    FADE IN:

1   EXT. STREETS OF LONDON - NIGHT                                1

    Autumnal streets seen through the sooty glass of a STREET
    LAMP. Shadows within shadows. Fog in the air. Full
    moon.

                             WATSON (V.O.)
               The year was 1891. London was the
               capital of the world -- the height
               of modernity, with the hiss of
               steam and smell of coal in the
               air. It was also the great
               cesspool into which all the
               sinners and criminals of the
               empire drained.

    Gas hisses audibly, the street lamp ignites, and casts a
    POOL OF LIGHT onto the street, silhouetting a MAN making
    his way through the fog and dark shadows with a lantern.

                             WATSON (V.O.)
               I had come to London, ten years
               prior, to find a life after the
               Afghan war. I had hoped to start
               a medical practice and settle into
               a nice, steady existence. The
               life I found was anything but nice
               and steady.

    We can see that the MAN wears a cape. The distinctive
    silhouette of his deerstalker hat is unmistakable. A
    FURIOUS CLATTER OF HOOVES APPROACHES in the distance.
    The MAN tugs on a pipe and turns towards the growing
    stampede.

                             WATSON (V.O.)
               And that had everything to do with
               one man. My friend, my partner,
               my burden...

    The MAN exhales a plume of smoke calmly, giving us the
    impression that he knows something that we don't.

                             WATSON (V.O.)
               ... Sherlock Holmes.

    WHAM! The MAN in the deerstalker hat is KNOCKED FLAT by
    A RUNNING MAN who has vaulted over a wall, sending him,
    his pipe, and hat flying across the cobbles.




                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                     2.

    The RUNNING MAN leans down as if to assist, but instead
    just picks up the smoker's broken umbrella and studies
    it. The MAN in the deerstalker hat's eyes widen as he
    recognizes his famous assailant.

                            MAN
              Sherlock Holmes?!

    SHERLOCK HOLMES offers the handle of the umbrella to the
    MAN, hauls him to his feet and hands back his broken
    umbrella.

                            HOLMES
              My apologies. Send the bill to
              John Watson, 221B Baker Street.

    Sherlock Holmes sprints off down an alleyway.   The MAN
    takes a step into the road to watch him go --

    -- and is nearly flattened for good by the first of a
    number of POLICE CARRIAGES, hurtling by on a serious
    pursuit, Victorian-style.

    INT. CARRIAGE - CLOSEUP ON THE OFFICERS - NIGHT
    inside. Big, uniformed guys assemble their weaponry -- a
    19th century SWAT team. One man stands out as a leader,
    older than the rest, INSPECTOR LESTRADE.

    A man in plainclothes sits to one side of the officers:
    DR. JOHN WATSON, physically as tough as anyone else in
    the carriage, but with a more pensive air about him. A
    thinking man of action.

3   EXT. STREETS OF LONDON - NIGHT                                   3

    Almost tipping over, the carriage turns onto the
    Embankment and hurtles through the writhing fog along the
    river.

    As the carriage banks, we see Holmes cut across the
    carriage path again, taking a line the horses cannot
    follow.

                                                           CUT TO:


    ANOTHER ANGLE

    Holmes bursts out of an alley, sprints round a corner and
    runs across a courtyard to a side door.

    WE PULL BACK to see the FACADE OF ST. PAUL'S CATHEDRAL.

                                                    3.

5   INT. CATHEDRAL CRYPTS - ENTRANCE - NIGHT                     5

    Holmes enters through the door and stands at the top of a
    stairwell. He takes a moment to recover; he's fit, but
    not as fit as he used to be.

    Holmes descends the stairwell to a door and a spiral
    staircase beyond it. He stops at the doorway and peers
    round the corner.

    A lantern glow ascends the spiral stairway towards
    Holmes. Holmes withdraws into the shadows behind the
    door. A BOWLER-HATTED MAN ascends the stairs, carrying
    the lantern and a gun.

    He peers behind the door and holds the lantern up to the
    shadows, but does not see Holmes, who has pulled his
    black jacket up to conceal his face. The man swings the
    lantern away again. He peers about, confused.

    We see Holmes' eyes from the shadows, as he lowers his
    jacket and thinks through his plan of attack.

                            HOLMES (V.O.)
              Head cocked to the left, partial
              deafness in right ear. First
              point of attack.


    PRE-VISUALIZATION IN VARI-SPEED

    FOCUS ON the spot behind the man's right ear, just at the
    top of the jaw -- the most vulnerable point. Holmes
    launches a hammer blow, and we ramp from 24 fps to 400
    fps (ULTRA SLOW MOTION) as he makes contact. The man's
    head is thrown back as he spins round.

                            HOLMES (V.O.)
              Then throat, paralyze vocal
              chords, stop screaming.

    BACK TO 24 fps. The man's mouth opens to cry out. We
    RAMP BACK UP TO 400 fps as his Adam's Apple is struck
    with a precision karate chop, strangling his scream.

                            HOLMES (V.O.)
              Stink of alcohol, heavy drinker --
              knuckles to liver.

    BACK TO 24 fps, RAMPING TO 400 fps as a devastating
    knuckle-punch to the liver doubles up the bowler-hatted
    thug and crumples him to his knees.
                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                     4.

    SECOND-TIME ACTION - SUPER FAST REPEAT OF ABOVE

    Holmes flashes out of the shadows, moving so fast that we
    can barely see what he's doing.

    THWACK! Hammer blow to ear.
    CRACK! Karate chop to throat.
    WHAP! Knuckle punch to liver.

    BACK TO NORMAL MOTION as the man crumples to the ground,
    Holmes takes his bowler hat from his head and flips it
    onto his own in one super fast move.

    Holmes drags the battered man into the shadows, lifts his
    lantern and proceeds down the spiral staircase.


    POV - BOTTOM OF THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE

    Another bowler-hatted THUG approaches the bottom of the
    staircase. He has seen the lantern light. He draws his
    gun and approaches. Holmes places the lantern on the
    post at the bottom of the bannister, ducks down into the
    shadows.

                            THUG
              What's goin' on, John?

    When he gets no answer, the THUG points his gun to where
    we saw Holmes hide.

    But Holmes appears from the shadows behind the THUG,
    reaches around him, grabs his gun hand and pistol-whips
    him twice with his own gun, dropping him.

    Holmes extracts a cigar from the Thug's top pocket and
    sniffs it appreciatively.

                            HOLMES
              Hhhmm, good cigar. Who do you
              work for?

    He jams the cigar in his own top pocket, picks up the
    man's bowler and proceeds on, further down into the
    crypts.

7   INT. CATHEDRAL CRYPTS - BALCONY - NIGHT                          7

    TWO HARD MEN in bowler hats stand guard.

                                                           CUT TO:
                                                  (CONTINUED)

    ANOTHER ANGLE

    Holmes surveys the scene AT A DISTANCE, out of sight.
    Eyes alive with intelligence, processing angles when --

    A HEAVY HAND falls on his shoulder.    PULL BACK to
    reveal --

    (The following exchange in whispers.)

                              HOLMES
              Watson.    Perfect timing.

                              WATSON
              Nice hat.

                              HOLMES
              Just got it.    Where's Lestrade?

                            WATSON
              Getting his troops in formation.
              Is that your blood or theirs?

                              HOLMES
              I don't know.    It's an old shirt.

                            WATSON
              You left this behind.

    Watson hands him his pistol.    Holmes looks at it with
    distaste, doesn't take it.

                            HOLMES
              Knew I'd forgotten something.
              Thought I'd left the stove on.

                              WATSON
              You did.

                              HOLMES
              Right.    Shall we?

    This is what they do.    This is what they like.

                                                              CUT TO:


    ANOTHER ANGLE

    The two HARD MEN on guard turn fast and gather together
    as they hear footsteps approaching.

                              MAN #1
              Des?

    He can see the hat, but not the man underneath.

                            WATSON
              Yeah, s'me.




                                                  (CONTINUED)

     Watson takes out the two men. He is more of a brawler,
     using headbutts, knees, and elbows. Less artful, but no
     less effective.

9    INT. CATHEDRAL CRYPTS - BALCONY - NIGHT                      9

     Thugs dispatched, Holmes and Watson look down and see a
     chilling sight.

     A WOMAN IN WHITE LIES INSIDE A CRUDELY-PAINTED PENTACLE
     (five-sided figure), lit with candles at each corner.
     Her eyes roll back in her head, trance-like. A sword has
     been placed at her feet.

     A HOODED FIGURE KNEELS INSIDE A DOUBLE CIRCLE next to the
     pentacle. This is LORD BLACKWOOD. We do not yet see his
     face.

     ANOTHER HOODED FIGURE stands on the edge of the ceremony,
     shrouded in shadow. We do not see his face.

     Suddenly, the woman rises up like a broken puppet, as if
     pulled to her feet by invisible hands.

     Some kind of ritual is about to climax.

     Holmes and Watson head down, fast, not caring if they
     make a noise or not. Their footsteps echo.

9A                                                                9A
     INT. CATHEDRAL CRYPTS
     The second hooded figure moves back and melts into the
     shadows.

     Still kneeling, still hooded, Blackwood chants softly,
     Latin incantation repeating and repeating.

     ON THE WOMAN as her lips start to move in time with the
     incantation. This is spooky, real, powerful stuff.

     Holmes and Watson leap from the stairs to Blackwood's
     level.

     Blackwood simply ignores them.   The Latin incantation
     never stops.

     Holmes is closer to the girl, Watson closer to Blackwood.

                             WATSON
               The girl.
                                                    (CONTINUED)

9A   CONTINUED:                                                     9A
     The girl bends with alarming and mechanical suddenness,
     picks up the sword and turns it on herself, ready to
     plunge the point into her heart.

     Holmes lunges, grabs the woman's arm, disarms her and
     pulls her out of the pentacle. She collapses.

     Simultaneously and eerily the candles extinguish and a
     rush of air departs the tunnel.

     Blackwood throws back his hood. We finally see his face.
     His eyes are intense, he is tapped into something dark
     and cruel.

     Holmes and Watson are shocked at his identity.

                             WATSON
               Lord Blackwood?!
     Blackwood applauds softly, strangely.

                             BLACKWOOD
               Well done, Holmes. And Watson as
               well.

     Watson raises his gun, trains it on Blackwood.

                             WATSON
               Stay right there.

     Blackwood raises his hands in front of him, almost
     mockingly.

                             BLACKWOOD
               Tell me, doctor, as a medical man,
               how did you like my work?
                    (beat)
               The fifth one was so scrawny, it
               was over before I'd finished the
               first incision.

     That's more than Watson can take.   He moves in to pistol-
     whip Blackwood --

     -- is stopped suddenly by Holmes' hand grabbing his
     collar.

                             HOLMES
               No.

     Watson struggles forward against Holmes' grip.

                             HOLMES
               Look.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                       8.

     Holmes seems to be pointing at Blackwood.   Watson looks,
     sees nothing.

                               HOLMES
               Look.

     Watson looks, and sees it and his eyes flare wide.

     INCHES FROM WATSON'S RIGHT EYE is the needle-pointed end
     of a QUIVERING PIECE OF HIGH-TENSILE WIRE, almost
     invisible --

     -- the other end held between Blackwood's hands.    A
     really nasty concealed weapon.

     One more step and Watson gets impaled in the eye.

                               BLACKWOOD
               What a shame.    That would've been
               fun.

     We hear heavy boots on the balcony, as Lestrade and his
     men finally appear.

     POLICEMEN flood the area.

                             HOLMES
               Impeccable timing, Lestrade.

                             LESTRADE
                    (vis Blackwood)
               Is that -- ?

                               WATSON
               It is.

                             HOLMES
                    (re: girl)
               We've gone for the doctor...
                    (re: Blackwood)
               And one for the rope.

                             LESTRADE
               You should've waited for my help.

                             HOLMES
               If I had, you'd be cleaning up a
               corpse and chasing a rumor.
               Besides, the girl's parents hired
               me, not the Yard.
                    (a wry smile)
               I can't imagine why they thought
               you'd need any assistance.

      Lestrade turns, frustrated. He watches his men yank
      Blackwood out of his double circle, put chains on him,
      while others carry the girl away on a stretcher. She's
      still mouthing the incantation.

      Lestrade eyes the double circle, the pentacle, shakes his
      head, not understanding them.

      Grudgingly, reluctantly, hating himself for needing to,
      he turns to Holmes.

                               LESTRADE
                 What do you make of that?

                 Bravo, Lestrade. Have a cigar.

      Holmes sticks the villain's cigar in Lestrade's pocket
      and --

      -- A POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER lifts his massive camera.

      FROM A RAVEN'S POV

      We FOLLOW a lady, MRS. HUDSON, walking down the street
      with the day's shopping. She picks up a paper with the
      day's headline "BLACKWOOD HANGS TOMORROW: CLAIMS PACK
      WITH THE DEVIL." She continues down the street until
      arriving at 221 Baker Street. A raven lands on the entry
      gate, she shoos it away, walks up the steps, and inside.


12    INT. 221 BAKER ST. - WATSON'S APARTMENT                        12

      Watson takes a blood pressure cuff off CAPTAIN PHILIPS,
      an OLDER GENTLEMAN who sports an array of medals. The
      room is a tribute to military and medical order -- all is
      neat and tidy, everything in its place.

                              WATSON
                71 over 104... very good, Captain.

                              CAPTAIN PHILIPS
                Me nerves are the best they been
                in years, thanks to you.

               Tell me something -- your new
               offices. There won't be so many

     Watson suppresses extreme irritation, writes a
     prescription on a piece of paper, then helps Captain
     Philips to his feet.

                             WATSON
               Let's give it a little longer,
               just to be safe.

     is turned to his patient.


13   INT. 221 BAKER ST. - HALL                                    13

     As Watson exits his apartment and moves down the hall,
     MRS. HUDSON, his landlady, shoots up the stairs with the
     paper. Her nerves are almost as bad as Captain Philips'.

                             MRS. HUDSON
                    (panting)
               I won't go in there by myself, not
               while he's in this state.

                             WATSON
               You're not going in at all.

     Which is a relief to Mrs. Hudson.

                             MRS. HUDSON
               What will I do when you leave?
               He'll burn the house down around
               me. What will he do? Couldn't
               you have a longer engagement?

                             WATSON
               He just needs a new case, that's
               all.

     Captain Philips emerges from Watson's apartment, heads
     towards them.

                             WATSON
               I smell burning.

     Mrs. Hudson's already-frayed nerves take a turn for the
     worse. Watson takes the newspaper from her.

                             WATSON
               Why don't you take Captain Philips
               and give him a nice cup of tea.

                             MRS. HUDSON
               Come on, Captain, let's go down.
               It'll be quieter.

                             WATSON
                    (as they leave)
               And perhaps some tea and bread up
               here when you can.

     Watson heads down the hallway to the last door. A
     tendril of smoke wafts out from under it. Urgent.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

     Nonetheless, Watson   stops, takes a deep breath, gathers
     himself. Something    like this has happened before (is, in
     fact, Holmes' usual   brand of chaos) the difference being,
     now, that Watson is   sick to death of dealing with it.

     Which doesn't mean he won't.

     Newspaper in hand, Watson opens the door, pokes his head
     in, cautiously. He sees --


14   INT. 221 BAKER ST. - HOLMES' APARTMENTS                       14

     Watson squeezes through the doorway to find that the                
     obstruction is Holmes who is sitting in the dark on a               
     chair, blocking the door, aiming a gun (with an odd                 
     contraption fastened on its barrel) at the wall.                    

     Unadulterated chaos. A series of FLAMING BULLET HOLES               
     blasted into the wall in the (ragged) initials "V.R."

                             WATSON                                      
               May I join you in the armory?                             

                             HOLMES                                      
               Please... Watson, I've been                               
               working on a device which will                            
               suppress the sound of a gunshot.                          

     Watson heads towards the conservatory.                              

                             HOLMES                                      
               Please... Don't, don't, don't...                          

     Watson pulls open the curtains allowing the light to pour           
     in.

               It needs work.     May I see?...                          

     Watson passes him heading to the other side of the room             
     (possibly grabs the gun) picking up a pile of open                  
     letters from a table.

               Gently, gently, Watson...                                 

     Watson whips open more curtains and opens a window.                 

     Holmes crawls on his hands and knees over to a table                
     where he finds his sunglasses and puts them on.                     

     Watson sits on a chair and begins to leaf though the                
     letters.

               I have been studying her comings                         
               and goings and they appear most                          
               sinister.

               Tea, Mr. Holmes.                                         

     Mrs. Hudson crosses to Holmes and puts the tray before             
     him.

               Is it poisoned, nanny?                                   

                             MRS. HUDSON                                
               There's enough of that in you                            
               already.                                                 

     She goes to remove an old tray from behind him.                    

                             HOLMES                                     
               Don't touch that. Everything is                          
               in its proper place, as per usual.                       

     She ignores him and removes the tray then crosses back             
     towards the door noticing a bulldog lying unconscious              
     under the table.

               He's killed the dog... again.                            

     Watson jumps up. His bulldog, GLADSTONE, lies on the               
     floor in a drugged stupor.

               this time?

               I was simply testing a new                               
               anesthetic. He doesn't mind.                             

                              WATSON

     Watson exits, leaving Holmes alone in his own chaos.
     For the first time, we see a hint of fear in his eyes.

                                                       CUT TO:

15   INT. THE ROYALE - DINING ROOM                               15

     Holmes sits in the center of a booth waiting for Watson
     to arrive. He is quite uncomfortable in this setting.

     WE SEE HIS OBSERVATIONS -- he picks up little pieces of
     information from the other guests. He notices the
     details on a pair of gentleman's cufflinks, the name on a
     bottle of wine, a surreptitious argument between waiters.
     It all becomes quite overbearing.

     And then Watson and Mary arrive, talking, intent on each
     other -- surprised when they realize Holmes is already
     there.

                              WATSON
               Holmes!   You're early.
                              HOLMES
               Fashionably.

                             WATSON
               May I present Miss Mary Morstan.

     Holmes looks at MARY MORSTAN -- looks again. She's
     beautiful, 30s, and clearly a woman worth marrying.
     Holmes stands. She extends her hand.

                             HOLMES
               My pleasure. For the life of me I
               don't know why it's taken him so
               long to get us properly
               introduced.

     Holmes gestures politely, they sit, Mary and Watson on
     either side of him. There is a decanted bottle of wine
     on the table.

                             MARY
               The pleasure's mine. It really is
               a thrill to meet you, Mr. Holmes.

               They can seem a bit far-fetched
               sometimes, though. Making these
               grand assumptions out of tiny
               details.

               I intend to.

     Watson likes that, Holmes less so -- a forced chuckle.

                             HOLMES
               ... see that walking-stick? A
               rare African snakewood hiding a
               blade of high-tensile steel. A
               few were awarded to veterans of
               the Afghan war, so I can assume
               he's a decorated soldier. Strong,
               brave, born to be a man of action.
               And neat, like all military men.
               Then I check his pockets... ah. A
               stub from a boxing match. Now I
               can infer he's a bit of a gambler.
                    (a wink)
               I'd keep an eye on that, by the
               way.

               Those days are behind me.

               He's cost us the rent more than
               once.

     Mary laughs.

                              MARY
               With all due respect, Mr. Holmes,
               you know him. But what about a
               perfect stranger? What can you
               tell about me?

     Holmes and Watson exchange a glance -- not a good idea.

                             WATSON
               I don't think that's necessary --

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                  Yes, I doubt --

                                MARY
                  No, it'd be wonderful.   I insist.

                                HOLMES
                  You insist?
                       (at Watson)
                  She insisted.
                       (instantly)
                  You're a governess.

                                MARY
                  Well done.

                                WATSON
                  Yes, well done. So shall we --

                                HOLMES
                  Your student's a boy of 8.

                                MARY
                  Charlie's 7, actually.

     Watson's getting nervous, reaches for the wine.     Holmes
     stops him.

                                HOLMES
                  It's breathing.
                       (back to Mary)
                  Then he's tall for his age.

     Mary nods.

               He flicked ink at you today.

                             MARY
               Is there ink on my face?

     The WAITER appears.

                             WATSON
               There's nothing wrong with your
               face.

                             WAITER
               The gentleman has already ordered
               for himself.
                    (to Watson)
               What would madam care for this
               evening?

     Watson gives Holmes a hard look:   that's a bit much.

                             WATSON
               Give us a few minutes, please.

     He shakes his head, pours wine for all.

                             HOLMES
               There are two drops on your ear...
               India blue's nearly impossible to
               wash off, anyway. A very
               impetuous act by the boy, but
               you're too experienced to react
               rashly -- which is why the lady
               you work for lent you that
               necklace. It's from Asprey's,
               flawless, not the gems of a
               governess.
                    (beat)
               However, the jewels you're not
               wearing tell us rather more.

               Holmes.

     Both Watson and Mary scorch Holmes with their eyes.
     Holmes pauses... pauses, then:

                             HOLMES
               You were engaged.

     Holmes' mind has gotten away from him.   He begins talking
     faster, intensely focused, manic.

                             HOLMES
               The ring is gone. But the lighter
               skin where it sat suggests you
               spent some time abroad wearing it
               proudly.

     As Holmes talks, Watson gets up, moves to help Mary to
     her feet. They're leaving.

                             HOLMES
               Or at least until someone informed
               you of its true and rather modest
               worth, at which point you broke
               off the engagement and returned to
               England for better prospects. A
               doctor perhaps.

     Mary throws Watson's wine in Holmes' face. The
     restaurant goes silent. She turns to leave, turns back.

                             MARY
                    (low)
               Right on all counts but one. I
               didn't leave my fiance... he died.

     Now she leaves --

                 Well done, old man.

       -- and Watson goes with her.

       Holmes lets the wine drip down over him.

                                 HOLMES
                 She's lovely.

       Holmes is left at an empty table with wine running down
       his face.

       Their orders arrive -- an array of plates piled high.
       The waiter puts them down, Holmes very carefully unfolds
       his napkin and places it into the top of his shirt,
       spaghetti style, takes his knife and fork and begins to
       cut the meat -- then pauses, looks around.


       HOLMES' POV

       Happy couples eating, laughing, talking. Suddenly,
       Holmes hears no words. He just sees their mouths moving.
       The sound of silverware clinking and scraping on fine
       china rises to an ORCHESTRAL ROAR --

       -- which becomes the ROAR of a BLOOD-THIRSTY MOB as a
       fist smashes into a face with a MEATY THUD.

       NIGHT

       Holmes staggers back from the blow. He tastes his own
       blood from a split lip. It interests him.
       He is stripped to the waist, all sinew and gristle. His
       opponent, McMURDO -- huge but flabby -- bangs his fists
       together and moves in.

       Bets rage back and forth through the pressing CROWD.


       HOLMES' POV

       The room and the fight are calm -- the sounds muffled and
       indistinct -- a complete sensory reversal of his
       experience in the restaurant. This is soothing to him,
       the ring is the only place where his mind stops racing.




                                                      (CONTINUED)

       He's able to feel, not just think.    He is utterly in the
       moment.

       Holmes' hawk-sharp gaze darts down from McMurdo's face to
       his muscles as they flex, giving him just enough warning
       to move his head so that a punch grazes him.


       BACK TO SCENE

       McMurdo throws a storm of punches, most of which Holmes
       ducks or blocks. He throws nothing in return, sometimes
       even drops his hands, just using his reflexes to protect
       himself.

       Once or twice, he reaches out and gently touches
       McMurdo's face or throat, when the big man leaves an
       obvious opening. But that's all. Holmes is completely
       in control --

       -- until he notices a face at ringside.


       CLOSEUP ON A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN

       Early thirties, a look of pure intrigue in her eyes and a
       slight smile on her lips as she watches the detective.

       Holmes' POV returns to normal when he sees her, the sound
       floods back into the room.

       McMurdo senses his opponent's lapse in concentration and
       steps on Holmes' foot, tramping him and --

       He knocks Holmes down with a thunderous right.

       Holmes rolls over, stands, shakes his head to clear the
       cobwebs. He looks for the woman. She's gone. He turns
       back to McMurdo, smiles.

                                HOLMES
                 Well done.   Thank you.

       Holmes begins walking away.

                                McMURDO
                 Oi!   We ain't done here.

                               HOLMES
                      (walking away)
                 Not done. Finished. And as I
                 said, thank you, it was most
                 pleasurable.

       Face twisted in disgust, McMurdo strides forward and
       SPITS CONTEMPTUOUSLY at Holmes, catching him on the back
       of the head. The crowd falls silent.

       Holmes stops.     Feels the back of his head, smells his
       hand.

                                  HOLMES
                   Hm.   Plymouth gin.

       He turns.   Steps back into the ring.

       The crowd applauds, working into a fever pitch, but from
       Holmes' POV, all is calm. His eyes tick slowly, scanning
       McMurdo, locking onto the big man's knee:

       A little scar-tissue, nearly invisible.    As McMurdo
       braces for combat --

       Instantly Holmes unleashes a series of superfast moves,
       incorporating exotic martial arts. The blinding
       combination culminates with a spinning kick to the big
       man's knee, which buckles altogether wrong.

       McMurdo falls, over and out. Holmes is already turning
       away before the giant hits the canvas.

       He sees the crowd fall silent, they're not sure if they
       like it, there really isn't any sport. He doesn't care.

       Passing fellow fighters and flirty barmaids, Holmes
       strides out of the bar, battered on the outside, soothed
       inside. He grabs a bottle in his hand. Taking a huge
       swig, he climbs the stairs towards the upstairs rooms.

18A                                                                   18A

       cells. The sound of prisoners SCREAMING in the dark. A
       full-scale riot is on.

       Five GUARDS charge down the corridor, banging on the
       doors to quiet the prisoners.

       The GUARD CAPTAIN approaches a young guard, CHARLIE, who
       is frozen on the spot.

                And now he's in some kind of fit.

      The Guard Captain continues around the corner. We see
      another guard, JACK, lies convulsing on the floor.

                Charlie, get, down here and get

      Blackwood sits dead center in the dark.   Eyes closed,
      WHISPERING ungodly sounds.

      On the walls the scrawls of a madman: wild symbols,
      sketches of animals, a headless sphinx, an upside-down
      cross. A hint of some method to his madness.

                              GUARD CAPTAIN
                All right, Blackwood, what's this
                all about?

                stop this devil nonsense. That's
                a holy book --

      Blackwood closes his eyes again, resumes his soft murmur.

                     (louder)
                -- and you will respect it!

      Blackwood starts whispering FASTER.   LOUDER.

                              GUARD CAPTAIN
                Boy, you want me to muzzle you --

      Suddenly, the Captain starts COUGHING. He's confused.
      He coughs harder. Prisoners watch him stumble backwards.

     Blackwood keeps whispering.     The Captain falls to one
     knee, keeps coughing.

     Finally the Captain COUGHS SOMETHING UP, spits it out
     onto the stone floor. He looks down, horrified:

     It's a small CATHOLIC CROSS on a chain.

     Prisoners start SHOUTING.   The RAVEN at Blackwood's
     windowsill flutters away.   Other guards run up,
     terrified.

     Guards pull the Captain away. The remaining guard picks
     up the cross, stares at Blackwood, chilled. Blackwood's
     eyes snap open.

     The fighting is over and the pub is closing. Only a few
     people remain cleaning up, mopping the beer and blood.
     Watson enters fast, looks around, and moves upstairs.

     INT. PUNCH BOWL PUB - ATTIC
     Watson walks down a dingy hallway towards a door. With a
     look of resignation, he opens the door to see Holmes
     sitting alone in the sterile, barely furnished room.

     Holmes faces the corner, playing scales on his VIOLIN.
     On the table next to him, an upside down BEER STEIN and
     an assortment of prescription medicine bottles.

     Watson approaches, sees Holmes has bloodshot eyes from
     lack of sleep.

     Watson picks one of the medicine bottles which is open.
                             WATSON
               You know this is for eye surgery?

                             HOLMES
               I find that it lifts my spirits.

                             WATSON
               It's a pathological amorbic
               process, it increases tissue
               change and weakness. And you know
               what a black reaction comes on you
               afterwards.

     No answer. More scales. Watson approaches, sees Holmes
     has bloodshot eyes from lack of sleep. The beer stein is
     full of FLIES all buzzing about.

               Look at this. If you play a
               chromatic scale, they move
               clockwise. As soon as you switch
               to a pentatonic scale --

     Holmes plays a different scale, the flies all stop
     moving, stick to the glass.

                             WATSON
                    (faking interest)
               Really? What about when you --
               oops --

     Watson picks up the glass, lets loose the flies. Holmes
     looks up; Watson's already moving for the door, pissed.

                 That's your job, not mine.

                 You're Blackwood's last request.
                 Says he has information he'll give
                 only to you.

     But Watson's already out the door.


23   EXT. LONDON - DAWN                                             23

     Watson and Holmes ride in a cab, passing familiar
     landmarks as the city comes to life. They sit in
     silence, tension hanging between them. Finally Holmes
     grabs Watson's bag, rummages around and pulls out a clean
     white shirt.

     Watson looks out the window, frustrated. He sees THE
     HALF-CONSTRUCTED MASS OF TOWER BRIDGE. Near ground
     level, workers take down a large BLACKWOOD STEEL sign.

                               HOLMES
                 Look at that structure. What has
                 it been? Five years' work
                 already? Are you aware that is
                 the first combination of bascule
                 and suspension bridge. Very
                 innovative.

     No reply.

     As Holmes is taking off his jacket, he reaches into his
     pocket and pulls out a wad of money.

                Oh, I have your cut from last
                night, by the way. You weren't
                there so I laid your customary
                bet --

     Silence.   Holmes takes off his shirt.

                              HOLMES
                You're right... I'll keep it with
                your check book, locked safely
                away in my drawer.

     Silence.   Holmes pulls on the clean shirt.

                              HOLMES
                The opera house is featuring Don
                Giovanni and I could easily
                procure two tickets if you had
                some cultural inclination this
                evening.

     Silence.

                              HOLMES
                You have the grand gift of
                silence, Watson. It makes you
                quite invaluable as a companion.

     Watson punches him square in the face.

                              WATSON
                And your grand gift is the uncanny
                ability to demoralize people. I
                was aware she'd been engaged. She
                told me.
     Holmes rubs his jaw.

                              HOLMES
                So that's a `no' to the opera
                then?

     Watson's steaming.   Holmes puts on his vest.

                              WATSON
                That's my waistcoat.

                              HOLMES
                It's too small for you.

                              WATSON
                Well, it's my property and I want
                it back.

     Holmes hands him the waistcoat which he promptly tosses
     out of the carriage window. Holmes frowns, looks out the
     opposite window.

                                                    26A.



24   EXT. PENTONVILLE PRISON - EARLY MORNING                     24

     Already a CROWD is gathering outside the jail, papers are
     for sale, Blackwood's death is the headline. Religious
     zealots and occultists swarm. Police keep them away from
     the entrance. Holmes heads inside, Watson stops.

                             WATSON
               You go ahead. I've no business
               with him while he's alive.

26   INT. PENTONVILLE PRISON - CORRIDOR - DAWN                    26

     A pale, nervous GUARD leads Holmes down the shadowy
     corridor. All the cells are now EMPTY.

                             HOLMES
               Where are all the other prisoners?

                             GUARD
               We had to move `em, sir, otherwise
               we were going to have a riot on
               our hands. There's something
               about him... it's like he can get
               inside your head.

     Holmes can see how spooked the Guard is.

                             HOLMES
               I'm sure I can find my own way
               from here, if you have other
               duties to attend to.

                             GUARD
               Much obliged, sir. Thank you,
               thank you.

     The Guard high-tails it out of there.

     INT. PENTONVILLE PRISON - BLACKWOOD'S CELL - DAY
     Holmes approaches Blackwood's cell, strolling
     insouciantly. No way this creep's getting to him. In
     the shadows he can barely make out Blackwood, who's
     reading aloud to himself. Holmes listens, getting
     closer.
                             BLACKWOOD
               QUOTE from Revelations tbd...

     Blackwood pauses, turns, sees Holmes.

     They share a smile -- two heavyweights sizing each other
     up.

                             HOLMES
               Love what you've done with the
               place.

                             BLACKWOOD
               Thank you for joining me.

               A small point of concern.

                             BLACKWOOD
               How can I help?

                             HOLMES
               I'd already followed the murders
               with some interest and while my
               heart went out to the families of
               the victims, I couldn't but notice
               a criminal mastery in the stroke
               of your brush --

                             BLACKWOOD
               You're too kind.

                             HOLMES
               However, by comparison, your work
               in the crypt was akin to a finger
               painting.

     Suddenly, Blackwood is right at the bars, close to
     Holmes.

                             BLACKWOOD
               So now you're curious as to
               whether there's a larger game
               afoot, and that's why you're
               really here.

                             HOLMES
               Actually, my friend will pronounce
               you dead shortly and I thought I
               might keep him company.

                             BLACKWOOD
               Allow me to enlighten you. Your
               mistake is to imagine that
               anything earthly has led to this
               moment. Your error in judgement
               is to assume I've been holding the
               brush at all -- I am merely the
               channel.

     Despite the bars between them, the men are close
     together. Holmes seems to be studying Blackwood's ear.

               My only wish is that I'd caught
               you earlier. I might have spared
               five lives.

                             BLACKWOOD
               Those lives were a necessity, a
               sacrifice. Five otherwise
               meaningless creatures called to
               serve a greater purpose.

                             HOLMES
               I wonder if they'd let Watson and
               I dissect your brain -- after
               you're hanged, of course. I'd
               wager there's some deformity that
               would be scientifically
               significant. Then you would serve
               a greater purpose, too.

                              BLACKWOOD
               Mr. Holmes, you must widen your
               gaze. I'm concerned you
               underestimate the gravity of
               coming events.
                    (beat)
               For you and I are bound on a
               journey that will twist the very
               fabric of nature.
                    (beat)
               I sense fragility beneath your
               mask of logic, and it worries me.
               Steel your mind, Holmes, I need
               you.

     Holmes steps back, shakes his head.

                             HOLMES
               I must say, you've come a long way
               down from the House of Lords.

                             BLACKWOOD
               But I will rise again.

                             HOLMES
               Bon voyage, Blackwood.

     As Holmes walks away, Blackwood calls after him.

                             BLACKWOOD
               Pay attention! Three more shall
               die, and there is nothing you can
               do to save them.

                              IRENE (O.S.)                                
                London's so bleak this time of                            
                year.

     REVEAL: Irene Adler sits on the stairs near Holmes' lab,           
     cracking walnuts. She stands and Holmes watches her                
     every move as she crosses to him. She leans down,                  
     putting the walnuts in front of him and flashes him a              
     smile.                                                             

                             IRENE                                      
               Not that I'm pining for New                              
               Jersey.                                                  

     Irene gets up to cross the room. Only once her back is             
     turned does Holmes lever himself upright, stunned by this          
     intrusion. As soon as she clears he quickly moves over             
     to a concealed safe. He tests the door to make sure it's           
     still locked.                                                      

                             IRENE                                      
               I prefer to travel in the winter.                        

     As she passes a small table that has been outfitted with           
     tea, dried fruit, olives, etc...                                   

                             IRENE                                      
               I brought a few souvenirs. Dates                         
               from Jordan, tea from Ceylon and                         
               olives from Cyclades. I thought                          
               we'd have a little tea party to                          
               cheer us up.                                             

     Irene grabs a file from Holmes' desk.                              

                             IRENE                                      
               I came across this as I was                              
               setting up.                                              

     Irene opens the file, flips through newspaper clippings            
     and police reports, her back to Holmes.                            

                             IRENE

     Holmes stealthily turns down a photo of Irene, just                
     before she turns back to face him.

               But your signature is clear.                             

     Holmes reaches for Irene and pulls on a chain around her           
     neck, revealing and enormous diamond.

     TRACK INTO Irene's hypnotically beautiful eyes. Holmes             
     almost melts. Then, Irene reaches for something inside             
     her jacket and Holmes grabs her hand.                              

                             IRENE

     Irene pulls out an ENVELOPE.

               Keep your money. I didn't say I'd

     She ignores him. Holmes examines the envelope. On it is          
     stamped the letterhead of the Grand Hotel. She pauses

     Irene descends the stairs just as Watson is coming in.
     He lifts his hat, waits for her to pass --

               Hello, John.

     We PICK UP Irene crossing a street. She passes a DARK
     ALLEYWAY. Pauses. Looks. She turns into the alley.
     HOLD ON the alley for a long beat. Too dark to see much
     in there.

     emerges from the alley holding a lovely bunch of roses.
     She sniffs them appreciatively, walks on.

     INT. CARRIAGE
     Irene sits, turns to address a man-shaped shadow filling
     the opposite corner of the carriage. Before she can
     speak, a gesture from the shadow stills her. This is
     PROFESSOR MORIARTY.

     Irene is made to wait as Moriarty finishes writing a
     complex mathematical equation (in astronomy), folds the
     paper to reveal that it is addressed to THE ROYAL
     ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY, cracks open the carriage window and
     slides the folded paper partway out.

     Someone waiting outside takes the paper, and their
     footsteps clatter away.

     Moriarty closes the window, and the carriage starts
     moving. A full beat goes by before he turns to Irene,
     finally prepared to engage with her.

                             MORIARTY
               I assume he'll do it?

                             IRENE
               Not for money, but for me.   I
               wager he'll find our man within
               twenty-four hours.

                             MORIARTY
               You wager?

               A better word.     I sincerely hope
               it's accurate.

                                IRENE
               I --

     Suddenly, the coach comes to a halt, they lurch forward.


34   EXT. LONDON STREET                                            34

     A rough-looking BEGGAR wearing an eye patch has fallen
     under a wheel of the coach.

                             COACH DRIVER
               You fell right into the carriage!

     The Beggar is up, limping toward the window where
     Moriarty and Irene sit. He has disgusting blackened
     teeth.

                             BEGGAR

               way, yes it would, sir.

     He reaches toward the window. Within a nanosecond,
     Moriarty extends his hand into which a PISTOL appears,
     delivered by a concealed mechanism (Travis Bickle style).

     The gun rests on the Beggar's forehead. The cold eyes of
     the man that holds the weapon bore into the skull of the
     Beggar, who backs off in fear. The carriage moves on.


35   INT. 221 BAKER ST. - HOLMES' APARTMENT                         35

     Holmes is washing his face in a basin on the other side
     of the room, completely transformed now, utterly alive.
     Watson approaches, very concerned, almost enraged.

                             WATSON
               Look at you, I can't believe you                           
               ran after her like a schoolboy                             
               again. Leaping about, all                                  
               aflutter. Are you a masochist?                             

                             HOLMES
               Allow me to explain.                                       

                             WATSON
               Don't you remember what she did to                         
               you? She turned you inside out,                            
               she made a proper idiot of you.                            
               I'm sorry, you were going to                               
               explain something...

               No, I don't agree. It's more than

       Holmes plucks his violin, the notes play over a FLASHBACK
       of the previous scene, all from HOLMES' POINT OF VIEW.

36     FLASHBACK - INT. 221 BAKER ST. - HOLMES' APARTMENT           36

       We see Irene step out.

                                IRENE
                  Why don't I see myself out.

       Once Irene leaves, he steps quickly to a window, and
       looks out to see her walking down Baker Street, turning
       down an alley. He bolts    into --


36A    INT. 221 BAKER ST. - CORRIDOR                               36A

       He sees Watson coming up the stairs. Before Watson can
       speak, Holmes snatches his coat and runs down the other
       end of the corridor. He JUMPS out the window to --


37     EXT. 221 BAKER ST. - REAR YARD                               37

       Holmes flies from the window and lands neatly on a tin
       roof. The jump to the next level is a more taxing
       prospect. Holmes weighs the distance and hurls himself
       down with a determined look. He lands just right.


37A-37D OMITTED                                               37A-37D

38    EXT. COAL SHED                                                 38

      Holmes jumps off the shed, heads for the street one block
      over from Baker Street.


38A   EXT. LONDON STREET                                            38A

      He runs down the mews in great haste, stops at the same
      alley that Irene disappeared into -- but at the other
      side.

                                                          CUT TO:


      HOLMES' POV DOWN ALLEY

      from concealment:    Irene walks towards a MAN HOLDING A
      BUNCH OF ROSES.

                                 MAN WITH ROSES
                   Got some roses for you,
                   sweetheart. Cut you a deal `cos
                   you're so pretty.

                                 IRENE
                   Oh, how nice of you.

      Even without the man -- who is scrofulous and sly -- no
      woman in her right mind would go down this alley.

38B                                                                 38B
      INT. ALLEY
      The man with the roses beckons Irene forward. Another
      man steps in behind her, trapping her. He closes in to
      grab her --

      -- and WHAP!WHAP!WHAP! Gets three cosh-strikes across
      the chin, dropping him immediately.

      Still holding the roses, the man finds himself smacked up
      against the bricks with Irene's hand over his mouth.

      Quick as a snake, she slices upwards with a razor-sharp
      knife, cutting his belt, then his clothes, all the way to
      his collar. The move ends with Irene's finger over her
      own mouth, signalling the mugger to be quiet. He obeys,
      eyes bulging.

      Irene frisks him expertly. She's mugging the mugger.
      There is excitement in her eyes; this turns her on.



                                                      (CONTINUED)

38B   CONTINUED:                                                  38B
                              IRENE
                Oh, look, a wallet. Doesn't look
                like yours, does it? And --
                naughty boy -- here's another
                one. I'll return them, shall I?

      She takes both wallets, takes the roses --

                              IRENE
                These are lovely, thank you.

      -- and leaves, stepping daintily over the crumpled man on
      the floor.

      On second thoughts, she turns back, takes his wallet too,
      then leaves.

                                                           CUT TO:


      ANGLE ON HOLMES

                              HOLMES
                Now, that's the Irene I know.

      He hurries after Irene down the alley.

38C                                                                  38C
      EXT. LONDON STREET
      Holmes exits the alley, catches a glimpse of Irene
      through a STREET FAIR, which is being assembled.

      Holmes picks up the pace.

      He snatches a HAT from a one-eyed old BEGGAR with his
      hand out. He drops a coin in his hand, then another coin
      and snatches the beggar's eye patch too.

      He runs past a coal cart, snags a lump of coal, rubs it
      on his face and hands, then pops it in his mouth, chews
      it to blacken his teeth.

      He pauses to singe the sleeve of Watson's coat on a
      fairground fire-breather's flames, runs on.


39    EXT. LONDON STREET                                              39

      Holmes emerges as the beggar we saw previously. Again he
      stops the coach and again the gun comes out, but this
      time we can see that Holmes gets a view of the man on the
      other end of the weapon before the carriage pulls away.

                                                      37B.


40   INT. 221 BAKER ST. - HOLMES' APARTMENTS (PRESENT)             40

     Holmes strums one more chord on his violin, thinking.

     Irene's bag of money still sits on the table.                       

                             HOLMES
               This man intrigues me, Watson.                            
               He's got Adler on edge.                                   

                             WATSON
               Which is no mean feat.                                    

                             HOLMES                                      
               She's intimidated, scared...                              

                             WATSON                                      
               And yet she works for him. That's                         
               bad money. It's nothing to do                             
               with me, but leave this case.                             

     Holmes motions to the bills.

                             HOLMES
               Well, I may not have a choice. A                          
               man has to make a living. After                           
               all, I'll be paying the rent                              
               entirely on my own.                                       

                             WATSON                                      
               You know what, I've had just about                        
               enough --

                             VOICE (O.S.)
               Mister Holmes, sir...?

     He turns to see... CONSTABLE CLARK standing at the door.
     Breathless, pale, scared.

                             CONSTABLE CLARK
               Inspector Lestrade asks that you
               come with me, at once.

               What's he done now, lost his way
               to Scotland Yard? Watson, grab a
               compass. You means us.

               It's Lord Blackwood, sir. It                     
               appears he's come back from the                  
               dead.

                             WATSON                             
               Well that's clever seeing as how I               
               pronounced him dead myself.

               A groundsman saw him walking                     
               through the graves, just this
               morning.

                             WATSON
               I'll leave this one in your                      
               capable hands. I have tea with                   
               Mary and her parents this evening.               

     Watson walks into his office.                              

                             HOLMES
               It is not my reputation at stake                 
               here.                                            

                             WATSON                             
               Are you taking this seriously?                   

                             HOLMES                             
               Like it or not, it's a matter of                 
               professional integrity. No girl                  
               wants to marry a doctor who can't                
               tell if a man's dead or not.                     

     They all move to the exit.                                 

                             HOLMES                             
               Watson, you'd do well to hide your               
               medical certificates in case                     
               they're revoked.                                 

     Clarky laughs.

41   EXT. THE BLACKWOOD ESTATE - ESTABLISHING - DAY                 41

     Judging by the estate, Blackwood comes from old money,
     and lots of it. We FOLLOW the carriage hurrying Holmes
     and Watson forward.


42   EXT. THE BLACKWOOD BURIAL PLOT - DAY                           42

     Generations of wealth buried in moss-covered marble
     memorials. Not a place for a picnic, not even on a
     bright sunny day -- and it's starting to rain.

     A COP stops the carriage, opens the door. Holmes and
     Watson exit, Watson carries a black leather FORENSICS
     KIT.

     They walk up the pathway towards the Blackwood Family
     Crypt. Watson barely lifts his head, scanning the ground
     while Holmes appears to have taken an interest in a clump
     of trees in the distance.

                             WATSON
               Look at this mess. Nothing but
               standard-issue police bootprints.
               Any possible evidence there might
               have been has been trampled.

               Scotland Yard at their finest,
               once again.

     Police lamps light one large marble CRYPT. The cops are
     in tight clusters, whispering to themselves, spooked.
     They'd rather be anywhere but here.

     As Holmes and Watson approach, they see the marble doors
     of the crypt have been BLASTED OPEN FROM THE INSIDE.
     Holmes and Watson share a quick glance -- this is
     interesting.

     Lestrade emerges from the crypt.   He is sweating, shaken.




                                                    (CONTINUED)

     Holmes offers Lestrade his handkerchief, Lestrade waves
     it off.

                             LESTRADE
               Look at those slabs of marble --
               they're half a ton each if they're
               a pound -- smashed outward like
               they were nothing.

     On second thought, Lestrade does take Holmes'
     handkerchief.

                             LESTRADE
               Explain it if you can, Holmes.

     Holmes inspects the door, checking the hinges. He
     notices the Blackwood CREST, and the image of a SPHINX.

                             HOLMES
               And the coffin?

                             LESTRADE
               We're digging it up now. The
               witness is over there. You can
               question him if you like -- but
               you won't get much.

     The old GROUNDSKEEPER, pale and terrified, stands out of
     the rain under an ancient cypress tree.

     Watson heads for him.   Holmes disappears in the opposite
     direction.

     As soon as their backs are turned, Lestrade marches over
     to a nervous knot of cops, grabs a fistful of blue in
     each hand, drags his boys in close. He doesn't want
     Holmes or Watson to hear this.

                             LESTRADE
                    (low, angry)
               If you lot don't stop behaving
               like a bunch of superstitious milk
               maids, you're on double-time!
               You're an embarrassment! Also,
               you're forbidden to talk about
               this to anyone, not a word. Are
               we bloody clear on that?

     The cops nod, duly chastened.

                                                         CUT TO:

     THE GROUNDSKEEPER

     mumbles the Lord's Prayer under his breath. Watson
     immediately goes into doctor mode checking his pulse,
     looking in his eyes.

     The Groundskeeper just keeps praying. Watson takes a
     boiled sweet from his pocket, pops it in the man's mouth
     and gently sits him down.

     Holmes walks over holding a small branch from a tree.

                                WATSON
               He's in shock.     We should give him
               a few moments.

     Lestrade stomps up.

                              LESTRADE
               The witness stated that he saw
               Lord Blackwood rise from the
               grave.
                     (at Watson,
                      accusingly)
               Well? You pronounced the man
               dead.

                             WATSON
                    (stung)
               He had no pulse.
                             HOLMES
               Inspector, do you know if this is
               a spruce or a sycamore?

     Lestrade shakes his head.    It hasn't been a good day for
     him, or the Yard.

     There's a clunk. They all turn to see the coffin has
     been extracted from the crypt.

     Four beefy, soil-stained cops emerge lugging the coffin.
     They place it on the ground, step back, crossing
     themselves, murmuring, plainly terrified. Holmes
     chuckles.

                                LESTRADE
               OPEN IT!!

     But no one moves. The cops pass a CROWBAR around as if
     it were red-hot. Watson's had enough. He marches
     forward --

     -- snatches the crowbar away, jams it under the lid and
     levers it off with a slow, eerie groan.

     Holmes and Lestrade move forward, the cops move backward.

     The coffin is filled with EARTH, overflowing. They brush
     away a layer of dirt, to reveal... A DEAD BODY in the
     coffin. The body is a much smaller man than Blackwood,
     in everyday clothes, with red hair.

                             LESTRADE
               That's not Blackwood.

                              HOLMES
               Now that we have a firm grasp of
               the obvious...

     Watson opens his forensic kit, disturbed. Vials, silver
     tools. He takes a CALIPER, begins examining the body.

                             WATSON
               Lividity is late stage. Diptera
               deposits are approximately --
                    (measuring)
               -- three quarters of an inch,
               putting the time of death at ten
               to twelve hours ago.

                             HOLMES
               Inspector, may I see your pen?

     Lestrade hands over a nice fountain pen, still stunned.
     Holmes takes the pen and pries open the corpse's mouth,
     revealing: two missing teeth in the man's jaw.

                             WATSON
               Missing two incisors in the upper
               jaw...
                    (a look at Holmes)
               Adler's midget.

     Holmes spots something glinting in the man's dirt-filled
     pocket. He uses the pen to fish out: a POCKET WATCH.

                             HOLMES
               All yours, Inspector.

     Holmes hands the pen back to Lestrade. Lestrade looks at
     it with dismay, takes it in Holmes' handkerchief -- a
     small measure of revenge.

       Holmes and Watson begin walking away from the crypt.
       Lestrade follows, anxious. Holmes shows him the dusty
       pocket watch.

                               HOLMES
                 Scratches around the keyhole where
                 the watch is wound. Most drunks
                 are the same, and pawnbrokers
                 scratch the ticket number and
                 their initials inside the lid.
                 This one has five, so the owner --

                               GROUNDSKEEPER (O.S.)
                 He was walking.

       They all stop, suddenly. The old Groundskeeper stands in
       front of them, ready to unburden himself.

                               GROUNDSKEEPER
                      (quivering voice)
                 He was walking but his feet didn't
                 touch the ground. And I'm not
                 daft, I know what I saw and I know
                 Lord Blackwood. He was as alive
                 as you or me. It's not right.
                 It's not natural.
                      (turns, leaves)
                 Our Father Who art in heaven...
                 (etc.)

       All three men watch the Groundskeeper go. A sudden gust
       of wind moans eerily. They all want to get the hell out
       of there.

                               HOLMES
                 Now the game is afoot, Watson.

       Holmes stands in the middle of the street contentedly
       observing humanity. Watson ENTERS FRAME and hands Holmes
       a bundle wrapped in newspaper.

                               WATSON
                 I fail to see how these fish and
                 chips are different from the three
                 other places we passed along the
                 way.

                                  HOLMES
                 Trust me.

               Just eat.

     Holmes complies hungrily and they start to stroll along.
     Watson appears preoccupied.

                             WATSON
               You know, I've seen things in war
               that I couldn't explain. I once
               heard a man predict his death,
               down to the number and placement
               of the bullet holes that killed
               him. You have to admit that a
               supernatural explanation is at
               least theoretically possible.

                     indecipherable)
               Never theorize before you have
               data. Invariably, you end up
               twisting facts to suit theories,
               instead of theories to suit facts.
               Adler's midget is the key to this.

     Holmes pulls out a JEWELER'S LOUP, screws it into his
     eye, and flips Reordon's watch open. He examines the
     lid.

                             HOLMES
               Hmm... scratches around the
               keyhole, what does that tell you?

                             WATSON
               The owner was most likely a drunk.
               Each time he wound the watch his
               hand would slip, hence the
               scratches.

                             HOLMES
               Very good, Watson! You've
               developed considerable powers of
               your own.

     Watson looks quite chuffed.

                             HOLMES
               Let's see now, there are several
               sets of initials scored into the
               lid.

                             WATSON
               Pawnbroker's marks.

                               HOLMES
               Excellent.

     Watson looks extremely pleased with himself until they
     turn a corner into a street where EVERY SECOND SHOP IS A
     PAWN SHOP. His face falls.

                             HOLMES
               The most recent is M.H...

     Watson shakes his head.

                             WATSON
               Maddison and Haig.

               Oh my Lord, here we are. They
               should give us an address.

     WE SEE MADDISON & HAIG, PAWNBROKERS, RESPECTABLE,
     DISCREET, ahead of them there on Bow Street.

                             WATSON
               There's one thing you've missed.
               On the watch.

                                HOLMES
               I think not.

                             WATSON
               The time. Which leads me to
               deduce that I'm already late for
               my appointment with Mary. You
               remember, the one I was leaving
               for before you talked me into
               coming to dig up dead bodies with
               you.

     A GYPSY PALM READER approaches Watson as he turns to
     leave.

                             PALM READER
               Reckon your future, sir?

                             HOLMES
               Perhaps we do need a little help
               from the beyond.

                                WATSON
               No, thank you.

     She grabs his hand anyway.

                             PALM READER
               You need to hear what I have to
               tell you.

     Watson is so taken aback by the urgency and gravity of
     her tone that he doesn't pull away.

                             PALM READER
               I see two men, brothers. Not in
               blood but in bond. I see the
               letters S and an L, no... wait, a
               J.

     Holmes and Watson look at each other.   She has their
     attention.

     Watson looks at Holmes.

                             PALM READER
               I see a letter... the letter M...

                    (horrified)
               Patterned table clothes, china
               figurines, lace doilies...

     Watson snatches his hand away.

                             WATSON
               You think you are clever don't
               you?

     Holmes feigns innocence.

                             PALM READER
               She turns to fat...

                                WATSON
               Enough.

     The Palm Reader looks at Holmes.

                             HOLMES
                    (to Watson)
               Do you have any changes?

     Watson shakes his head as he pays the woman.

                             WATSON
               This is a new low -- even for you.

               It's the most honest prediction
               old Flora has made in years. And
               you know it yourself, Watson.
               That is precisely the reason you
               can't find a suitable ring.
               You're terrified of a life without
               the thrill of the macabre, as well
               you should be.

     Holmes swallows the last of his cod and casts the
     wrapping aside, pleased with himself.

                             WATSON
               Do you still have my cut from the
               fight?

     Holmes digs into a pocket, produces a wad of coins.

                                HOLMES
               Why, do you --

     Watson snatches the money, storms into Madison and Haig.

     Holmes is confused until he spots a sign in the window:
     "Large selection of engagement rings for every wallet."

     Holmes starts to look a bit nervous. As he follows
     Watson, he is intercepted by the Palm Reader who grabs
     his arm.

                             PALM READER
               I seen something in his hand.
               Darkness and great pain. Mortal
               peril. Warn your friend, he's not
               safe.

     Even Holmes is taken aback by this.

     EXT. LONDON EAST END - MINUTES LATER
     Holmes and Watson move down the street, the pawnshop
     behind them. Now Watson is smiling, and Holmes is not.
     Watson is beaming at: an ENGAGEMENT RING in a box.

                                WATSON
               Not bad, eh?

     Holmes turns away, looks down at the TICKET he got from
     the pawnshop: an ADDRESS.

     windows are boarded up.

     Holmes winds his way up a twisting flight of creaky
     stairs, finds a door with scratches on the keyhole.

     Holmes takes out his knife and goes to work on the lock.
     It is fiddly. It takes him a while. He kneels to get a
     better angle with the knife.

     CRACK! Watson's boot flashes past him as he KICKS the
     door off its hinges. Off Holmes' pleased reaction, he
     gestures them inside.

                             WATSON
               I can spare ten minutes.

     INT. REORDON'S ROOMS - DAY
     The squalid doorway opens into a series of dark rooms.
     Watson lights a lamp which reveals details of an interior
     that stops them both in their tracks:

     From floor to ceiling, every available inch is covered in
     writing, biblical Latin and Hebrew. Scrawled-on paper
     and pages are tacked to walls and carved into the
     plaster, crucifixes punctuate the yards of text and
     collage, strange pagan charms hang from the ceiling.

                             HOLMES
               He clearly felt something was
               coming to get him.

                                WATSON
               Something did.

     They move further inside where there is a hallway and a
     basic bedroom. Holmes inspects it, moves through a door.

               Watson, come take a look at this --

     Watson puts down what he was looking at, goes towards...


56   INT. REORDON'S LAB                                            56

     Instantly, Watson covers his nose with a handkerchief.

                              WATSON
                    (reeling)
               Bloody hell...

     The room is stacked with an alarming amount of scientific
     and biological paraphernalia. Some of it gives off a
     distinctly electrical hum. Ungodly fragments of limbs
     and matter float in jars.

                             HOLMES
                    (inhaling deeply,
                     loving it)
               Ammonium sulfate.

     In the center of the room, something ROTTING. An
     experiment generating a massive stench, a seething cloud
     of flies. Holmes and Watson step closer to see:

     DEAD FROGS. Eyes opened impossibly wide, their bodies
     frozen in strange contortions, as if mid-death-rattle.

     Holmes moves around the room, sniffing like a morbid
     perfumer. Watson does his best not to gag.

                             HOLMES
                    (mumbles)

               Appears he was attempting to
               follow occult formula with
               scientific practice.

     Watson moves to the stove, sees a sheaf of BURNT PAPERS.
     He digs through them, finds one piece not as burnt as the
     rest. A CREST stamped on it, impossible to read.

     Watson digs through his forensic bag, pulls out vials.

                             WATSON
               Has he any hydrochloric acid?

     Holmes shuffles a few bottles, tosses one to Watson.
     Watson catches it, starts pouring the acid, another
     chemical on a clean sheet of paper.

     Holmes senses something, moves into the next room.       He
     stops at an open window, smells the CURTAINS:

                              HOLMES
                Irene was here.

     Watson presses the chemical-soaked paper onto the burnt
     paper.

                              WATSON
                Why would she hire you to find
                him, if she planned to do the job
                herself?

                              HOLMES
                Maybe it's not the man she's
                after, but something else.
                Something he was working on?
                              WATSON
                Ferrocyanide. Sucks the iron
                right out of the ink. Long as
                it's not too burnt...

     Watson keeps rubbing the paper together, puts it by the
     lantern. Slowly, faint words APPEAR on the blank page.
     Ghostly chemistry. Watson sees the crest is Blackwood's.

                              WATSON
                He worked for Blackwood.

     Holmes gets a whiff of something, raises an eyebrow.       He
     starts walking back to the other room.

                              HOLMES
                There's one odor I can't put my
                finger on. Sweet, almost like
                perfume... or sugar....

     They are followed by DREDGER, a huge man, just shy of
     seven feet tall and pushing 400 pounds, slightly
     deformed, who follows them into the room. He sucks on a
     twisty stick of barley sugar (Victorian hard candy).

     They stop, surprised to see Holmes and Watson.    Holmes'
     eyes widen at the giant.

                             HOLMES
               Hello, gentlemen.

     Dredger is deadpan.

                             DREDGER
               Sherlock Holmes.

                             HOLMES
               Let me guess -- you're here to
               extinguish any connection between
               the man who lived here and the man
               you work for? Curious you'd still
               be running errands for a dead man.

                             DREDGER
                    (smiles)
               You do like to talk.

     The two thugs step toward Holmes and Watson.

                             HOLMES
               You take them, I'll handle Mr.
               Sweet tooth.

                             WATSON
               Seems about fair.

     Watson meets the men in the middle of the room, swinging
     at them. As they dodge and swing back --

     Holmes grabs a standing lamp, sliding it into his hand as
     a weapon. He looks at Dredger, knows it won't make a
     dent. He keeps moving, swinging the lamp toward a
     CURTAIN. In the blink of an eye:

     He WRAPS UP the curtain, ripping it down, bringing the
     heavy STEEL ROD with it. He catches the rod, flipping it
     so the curtain-rings rain to the floor.

     He spins the rod expertly, SMASHING it into Dredger's
     face. It stuns the giant for a beat, but quickly --

     Dredger LUNGES forward, trapping the steel rod under his
     arm. He grabs the rod and HURLS Holmes through the air,
     sending him flying into --

      Holmes crash-lands on the table, scattering all the
      bottles and tools. He blinks, trying to gather his
      senses. He sees Dredger incoming, as --

      Watson tussles with the thugs, a bar-room brawler.    Head
      butting one, kicking the other in the groin.

      The men whip out knives. Watson ducks and dodges, blades
      flashing on either side of him. One of the blades slices
      his shirt, ripping off his pocket, so --

      The ENGAGEMENT RING falls to the floor. One of the thugs
      accidentally KICKS it, sending it across the ground.

      As Watson follows the ring with his eyes, the first man
      HURLS his knife. Watson just barely ducks the blade,
      which SMACKS into the second thug, who falls. Watson
      fights the first thug, as he scrambles toward the ring.

      INT. REORDON'S LAB
      Dredger bears down on Holmes. Holmes reaches out for
      some kind of weapon, anything he can grab. He snatches a
      SHORT SHAFT. A truly pathetic weapon.

      Dredger lurches toward Holmes, who swings the metal shaft
      desperately, and... the shaft SPARKS.

      ZAP! A flash of light and crackle, and Dredger gets an
      ELECTRIC SHOCK that sends him flying back twenty feet --

      Watson finishes off his thug and plucks the engagement
      ring off the floor, just as --

      Dredger flies through the air, SLAMMING into Watson,
      knocking him off his feet, and knocking the ring away.

      Holmes looks at the lightning rod in his hand, stunned by
      the efficacy of the weapon.

      Dredger tries to recover, climbing off of Watson.    Holmes
      cranks his weapon. The rod sparks and hums.

      Dredger pulls himself up with the help of a water pipe on
      the wall. Holmes thinks quickly, then touches the other
      end of the pipe with the rod, and ZZZAPPPP!!

      The electrical current RUNS ALONG THE PIPE, and KNOCKS
      Dredger back twenty more feet.

        Watson spots the ring rolling towards the window, starts
        running for it, frantic as --

        Dredger rises, a clear change in his demeanor. He looks
        at the sparking rod and races for the window as well.

        Watson chases the engagement ring, bends down... just as
        he's about to grab it...

        THUD!   Dredger's massive foot STOMPS DOWN ON THE RING.

        Dredger gives Watson a cruel smile, then leaps out the
        window, landing atop a heap of coal. Watson glares as --

        Holmes blasts past him, leaps out the window.   Watson
        picks up the ring, sees:

        The stone was knocked out of the setting, lost in the
        floorboards, the rest of the ring mangled. Watson
        darkens, grips his ruined ring, and heads out --

        Dredger runs down the street, knocking people out of his
        way. Holmes gives chase, darting around people, trailing
        Dredger through the gates of a huge commercial
        shipbuilders. Watson brings up the rear, as --

        Dredger runs towards a SLIPWAY, which holds the
        UNFINISHED HULL OF A LARGE SHIP. The vessel can't be far
        from completion; it sits in a wheeled carriage designed
        to see it smoothly into water.


63      EXT. UN-LAUNCHED SHIP - FIRST SLIPWAY                          63

        For now though, big wooden chocks hold it in place, the
        whole thing is attached to a heavy chain that coils back
        around the shed that they just ran through.

        Holmes trails the hulking form of Dredger into this
        network of struts. They weave through the shadows.

        Holmes sees one of the cables shifting slightly.    He
        takes an angle to cut off Dredger, and --

      ZAP! Holmes steps into Dredger's path, hitting him with
      the lightning-rod, knocking him back. ZAP!! Holmes
      gives another jolt, but the shaft starts to LOSE POWER.

      Dredger knows there isn't much juice left. He reaches
      out, grabs the weapon and... smiles a terrifying smile.
      A moment of reckoning between Holmes and Dredger:

      The shaft slowly... sizzles... out. Dredger tosses the
      rod. And now, Holmes backs away, as --

      Dredger grabs a sledgehammer, and swings the hammer at
      Holmes, smashing some of the wooden supports, tearing
      others out of his way. The ship LURCHES forward.


64    EXT. FABRICATION SHED - DAY                                  64

      Watson runs round the end of the building and sees Holmes
      scrambling under the half-built hull. Dredger in
      pursuit.

      A police WHISTLE echoes through the air.   Dredger turns
      for a moment, just long enough for --

      Holmes to launch himself at Dredger. They tumble down
      onto the massive runners on the floor of the slipway.

      Holmes wrestles Dredger's head onto the runner and pins
      him down. Dredger kicks out viciously, splintering
      another chock. It's the last straw for the support
      mechanism, the whole thing starts to creak.

64B   EXT. FABRICATION SHED                                       64B

      Grappling frantically on the runners, both Holmes and
      Dredger look up as the HUGE CHOCKS holding the ship
      EXPLODE BACKWARDS --

      -- the PROPELLERS on the stern of the ship start sliding
      down towards them.

      Dredger looks up at the approach of the propellers --

      backwards across the runners. Dredger pulls Holmes down
      with him, Holmes' head hits the ground hard.

      Holmes lies semi-conscious, eyes rolled back into his
      head, as the leviathan roars down towards him.

      The ground beneath him shakes, knocks his head against
      the runner -- once, twice -- as he blinks back into
      consciousness, he sees the great shadow sweeping over
      him. He's doomed. And...

      The stern lurches to a STOP INCHES from his face. He
      opens one tentative eye, half expecting to find himself
      in the after-life, and sees black metal an inch from his
      nose. He realizes the ship has stopped, but he doesn't
      know why. He tries to roll out of the way, as --

      EXT. SECOND SLIPWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION
      We see the chain extended taut as a tight-rope behind the
      half-launched ship.

      The SHIP squeals and groans as its timber supports buckle
      and crack with the weight of the tethered ship.

      A beat where the whole business hangs in limbo and...

      The timber finally gives way.   The ship is free again,
      falling through the air --
      Holmes rolls sideways as the propellers slice through the
      air above his head -- the hull screams past him with a
      sound like the side of the world being torn off --

      -- and then the ship's away, parting the Thames with a
      vast, frothy explosion of water.

      Holmes watches the ship drift gracefully out into the
      river -- from vortex to serenity in a matter of seconds.
      A quiet beat.

      Holmes collapses back, great gulps of air disappearing
      into his lungs. He tries to pull himself to his feet,
      but Dredger's bone-shaking punches have taken it out of
      him and he sags back to the ground.

      Watson arrives, helps him to his feet. They stagger back
      to the slipway where Dredger was standing. And they
      find:

      The police whistles get louder, officers swarm the scene.
      They see the wreckage, the ship adrift, and... Holmes and
      Watson.

      Watson looks at his watch and does a slow, deep burn.


67    INT. LONDON JAIL - MORNING                                    67

      The next morning. A giant holding cell where every shade
      and aspect of Victorian villainy is corralled.

      Holmes wakes up on a bench after a peaceful night's
      sleep. Watson sits next to him, exhausted, bloodshot
      eyes. He's reading his notebook, making the odd change
      here and there.

      Holmes looks up and sees Watson staring at him, shaking
      his head.

                               WATSON
                 I haven't slept all night. I
                 deserve this... I clearly deserve
                 it. How could I ever be so
                 deluded as to believe I could meet
                 Mary's parents for tea once I let
                 myself be talked into going with
                 you. Now of course I'm in jail.

      Holmes tries to wiggle his fingers which causes him
      enough pain that he decides to bind them with Irene's
      handkerchief.

                 I've used the time to review my

     Holmes turns and comes face-to-face with a dangerous-
     looking man who has a few conspicuous WARTS on his face.

                             HOLMES
               Ah, Mr. Brownlee. The fifteenth
               most dangerous man in London.

     Watson snaps at the man.

                             WATSON
               Who could forget that face? I

               in two weeks. Now, if you'll

     Brownlee takes a swing at Watson. Holmes checks him and

     lack of understanding.

               What you need is a rest. You and
               I could go out to the countryside.
               My brother Mycroft has a small
               estate near Chichester. It has

               If I were going to the country, I
               would be going with my future
               wife --

                             HOLMES
               Certainly. We should have her
               along. Let's get Gladstone out of
               the house as well.

                             WATSON
               No, Holmes. Not you.   Me and her.
               You're not --

                             HOLMES
               Invited? Now you're not making
               any sense, Watson. Why would I
               not be invited to my own brother's
               country home?

                     head)
               ... without this.

     He touches his own heart.   They hear a BILLYCLUB hit the
     bars.

                              PRISON GUARD
               John Watson?   You made bail.

     Watson steps up. Holmes looks confused.    He steps
     forward. But the Guard shakes his head.

                              PRISON GUARD
               Just Watson.

     As he slides open the bars, they see... MARY emerges from
     behind the Guard. Watson stands for a beat between
     Holmes and Mary. He must make a decision. And he does --

     -- he leaves.

     Holmes watches him walk out, then locks eyes with Mary.
     She gives him a polite nod, turns, heads off with Watson.
     The bars slide shut.

     The mob surrounds Holmes.   He's never looked more alone.

     having just been battered through it by Holmes.

               Lestrade -- your usual impeccable

     Holmes and Lestrade march along. Lestrade holds out a
     copy of the newspaper. The headline reads: "BLACKWOOD
     LIVES AND THE DEVIL WALKS WITH HIM! MURDERER
     RESURRECTED!"

                             LESTRADE

               All in good time.

                             LESTRADE
               We don't have time. I've an
               office full of policemen hanging
               crosses over their desks. A
               public that's working itself into
               a frenzy...
     Holmes sees a dark, strange carriage waiting, door open.

                              HOLMES
               Who's this?

                             LESTRADE
               Try to behave yourself. They just
               paid a small fortune to bail you

     He holds a black hood.   Holmes shrugs.

                                                     CUT TO BLACK.


     FADE IN:

72   INT. TEMPLE OF FOUR ORDERS HEADQUARTERS                         72

     The hood is pulled off. Holmes takes in the scene, eyes
     flicking around the room.

     He's in a grand office where a man in his late 60s, SIR
     THOMAS, rises from a pile of papers.

                              SIR THOMAS
                Mr. Holmes, apologies for
                summoning you like this. I'm sure
                it's quite a mystery as to where
                you are, and who I am.

                              HOLMES
                As to where I am -- I was,
                admittedly, lost for a moment
                between Charing Cross and Holborn.
                But I was saved by the bread shop
                on Saffron Hill, the only bakers
                to use a certain French glaze on
                their loaves. After that, the
                carriage forked left, then right,
                a bump over the Fleet conduit --
                need I go on?

     Somewhat stunned, Sir Thomas shakes his head.

                              HOLMES
                As to who you are -- that took
                every ounce of my not-
                inconsiderable experience and
                skill... the letters on your desk
                are addressed to Sir Thomas
                Rotheram, Lord Chief Justice.
                That would be your official title.
                Who you realy are is another
                matter entirely.

     Sir Thomas is not in the mood for this -- but Holmes is
     on a roll.

               Judging by the sacred Ox on your
               ring, you're also the secret head
               of the Temple of the Four Orders --
               in whose headquarters we now
               stand, on the northwest corner of
               St. James Square.
                    (beat)
               And as to the mystery -- the
               mystery is why you bothered to
               blindfold me in the first place.

                             SIR THOMAS
               Yes, well, it's standard
               procedure, I suppose.

     Holmes shakes his head; what a massive lack of judgement
     on their part.

                             STANDISH (O.S.)
               I think we have the right man.

     Holmes turns to see JOHN STANDISH and LORD COWARD
     standing behind him. Standish is an American in his
     sixties. Coward is a hard, ambitious man in his 30s.

               Sherlock Holmes, Ambassador
               Standish from America and Lord
               Coward, the Home Secretary.

     Holmes acknowledges them -- barely -- as they enter.    He
     isn't impressed by rank.

                             LORD COWARD
               I suppose you already have some
               notion as to the -- practices of
               our Order?

                              HOLMES
               Yes.   They're almost interesting.

                             SIR THOMAS
               Be as skeptical as you like -- but
               our secret systems have steered
               the world towards the greater good
               for centuries. The danger is that
               they can also be exploited for
               more nefarious purposes.

                             LORD COWARD
               What some call the dark arts, or
               practical magic.

     Holmes looks around the room, sees FLAGS on the walls
     with ancient symbols, variations of the SPHINX.

                             STANDISH
               We know you're are a rationalist.
               We don't ask you to share our
               faith, only our fears.

                             HOLMES
               Fear is the more infectious
               condition.
                    (at Sir Thomas)
               In this case, fear of your own
               child.

     That shocks them rigid.

                             HOLMES
               Blackwood is your son, yes? You
               have the same colored irises -- a

                      Thomas' ear)
               -- plus identical outer ears, or
               pinna, which only pass down
               through the direct bloodline,
               which would make you either
               brothers, or, more likely, father
               and son.

     Stunned, the men consult silently, come to some sort of
     conclusion. They turn back to Holmes. Sir Thomas seems
     especially shaken.

                             SIR THOMAS
               Very few people are privy to that
               information, and we want to keep
               it that way.

     Sir Thomas opens a bureau, digs for something.

                             SIR THOMAS
               He was conceived during one of our
               rituals. His mother wasn't my
               wife, but she shared our beliefs.
               She was a powerful practitioner.
               Though not enough to survive
               giving birth to him.

     Holmes is appalled and shows it.

                             SIR THOMAS
               We were young. It was before we
               fully understood the powers we
               were dealing with.

                             HOLMES
               Evidently.

                             SIR THOMAS
               Death followed him wherever he
               went, from his birth to arms he
               made and sold. What family he had
               tended to... not survive. No one
               could prove anything of course,
               but we all knew --

     Sir Thomas hands Holmes a TINTYPE. A photograph from the
     1860s. It's chilling: a death scene, a BODY covered by
     a sheet. A man who's just fallen out a window. A TEN-
     YEAR-OLD BOY -- young Lord Blackwood -- looks on.

                             SIR THOMAS
               The boy was a curse. I didn't
               have the courage either to take
               him in or to --

               All this is history. The present
               and future are worse.

                             SIR THOMAS
               We've done our best to stop him
               ourselves, but it's not enough.

                             LORD COWARD
               His power grows daily and
               exponentially. His resurrection
               is evidence of that. What he does
               next will be far more dangerous --

                             SIR THOMAS
               -- he's going to raise a force
               that will alter the very course of
               our world. We need you to find
               him and stop him before he does.

                             LORD COWARD
               We'll give you any assistance we
               can. As Home Secretary, I have
               considerable influence over the
               police.
                    (beat)
               Name your price.

     Holmes looks at Coward with scathing disdain.

                             HOLMES
               One of the great benefits of my
               work is that I can pick and choose
               my clients. I'll get him, but not
               for you.

     Holmes stalks out -- stops at the door, turns, fixes Sir
     Thomas with a very bleak gaze.

                             HOLMES
               I have one last question, Sir
               Thomas.

                             SIR THOMAS
               What is it?

     Holmes holds up the tintype.

                             HOLMES
               If the rest of his family's dead,
               why are you still alive?

     Holmes tosses the tintype onto a table, leaves.

     Holmes comes out of a carriage, and scoots up the steps
     of the massive hotel that's bustling with people.


75   INT. IRENE'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY                               75

     Irene enters wearing a stunning evening dress. She
     pauses glancing briefly around the room before sitting at
     a mirrored dressing table. There's a decanter on the
     table next to her from which she pours herself a glass of
     wine.

     Then she begins removing an impressive assortment of
     WEAPONS hidden on her person: she pulls a stiletto from
     her garter, a Derringer from her waistband (which she
     puts down next to the wine glass). She pulls long thin
     needles from her hair, lets her hair down. As she
     continues...

     PULL BACK TO REVEAL Holmes watching her from a shadowy

               If you're going to watch me take
               my clothes off, Sherlock, the
               least you can do is help me with
               the buttons.

     OR ALT:

                             IRENE
               To watch a lady undress without
               her permission is a criminal
               offense, Sherlock, and could get
               you into a lot of trouble...

     They both eye the Derringer on the table.

                             IRENE
               So why don't you come over here
               and help me instead.

     Holmes approaches her somewhat tentatively and reaches
     for the top button on the back of her dress.

                                IRENE
               That's better.

                             HOLMES
               You can stop looking for Reardon.

                             IRENE
               I knew I could count on you.

               He was buried in Blackwood's tomb.

     Irene is momentarily taken aback then recovers.

                             IRENE
               Wonderful. Case closed then.
               Your services are no longer
               required.

     Unbuttoning done, Holmes steps out to confront Irene.

                             HOLMES
               I can't help wondering if your
               employer will be as content with
               these results? You were
               uncharacteristically ill at ease
               in his presence. Your hand was
               trembling, your gaze was averted.
               I couldn't see his face, but I
               spotted chalk on his lapel. A
               professor perhaps?

     Irene gets up, walks behind a DRESSING SCREEN.

                             IRENE
                    (behind screen)
               The eye patch was a nice touch.

                             HOLMES
               But I've never known a professor
               to carry a gun, and on such a
               clever contraption.

                             IRENE (O.S.)
               Let's not argue.

                             HOLMES
               We're not.

     Irene steps out, now wearing an array of Victorian
     undergarments. Unfairly gorgeous. The huge DIAMOND
     still around her neck. She moves back to the dressing
     table.

     Holmes won't look at her, refusing to get turned on.

                             HOLMES
               Tell me who you're working for and
               what he's after.

                             IRENE
               That's nobody's business but my
               own.

                             HOLMES
               I disagree.

                             IRENE
               You see, we are arguing.

     Holmes gets closer and closer to Irene as he presses his
     case vehemently.

                             HOLMES
               When a man you ask me to find ends
               up dead in the coffin of the most
               notorious murderer since Jack the
               Ripper and that murderer manages
               to return from the dead, not only
               is it my business, it's the
               business of Scotland Yard and the
               highest levels of the British
               government. They will certainly
               consider your reticence to be an
               obstruction of justice. Which in
               relation to a crime of this
               magnitude would certainly mean
               prison time.

                             IRENE
               This wine is excellent.    You
               should really try some.

     Holmes notices her Derringer on the table next to the
     wine bottle.

                             HOLMES
               So what's it to be?

                             IRENE
               Do we really have to decide now?

     Irene reaches for the wine.

                             HOLMES
               You're in over your head this
               time, Irene.

     Irene snatches up her gun.    Holmes grabs her arm.

     BANG! A BULLET tears into his shoe, missing his toe.
     Holmes snatches away the smoking Derringer. Irene kisses
     him, hard and angry at first, becoming something else.
     Another of the weapons in her arsenal, and the one that
     disarms Holmes.

     The kiss leads them to the bed.

               That's better.

     Irene pulls him down to it.     He doesn't resist.

     CLICK!

     Holmes' eyes flare with surprise.

     CLICK!

                                IRENE
               Much better.

     Irene has handcuffed him to the bed frame.

                             IRENE
               This is the only way it could ever
               work between us, Sherlock -- one
               in shackles, the other with the
               key.

     She gets off him.

     While he struggles on the bed, Irene walks casually
     across the room. She starts putting on MAN'S CLOTHING.
     She's in charge now.

                             IRENE
               I've NEVER been in over my head.

                             HOLMES
               How can you live like this --
               always a fugitive.

     She approaches, now dressed as a man, straddles him.

                             IRENE
               But free. And on my own terms.
               Just like you -- well, not you at
               this exact moment --

      She pulls at the front of his trousers, throws the
      handcuff keys down there.

                              IRENE
                -- but generally speaking.

      Holmes has no retort. Irene takes the scarf off his
      neck, moves to the doorway.

                              IRENE
                If anyone asks, please let them
                know that Mr. O'Neil didn't have
                time to check out.
                      (beat)

      His butler, PERIGRINE, stands there waiting for him.

                              PERIGRINE
                Good evening, sir. Some figs and
                honey with a nice glass of port?
                I've prepared a tray.

                              SIR THOMAS
                No thank you, Perigrine, I'm going
                to bed.
                     (as he heads
                      upstairs)
                You won't let those figs go to

     Sir Thomas sinks into his bath.   Relaxing.

     The CAMERA SLOWLY TRACKS IN, drip, drip, drip.

     The silence is broken all of a sudden when the tap is
     magically turned on. Sir Thomas opens his eyes in panic,
     as he hears an eerie WHISPER O.S., like the rushing of
     wind.

     Sir Thomas is overcome with panic, tries to sit up.
     Can't. Not all the way.

                Hello, Father...

      Thomas blinks and sees that BLACKWOOD now sits in the
      corner of the bathroom, lit in a sinister fashion.

      Sir Thomas' eyes widen, the muscles stand out in his neck
      as he fights paralysis. He slides back down, slowly.

                              BLACKWOOD
                You can't fight it. It comes from
                a power greater than yours. You
                can only surrender.

      The water flows over Sir Thomas, as Blackwood steps
      closer and takes the sacred RING from his rigid finger.

                              BLACKWOOD
                I've been imagining this moment
                for a long time...

      The water closes over his face. Sir Thomas stares up at
      Blackwood, who watches him drown, slowly and surely.

                              BLACKWOOD
                ... I must admit, it's better than
                I thought it would be.

      handcuffed to the bed. Clothes in total disarray. Her
      shriek wakes him. He looks down at himself and reacts
      with shock, then grim recognition sets in.

      Holmes is briefed by Constable Clark as they enter. As
      Constable Clark continues in, Holmes swivels away --

                              CONSTABLE CLARK
                We've checked everything. No sign
                of a break-in. The Butler didn't
                hear anything. The body was in
                the tub, eyes wide open --
      -- so that Const. Clark ends up talking to thin air.

                              CONSTABLE CLARK
                     (realizing Holmes
                      isn't there)
                -- only his ring was missing.

      He turns, puzzled, looking for Holmes, finds him right
      back at the doorway, in full virtuoso detective mode.
      Right now, right here is where Holmes is at his very best
      -- this is, in fact, why he exists.

      Holmes is satisfied by what he sees or finds, continues
      into the bathroom, where a POLICE OFFICER stands over the
      tub and Sir Thomas' body (covered with a blanket).

      The tub has been drained. The kind of crime scene
      violation that Holmes cannot get them to stop doing.

                Why did you drain the water?

                              POLICE OFFICER
                Out of common decency.

                              HOLMES
                     (incensed)
                Crime is common, logic is rare.
                The decent thing to do is catch
                the killer, not provide comfort to
                the corpse.

      Neither the officer nor Clark have a response. Holmes
      swivels, sees a JAR OF BATH SALTS on the table next to
      the chair Blackwood sat in, leans over, scoops it up,
      opens it, sniffs it.

                                HOLMES
                Hmm...

      Holmes thrusts the open jar under the Officer's nose.

                What is that?

                              POLICE OFFICER
                     (smelling)
                Uhhhh... jasmine?

                              HOLMES
                Superb. I suspect this comes from
                a larger cannister. It'll either
                be in the pantry, high up where
                it's warm and dry, or in a linen
                closet with a vent. And,
                Constable, you could check the
                ground under the rear windows for
                any footprints not your own.

      Both cops hesitate -- Holmes is not their boss.

                              HOLMES
                Data, data, data! I cannot make
                bricks without clay!

      The cops hurry away. Now Holmes can really get down to
      work. This may mean he gets on his belly for a floor's-
      eye-view, it may mean he looks down from a window sill.
      Sometimes he hums or sings to himself.

      Holmes is happy.

      He glances around the room, sees the chair where
      Blackwood was perched, sits in it himself.

      His eyes keep moving, noticing something on a wall. He
      steps toward it, runs his hand along a layer of dust.
      The dust has a line down it, as if the wall cracked open.

      Holmes steps to the sink, grabs a handful of TALCUM
      POWDER and tosses the powder against the wall, revealing:

      FINGERPRINTS on one of the panels.

      He pushes the panel, and the wall shifts, opening to
      reveal a SECRET ROOM. Holmes enters --

78E   INT. SIR THOMAS' SECRET ROOM                                  78E

      Holmes finds a desk with a prayer table, and ancient
      texts, spellbooks, one book open to a picture of
      Alexander the Great at the Sphinx. He steps toward --

      An ALTAR below the image of the Sphinx. On the altar,
      four strange objects: a strand of human HAIR, a cow's
      BONE, a large sharp FANG, and a FEATHER.

      Holmes pockets the altar items and a couple pieces of
      paper, just as --

      -- Const. Clark and the Officer return, the Officer
      proudly hugging a 5 LB. CANNISTER OF JASMINE BATH SALTS.

      They are startled by the secret room --

      -- they are even more startled by the sight of Holmes
      kneeling at the altar and singing to himself.

      As soon as they arrive, Holmes springs to his feet and
      walks out. Maybe he continues singing between words.
                                 HOLMES
                      (vis   the secret room)
                I have no    idea what to make of
                that.

      Holmes walks up the stairs and finds Watson's office door            
      open. He is well into packing his things. The office is              
      full of boxes, the walls and shelves are very sparse.

               Don't forget the wallpaper.

               There isn't any.

               Figure of speech.                                      

     Holmes steps into the room.

               use, do you mind if I employ it?

     Holmes steps aside. Two/three policemen enter carrying a         
     large, heavy bag and unceremoniously dump it on Watson's         
     desktop. They unzip the bag, revealing the dead body of

               consolation in the knowledge that                       
               he can still be of service to his                       
               fellow men.                                             

     Watson keeps packing. Holmes analyzes the body,
     starting, of all places, with the outer elbows and
     forearms of his coat.

     Holmes grabs various instruments and other items from             
     Watson's newly-packed boxes. Frustrated, Watson snatches          
     them back as quickly as Holmes takes them out.

               Elbows and arms stained with
               blood, but older than his own
               injuries. Plenty of it, layer on
               layer...

     Holmes scrapes at the layers of blood with his knife,
     examines it.

                             HOLMES
               Though none of it human.

     Watson slows down slightly. He keeps packing, trying to
     resist the mystery, but it's not easy.

                             HOLMES
               A butcher perhaps...?   What else?

     Holmes cuts a lock of the man's hair, ignites it, studies
     the color of the flame carefully. Watson wrinkles his
     nose at the smell.

                             HOLMES
               Hm -- predominantly yellow flame,
               but with distinct green bursts.
               Sulfurous. He spent lots of time
               around industrial work and very
               little around a wash basin.

     Holmes uses a curved nail file to scrape dirt from under
     the man's fingernails, rubs the evidence between his
     fingers like a connoisseur.

                             HOLMES
               Coal... river silt...

     Watson slows down further, struggling.

                             HOLMES
               That plus the river silt and
               industrial slag on his trousers
               puts him squarely in...

     A hanging beat.   And Watson finally cracks, blurting out:

               Nine Elms.

                             HOLMES
               Well done. Now, you didn't happen
               to pack the Lord's Register of
               members' interests, did you?

     Watson pulls it out of a box.

     As Watson flips through it, Holmes plucks a few chords on

        A brief nod, then Holmes is gone.

        A beat as Watson continues packing. He heaves a box up,
        moves for his suitcase. After a moment, he notices...

        Holmes' PISTOL.

        He picks it up. As he contemplates the weapon, he
        becomes more serious. Then angry. He mouths a curse to
        himself, and sees their DOG giving him a disapproving
        look.

                  Yes, I know. Don't give me that
                  look, Gladstone.

        He pockets the gun, grabs his jacket and heads out.

      A few DROPS OF RAIN trickle down. He looks up, surprised
      by the rain. He raises his collar, and keeps moving.

      He hits the door to a building. It is locked. He bangs
      on the door, as the rain comes harder. The door finally
      opens. As he enters, we see the rain stops behind him,
      gone as fast as it came. A RAVEN flaps into the night.

                immediately, I nominate Lord
                Blackwood as head of the Order.

                              STANDISH
                Are you mad, Coward? Have you any
                idea what he's capable of?

                              BLACKWOOD (O.S.)
                Of course he does. It's why he's
                here.

      Blackwood enters. He looks as if he's been to hell, and
      come back more powerful than ever.

      The crowd is stunned. Standish looks at Coward,
      betrayed, turns to the others -- who are transfixed by
      the sight of Blackwood suddenly kneeling before them.

                              BLACKWOOD
                I am humbled. I am honored.
                     (beat)
                My powers and my assets --
                munitions, shipping, industry --
                they were given to me for a
                purpose.

                             BLACKWOOD (CONT'D)
               A magnificent and simple purpose.
               A different future... a future
               ruled by us.

     Blackwood stands, prowls.

                             BLACKWOOD
               You've made policy in secret for
               centuries. Now, you'll make it
               openly.

     The men are beginning to like what they hear.

                             BLACKWOOD
               The first act is a necessary one,
               for without death there can be no
               rebirth...
                    (beat)
               ... at noon tomorrow, we will take
               the first step towards a new
               chapter in history.
                    (beat)
               England will know our power.
               Then, the whole world will.
               Across the Atlantic lies a colony
               that was once ours, and will be
               again. Their civil war weakened
               them; their government is as
               corrupt and ineffective as ours.
               We'll take it from them.
                    (beat)
               With their resources and our
               power, we'll remake the world,
               we'll create the future.
                    (beat)
               Are you with me?

                             STANDISH
               No, sir, we are not!
                    (turning to the
                     others)
               The powers he's playing with are
               beyond any man's control.

                              BLACKWOOD
               They're limitless -- even death
               holds no sway.

                             STANDISH
               Help me stop him before it's too
               late.

     Nobody moves.   Blackwood smiles -- he's won.

      In desperation, Standish pulls a gun.   But as he aims it
      at Blackwood -

                              BLACKWOOD
                I wouldn't do that.

      -- he IGNITES, combusting with an impossible BLAST OF
      BLINDING HOT FLAMES!

      The men in the room reel backwards, shocked, terrified.

      Flames consuming him, Standish flails, crashing through a
      window out to --


83A   EXT. LONDON STREET - NIGHT                                     83A

      The fireball plummets through the sky, lighting city
      blocks. People look up, gape, and --

      WHOOMPF! Standish lands on the roof of a carriage.
      Horses and carriages SCREECH to a stop.

      The flames flicker blinding white, as his body contorts,
      melting away. People scream, gasp, faint, cross
      themselves, as they witness this unnatural act.

      Blackwood turns to Coward, nods.

      Coward produces a brimming silver chalice.

                              BLACKWOOD
                Come, drink your allegiance here.

      The members line up to drink from a CHALICE. It doesn't
      taste good, but it tastes like power. As they drink,
      Blackwood leans close to Coward:

      Coward nods.


84    EXT. QUEENSHITHE SLAUGHTERHOUSE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT         84

      An industrial area on a bend of the Thames. Work doesn't
      stop when the sun goes down. Wharves stretch out into
      the water. WE SEE a boat is being loaded. We PULL BACK
      FROM the scene and look ACROSS the water.

      Just above the thump of industry we can hear a
      distinctive and irregular CHUGGING sound. Slowly a
      decrepit and eccentric little steam launch chugs INTO
      VIEW. Holmes is on the deck along with a much older man
      in a sailor's hat -- CAPTAIN TANNER.

                              HOLMES
                Everything all right, Captain
                Tanner?

      Captain Tanner has few teeth and a large white beard.

                              TANNER
                Just a little leak, nothing to
                worry about.

      Watson is busy with a bucket clearing the boat of a very
      serious leak. He's soaked, and furious.

                              TANNER
                Not a great one for the water, are
                you, doctor? Army type, aren't
                you? You wouldn't have lasted
                long in the Navy.

      Watson glares. Holmes scans the banks with a telescope.
      He sees a jetty with a few shadows shifting on it. The
      engine shudders off, the boat drifts. Tanner whispers:

                              TANNER
                That's as far as we can go.

      Holmes starts clambering over the side.    Watson's pissed.

                              WATSON
                There must be fifty yards of mud
                out there.

      Holmes' head is just visible before he drops over the
      prow. He whispers at Tanner.

               Pull in at Vauxhall. Send for the
               police when you get there.

     Tanner nods. A soft "splosh" as Holmes disappears.
     Watson carefully leaves his valued possessions behind,
     watch, etc. He lays down his wallet and looks at Tanner.

                             WATSON
               I know precisely how much money is
               in there.

                             TANNER
                    (taking the piss)
               I am sure you do, doctor.

     Watson glares, goes over the side, with his walking
     stick.

86   EXT. QUEENSHITHE SLAUGHTERHOUSE                              86

     Holmes and Watson emerge out of the shallows, covered in
     mud. Holmes doesn't seem bothered. Watson does.

     They look up and see a jetty that heads out into the
     river. Two shadowy THUGS guard the dock, while more
     THUGS are loading the boat with something.

     Holmes and Watson scuttle forward, towards the entrance,
     where two more THUGS patrol. Watson pulls out Holmes'
     GUN.
                             HOLMES
               What are you doing with my gun?

                             WATSON
               Oh, please.

                             HOLMES
               It was an honest mistake --

                             WATSON
               There was nothing honest about it.

     Holmes looks back at Watson, takes the gun, says nothing,
     the closest he'll come to a confession. Watson steps
     forward.

                             WATSON
               Come on, let's get this over with.

     They look out at the thugs guarding the door. Holmes
     whispers, trying to figure out the best strategy.

                             HOLMES
               The one on the left seems more
               attentive, might prove easily
               distracted. The big one's been
               drinking -- whether for courage or
               from habit... Watson?

     Watson has already left. He simply walks up to the door
     and whacks the larger man in the face with the gun --
     before dispatching the other with a backhand pistol-whip.

     Holmes follows, notices that both men have hip flasks.
     He picks one up, takes a whiff, and pockets it as he
     follows Watson. He slows, sensing something behind him.
     He turns, looks at shadows. Nothing. And he enters --

     stopped in his tracks, spooked. Holmes catches up,
     passing Watson into --


89   INT. QUEENSHITHE SLAUGHTERHOUSE - ANTECHAMBER                 89

     Shadows on shadows. Metal groans softly, like a
     plaintive wail. The twisted blades of slaughterhouse
     instruments glimmer in the darkness. A few RATS lay
     dead. A truly creepy scene. Holmes and Watson move
     through it.

     As they go, Holmes notices rows of empty tables. He runs
     his finger through a layer of dust, inspecting it.
     Quiet:

                             HOLMES
               They cleared something out of
               here, not minutes ago...

     Holmes slows, picks up one of the dead rats. He inspects
     it, sees something on its skin, some kind of dark spore.

                              WATSON (O.S.)
               Holmes.   You need to see this.

     Holmes looks up, and sees Watson standing at a set of
     doors.

     TAIL, slipping it into his pocket, as he joins Watson,
     stepping into --


90   INT. QUEENSHITHE SLAUGHTERHOUSE - FACTORY FLOOR                90

     A massive space with a maze of machinery full of deadly
     gears and blades and saws, lifeless and silent for now.
     An automated butchery on a grand scale. This is the
     killing floor. Huge hooks hang from chain belts on an I-
     beam, the ceiling, swaying softly, whispering in the
     wind.

     On the high walls, a huge number has been scrawled:     118.

                               WATSON
               One-eighteen.    It's a date, a
               time?

     Holmes shakes his head, his eyes narrow, ticking.

                             HOLMES
               It's chapter and verse.
               Revelation 1:18. `I am He that
               liveth, and was dead.'

     Another voice completes the passage, echoing from above:

                             BLACKWOOD (O.S.)
               `And behold, I am alive
               forevermore, and have the keys of
               hell and of death. Amen.'

     Holmes and Watson follow the voice to see: BLACKWOOD in
     the rafters. Shadows hang heavy around him. Holmes and
     Watson react: this is the first time they've seen him in
     the flesh.
                              BLACKWOOD
                I cautioned you to accept that
                this is beyond your control. Now
                you see the truth for yourself.

     The hooks in the ceiling are shivering softly, strangely.
     Holmes tightens. Blackwood continues, his voice echoes,
     as the hooks move through the air, gliding on a track.

                             BLACKWOOD
               I want you to bear witness. At
               noon tomorrow, the world as you
               know it ends.

     Watson pulls his gun, draws a bead on Blackwood, pulls
     the trigger. Click. Misfire.

                help, Holmes, I have a gift for
                you.

      Holmes starts climbing up towards Blackwood.

                              BLACKWOOD
                     (voice moving away)
                She followed you. You led your
                little lamb straight to slaughter.

      Suddenly the whole machine starts up. Industrial-
      strength loud, movement everywhere, empty hooks jerking
      towards the processing line. Blades and gears and
      grinders churn.

      Watson's eyes go from Blackwood to --

      A pig carcass as it comes swinging out of the killing
      area, towards the SCORCHER (which scorches the carcasses
      with live flame).

      Then next carcass emerges --

      -- not a carcass, Irene. She is alive, for now. She
      hangs from two hooks on a track-line, her wrists shackled
      above her, her mouth gagged.

      Her eyes show terror until she sees them, then immense
      relief for a moment, then determination.

      Holmes looks up to see Blackwood's shadow retreating.

      Decision time.

90A                                                                90A

      Holmes drops on to the machine and leaps from gear to
      gear like stepping-stones. He heaves himself up to the
      conveyor, where Irene is being pulled down the assembly
      line towards the flames.

      Watson sprints ahead, looking for a shut-off switch.

      Holmes unties Irene's gag.

                              HOLMES
                It's your turn in shackles this
                time.

      Ahead of them, the pig carcass is scorched in an
      overwhelming burst of flame. Holmes and Irene are next.

                But this time no key,
                unfortunately.

      Holmes notes that Irene's hands are shackled to separate
      hooks. It's going to take two actions to free her.

      The flame machine gurgles ominously, gearing up for the
      next blast.

      Watson sees a LEVER (PLEASE NOTE, NEW PROP!) that looks
      promising, turns to head for it -- then his eyes focus on
      a big canvas splatter cloth.

                              HOLMES
                I've been meaning to ask you
                something --

                              IRENE
                Well, I'm a captive audience.

      Watson rips down the splatter cloth, sprints to Holmes
      and Irene, tosses the cloth across the conveyor belt to
      Holmes --

      -- who wraps them up in the thick cloth just before the
      flames hit them.

      The heat is excruciating -- but the cloth protects them.

      Watson watches anxiously as the scorched cloth drops
      away, revealing that Holmes and Irene made it -- just.

      Relieved, Watson heads for the lever until "Oh Shit!" he
      looks ahead --

      -- sees the scorched pig carcass being dragged into a
      long, conveyor-belt-wide SCALDING TANK OF BOILING WATER.

      Decision time for Watson -- help Holmes and Irene, or try
      the lever? He goes for the lever, reaches it, pushes it
      all the way over --

      -- and the belt speeds up with a jerk.

      Watson hauls back on the lever, gets the belt back to the
      original speed, looks around for another possible off
      switch.

      Just as they reach the scalding tank, Holmes jumps off
      the belt (still opposite side to Watson), grabs Irene's
      legs and pulls her horizontal just before she's dragged
      into the boiling water.

      She's suspended just above the boiling water, with Holmes
      moving sideways, keeping pace with her.

                              IRENE
                     (trying her best not
                      to show the strain)
                You had a question.

      Holmes keeps hold of Irene's feet as he maneuvers past
      various obstacles --

                              HOLMES
                     (same)
                Ah. Yes. Do you still maintain
                you're not in over your head?

                              IRENE
                     (panting)
                In some countries steam is
                considered excellent therapy for
                the skin.

      -- then is gouged in the back by a whirling fan belt,
      jerks away, and Irene touches the water, SCREAMS.

      Watson hears the scream, turns -- then sees something
      again. It pisses him off. Fuck this machine.

      When Holmes has Irene stable again:

                              IRENE
                     (weakly)
                I have to say -- it's overrated.

      Holmes has to admire her courage -- until he hears Watson
      yelling at him.

      Up ahead a huge pipe spews boiling water into the tank --
      and impassable obstacle from Holmes' side of the conveyor
      belt.

      Watson points at the I-beam running above them.   Holmes
      nods. Irene sees it, too.

      Holmes helps her reach one foot, then other up to the I-
      beam. She hooks her feet over it, and is suspended
      upside down by her shackles and her feet --

      -- and still heading for the pipe spewing boiling water.

      Watson appears opposite Holmes, nods up at Irene.   She
      swings off the I-beam, through the air --



                                                    (CONTINUED)

      -- and Watson catches her feet, pulls her horizontal,
      facing the other way just in time to avoid the gush of
      boiling water.

      As Watson holds Irene, he spots a small, but significant-
      looking SWITCH on the wall, painted red. (PLEASE NOTE,
      NEW PROP!)

      Watson helps Irene back onto the conveyor belt, leaves
      her for Holmes to deal with, sprints for the switch.

      Irene rides the belt upwards.   Holmes clambers the
      equipment, following her.

      Up ahead, the scorched, scalded pig carcass precedes
      them.

      Holmes darts through a trimming station, with CLEAVERS
      HANGING FROM CHAINS, grabs one, jumps onto the belt,
      catches up to Irene --

      -- just as they both see the pig carcass CUT IN HALF
      LENGTHWAYS BY A GIANT BANDSAW.

      Holmes wastes no time, swings the meat cleaver at the
      lock shackling Irene's left hand. Sparks fly as metal
      kisses metal, but that's all. She's still shackled.

      Then both of them see that Watson has reached the SWITCH.
      Whew!

      Watson looks at them with relief -- close one -- and
      pulls the switch down with a really satisfying CLUNK!

      A bank of lights goes out but the conveyor belt keeps
      moving towards the giant band saw.

      Shit a brick.

                              IRENE
                Sherlock?

      Now, she's showing nerves. So is Sherlock. He braces
      himself on the belt, swings the cleaver with all his
      might --

      -- smashes the shackle lock.

      Irene swings sideways violently, still shackled by her
      right hand.

      The bandsaw whines viciously.

      Irene swings aside, just misses it.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

      Gets a free haircut.

      Then Holmes is under her, lifting her high so that she
      can free her right hand (a move not possible with both
      shackles).

      Irene unhooks herself, falls forward, taking Holmes with
      her. They plummet downwards OUT OF FRAME.

      Watson sprints towards where they fell, looks down --

      -- sees them lying on a carpet of scorched, boiled, cut-
      in-half pig carcasses. They're okay.

      Watson shakes his head, turns, heads for the door,
      looking for Blackwood.

      Irene gives Holmes a sweet, grateful smile --

                              IRENE
                Thank you so much. I owe you.

      -- pulls a knife, gets up, heads after Watson.    Holmes
      grabs her, stops her.

                              HOLMES
                You owe me information.
                     (angry)
                No more games, Irene.

      She hears Watson opening the door to the dock. She looks
      at Holmes, their eyes locking. Finally, the truth:

                              IRENE
                Blackwood's manufactured large-
                scale weapons for years. Lately
                there've been rumors of something
                new. More powerful than anything
                else. And... magical. My job is
                to find out if the rumors are
                true.

                I would say they are.

      And she's off, running toward the door. Holmes trails
      her, processing. They blast through the doors to --


91    EXT. NINE ELMS JETTY                                            91

      Watson runs out of doors and towards the end of the dock.
      He sees: Blackwood and the boat are disappearing into
      the darkness.

      Holmes and Irene run out of the doors following Watson.
      Holmes slows, looking around the dock, seeing something
      on the planks:

      Steel drums are dripping.    A chemical.   Holmes recognizes
      it.

                                HOLMES
                Watson!

      Watson continues down the dock, tripping a wire connected
      to the steel drums, he turns realizing he has set off a
      trap and turns back to warn the others --

                                WATSON
                Holmes...

      A metallic conductor SPARKS.    Time slows.   BOOM!

      The drums of chemicals all EXPLODE! A blinding
      conflagration engulfing Watson. For a moment, it lights
      up all of London.

                              HOLMES
                WAATTTSSSSSONNN!!!!

      Holmes is pushed back   by the explosion as the rest of the
      barrels that line the   dock begin exploding arond them --
      it looks as it Watson   hasn't survived. BOOM! Irene is
      knocked to the ground   by the blasts and flying debris.

      Holmes races towards her as more explosions, flames and
      debris fly all around him in slow motion, occasionally
      knocking him to the ground.

      He reaches Irene, picks her up and grabs part of an
      exploded barrel to shield the two as they run for cover --
      BOOM! The barrel splinters as a final blast knocks them
      down, but to safety.

      As he opens his eyes --

     We see Lestrade and his men swarming the scene, they spot
     Watson, alive, but unconscious. Irene has disappeared.
     Holmes sees this and heads toward his friend, but --

     -- is intercepted by Constable Clark.

                             CONSTABLE CLARK
               There's an order for your arrest
               all the way from the top, sir --
               so you'll have to hit me now.

                             HOLMES
               From Lord Coward?

                             CONSTABLE CLARK
               Yes, sir, so make it look good.

                             HOLMES
               Thank you, Clarky.

     Holmes cracks Constable Clark in the sweet spot, helps
     him gently to his knees. Holmes turns away, makes his
     escape fast.

     Holmes turns back to look at the explosion.

     Two POLICEMEN half-heartedly guard the end of a corridor.
     One reads the paper. The headline: "AMERICAN AMBASSADOR

     Mary returns past them, having unsuccessfully washed away
     tear-stained makeup; there is a smear on her cheek. The
     two coppers nod respectfully.
     Mary arrives at the windowed door of a private room,
     reaches for the handle, pauses.

     THROUGH THE GLASS, she sees a white-coated DOCTOR,
     studying Watson's chart.

     Mary stays at the door, unsure whether to enter or not.

     The doctor injects Watson in the arm. The shot wakes
     him. Watson tries to sit up, wincing with pain.

                             WATSON
               What are you administering?

               Morphia. A sixth of a grain, for
               the pain.

     Watson looks at his wounded shoulder.

                             DOCTOR
               There are four pieces of shrapnel.
               The surgeon should be along
               shortly.

     Watson tries to sit up again.

     This reveals that Mary has entered the room, stands back
     respectfully, letting the Doctor do his work.

                             WATSON
               Are they subcutaneous, or deeper?

                             DOCTOR
               They're near the carotid artery.

               Get a mirror, I'll extract them
               myself.

               I can't authorize that, Doctor.
               We must first manage the pain and
               combat the infection.

                             WATSON
               I haven't time for that.   My

       ESTABLISHING SHOT of London, possibly the bustle of Fleet
       Street during the morning rush hour. A train crosses on
       an overhead railway.

       We PUSH IN UNDER the railway arch until we can make out a
       splash of white in the shadows -- the Doctor from the
       hospital is slumped down against the wall.

       We PUSH IN ALL THE WAY, so that we CAN SEE that the
       Doctor is actually Holmes.

       There is something grotesque about his face, he hasn't
       completely removed his disguise. Parts of it hang down,
       obscuring him --

       -- but not obscuring the light of instability in his
       eyes. They begin to overflow with tears. He brushes
       them away then looks at his wet hand, horrified.

       Holmes enters, disturbed, pained.   Emotions swirling.

       He pulls out a newspaper with the story of Standish's
       death, the pages and strange sacrificial offerings (bone,
       hair, feather, fang) from Sir Thomas' house.

       Gathering himself, Holmes stands in the middle of the
       bare room and starts to lay out the clues he has on the
       floor. The Ox bone directly in front of him (at 12
       o'clock). The eagle feather to his right (at 3 o'clock).
       The human hair behind him (at 6 o'clock) and the Lion's
       fang to his left (at 9 o'clock).

       Then with a piece of charcoal Holmes draws a circle
       around each image and a circle directly in the center of
       the four other circles. He then draws lines which join
       the circles together in the shape of a cross.

       In the center circle he draws a pentagram (using wax from
       a burning candle?). Then he pours a ring of salt around
       that circle.

       He lights four candles (one at each point of the cross)
       then stands in the center of the circle.

       He pulls a pocket knife from his coat, opens the blade,
       cuts his thumb and allows the drops of blood to drip onto
       the ground just outside the circle.

     Then he begins to chant. The words are eerily
     reminiscent of Blackwood's chanting.

     Suddenly one of the drops of blood bursts into flame in
     mid-air -- as it hits the ground, the circle around
     Holmes ignites, followed by a larger circle beyond that.

                             BLACKWOOD (O.S.)
               And now it dawns on you, you begin
               to recognize your part in his
               play.

     Holmes snaps around, Blackwood has appeared behind him
     within the outer circle of flame.

                             BLACKWOOD
               You see the path he chose for you.

     Holmes sways, fuzzy.   He struggles to focus on Blackwood.

                 Didn't you wonder why it was so
                 easy to catch me? I told you I
                 needed five lives for my
                 resurrection. Why would I take a
                 sixth under St. Paul's?

     Holmes shakes his head, he can barely see straight.

                               BLACKWOOD
                 Unless I simply wanted to be
                 caught by the great Sherlock
                 Holmes...

     Blackwood raises a sacrificial sword and swings at
     Holmes' head.

                 ... so I could die on the biggest
                 stage of all. You made me what I

     We see --

     as Blackwood swings the sacrificial sword at Holmes'
     head. It looks as if Holmes has no time to react --

     WHOOSH -- the sword WIPES the FRAME --

     The sun is rising.   Holmes' eyes open and we see:

     WATSON -- or some deathly version of his old friend -- is
     sitting in the chair where Blackwood appeared.

                              HOLMES
                     (confused)
                Watson...?

     Watson leans closer, into the light. A ghost or a man?
     He gestures towards the diagram on the floor.

                              WATSON
                Interesting artwork.   You look
                bloody awful.

     He writes something in his notebook. He is decidedly
     alive, but with burn flashes, cuts and bruises. His arm
     is in a sling. He's been through it.

     In the b.g. Irene is at the fire heating some coffee.

                              HOLMES
                What about the shrapnel in your
                arm?

     Watson shows him a piece of shrapnel --

                              WATSON
                Took it out myself. Mary said I
                had a lousy doctor.

                              WATSON
                Yes, oddly, it seems she might
                understand the power of
                partnership.

     They both look back over to Irene who just finished
     loading her gun. The coffee seems ready so she pours a
     cup.

     Irene walks over and hands Holmes the cup.

               Thank you. You know, I dreamt
               that you were strangling me.

               out to settle down.

     Watson and Irene sit at a table, the SCREECH of a fiddle
     now comes from upstairs.

     The fiddler's owner -- from the pub's band -- is busy
     getting drunk with the money he has acquired.

     Irene arrives with two pints, puts one down in front of
     him, sits opposite him with the other.

     Watson looks from Irene to the pint with open suspicion.
     Could it be poisoned? He wouldn't put it past her. But
     then he decides that's absurd. He takes a sip.

               Oh, I poisoned that one.

      it, he strums it, he makes strange atonal sounds, as he
      STARES AT THE RITUAL PATTERN he's laid out on the floor.

      Flashes to various images of the sphinx that he's
      observed over the course of the investigation.

      He stands up and draws a sphinx in charcoal on the floor.
      Then he moves to the ox bone -- a flash of Sir Thomas'
      ring with the Ox crest. He draws an ox in charcoal.
      Next to the ox bone Holmes writes -- Sir Thomas -- OX
      ring.

      Next, he moves to the feather -- a flash to an Eagle in
      flight -- he quickly sketches an eagle. Then to an
      American flag, then to Standish with his eagle-topped
      cane. Next to the feather he writes America.

      Then he moves to the hair. He draws a man's face. Flash
      to Reordon's red hair. Next to it Holmes writes Man.

      Then he moves to a Lion fang. He sketches out a lion --
      he thinks -- BUT no flashes. Next to it he writes a big
      question mark. Where? Who?

      Holmes returns to his violin. Staring at the Lion fang
      as if willing the flashes to come.

      Holmes is excited, electric.

                              HOLMES
                Now that you're sitting
                comfortably, I shall begin. My
                initial approach was far too
                narrow. When Blackwood invited me
                to Pentonville prison, he
                suggested I widen my gaze and, at
                minimum, I have done just that.
                In fact, I may well have
                reconciled thousands of years of
                theological disparity. But that's
                for another time. Blackwood's
                method is based on a ritualistic
                mystical system that has been
                employed by The Temple of the Four
                Orders for centuries. To fully
                understand this system, to get
                inside it, I re-enacted the
                ceremony we interrupted in the
                crypt... with a few enhancements
                of my own.

                But I have emerged enlightened...
                The fraternity who silently
                control the Empire, share the
                belief with the Kings, Pharoahs,
                and Emperors of old that the
                Sphinx was a door to another
                dimension, a gateway to
                immeasurable power --

      He points out the individual parts of the Sphinx,
      covering other parts with his hand. We see the Ox body,
      Lion paws, Eagle wings, Man's face.

                              HOLMES
                In Sir Thomas' secret chamber I
                found the bone of an ox, the tooth
                of a lion, the feather of an
                eagle, the hair of a man. Map!

      Watson throws the map down on the floor, really flying
      now.

                              HOLMES
                Now, it is a widely held belief
                that within the architecture of
                the great cities are coded
                references to this system.

      He runs his finger over the map tracing the shape of a
      cross...

      Then he picks up the charcoal and (following the map)
      draws a serpentine curve of the River Thames straight
      through the middle of the cross that he drew on the
      floor.

                              HOLMES
                Since he rose from the grave,
                Blackwood has killed three men.
                Each murder was committed at a
                location that has a direct
                connection with the Temple,
                therefore the System.
                     (beat)
                Reordon, the ginger midget,
                represents Man. We found his body
                here...

      He points to a spot on the map south of the Thames. It
      corresponds to the point on the cross that Holmes drew
      that has the hair (6 o'clock).

                              HOLMES
                Then Sir Thomas, Master of the
                Temple, wore the ox ring... he
                died here...

      Again the spot Holmes points is directly north of the
      river and corresponds to the point on the cross that has
      the ox bone (12 o'clock).

                Standish was Ambassador to
                America, where the Eagle has been
                the national emblem for over a
                hundred years -- and not by
                coincidence.

      Holmes points to the map.

                              HOLMES
                The headquarters of Temple of the
                Four Orders where he died is
                here...

      He points to corresponding points on the map and on the
      cross.

                              WATSON
                Man, Ox, Eagle...

      He connects the dots on the map.   They form three points
      of a cross.

                              WATSON
                And last on the list:    the Lion.
      Holmes scribbles on a piece of paper. Watson and Irene
      step closer looking at the lion's fang and then the
      map...

                              HOLMES
                Correspondingly, the map will tell
                us the location of Blackwood's
                final act. Right here.

      Their eyes widen as they realize what they're seeing.

                What is the meaning of this
                circle?

      Irene indicates the fifth circle Holmes has drawn -- the
      point at which the other four come together. They look
      to where it would correspond to on the map -- right in
      the middle of the river.

                              HOLMES
                It is the fifth element -- the
                ethereal. That which can't yet be
                known.

                 It's right in the middle of the
                 River Thames.

       BOOM! They hear doors slamming outside, boots echoing.
       Irene looks out the window, sees POLICE OFFICERS flooding
       the pub.

                                 IRENE
                 Police.

       Holmes folds up his piece of paper, hands it to Watson.
       He quickly moves to a hatch in the floor. Flings it
       open.

                                 HOLMES
                 Ladies first.

       Irene jumps down.   Watson is about to follow her down.

                               HOLMES
                 Follow these plans.

       Watson goes down. It looks as though Holmes is about to
       join them when Lestrade and his men burst into the room.
       Holmes kicks the hatch closed and steps towards Lestrade.

102A                                                               102A
       INT. PUNCH BOWL PUB - HALL
       Holmes races down the hall toward the back door, but the
       door EXPLODES inward. Police fill the hall. Holmes
       looks back, where more police block his path. He simply
       raises his arms, and they drag him away.

103    INT. POLICE CARRIAGE - MID-MORNING (LATER)                   103

       Holmes sits battered, cuffed and bruised, though we can
       see from his face that his spirits are unaffected by his
       physical state. Tough-looking cops sit either side of
       him, Lestrade sits opposite, shaking his head -- he can't
       believe it's come to this. He looks at Holmes.


104    EXT. HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT                                    104

       PULL BACK FROM an image of a GOLDEN LION on a banner.
       We're at the Houses of Parliament.

      The carriage pulls up. Crowds are gathering outside,
      hawkers and tourists, plenty of flags and enthusiasm.
      Holmes sees the hands of BIG BEN, climbing toward noon.


105   INT. HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT                                    105

      The place is a hive of activity, preparing for pomp and
      circumstance, at its ceremonial best.

      All of which is in stark contrast to the battered figure
      of Holmes, who is marched through a series of doors and
      checkpoints along the corridors of power by an angry-
      looking Lestrade. They come to a door. Lestrade knocks.


106   INT. PARLIAMENT - LORD COWARD'S CHAMBERS                     106

      The door is opened by Lord Coward, who's halfway through
      putting on his official robes, and caught off guard by
      the sight of Holmes cuffed (hands behind him) and flanked
      by Lestrade and men.

                                 LORD COWARD
                Lestrade?

                              LESTRADE
                Begging your pardon, m'lord, I
                know it's unorthodox, but Mr.
                Holmes has been making serious
                accusations about you and the
                order, sir.

      Lestrade pulls his lapel, revealing a temple of four
      orders pin.

                              HOLMES
                Oh, that solves the great mystery
                as to how you became inspector.

      Lestrade punches Holmes.

                              LORD COWARD
                I have five minutes before my next
                engagement, why don't you regale
                me with your stories of
                conspiracies. Thank you,
                Lestrade, if you could wait
                outside.

      Lestrade leaves and shuts the door.

                              HOLMES
                I'm curious, Coward, did you
                assist Blackwood in all the
                murders or just the one I
                prevented? Very distinctive those
                hand-made shoes of yours, but the
                price of quality is the unique
                imprint they leave.

      Coward walks towards his desk at one end of the room.
      Holmes goes to warm himself by the fire at the other end.

                               HOLMES
                Nonetheless, I confess to being
                completely out-matched. I could
                deduce very little from my
                investigation.

      Coward turns away for a moment -- Holmes subtly kicks a
      log from the fire, it starts to smolder and fill the room
      with smoke.

                              HOLMES
                Fortunately, there is nothing more
                stimulating than a case where
                everything goes against you. How
                many members of parliament do you
                intend to murder at noon today?
                     (beat)
                Man, ox, eagle, lion -- the lion
                is parliament, isn't it?

      Lord Coward slows, looks at Holmes in some astonishment.

                              LORD COWARD
                Very clever. But it's not murder,
                Mr. Holmes. It's mercy. We are
                giving the weak masses a strong
                shepherd. Don't you see it's for
                their own good?

      Smoke fills the room so that Holmes is concealed. Coward
      pulls a gun from the desk and moves to the window. He
      opens it to try and clear the smoke.

                              HOLMES
                No, but I don't care much what you
                think. I simply wanted to know
                the location of Blackwood's final
                ceremony, and now you have given
                it to me.

                              LORD COWARD
                I have told you nothing.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

      feet. He looks up and Holmes is nowhere to be found.
      Coward quickly moves across the room to lock the door.

                where you have been standing.

      Coward, Blackwood, and the Temple members perform a
      ritual around a pentagram in the SEWERS. The big
      ceremonial sword is prominent.

                              LORD COWARD (V.O.)
                It's a shame you made an enemy out
                of Blackwood, Holmes, you would
                have made a valuable ally. The
                powers at our disposal are far
                greater than you can imagine.

                              HOLMES (V.O.)
                You and Blackwood laid the final
                touches to your ceremony in the

                How terrible is wisdom, Holmes,
                when it brings no profit to the
                wise.
                      (turning to Holmes)
                We take power at noon.

      REVEAL Holmes sitting in a chair behind Coward.

                Well there's no time to waste
                then, is there?

      Coward spins around and shoots at Holmes. He misses.
      Holmes runs towards the open window as Coward fires
      another shot.

      With a single bound, Holmes leaps out of the window
      Coward opened.

      Coward runs to the window and sees Holmes DIVING toward
      the river Thames, PLUMMETING down down down to --

      EXT. THAMES - OUTSIDE PARLIAMENT
      SPLASH! Holmes dives into the river handcuffed. He
      disappears for a moment then surfaces, looks about in the
      water. A moment of concern until we hear the familiar
      "chug" of a struggling engine.

      Holmes looks in the water and sees a rope trailing on the
      surface. He grabs it with his hands. And... it pulls
      him closer to the rickety boat of Captain Tanner.

      Watson stands on the rear deck, pulling Holmes in on the
      rope. Irene is also present.

      When Holmes is level, Watson leans over and clips off his
      cuffs using bolt cutters. Clearly the whole escape has
      been planned. Holmes is pulled up into the boat.

                              TANNER
                     (to Watson)
                I told you he'd be coming out the
                top window, soldier boy. No way
                he'd be coming over the terrace.

      Watson hands over the change from the engagement ring.
      Tanner takes it happily.

                              WATSON
                How was Lestrade?

                              HOLMES
                Performed his role perfectly.   A
                little too perfectly, come to
                think of it.

      Watson has the PAPER that Holmes gave him in the attic.

                              WATSON
                Well, your instructions were
                fairly precise... about everything
                except the window.

      Tanner smiles, still pleased with himself.

                              IRENE
                Where to, Sherlock?

      Holmes points to a dark recess in the embankment.

                              HOLMES
                Port side, Captain Tanner, into
                the sewers.

      Tanner turns the boat.   Irene looks out, her eyes narrow.

                              HOLMES
                Watson, did you bring my clothes?

      Watson hands over a pile of clothes and Holmes' PISTOL.
      Holmes opens the drum, checks the load, grimaces, pockets
      it. He's never going to like guns.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

       Then Holmes reaches inside a pocket of clothes he is
       still wearing, and pulls out the hip FLASK that he took
       from the men at the slaughterhouse. He takes a shot.

                                IRENE
                  Starting early, aren't we?

       He offers the flask to her.

                                HOLMES
                  Trust me, have a drink.

       She can see this is more than a social invitation, she
       takes a hit, pulls a face. Holmes nods towards Watson,
       Irene passes him the bottle. He drinks, grimaces, hands
       it on to Tanner, who swallows it without flinching, wipes
       his mouth, smiles. The boat is almost at the sewers.

                                WATSON
                  What are we doing in the sewers?

                                HOLMES
                  Patience, Doctor. I am about to
                  show you...

       As they head toward the sewers, Holmes glances up toward
       Big Ben, the time moving toward noon.

107A                                                               107A

       Tanner's boat, unlit, floats at the opening to the
       tunnel, on the edge of the darkness.

                                TANNER
                  Far as I can go.

       Holmes and Watson leap off the boat into the mouth of the
       sewer. Irene follows. (Watson has his SWORD STICK and a
       GUN, Holmes has changed into the clothes Watson brought
       for him.)

       They move through the shadowy sewer tunnels, working
       their way around corners and through junctions back under
       the Houses of Parliament.

      Holmes ducks around a corner, stops. Irene and Watson
      flank him, standing in shadows. They look down a long
      tunnel to:

      The area where Coward and Blackwood were seen in the
      flashback ceremony with the sword. But now:

      Blackwood's THUGS patrol the area. In the center, the
      pentagram remains. But there is something sitting in it,
      a futuristic device:

                              HOLMES
                Behold, Blackwood's magic.

      A black glass cylinder is housed in a metal cradle with
      electrodes on either side. It sits below a shattered
      ceiling, bricks dismantled, exposing a VENTILATION PIPE.
      Holmes looks back at Watson and Irene. Quiet:

                              HOLMES
                A chemical weapon. The first of
                its kind. Cyanide, to be precise.

                              WATSON
                You can tell that from here?

                               HOLMES
                No.   I can tell it from here.
      He pulls something out of his pocket:    the RAT TAIL.

                              HOLMES
                I snipped this off a rather
                recumbent rat at the
                slaughterhouse. Note the blue
                discoloration, the faint smell of
                bitter almonds. Tell-tale signs
                of cyanide.

      He points at the device and the exposed shaft over it.

                              HOLMES
                That shaft leads directly to
                Parliament. When activated, those
                electrodes on either side will
                send a charge converting the
                cyanide powder into a gas.

                              IRENE
                All of the people inside that
                building --

                              WATSON

                 As if by magic. There will be no
                 one left to stop Blackwood and his
                 followers from assuming control.

       The CAMERA MOVES THROUGH the shattered ceiling, UP a
       channel, DOWN a bend, all the way through a GRATE TO --


110A   INT. PARLIAMENT - DAY                                        110A

       Air blows UP through the grate. The chamber is now full
       of Lords and senior Royals. As they start to take seats,
       Lord Coward steps up, checks the crowd. He sees a shadow
       up in the Lords' Gallery.

111                                                                  111

       Holmes checks his watch.

                               HOLMES
                 Seven minutes to twelve...

       They nod. Shoulder-to-shoulder, they move down the
       tunnel, faster and faster.

       Irene trails them closely.

       Watson slides his sword stick into a loop on his belt.
       It's there when he needs it, out of the way otherwise.

       They draw their guns.
       They burst into the area, completely surprising the three
       thugs.

       Watson pistol-whips the nearest.    Holmes front-kicks the
       next.

       The third thug looks down the barrels of both their guns
       before he has a chance to fight or flee.

                                  HOLMES
                 I wouldn't.

       He doesn't. Irene comes in behind them and heads
       straight for the device.

                               WATSON
                 I'll keep these under wraps.

                              HOLMES
                Take this.

      Holmes hands Watson his gun. Gun in each hand, Watson
      herds the three thugs away from the device.

                              WATSON
                Over there.

      Sullen, but without much resistance, they move away (two
      dragging the pistol-whipped one, who is out). Watson
      turns so that he can watch the action at the device --

      -- which puts his back to another tunnel.

      Holmes joins Irene at the device. She grips her knife,
      looking for a way to detach the CYLINDER from the CRADLE
      (where electric coils and circuits pulse).

                              IRENE
                I've never seen anything like it.

                              HOLMES
                There's never been anything like
                it. A totally wire-free weapon.
                He must have some kind of remote
                device sending a signal to the
                receiver. Really quite --

      She reaches out with her knife and... ZAP! Her blade
      hits a coil, sparks flashing. Electrocuted, she drops
      the knife, which falls into the cradle, surrounded by
      humming, sparking coils.

      Irene recoils, sees something past Holmes --
      RACK PAST HOLMES TO WATSON --

      Where DREDGER LOOMS OUT OF THE DARK BEHIND HIM, both
      hands held high to grab the guns and smash Watson.

      Before Irene can alert him, Watson's wrists are crushed
      from behind. Dredger jerks Watson's arms sideways,
      sending both guns spinning away --

      -- Holmes's gun splashes into the sewer.

      Dredger spins Watson around, head-butts him with a teeth-
      rattling blow, flings Watson away like a discarded paper
      cup.

      Now unguarded, the two conscious thugs charge Holmes and
      Irene.

      Holmes goes for Dredger.


113   INT. PARLIAMENT - DAY                                       113

      Lords and Royals sit in this august hall, waiting for the
      session to begin. Coward looks up, and points, very
      emphatically.

                                 LORD COWARD
                Look.

      All eyes rise to see: BLACKWOOD, up in the Lords'
      Gallery. The hall goes silent, staring at a ghost.
      Blackwood is calm, commanding.

      Voices rise; Blackwood's followers move to block the
      doors as --

      BONG! The first CHIME OF NOON from Big Ben.

114                                                               114
      INT. SEWERS - DAY
      The chime echoes. Dredger charges towards the device and
      Irene. Holmes flies into him feet-first, deflecting him
      for a moment.

      It is now clear that Dredger's sole purpose is to protect
      the device.

      Irene sits at the device, trying to figure out how to
      defuse it.

      BONG!

      The second chime resounds. Dredger grabs Holmes, thrusts
      him upwards against the sewer roof, simultaneously
      strangling him and hammering him against the bricks hard
      enough to dislodge some.

      Holmes lashes out with his feet at Dredger -- who doesn't
      even bother to block anything. Holmes' kicks lose steam
      as he loses air.

      BONG!

                 Nine strokes left.

      Dredger grins --

      -- until he is earholed from behind by two bricks, swung
      with full force by Watson.

      Dredger drops Holmes, staggers back holding his bleeding
      ears. Holmes heads back to Irene.

      Watson draws the sword from his sword stick.   Deadly
      enough, but not very big.

                               WATSON
                 You owe me for the ring.

      Dredger backs off, as if scared of the sword -- but only
      until he can reach up and pull Blackwood's ceremonial
      sword down off a brick ledge. This is going to be more
      uneven than usual.

      BONG!

      As Watson parries Dredger's massive slashes and thrusts
      all around them, only just keeping Dredger at bay --

      -- Holmes sees that the cylinder is welded onto the
      cradle by two RODS. His eyes narrow, a plan forming.

                               HOLMES
                 Give me your gun. The bullets, I
                 need the bullets.

      BONG!   The clock is ticking down.

      Irene pops open her Derringer, slides the bullets into
      Holmes' hand. He chops open the bullet casings with his
      knife, pouring the gunpowder into --

      -- the bowl of his pipe.

      BONG!

      Watson ducks a whooshing cut, lunges with his little
      sword, sticks it into the meat of Dredger's bicep.

      Dredger grunts angrily, flexes his bicep, rips the sword
      out of Watson's grasp with his muscle, then he pulls it
      out, snaps the blade against the wall like a twig, and
      moves in to cut Watson in two with the ceremonial sword
      from head to toe.

      Watson dives desperately, gets a haircut from the sword --

       -- which shatters against the floor.

       While Watson is down, Dredger punts him into the sewer
       with a splash, then turns back to the device.

       BONG!

       Blackwood has lit four small red candles, placed them on
       the balustrade in front of him. He calmly intones a
       familiar chant. Lords are on their feet. Guards are
       banging outside the doors, but the doors are locked.
       Members of the Temple of Four Orders stand in front of
       anyone going to open them.

       Holmes rips the stem off his pipe, places the open end of
       the bowl against the bolt holding the cylinders in place.
       Shaped charge, Victorian-style.

                               HOLMES
                 We need a light, a match --

       Irene's eyes narrow, seeing something in the cradle:   her
       KNIFE. She rolls up a sleeve.

                 Got it...
       Which is when a blood-maddened Dredger thunders into them
       both, arms wide, driving Holmes and Irene away from the
       device --

       -- hammering them into the wall with a mighty thud. Then
       he braces his massive feet, angles his huge legs and
       pushes, squeezes them against the wall like a human vice.

       That's the extent of Dredger's plan, and it will work for
       long enough because --

       The batteries begin to fizz madly, cams turn, gears
       ratchet past each other. Bad news.

                 Hey!

       Dredger turns his head so that he can see Watson, on his
       belly, crawled from the sewer -- where he found HOLMES'
       GUN.

       BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! Four white phosphorous tracers
       strobe through the sewer, stitch a line down Dredger's
       back (aimed so as not to hit Holmes or Irene on the
       through-and-through) --

       -- and continue to burn inside Dredger. He lurches away,
       eyes bulging, mouth wide with a silent scream.

       BONG!

                               IRENE

       Holmes and Irene stagger for the device.

       Fizzling, boiling inside, the dying giant falls like a
       tree.

       Watson is face-down on the stones, still.   The gun falls
       out of his limp hand.

       Irene swipes her hand down into the cradle, just barely
       avoiding the sparks and coils, snatching her blade,
       and...

       ZAP! A spark hits the blade, and she angles the blade,
       redirecting the spark toward --

       Holmes' pipe, which BLOWS WITH A VICIOUS CRACK!   The
       shaped charge shears the steel rods.

       Holmes and Irene reach for the cylinders.

       BONG!

                 You seem surprised. Did you                                
                 really take me for a man who could                         
                 be dispatched like a truculent                             
                 servant? I see before me a                                 
                 conspiracy of arrogant old men                             
                 puffed up by the illusion of their                         
                 own vainglory. In your hands this                          
                 once great parliament has become                           
                 nothing more than a drunken satyr,

       wall to complete the pentagram within the circle.

       ZZZZP! The electrical charge zaps through the device,

       Holmes and Irene RIP the cylinder out of the way just
       as... the sparks collide in a blinding flash and...

       The men wait for something mythic, magical.    And...

       Nothing happens. Nothing at all. They look around.
       Everyone is still standing. Coward looks confused,
       scared. Other Temple members eye him.

       Blackwood hits the remote again. But again, nothing
       happens. WE SEE something new in his eyes: fear. He
       ducks away fast, disappearing into the gallery.

       Holmes and Irene look each other in the eye.   For the
       first time, neither knows what to say.

                                IRENE
                  That was something new for us.

                                   HOLMES
                  Yes... it was.

       She looks past Holmes.

       Holmes whips around -- sees Watson, seemingly dead. He
       goes to him, drops to his knees next to Watson, feels for
       a pulse.

       With his face still pressed to the stones:

                               WATSON
                 I'm pretty sure I heard the last
                 chime.

       Holmes looks down at his friend, relieved.

                               HOLMES
                 Yes, we made it. Just.

       Watson rolls over, sits up.     He's done, had enough.

                               HOLMES
                 Come on, you've got to admit,
                 you're going to miss this.

                               WATSON
                 Which part? The stench of the
                 sewers or the broken bones?
                      (beat)
                 My ankle's done.

       Watson looks around.

                 Where's Irene?

       Holmes turns, looks. The cylinders are gone, and so is
       Irene. His face darkens. He misread her yet again.

                               WATSON
                 Holmes, I'm sorry...

       Holmes sees Irene's lithe shadow moving fast into a maze
       of tunnels. He motions to the disabled device.

                               HOLMES
                 Make sure Lestrade keeps it
                 intact.

       Watson nods.   He watches Holmes sprint into the darkness,
       face grim.

       Irene hears Holmes' angry footsteps behind her, turns,
       sees a flash of movement through the labyrinth of tunnels
       and columns. She picks up speed.
                                                          CUT TO:

       ANGLE FROM THE SIDE

       Blackwood enters the maze of tunnels, hears, then sees
       Irene sprint across the maze, about 500 yards away.

       Then Holmes.

       Blackwood follows them.    Sees something on the ground
       ahead -- pauses.

       It's WATSON'S SWORD STICK, flung there from the previous
       action with Dredger.

       Blackwood scoops it up.

118C                                                              118C
       INT. SINGLE SEWER TUNNEL - DAY
       Panting, Irene runs along a tunnel that steps lower --

       -- and pinches tighter. A large-diameter water pipe
       angles down the tunnel wall, forcing Irene to turn
       sideways to continue.

       The sound of Holmes' footsteps drives her forward.

       And then the tunnel ends. The water pipe breaks off
       jaggedly in mid-air, next to Irene's head.
       The continuation of the pipe passes through solid brick
       at the end of the tunnel -- a dark, claustrophobic
       gamble. Irene hesitates for a moment, then slithers into
       the pipe, into the unknown.


118D   INT. PIPE - DAY                                            118D

       The pipe angles down, damp, horrible. For a long moment
       it is pitch black, pinched down. Irene's quick, anxious
       breath the only point of reference.

       This is as tight, subterranean, dark and nightmarishly
       claustrophobic as it gets.

       Then, almost imperceptibly, light.

       We can make out Irene's determined profile. Light
       increases, and so does Irene's rate of movement.

                                                          107.


118E   INT. CELLAR - DAY                                           118E

       The pipe emerges from the brick wall in what looks to be
       the cellar of a building. Stonework fairly new.

       Dim daylight from an unseen opening shows a fixed ladder
       heading upwards. Irene accelerates for it.


118F   INT. PIPE - DAY                                             118F

       Holmes grimaces, enters the pipe, shimmies TOWARDS us.
       An even tighter fit for him.


118G   INT. CELLAR - ON THE LADDER - DAY                           118G

       Irene -- climbing with one hand, cylinders in the other --
       reaches an iron grate, has to use all her strength to
       shoulder it aside. As fit and athletic as she is, this
       is a grind.

118H                                                               118H
       INT. HOLLOW BUILDING - DAY
       Irene emerges at the base of a dark, hollow building full
       of construction equipment, and sees, yes --

       -- more stairs, upward.   The only ready way out.

       Gritting her teeth, chest heaving, Irene charges the
       stairs --


118I   INT. CELLAR - DAY                                           118I
       -- just as Holmes pops out of the pipe, vaults onto the
       fixed ladder and swarms up it. Anger lends him energy.

       IN A SERIES OF TIME JUMPS MARKED BY INCREASING
       EXHAUSTION:

       Irene finally makes it to a floor in the building that is
       flooded with sky-bright daylight.

       She surges for light -- a brick-framed window -- and --

                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

118K   EXT. TOWER BRIDGE - HELICOPTER SHOT - REVERSE ANGLE -         118K
       DAY

       OF IRENE at the top of TOWER BRIDGE. She's climbed up
       the inside of the Tower. She's 250 feet above the
       Thames.

       We've gone straight from maximum claustrophobia to
       maximum knee-buckling exposure.

       PULL BACK and SWEEP INTO a massive, NEAR 360-DEGREE
       HELICOPTER SHOT that starts with Irene at the
       (unfinished) window --

       -- then shows the skeletal bridge spanned tenuously with
       scaffolding --

       -- then the glory of London, the center of the world,
       laid out for us in breathtaking, spectacular beauty --

       -- and returns to Irene as, recovered somewhat -- she
       darts onto the walkway scaffolding that crosses above the
       Thames.

       Irene works her way through the construction debris on
       the bridge. She makes it to the end, no further to go.

       He moves in again.   She shoots him in the arm.                    

       And in that split second --                                        

       Blackwood drops down from behind Irene, HITS her with              
       WATSON'S SWORD STICK. She drops, stunned. As she falls,            
       Blackwood plucks the cylinder out of her hand, and kicks           
       her gun away. Her gun goes flying off the side of the              
       bridge. But Irene doesn't pause:                                   

       She swings her legs through the air, trying to take out            
       Blackwood's knees. But he swipes her legs away, and                
       KICKS DOWN and --                                                  

       IRENE FALLS OFF THE BRIDGE.                                        

                               BLACKWOOD                                  
                 You're better off without her,

       High above:   a RAVEN lands.

       EXT. TOWER BRIDGE - WALKWAY - DAY
                                                                          
       A look between them and then it's on. Holmes grabs a
       short section of wooden batten out of the railing.
       Flimsy, no match for the sword --

       -- which is immediately apparent as Blackwood comes in,
       slashes, chops six inches off the batten.

                               BLACKWOOD                                  
                 I planned to kill a handful of                           
                 senile old men to make this empire                       
                 strong... but now because of you                         
                 thousands are going to die.                              

       Holmes is on the defensive throughout, but, as before,
       his target is the cylinder first, Blackwood second, self
       defense third.

                               BLACKWOOD                                  
                 All I have to do is break this                           
                 cylinder. The wind will do the                           
                 rest. And you'll be the first.                           

       The two men continue their swordfight: Holmes grabs some           
       rope hanging from the scaffolding above and swings off             
       the bridge. Blackwood steps to the edge with his sword             
       out, awaiting Holmes. Holmes swings towards the blade              
       and then pushes off the bridge once again to avoid it.             

       Holmes swings back onto the bridge a few feet away from            
       Blackwood. He lands, whips off his scarf and twirls it             
       around Blackwood's arm, binding them together. They                
       continue to spar, now bound.                                       

       Blackwood snarls, mounts a frenzied attack, which Holmes           
       simply tries to survive. The two men finally part, with            
       Holmes cast off towards the end of the bridge.                     

       Blackwood smiles. He grabs Holmes' gun (which Blackwood            
       knocked from Irene's hand earlier).                                

       Blackwood fires at Holmes. Holmes quickly ducks. The               
       bullet misses him, but hits a bucket twirling above his            
       head. A black liquid (tar) begins to pour out in a                 
       circle around him.                                                 

       Holmes turns, as if to flee (not that there's anywhere to
       go) -- his eyes lock on to something. He looks back to             
       Blackwood.                                                         

       -- Holmes kicks a huge scaffolding plank, which falls --

       -- whipping a coil of rope across the floor, hooking
       Blackwood around his ankle.

       Blackwood is DRAGGED down the walkway by the weight of
       the falling plank, pulled toward the edge.

       Holmes grabs the cylinders as Blackwood passes.                   

       Blackwood digs his fingers into a gap, screeching to a
       painful halt. His fingers are white from strain. Holmes
       remains cool.

       Holmes looks over the edge of the walkway. He sees the
       plank swinging dangerously in the storm. Blackwood
       strains desperately to hold on. As Holmes steps closer
       we INTERCUT with relevant FLASHBACKS.

       Blackwood struggles to hold on, he loses his grip for a
       second and is dragged back toward the precipice. Wind
       whips harder.

       Holmes doesn't notice: The Raven's rope SNAPS, starting
       a slow, subtle DOMINO EFFECT IN B.G.: a bucket drops,
       hits a row of standing timbers. The timbers start to
       topple.

       (NOTE: Each time one object strikes another, we hear a
       faint musical note moving up the same pentatonic scale
       that Holmes played earlier for his flies.)

       to fall. The last timber falls over the edge, lands on a
       rope. The rope yanks down a crane, the crane swings,
       strikes another crane...

                 Cut me loose, Holmes!

       Blackwood's eyes are full of fear. Holmes thoughtfully
       looks out at the angry storm, the atmosphere electric and
       dangerous. Holmes gives the slightest hint of a smile.

                               HOLMES
                 You better hope that it's nothing

       Holmes looks around at the gathering storm.
                                                                         
       Blackwood can hold on no longer. He screams as he
       releases his grip and is torn down the walkway at
       breakneck speed.

       Quick as a snake, Holmes grabs a workman's ax placed on
       the side and hurls it at his feet, cutting the rope.

       Blackwood's imminent death is brought suddenly to a halt.
       The storm grows in ferocity. Holmes bends down,
       Blackwood is on his knees, cowed.

                                HOLMES
                  First, the world will see you for                        
                  what you are. Then you will                              
                  hang... properly this time.                              

       Blackwood looks up. CRACK! The crane dislodges a METAL              
       GIRDER, which misses Holmes by inches as it crashes
       through the floorboards --

       Blackwood smirks.                                                   

                                BLACKWOOD                                  
                  We'll see about that shall we.                           
                  It's a long journey from here to                         
                  the rope.                                                

       CREAK.   Holmes looks up.    Blackwood looks up.                    

                                HOLMES                                     
                  We'll see about that shall we.                           

       BANG! The top of the crane crashes down. The wooden                 
       infrastructure supporting Blackwood falls away.                     

       Sending Blackwood falling into a lattice of HANGING
       CHAINS below. Blackwood screams as the chains begin to              
       snap off one by one. He falls farther... and farther...
       and finally --

       SNAP! The last chain CATCHES, TIGHTENS around
       Blackwood's neck, killing him instantly.

       Blackwood dangles on the rusty chain, hanged like a
       common man after all, with Tower Bridge as his gibbet.

       Holmes just stands there, stunned. He looks out to see:
       the RAVEN flying away, a silhouette against the stormy
       sky. The bird flaps its wings, disappearing into a
       cloud.

       His brow furrows. Perhaps there really are some things              
       that cannot be explained.
                                                                           
       Holmes looks over the side of the bridge, sees:

       IRENE is awkwardly splayed on the lower level. She                  
       appears to be dead, possibly a small trickle of blood is            
       coming out of her mouth. Holmes moves down to her. He               
       takes her hand.                                                     

                                   HOLMES                                  
                  Oh, Irene...                                             

       His fingers move to take her pulse.

       Her eyes pop open.                                                 

       Irene makes a quick move: she tries to CUFF him.   But             
       this time, Holmes is ready for it:                                 

       He reverses the move, cuffing her instead.   He takes a            
       seat next to her.                                                  

       They sit there for a beat, an odd lovers' moment looking           
       out over the Thames.                                               

                               IRENE                                      
                 It looks like rain.                                      

                               HOLMES                                     
                 We've still got a moment.                                

       A bit of a smile and break.                                        

                               IRENE                                      
                 You were right, he is a professor.                       
                 Moriarty. Key's in the watch                             
                 pocket.

       Holmes reaches over to grab the key. Their faces close,               
       near a kiss. Holmes drops the keys down the top of her                
       shirt (just as she dropped them down his pants). He
       snatches the DIAMOND from around her neck, turns and                  
       walks away. She smiles, calls out:

                                IRENE
                  You'll miss me, Sherlock.

                  Sadly, yes.                                                

       Holmes walks away, pauses to pick up Watson's sword                   
       stick, keeps walking.

       At the end of the top of the stairs.    Holmes hands the              
       Cylinder to one of the policemen.

       Rain falls softly.

                                LESTRADE
                  It'll be a hell of a trick if
                  Blackwood comes back from this
                  one.

                                HOLMES
                  Thank you, Lestrade.

                                LESTRADE
                  Now you're going to be even more
                  arrogant and insufferable than
                  ever.

       Then Lestrade cracks a smile.

                                LESTRADE
                  You're welcome, detective.
                       (beat)
                  Is the woman up there?

                                HOLMES
                  She won't be by the time your boys
                  get there.

       Holmes keeps moving into the night. The storm curls
       around him, the rain falling hard. And he sees...

       A shadow is waiting for him. We recognize the figure of
       WATSON. Holmes can't help but smile. He joins Watson,
       no words spoken.

       Holmes holds out Watson's sword stick. Watson takes it.
       The two of them stand looking out down the Thames.

       MOVING DAY. Mary and Watson walk towards 221B. A DRIVER
       loads Watson's boxes into a CARRIAGE that waits in front
       of the apartment.

                                 WATSON
                 One moment.

       Watson takes a quick look in one of the boxes.

                               WATSON
                 Please make sure this one is put
                 on the desk in the front room.

                               MARY
                 What's in all those notebooks?

                               WATSON
                 Nothing really... Just a few
                 scribbles... cases we've worked on
                 over the years.

                               MARY
                 All your adventures... I'd love to
                 read them sometime.

       Watson laughs then pauses for a moment to consider this
       idea before they enter.

       As Watson and Mary climb the stairs, it becomes clear                  
       that Mary now wears IRENE'S DIAMOND on her finger.
       Holmes had it made into an engagement ring.
                               WATSON
                 I still can't believe he's given
                 us that ring.

                               MARY
                 Do you think he's finally come to
                 terms with you leaving?

                                 WATSON
                 Of course.    No question about it --

       Watson opens the door of Holmes' apartment revealing a
       horrific scene: Holmes is hanging from a rope, his back

                 he's far too fond of himself.

                 Good afternoon. I was trying to                        
                 deduce the manner in which                             
                 Blackwood survived his execution.

                 were. But it had a surprisingly                        
                 soporific effect and I was carried                     
                 off in the arms of Morpheus, like

      We FOLLOW POLICEMEN heading into the sewer tunnel.

      They spread out to seal the crime scene, where Holmes had
      dismantled Blackwood's device.

                We believe Sergeant Smith was the
                first officer there.

      SERGEANT SMITH sees a POLICEMAN leaning over the device.

                              SERGEANT
                Oi, what you doing?

      The policeman looks up, and a GUN slides into his hand by
      means of the same device we saw in the carriage scene
      with Irene. We don't see his face.

                              CONSTABLE CLARK (V.O.)

                                                            CUT TO:


      FLASHBACK - THE POLICEMAN
      removes a small receiver-like object from Blackwood's
      device.


      BACK TO PRESENT

      Constable Clark nods.   Holmes pulls his coat on.

                 Moriarty was after the machine not
                 the poison.

      Holmes nods.

                               HOLMES
                 Blackwood's wire-free invention
                 was the game all along. It is
                 undoubtedly the more dangerous and
                 the more valuable of the two...
                      (wistful)
                 Irene was just a diversion.

      Mary looks at Watson who is clearly trying to curb his
      enthusiasm and interest.

      A KNOCK.   The MAN from the stairs pokes his head in.

                               MAN
                      (to Watson)
                 I've loaded the last of your
                 boxes, sir.

      Watson nods, the Driver exits.    Watson turns to Holmes.

                               WATSON
                 Well...

                               HOLMES
                 I'll walk out with you...

                                                       118.


127   EXT. 221 BAKER ST. - DAY                                      127

      Mary and Gladstone wait for Watson in the carriage.

      Holmes and Watson stand in the doorway.    A stiff beat.
      Holmes extends an awkward hand.

                              HOLMES
                An honor working with you, Doctor.

      Watson shakes Holmes' hand, puts a hand on his arm.      A
      warm look, an understanding between the two men.

                              WATSON
                Take care of yourself, Holmes.

      Watson moves to the open door of the carriage but Mary
      stops him.

                              MARY
                Try not to be too late for dinner
                with my parents and... be careful.

      She waves to Holmes as the carriage pulls away.   Watson
      looks relieved and excited.

                              HOLMES
                Magnificent woman, Watson.
                Magnificent!

      They climb into Constable Clarke's black mariah which
      pulls away down Baker St. We PULL BACK FROM the carriage
      WIDE and UP like our opening on Baker Street -- perhaps
      the POV of the raven.

                                                        FADE OUT.

                                        Ted Tally

                                  Based on the novel by

                                      Thomas Harris

                

               FADE IN:

               INT. GRUBBY HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY (DIMLY LIT)

               A woman's face BACKS INTO SHOT, her head resting against 
               grimy wallpaper. She is tense, sweaty, wide-eyed with 
               concentration. This is CLARICE STARLING, mid-20's, trim, 
               very pretty. She wears Kevlar body armor over a navy 
               windbreaker, khaki pants. Her thick hair is piled under a 
               navy baseball cap. A revolver, clutched in her right hand, 
               hovers by her ear. She raises a speedloader, in her left 
               hand, locks it into her cylinder, twists and reloads.

               CLOSE ON

               A guest room door, with a small, wired pack attached to its 
               knob. Suddenly, wish a sharp CRACK!, the knob explodes, and 
               the door bursts open.

               WITH CLARICE - MOVING SHOT

               as she runs around a corner, through a cloud of smoke. She 
               shoulders aside the shattered door and rushes inside, gun at 
               the ready in both hands...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

               CLARICE'S POV - MOVING - as she first sees, sitting on the 
               edge of a bed - a FEMALE HOSTAGE. Black, late 20's, gagged, 
               hands behind her back. Then, SWIVELLING... she sees a startled 
               MALE SUSPECT, white, mid-20's, standing by a window with a 
               rifle in his hands. He is turning towards her...

               Clarice drops into a combat crouch, gun extended, and shouts.

                                     CLARICE
                         Freeze! FBI!

               CLARICE'S POV - SLOW MOTION

               all natural SOUND suspended - as the Suspect faces her with 
               a strange, pleading expression. The rifle is rising in his 
               hands, but oddly enough, it is held across his chest, not 
               pointing. Then another puzzling detail registers...

               THE SUSPECT'S HANDS

               are taped to his gun, away from the trigger; he couldn't use 
               it even if he tried. Suddenly we hear a metallic CLICK, which 
               registers with unnatural amplification, as - Clarice reacts, 
               drops to the floor, rolling sideways, and -

               THE "HOSTAGE"

               pulls a revolver out from behind her back, still in SLOW 
               MOTION, raising it in her untied hands. She fires repeatedly, 
               flames leaping from the muzzle; the SOUND is an echoing roar 
               in these close quarters, but -

               Clarice has come up on one knee, beside an armchair, and is 
               already firing back herself, two quick SHOTS, which send -

               THE "HOSTAGE"

               pitching over the bed, backwards, to shudder and lie still 
               in a haze of gunsmoke. Clarice rushes to her, clamping one 
               knee down on her gun hand, still keeping her covered in case 
               of movement. HOLD for a few beats... then we hear the shrill 
               blast of a WHISTLE from somewhere, off screen, as normal 
               ACTION and SOUND are restored.

                                     BRIGHAM (O.S.)
                         Okay, people, good exercise...

               Clarice relaxes, lowering her gun. The lights brighten.

               PULLING BACK

               we see that we're in some sort of auditorium, with the "hotel 
               room" and its "corridor" built as a training set. JOHN BRIGHAM 
               walks onto this set, thumbing a stopwatch. Mid-40's, ex-
               Marine. His T-shirt's lettering says "Firearms Instructor / 
               FBI Academy."

                                     BRIGHAM
                         Starling's reaction time was 
                         excellent. Let's break. Critique in 
                         five.

               A class of about forty young FBI trainees, of both sexes, 
               begins to rise from their seats, mingling and chatting. 

               Clarice nods amiably to the "Suspect", then gives her 
               "Hostage" a hand up. It's ARDELIA MAPP, her roommate. Her 
               broad, clever face breaks into a big smile, as they both 
               remove ear plugs. Clarice's voice has just a soft trace of 
               southern accent.

                                     ARDELIA
                         Damn, Clarice, how'd you make me?

                                     CLARICE
                              (indicating her gun)
                         Never cock. Just squeeze.

                                     ARDELIA
                              (grins)
                         I love it when you talk dirty.

               As Brigham joins them, Clarice can't resist a star pupil's 
               little smile of pride. He frowns good-naturedly.

                                     BRIGHAM
                         What're you laughin' at, Junior G-
                         Man? She got off four rounds to your 
                         two.

               He takes out a steel-coiled grip flexer, drops it onto her 
               palm.

                                     BRIGHAM
                              (continuing)
                         One hundred reps, each hand, every 
                         day. Now tidy up, the Section Chief 
                         wants to see you.

               He nods a direction, then moves off. Clarice, with her smile 
               finally fading, looks out into the auditorium.

               SPECIAL AGENT JACK CRAWFORD

               sits on the top step of the aisle, looking down at her. He 
               is 53, strongly built. He rises impassively, exits through 
               the back door. He carries a think manila envelope under one 
               arm.

               Ardelia who is helping Clarice unbuckle her bullet-proof 
               vest, follows her worried gaze.

                                     CLARICE
                         What'd I do?

                                     ARDELIA
                         Stay cool. Just remember to call him 
                         "God."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. FBI ACADEMY GROUNDS, QUANTICO, VIRGINIA - DAY

               Crawford is watching a group of trainees on the firing range, 
               as Clarice joins him. He looks tired, haunted. Between master 
               and student, we sense a subtle, muted tug of sexuality.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Starling, Clarice M., good morning.

                                     CLARICE
                         Good morning, Mr. Crawford.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Your instructors tell me you're doing 
                         well. Top quarter of the class.

                                     CLARICE
                         I hope so. They haven't posted 
                         anything.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         A job's come up and I thought about 
                         you. Not really a job, more of - an 
                         interesting errand. Walk me to my 
                         car, Starling.

               They begin to cross the academy grounds. A group of trainees 
               jogs by, in matching sweats, following a p.e. coach.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         We're trying to interview all of the 
                         serial killers now in custody, for a 
                         psychobehavioral profile. Could be a 
                         big help in unsolved cases. Most of 
                         them have been happy to talk to us. 
                         They have a compulsion to boast, 
                         these people... Do you spook easily, 
                         Starling?

                                     CLARICE
                         Not yet.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         You see, the one we want most refuses 
                         to cooperate. I want you to go after 
                         him again today, in the asylum.

                                     CLARICE
                         Who's the subject?

                                     CRAWFORD
                         The psychiatrist - Dr. Hannibal 
                         Lecter.

               Clarice stops walking, goes very still. A beat.

                                     CLARICE
                         The cannibal...

               Crawford doesn't respond, except to study her face.

                                     CLARICE
                         Yes, well... Okay, right. I'm glad 
                         for the chance, sir, but - why me?

                                     CRAWFORD
                         You're qualified and available. And 
                         frankly, I can't spare a real agent 
                         right now.

               He walks on again, at a faster clip. She hurried to keep up.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         I don't expect him to talk to you, 
                         but I have to be able to say we 
                         tried... Lecter was a brilliant 
                         psychiatrist, and he knows all the 
                         dodges.
                              (hands her the manila 
                              envelope)
                         Dossier on him, copy of our 
                         questionnaire, special ID for you... 
                         If he won't talk, then I want straight 
                         reporting. How's he look, how's his 
                         cell look, what's he writing? The 
                         Director himself will see your report, 
                         over your own signature - if I decide 
                         it's good enough. I want that by 
                         0800 Wednesday, and keep this to 
                         yourself.

               They're reached his car. His driver stamps on a cigarette, 
               climbs in behind the wheel. BURROUGHS, his assistant, says 
               something into a walkie-talkie, then opens the back door. 
               But Crawford pulls her aside, a hand on her shoulder. His 
               intensity is scary.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Now. I want your full attention, 
                         Starling. Are you listening to me?

                                     CLARICE
                         Yes sir.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter. 
                         Dr. Chilton at the asylum will go 
                         over the physical procedures used 
                         with him. Do not deviate from them, 
                         for any reason. You tell him nothing 
                         personal, Starling. Believe me, you 
                         don't want Hannibal Lecter inside 
                         your head... Just do your job, but 
                         never forget what he is.

                              (a bit unnerved)
                         And what is that, sir?

                                     CHILTON (V.O.)
                         Oh, he's a monster. A pure 
                         psychopath...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CHILTON'S OFFICE - BALTIMORE STATE HOSPITAL FOR THE 
               CRIMINALLY INSANE - DAY

               CLOSE ON an ID card held in a male hand. Clarice's photo, 
               official-looking graphics. It calls her a "Federal 
               Investigator."

                                     CHILTON (O.S.)
                         It's so rare to capture one alive. 
                         From a research point of view, Dr. 
                         Lecter is our most prized asset...

               DR. FREDERICK CHILTON looks up from her card. A smarmy little 
               peacock, behind a vast desk; he's conceived an instant, 
               hopeless letch for Clarice. He smiles, stroking her card 
               with his beloved gold pen.

                                     CHILTON
                         You know, we get a lot of detectives 
                         here, but I must say, I can't ever 
                         remember one so attractive...

               NEW ANGLE - REVEALS CLARICE

               now wearing a more feminine skirt suit. Hair neatly coiled, 
               elegant shoulder bag, briefcase. He has rudely left her 
               standing.

                                     CHILTON
                         Will you be in Baltimore overnight...? 
                         Because this can be quite a fun town, 
                         if you have the right guide.

               Clarice tries, unsuccessfully, to hide her distaste for him.

                                     CLARICE
                         I'm sure it's a great town, Dr. 
                         Chilton, but my instructions are to 
                         talk to Lecter and report back this 
                         afternoon.

                                     CHILTON
                              (pause, sourly)
                         I see.
                              (beat)
                         Let's make this quick, then. I'm 
                         busy.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ASYLUM CORRIDOR - UPPER FLOOR - DAY

               Clarice flinches as a heavy steel gate CLANGS shut behind 
               her, the bolt shooting home. Chilton walks ahead of her.

                                     CHILTON
                         Lecter carved up nine people - that 
                         we're sure of - and cooked his 
                         favorite bits. We've tried to study 
                         him, of course - but he's much too 
                         sophisticated for the standard tests. 
                         And my, does he hate us! Thinks I'm 
                         his nemesis... Crawford's very clever, 
                         isn't he? Using you.

                                     CLARICE
                         How do you mean, Dr. Chilton?

                                     CHILTON
                         A pretty young woman, to turn him 
                         on? I don't believe Lecter's ever 
                         seen a woman in eight years. And oh, 
                         are you ever his "taste" - so to 
                         speak.

                                     CLARICE
                         I graduated magna from UVA, Doctor. 
                         It's not a charm school.

                                     CHILTON
                         Good. Then you should be able to 
                         remember the rules.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DIFFERENT CORRIDOR - LOWER FLOOR - DAY

               A darker, even grimmer area. Heavy grids over the lights. 
               Distant SLAMMINGS and faint, hoarse SHOUTS. They walk briskly.

                                     CHILTON
                         Do not reach through the bars, do 
                         not touch the bars. You pass him 
                         nothing but soft paper - no pens or 
                         pencils. No staples or paperclips in 
                         his paper. Use the sliding food 
                         carrier, no exceptions. Do not accept 
                         anything he attempts to hold out to 
                         you. Do you understand me?

                                     CLARICE
                         I understand.

                                     CHILTON
                         I'm going to show you why we insist 
                         on such precautions... On the 
                         afternoon of July 8, 1981, he 
                         complained of chest pains and was 
                         taken to the dispensary. His 
                         mouthpiece and restraints were removed 
                         for an EKG. When the nurse bent over 
                         him, he did this to her...

               He hands Clarice a small, dog-eared photo. Looking at it, 
               she is stopped in her tracks. This pleases Chilton.

                                     CHILTON
                         The doctors managed to re-set her 
                         jaw, more or less, and save one of 
                         her eyes. His pulse never got over 
                         eighty-five, even when he ate her 
                         tongue.
                              (pauses, he smiles)
                         I keep him in here.

               He turns, pushes a button. A steel door BUZZES slowly open, 
               and BARNEY - a big, impassive orderly - awaits them in an 
               anteroom. On its walls: restraints, mouthpieces, Mace, 
               tranquilizer guns.

                                     CLARICE
                              (quickly blocking him)
                         Dr. Chilton - if Lecter feels you're 
                         his enemy - as you've said - then 
                         maybe I'll have more luck by myself. 
                         What do you think?

                                     CHILTON
                              (annoyed)
                         You might have suggested that in my 
                         office, and saved me the time.

                                     CLARICE
                         But then I would've missed the 
                         pleasure of your company.

               She holds out the photo. A beat. He grabs it, jaw twitching.

                                     CHILTON
                         When she's finished, bring her out.

               He turns on his heel, goes. Barney smiles reassuringly.

                                     BARNEY
                         Hi, I'm Barney. He told you, don't 
                         get near the bars?

                                     CLARICE
                              (shaking his hand)
                         Clarice Starling. Yes, he did.

                                     BARNEY
                         Okay. Past the others, it's the last 
                         cell. Stay to the middle. I put out 
                         a chair for you.

               Sensing her tension, he indicates a nearby security monitor.

                                     BARNEY
                         I'm watching. You'll do fine.

               Clarice nods gratefully. She looks down the long corridor, 
               takes a deep breath, walks into it. He watches her go.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DR. LECTER'S CORRIDOR - DAY

               MOVING SHOT - with Clarice, as her footsteps ECHO. High to 
               her right, surveillance cameras. On her left, cells. Some 
               are padded, with narrow observation slits, others are normal, 
               barred... Shadowy occupants pacing, MUTTERING... Suddenly a 
               dark figure in the next-to-last cell hurtles towards her, 
               his face mashing grotesquely against his bars as he hisses.

                                     DARK FIGURE
                         I c-can sssmell your cunt!

               Clarice flinches momentarily, but then walks on.

               DR. LECTER'S CELL

               is coming slowly INTO VIEW... Behind its barred front wall 
               is a second barrier of stout nylon net... Sparse, bolted-
               down furniture, many softcover books and papers. On the walls, 
               extraordinarily detailed, skillful drawings, mostly European 
               cityscapes, in charcoal or crayon.

               Clarice stops, at a polite distance from his bars, clears 
               her throat.

                                     CLARICE
                         Dr. Lecter... My name is Clarice 
                         Starling. May I talk with you?

               Dr. Hannibal Lecter is lounging on his bunk, in white pajamas, 
               reading an Italian Vogue. He turns, considers her... A face 
               so long out of the sun, it seems almost leached - except for 
               the glittering eyes, and the wet red mouth. He rises smoothly, 
               crossing to stand before her; the gracious host. His voice 
               is cultured, soft.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Good morning.

               CUTTING BETWEEN THEM

               as Clarice comes a measured distance closer.

                                     CLARICE
                         Doctor, we have a hard problem in 
                         psychological profiling. I want to 
                         ask for your help with a 
                         questionnaire.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         "We" being the Behavioral Science 
                         Unit, at Quantico. You're one of 
                         Jack Crawford's, I expect.

                                     CLARICE
                         I am, yes.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         May I see your credentials?

               Clarice is surprised, but fishes her ID card from her bag, 
               holds it up for his inspection. He smiles, soothingly.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Closer, please... Clo-ser...

               She complies each time, trying to hide her fear. Dr. Lecter's 
               nostrils lift, as he gently, like an animal, tests the air. 
               Then he smiles, glancing at her card.

                                     DR. LECTER
                              (continuing)
                         That expires in one week. You're not 
                         real FBI, are you?

                                     CLARICE
                         I'm - still in training at the 
                         Academy.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?

                                     CLARICE
                         We're talking about psychology, 
                         Doctor, not the Bureau. Can you decide 
                         for yourself whether or not I'm 
                         qualified?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Mmmmm... That's rather slippery of 
                         you, Officer Starling. Sit. Please.

               She sits in the folding metal desk-chair. He waits politely 
               till she's settled, then sits down himself, faces her happily.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Now then. What did Miggs say to you?
                              (she is puzzled)
                         "Multiple Miggs," in the next cell. 
                         He hissed at you. What did he say?

                                     CLARICE
                         He said - "I can smell your cunt."

                                     DR. LECTER
                         I see. I myself cannot. You use Evyan 
                         skin cream, and sometimes you wear 
                         L'Air du Temps, but not today. You 
                         brought your best bag, though, didn't 
                         you?

                                     CLARICE
                              (beat)
                         Yes.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         It's much better than your shoes.

                                     CLARICE
                         Maybe they'll catch up.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         I have no doubt of it.

                                     CLARICE
                              (shifting uncomfortably)
                         Did you do those drawings, Doctor?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Yes. That's the Duomo, seen from the 
                         Belvedere. Do you know Florence?

                                     CLARICE
                         All that detail, just from memory...?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Memory, Officer Starling, is what I 
                         have instead of view.

               A pause, then Clarice takes the questionnaire from her case.

                                     CLARICE
                         Dr. Lecter, if you'd please consider -

                                     DR. LECTER
                         No, no, no. You were doing fine, 
                         you'd been courteous and receptive 
                         to courtesy, you'd established trust 
                         with the embarrassing truth about 
                         Miggs, and now this ham-handed segue 
                         into your questionnaire. It won't 
                         do. It's stupid and boring.

                                     CLARICE
                         I'm only asking you to look at this, 
                         Doctor. Either you will or you won't.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed 
                         if he's recruiting help from the 
                         student body. Busy hunting that new 
                         one, Buffalo Bill... Such a naughty 
                         boy! Did Crawford send you to ask 
                         for my advice on him?

                                     CLARICE
                         No, I came because we need -

                                     DR. LECTER
                         How many women has he used, our Bill?

                                     CLARICE
                         Five... so far.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         All flayed...?

                                     CLARICE
                         Partially, yes. But Doctor, that's 
                         an active case, I'm not involved. If -

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Do you know why he's called Buffalo 
                         Bill? Tell me. The newspapers won't 
                         say.

                                     CLARICE
                         I'll tell you if you'll look at this 
                         form.
                              (he considers, then 
                              nods)
                         It started as a bad joke in Kansas 
                         City Homicide. They said... this one 
                         likes to skin his humps.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Witless and misleading. Why do you 
                         think he takes their skins, Officer 
                         Starling? Thrill me with your wisdom.

                                     CLARICE
                         It excites him. Most serial killers 
                         keep some sort of trophies.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         I didn't.

                                     CLARICE
                         No. You ate yours.

               A tense beat, then a smile from him, at this small boldness.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Send that through.

               She rolls him the questionnaire, in his sliding food tray. 
               He rises, glances at it, turning a page or two disdainfully.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Oh, Officer Starling... do you think 
                         you can dissect me with this blunt 
                         little tool?

                                     CLARICE
                         No. I only hoped that your knowledge -

               Suddenly he whips the tray back at her, with a metallic CLANG 
               that makes her start. His voice remains a pleasant purr.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         You're sooo ambitious, aren't you...? 
                         You know what you look like to me, 
                         with your good bag and your cheap 
                         shoes? You look like a rube. A well-
                         scrubbed, hustling rube with a little, 
                         taste... Good nutrition has given 
                         you some length of bone, but you're 
                         not more than one generation from 
                         poor white trash, are you Officer 
                         Starling...? That accent you're trying 
                         so desperately to shed - pure West 
                         Virginia. What was your father, dear? 
                         Was he a coal miner? Did he stink of 
                         the lamp...? And oh, how quickly the 
                         boys found you! All those tedious, 
                         sticky fumblings, in the back seats 
                         of cars, while you could only dream 
                         of getting out. Getting anywhere -
                         yes? Getting all the way - to the 
                         F...B...I.

               His every word has struck her like a tiny, precise dart. But 
               she squares her jaw and won't give ground.

                                     CLARICE
                         You see a lot, Dr. Lecter. But are 
                         you strong enough to point that high-
                         powered perception at yourself? How 
                         about it...? Look at yourself and 
                         write down the truth.
                              (she slams the tray 
                              back at him)
                         Or maybe you're afraid to.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         You're a tough one, aren't you?

                                     CLARICE
                         Reasonably so. Yes.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         And you'd hate to think you were 
                         common. My, wouldn't that sting! 
                         Well you're far from common, Officer 
                         Starling. All you have is the fear 
                         of it.
                              (beat)
                         Now please excuse me. Good day.

                                     CLARICE
                         And the questionnaire...?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         A census taker once tried to test 
                         me. I ate his liver with some fava 
                         beans and a nice chianti... Fly back 
                         to school, little Starling.

               He steps backwards, then returns to his cot, becoming as 
               still and remote as a statue. Frustrated, Clarice hesitates, 
               then finally shoulders her bag and goes, leaving the 
               questionnaire in his tray. But after just a few steps, as 
               she passes -

               MIGG'S CELL

               She sees that creature at his bars again, hissing at her.

                                     MIGGS
                         I b-bit my wrist so I c-can diiiieeee! 
                         S-ee how it bleeeeeeeeds?

               The dark figure suddenly flings his palm towards her, and -

               CLARICE

               is spattered on the face and neck - not with blood, but with 
               pale droplets of semen. She gives a little cry, touching her 
               fingers to the wetness. Stunned, near tears, she forces 
               herself to straighten up and walk on, fumbling for a tissue. 
               From behind her, Dr. Lecter calls out, very agitated.

                                     DR. LECTER (O.S.)
                         Officer Starling... Officer Starling!

               Clarice slows, stops. She shudders, but makes the very 
               difficult choice to turn, walk back, stand again in front of -

               DR. LECTER

               Who's shivering with rage. For an instant his face opens, 
               and we catch a glimpse into hell itself. Then he's composed 
               again.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         I would not have had that happen to 
                         you. Discourtesy is - unspeakably 
                         ugly to me.

                                     CLARICE
                         Then please - do this test for me.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         No. But I will make you happy... 
                         I'll give you a chance for what you 
                         love most, Clarice Starling.

                                     CLARICE
                         What's that, Dr. Lecter?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Advancement, of course.
                              (beat)
                         Go to Split City. See Miss Mofet, an 
                         old patient of mine. M-O-F-E-T... 
                         Now go. Go.
                              (a smile)
                         I don't think Miggs could manage 
                         again so soon, even if he is crazy - 
                         do you?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE HOSPITAL - PARKING LOT - DAY

               The grim gothic pile of the asylum looms overhead as Clarice 
               rushes out the front doors. She is badly shaken, almost 
               stumbling, as she rubs at her face. She looks around for, 
               and finally, with some relief, spots -

               HER CAR

               an old Pinto, parked nearby. This image begins to BLUR...

               CLOSE ON

               her face, fighting tears, as the CAMERA begins to WHIRL AROUND 
               her, almost dizzily. She is seeing, in her mind's eye -

               IN FLASHBACK

               a screen door banging open, on a wooden porch, and a 10-year 
               old girl - the young Clarice - rushing outside, down the 
               front steps, and running joyfully across her front yard to -

               MOVING ANGLE - THE GIRL'S POV

               a car - late 60's vintage - parked in the dirt road. A MAN, 
               Clarice's father, is just climbing out. He's tall, handsome, 
               and has a marshal's badge pinned on his dark suit. He grins, 
               seeing her, and spreads his arms wide as...

               THE YOUNG CLARICE

               rushes into them, and he sweeps her up in a hug, spinning 
               her around, the CAMERA SPINNING with them, and capturing 
               both their laughing faces, before we abruptly return to -

               THE ADULT CLARICE

               alone in the parking lot, sagging against her car. Her face 
               is buried in her arms, she shoulders shaking. SOUND UPCUT - 
               a steady, rapid series of GUNSHOTS, as we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FBI ACADEMY FIRING RANGE - DAY

               Clarice, in a combat stance, and wearing a sound-muffling 
               headset, is squeezing off ROUND after ROUND at

               A MOVING TARGET

               The silhouette of a man, approaching along a track. Her shots, 
               tightly grouped, are all finding the center chest. The target 
               stops, quite close to her, still swaying.

               Clarice stares at it, deftly working her speedloader. Then 
               she puts a final, emphatic shot right through THE FIGURE'S 
               FOREHEAD.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FBI ACADEMY LIBRARY - NIGHT

               CLOSE ON a microfilm monitor - a grainy newsphoto of Dr. 
               Lecter, scrawling past, with an accompanying story ("New 
               Horrors in Cannibal Trial"), dated 1980.

               Clarice is punching keys on the terminal. Other trainees 
               study at nearby tables.

               She pauses, jotting a note on her pad, as Ardelia comes by, 
               carrying an armful of books.

                                     ARDELIA
                         Phone call, Clarice. It's God.

                                     CLARICE
                         Thanks, Ardelia.

               MOVING ANGLE

               as Clarice rises, grabbing her notebook, and follows Ardelia 
               past high metal bookstacks.

                                     ARDELIA
                         You missed Fourth Amendment law. 
                         Unlawful seizure, real juicy stuff. 
                         Where were you all afternoon?

                                     CLARICE
                         Pleading with a crazy man, with come 
                         all over my face.

               Ardelia stares at her, figures it's a put-on, laughs.

                                     ARDELIA
                         Damn. Wish I had time for a social 
                         life.

               Clarice grins, as Ardelia indicates a phone receiver resting 
               on the check-out desk, then moves on. Clarice picks it up.

                                     CLARICE
                              (on phone)
                         Mr. Crawford?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CRAWFORD'S HOUSE - STUDY - NIGHT

               Crawford, in a cardigan, sits in a wing chair in the book- 
               lined study of his suburban home. He turns the pages of 
               Clarice's memo as they talk. His tone is sharp.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         I've read your interim memo on Lecter. 
                         You sure you've left nothing out?

               INTERCUTTING

                                     CLARICE
                         It's all there, sir, practically 
                         verbatim.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Every word, Starling? Every gesture?

                                     CLARICE
                              (a bit heatedly)
                         Right down to the kleenex I used.
                              (he is silent)
                         Sir, why? Is something wrong?

                                     CRAWFORD
                         He mentioned a name, at the very 
                         end. "Mofet..." Any followup on her?

                                     CLARICE
                         I spent all evening on the mainframe. 
                         Lecter altered or destroyed most of 
                         his patient histories, prior to 
                         capture. No record of anyone named 
                         Mofet. But "Split City" sounded like 
                         it might have have something to do 
                         with divorce. I tracked it down in 
                         the library's catalogue of national 
                         yellow pages.
                              (glancing at her notes)
                         It's a mini-storage facility outside 
                         Baltimore, where Lecter had his 
                         practice.

               She pauses, expecting some soft of approval for her 
               cleverness.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Well? Why aren't you there right 
                         now?

                                     CLARICE
                         Sir, that's a field job. It's outside 
                         the scope of my assignment. And I've
                         got a test tomorrow on -

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Do you recall my instructions to 
                         you, Starling? What were they?

                                     CLARICE
                         To complete and file my report by 
                         0800 Wednesday. But sir -

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Then do that, Starling. Do just 
                         exactly that.

                                     CLARICE
                         Sir, what is it? There's something 
                         you're not telling me.

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (beat)
                         Miggs has been murdered.

                                     CLARICE
                              (startled, upset)
                         Murdered...? How?

                                     CRAWFORD
                         The orderly heard Lecter whispering 
                         to him, all afternoon, and Miggs 
                         crying. They found him at bed check. 
                         He'd swallowed his own tongue... 
                         Chilton is scared stiff the family 
                         will file a civil rights lawsuit, 
                         and he's trying to blame it on you. 
                         I told the little prick your conduct 
                         was flawless.
                              (beat)
                         Starling...?

                                     CLARICE
                         I'm here, sir, I just - I don't know 
                         how to feel about it.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         You don't have to feel any way about 
                         it. Lecter did it to amuse himself. 
                         Why not, what can they do? Take away 
                         his books for awhile, and no jello...
                              (a bit softer)
                         I know it got ugly today. But this 
                         is your report, Starling - take it 
                         as far as you can. On your own time, 
                         outside of class. Now carry on.

               ANGLE ON CLARICE

               as we hear the loud CLICK of Crawford hanging up. She stares 
               at her receiver, stung by his abruptness.

                                     CLARICE
                         Well God damn it! You old creep. 
                         Creepo son of a bitch. Let Miggs 
                         squirt you and see how you like it.

               She slams her receiver into its cradle.

               ANGLE ON CRAWFORD

               as he flips aside her memo, then rises, wearily. He leaves 
               his study, flicking off the lamp, and pads away in his 
               slippers.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CRAWFORD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               A private nurse, in white, stands marking a clipboard chart, 
               as Crawford enters his tidy bedroom.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         I'll take over, Patricia. You get 
                         some rest.

               The nurse nods, hands him the chart, and goes. He glances at 
               it, then sets it aside. He crosses to -

               BELLA CRAWFORD

               who lies in an elevated hospital bed. Nearby are an oxygen 
               tank and mask, floral arrangements. Her breathing is shallow, 
               very labored. Crawford looks down at his comatose wife for a 
               long moment, tenderly brushes a strand of her hair back into 
               place, then bends over to kiss her forehead. SOUND UPCUT - 
               THUNDER and RAIN...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. "SPLIT CITY MINI-STORAGE" - DUSK (RAINING)

               An orange neon sign, streaked with rain, identifies out 
               location. It looms over a hurricane fence, topped with barbed 
               wire. Inside, row on row of garage-sized, cinderblock sheds.

                                     MR. YOW (V.O.)
                         Unit 31 was leased for ten years. 
                         Pre-paid in full... The contract is 
                         in the name of "Miss Hester Mofet."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. STORAGE UNIT NUMBER 31 - DUSK

               Clarice, kneeling before a closed, roll-up metal door, takes 
               a FLASH photo of its sealed padlock. EVERETT YOW, a fat, 
               60ish Chinaman, holds an umbrella over them both. He looks 
               unhappy.

                                     CLARICE
                         So no one's been in here since - 
                         1980?

               She opens the padlock, using a fat ring of tagged keys, then 
               sets aside both keys and lock.

                                     MR. YOW
                         Not to my knowledge. Privacy is a 
                         great concern to my customers. But, 
                         if you say this is an FBI matter...

                                     CLARICE
                         I won't disturb anything, Mr. Yow, I 
                         promise. Be gone before you know it.

               Slinging her camera over a shoulder, she tugs at the handle, 
               but the door won't budge. Another tug, harder - no good. Mr. 
               Yow stoops to help, puffing hard, but it's firmly stuck. He 
               sighs.

                                     MR. YOW
                         We could return tomorrow, with my 
                         son. Or perhaps some workmen...?

               Clarice crosses to her Pinto, which faces the shed, reaches 
               in to turn on her headlights. Mr. Yow blinks in the sudden 
               brightness. Then she opens her truck, rummaging inside, and 
               returns with a bumper jack, a flashlight, and a rubber floor 
               mat.

                                     CLARICE
                         Would you hold these, please?

               She gives him her flashlight and camera, drops the mat on 
               the ground, then sets the bumper jack in place, under the 
               center of the door. She pumps on the jack handle as the door 
               SQUEALS slowly up, but it won't go higher than about 18 
               inches, despite all her exertions. She spreads out the rubber 
               mat on the cement, takes the flashlight from Mr. Yow, then 
               lies on the mat.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE STORAGE SHED - DUSK (VERY DARK)

               Clarice, backlit, peers under the door. She reaches in, makes 
               a sweep with her flashlight. We catch shadowy outlines - 
               boxes, then the flattened tires of a car...

               SOUND of rain on the tin roof, and other noises, too - small 
               RUSTLINGS. Mr. Yow's chubby face appears down beside 
               Clarice's.

                                     MR. YOW
                         It smells like mice... I think I 
                         hear them, too - don't you?

               Clarice turns onto her back, starts squirming under the door.

                                     MR. YOW
                         You're going in there?

               CUT BACK TO:

               EXT. STORAGE UNIT NUMBER 31 - DUSK

               Clarice pulls her head back out again, reaching to take her 
               camera from him. She hands him a card, trying to appear 
               nonchalant.

                                     CLARICE
                         Mr. Yow, if this door should fall
                         down -ha ha! - or anything else - 
                         would you be kind enough to call 
                         this number? It's our Baltimore field 
                         office. They know you're here with 
                         me... Do you understand?

                                     MR. YOW
                         Might I suggest tucking your pants 
                         into your socks? To prevent mouse 
                         intrusion.

                                     CLARICE
                              (beat)
                         Good idea.

               CUT BACK TO:

               INT. STORAGE SHED - DUSK (VERY DARK)

               Clarice squirms, on her back, through the narrow opening. As 
               she squeezes all the way in, she snags one thigh on the metal 
               edge of the door. She curses softly, shining her flashlight 
               on her ripped khakis - there's a small streak of blood.

                                     MR. YOW (O.S.)
                         Okay, Miss Starling?

                                     CLARICE
                         Okay, Mr. Yow...

               She shines her light around. In its narrow beam, we see -

               CLARICE'S POV - UPWARD, SHIFTING

               spiderwebs, everywhere... high stacks of cardboard boxes... 
               a few dusty pieces of furniture... the big car, oddly long 
               and tall, covered with a tarp... Suddenly there's a scurrying 
               of loud MUSICAL NOTES. Clarice turns, scared, her beam 
               capturing... an old upright piano.

                                     MR. YOW (O.S.)
                         You're playing a piano, Miss Starling?

                                     CLARICE
                         That wasn't me.

                                     MR. YOW (O.S.)
                         Oh.

               Clarice crawls a bit further. There's hardly room to stand, 
               but she finally manages to wriggle upright, clawing away 
               cobwebs, next to the car. Holding her light under one arm, 
               she takes several FLASH photos of the shed's interior, ending 
               with the car. Then, slinging her camera over the shoulder, 
               she folds back the tarp, resting it on the roof. The resulting 
               clouds of dust make her cough.

               THE CAR

               is an antique beauty, a 1931 Packard. It's very dusty, despite 
               the tarp. Curtains close off the back passenger compartment, 
               but there's a narrow gap in them. More mousy RUSTLINGS.

               CLARICE

               peers in through the gap, aiming her flashlight.

               HER POV - SHIFTING

               as the thin flashlight beam picks out: the broad back seat... 
               as open album of lacy, old-fashioned Valentines... a crumpled 
               lap rug, on the floor... and then a pair of women's shiny, 
               high-heeled pumps... Above these, the hem of a fancy satin 
               evening gown - and a pair of pale, stockinged legs.

               Clarice recoils, alarmed, then steadies herself.

                                     CLARICE
                         Mr. Yow? Oh Mr. Yow...? It looks 
                         like somebody is sitting in this 
                         car.

                                     MR. YOW (O.S.)
                         Oh my! Oh my... Maybe you better 
                         come out now, Miss Starling.

                                     CLARICE
                         Not yet! - just wait for me.
                              (under the breath)
                         Maybe in about two seconds.

               She leans down with her camera, takes a FLASH through the 
               gap, then tries the door handle. Locked. So is the front 
               door. She looks around, aiming her light, and locates a tangle 
               of coat-hangers, sticking out of a carton of bric-a-brac. 
               She pulls out one of these, straightens it quickly, bends 
               the tip into a hook.

               CLOSE ANGLE

               as she jams this tool inside the join at the top of the back 
               passenger window, then fishes around till she can snag the 
               inside door latch, pulling up. A satisfying CLICK.

               Clarice opens the door - it hits stacked boxes, and won't 
               open far - then very cautiously leans inside, aiming her 
               flashlight.

               HER POV - MOVING LIGHT BEAM

               revealing more of the evening gown... a pair of hands, in 
               white, elbow-length gloves - one rests on the lap, the other 
               atop a large, beaded, drawstring evening bag... thick strands 
               of costume pearls over the breasts... and finally the white 
               neck stub of a female mannequin. No face or head.

               CLARICE

               sighs with relief. She takes a couple more FLASHES, then 
               very carefully lifts out the Valentine album, holding it by 
               the corners, and setting it atop the car. Then she eases 
               herself inside, onto the back seat, as the springs SQUEAK 
               loudly.

               ONE GLOVED HAND slides off the lap, brushing Clarice's thigh. 

               Clarice starts a bit, then pokes at the gloved arm, hard. 
               She peels back a bit of glove, revealing the white, synthetic 
               elbow. She smiles, shaking her head at her own jumpiness, as 
               she reaches over the mannequin's lap to loosen the evening 
               bag's drawstring.

               A SEVERED HUMAN HEAD stares back at her, as the beaded 
               material slides away.

               Clarice lurches back, gasping loudly, and several long, heart-
               pounding moments pass before she can make herself look more 
               closely.

               The head bobs gently in a pool of alcohol, in a laboratory 
               specimen jar. It is a man's head, but grotesquely transformed, 
               by the addition of heavy makeup, earrings, and a sodden wig, 
               into a woman's face. Over the years the makeup has smeared 
               badly, and the pupils have gone almost milky white.

               CLARICE

               staring at this terrible thing, is pleased to find herself 
               quickly regaining control. She murmurs to herself.

                                     CLARICE
                         Well, Toto, we're not in Kansas 
                         anymore.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. QUINN'S HOSPITAL - PARKING LOT - NIGHT (RAINING)

               A loud clap of THUNDER, as a flash of LIGHTNING illuminates 
               the eerie towers and barred windows of the asylum.

               MOVING ANGLE on Clarice as she climbs from her car, runs 
               through heavy rain towards the main entrance, where a guard 
               admits her.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DR. LECTER'S CELL AND CORRIDOR - NIGHT (DIM LIGHT)

               On a noiseless TV screen, an evangelist rants, waving his 
               arms. Behind him, a swaying choir in gaudy robes.

                                     CLARICE (O.S.)
                         It's an anagram, isn't it, Doctor?

               PAN TO Clarice, with her wet hair plastered flat, sitting on 
               the corridor floor to one side of this TV, which has been 
               stationed so that Dr. Lecter cannot avoid seeing it.

                                     CLARICE
                         Hester Mofet... "The rest of me." 
                         Miss The-Rest-of-Me... Meaning, you 
                         rented that place.

               HER POV

               he's lost in shadows; we can't see him. He doesn't respond.

               CUTTING BETWEEN THEM

               Clarice and the darkened call - as she tries again.

                                     CLARICE
                         You put those - things in there. 
                         Paid for it in advance, ten years 
                         ago... Why, Dr. Lecter?

               The food carrier suddenly SWISHES out of the cell, making 
               her jump up. In its tray is a clean, folded white towel. She 
               hesitates, then crosses, takes this.

                                     CLARICE
                         Thank you.

               She sits again, rubbing her wet hair. When he finally speaks, 
               he's on the floor, too - a deeper, hunching darkness in the 
               shadows, occasionally striped by the flickering TV light.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Your bleeding has stopped.

                                     CLARICE
                         How did -
                              (she stops herself)
                         It's nothing. A scratch.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Why don't you ask me about Buffalo 
                         Bill?

                                     CLARICE
                              (surprised, a beat)
                         Why? Do you know something about 
                         him?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         I might if I saw the case file. You 
                         could get that for me.

                                     CLARICE
                         Why don't you tell me about "Miss 
                         Mofet?" You wanted me to find him. 
                         Or do I have to wait for the lab?

                                     DR. LECTER
                              (sighs)
                         His real name is Benjamin Raspail. A 
                         former patient of mine, whose romantic 
                         attachments ran to, shall we say, 
                         the exotic...? I didn't kill him, 
                         merely tucked him away. Very much as 
                         I found him, in that ridiculous car, 
                         in his own garage, after he's missed 
                         three appointments. You'd have him 
                         under "Missing Person" - which, in 
                         poor Raspail's case, could hardly be 
                         more true.

                                     CLARICE
                         If you didn't kill him, then who 
                         did?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Who can say...? Best thing for him, 
                         really. His therapy was going nowhere.

                                     CLARICE
                         Wouldn't it have been easier to just 
                         leave him for the police to find?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         And have them clomping about in my 
                         life? Oh dear, no... At that time I 
                         still had certain private amusements 
                         of my own.
                              (beat)
                         How did you feel when you saw him, 
                         Clarice? May I call you Clarice?

                                     CLARICE
                         Scared, at first. Then - exhilarated.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Ahhh... Why?

                                     CLARICE
                         Because you weren't wasting my time.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Do you have something you use, when 
                         you need to get up your courage? 
                         Memories, tableaux... scenes from 
                         your early life?

                                     CLARICE
                         I don't know. Next time I'll have to 
                         check.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Jack Crawford is helping your career, 
                         isn't he? Apparently he likes you. 
                         And you like him, too.

                                     CLARICE
                         I never thought about it.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Your first lie to me, Clarice. How 
                         sad. Tell me - do you think Crawford 
                         wants you, sexually? True, he's much 
                         older, but - do you think he 
                         visualizes... scenarios, exchanges...? 
                         Fucking you?

                                     CLARICE
                         That doesn't interest me, Doctor. 
                         And it's the sort of thing Miggs 
                         would ask.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Not anymore.
                              (beat)
                         Surely the odd confluence of events 
                         hasn't escaped you, Clarice. Crawford 
                         dangles you before me. Then I give 
                         you a bit of help. Do you think it's 
                         because I like to look at you, and 
                         imagine how good you would taste...?

                                     CLARICE
                         I don't know. Is it?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Or doesn't this all begin to suggest 
                         to you a kind of... negotiation? 
                         There's something Crawford can give 
                         me, and I want to trade for it. I 
                         even wrote to him, offering my help. 
                         But he hates me, so he won't deal 
                         directly.

               Dr. Lecter slowly turns up the rheostat in his cell. As his 
               lights rise, we see that the cell's been stripped bare. Gone 
               are his books, drawings, mattress - even his toilet seat. 
               She stands, too, startled. They face each other.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Punishment, you see. For Miggs. Just 
                         like that gospel program. When you 
                         leave, they'll turn the volume way 
                         up. Chilton does enjoy his petty 
                         torments.

                                     CLARICE
                         Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You 
                         know, don't you?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         I've been in this room for eight 
                         years, Clarice. I know they will 
                         never, ever let me out while I'm 
                         alive. What I want is a view. I want 
                         a window where I can see a tree, or 
                         even water. I want to be in a federal 
                         institution, away from Chilton - and 
                         I want a view. I'll give good value 
                         for it. Crawford could do that for 
                         me, but he won't. You persuade him.

                                     CLARICE
                              (almost a whisper)
                         Who killed your patient?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Oh, a very naughty boy. Someone you 
                         and Jack Crawford are most anxious 
                         to meet.

                                     CLARICE
                         Buffalo Bill...?
                              (incredulous)
                         Bill killed him, all those years 
                         ago...? That's impossible.

               But Dr. Lecter only smiles, enigmatically.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Who is he stalking right now, Clarice? 
                         I wonder, don't you? How many more 
                         young women will have to die, before 
                         you trade with me...?

               As Clarice stares at him, unsure how to respond -

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. CATHERINE MARTIN'S APARTMENT - MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE - 
               NIGHT

               CATHERINE MARTIN takes a long toke from a bong pipe. She is 
               21, a tall, big-boned, rather fleshy girl with long brown 
               fair. Her head is on the lap of her boyfriend, CODY; they're 
               sprawled on a couch in the den of her well-furnished 
               apartment. The TV in on, with low SOUND.

                                     CATHERINE
                         This stuff's givin' me the munchies. 
                         Where's that bag of popcorn?

                                     CODY
                         Shit. Left the groceries in the car.

               He starts to rise, but she pushes him back.

                                     CATHERINE
                         'S okay, I'll go.

               She rises, goes out the front door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. PARKING LOT - THE APARTMENT COMPLEX - NIGHT

               Catherine straightens, with her bag of groceries, shutting 
               her car's back door. She sees, a short distance away -

               A MAN

               standing at the open rear door of a brown panel truck. His 
               right forearm is in a cast and sling; he is struggling, 
               unsuccessfully, to hoist an armchair into the truck. Parked 
               nearby, other cars, RVs, a boat on a trailer. A thin, breast-
               high fog fills the lot; arc lights make yellow pools. 

               Catherine hesitates, then crosses towards the man.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Help you with that?

                                     MAN
                         Would you? Thanks.

               His voice is odd, strained, very soft. A fog lamp, set on 
               end on the ground, distorts his features from below. We can't 
               get a good glimpse of his face, but his body is plump, above 
               average height; he's in his mid 30's. She sets down the bag, 
               then together they easily lift the chair into the truck.

                                     MAN (O.S.)
                         Let's slide it up, you mind?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE PANEL TRUCK - NIGHT

               He climbs inside the truck, ducking under a small hand winch, 
               and grabs the chair. She hesitates again, but climbs in after 
               him; together they slide the chair forward, behind the seats.

                                     MAN
                         Are you about a size 14?

                                     CATHERINE
                              (surprised)
                         What?

               Suddenly, in the shadowy dark, he clubs her over the back of 
               her head with his cast. She moans, slumps unconscious, sliding 
               off the armchair to lie on her stomach. He pulls off his 
               cast and sling, tosses them aside, then hops out of the truck, 
               grabs his lamp, climbs back inside, and pulls the door shut. 
               He bends over her face with the lamp.

               We hear her shallow BREATHING.

                                     MAN
                         Good.

               He peels back the collar of her blouse, reading the size 
               tag.

                                     MAN
                         Good.

               He carefully slits her blouse up the back, with a pair of 
               bandage scissors, peeling apart the two halves. There's no 
               bra strap. He strokes her bare skin delicately, very happily.

                                     MAN
                         Gooood...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               LOW ANGLE - CLOSE - on Catherine's grocery bag, as her blouse 
               is tossed out beside it. SOUND of the truck's motor starting. 
               The truck backs up, one rear wheel knocking over the bag, 
               partly squashing it. Then is drives away, taillights 
               shrinking, as a lone orange rolls slowly away from the bag...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. FBI ACADEMY CLASSROOM - QUANTICO - DAY

               CLOSE ON a large video screen, where a BLURRY image gradually 
               sharpens, resolving into two separate pieces of fabric.

                                     INSTRUCTOR (O.S.)
                         Electron microscopy reveals fiber 
                         "signatures" that are nearly as 
                         distinct as fingerprints...

               Clarice sits at a long table, with other trainees. Ardelia 
               is beside her. Other tables and students in the background. 
               Each trainee has his own microscope. Clarice is tired, but 
               straightens, hearing -

                                     INSTRUCTOR (O.S.)
                         Both of these blouses were worn by 
                         victims of Buffalo Bill. They were 
                         found in two different states, and 
                         four months apart. He always slits 
                         them up the back, like a funeral 
                         suit...

               ON THE SCREEN

               successively CLOSER VIEWS of the cut fabric edges, until we 
               are seeing individual threads, big as tree limbs. The cuts 
               match.

                                     INSTRUCTOR (O.S.)
                         The bunching you see - this 
                         compression - is characteristic of 
                         scissor cuts, rather than a single 
                         blade. And, as you see - Bill always 
                         uses the same pair...

               ANGLE ON THE DOOR

               as John Brigham, the gunnery instructor, sticks his head in.

                                     BRIGHAM
                         Clarice Starling! Are you in here?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HALLWAY - CLASSROOM BUILDING - DAY

               Clarice and Brigham walk briskly down the hall, passing other 
               trainees. He carries a small canvas bag.

                                     BRIGHAM
                         Get your field gear, take stuff for 
                         overnight. You're goin' with Crawford.

                                     CLARICE
                         Where?

                                     BRIGHAM
                         Some fishermen in West Virginia found 
                         an unidentified girl's body. It's a 
                         Buffalo Bill-type situation. Been in 
                         the water about a week, and Jack 
                         needs somebody that can print a 
                         floater. Think you can handle it?

                                     CLARICE
                              (thinking quickly)
                         I'll need the big fingerprint kit... 
                         and the one-to-one Polaroid, the CU-
                         5, with film packs and batteries.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BRIGHAM'S JEEP CHEROKEE - DAY (DRIVING)

               Brigham steers as they pass hangars, parked planes, an 
               airstrip. Clarice holds a big fingerprint kit and a weekend 
               bag.

                                     BRIGHAM
                         Jack's pretty tough on you, isn't 
                         he? Impatient...

                                     CLARICE
                         Sometimes.

                                     BRIGHAM
                         He's got a lot on his mind besides 
                         Buffalo Bill... His wife, Bella, is 
                         real sick. Comatose... I'm tellin' 
                         you about it now, 'cause he may never.

               Clarice absorbs this in silence as they stop near an ancient, 
               rather dilapidated Beechcraft. Its door is open, the twin 
               props and beacons already turning. Brigham turns to her, 
               holding out his small canvas bag.

                                     BRIGHAM
                         You're goin' in the field, so you 
                         gotta have full kit. Take this - 
                         it's my own...

               Clarice opens the bag, stares at the big blue gun nestled in 
               its shoulder holster. She looks up at him, touched.

                                     BRIGHAM
                         Wear it, don't ever leave it in your 
                         purse. Dry fire it whenever you get 
                         the chance. And do your exercises.

                                     CLARICE
                         I will... I promise.

                                     BRIGHAM
                         Listen, I hope you never need a thing 
                         I've taught you. But you've got 
                         something... Jack sees it, I do too. 
                         If you ever need to, you can shoot.

               She nods, climbs out. Then she looks back in at him. They're 
               both moved by this rite of passage, but a little embarrassed.

                                     BRIGHAM
                         Bless you, Starling...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BEECHCRAFT PLANE - DAY (FLYING)

               CLARICE'S POV - Out the plane's window, at the landscape far 
               below. Wisps of cloud, a quilt of farms.

               Clarice turns from the window, looks at a think folder in 
               her lap. The cover reads "Case File: / BUFFALO BILL." Clarice 
               is moody, distracted. She hesitates, then opens the file, 
               begins to scan.

               INSERTS - HER POV

               Police forms, some handwritten... Typed lab reports; we catch 
               words, phrases: "Autopsy Protocols", "Histamine Analysis"... 
               Grainy enlargements of bullet slugs, showing matched 
               grooves... And then a stack of victim photos. The first one, 
               taken from a good distance away, shows a nude female body, 
               face down on a pebbly riverbank, surrounded by bits of litter.

               Clarice hesitates again, then flips this photo to look at 
               the next. It makes her flinch, just slightly. Quickly she 
               turns through several more photographs, trying hard to 
               concentrate.

                                     CRAWFORD (O.S.)
                         He keeps them alive for three days.

               NEW ANGLE

               shows Crawford standing over her, swaying with the plane's 
               motion. Behind him, the open cockpit door, the pilot's back. 
               Crawford sits, removing sunglasses. He rubs his eyes.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Why, we don't yet know... There's no 
                         evidence of rape or physical abuse 
                         prior to death. All the mutilation 
                         you see there is post-mortem.
                              (a beat; he glances 
                              at her)
                         I'm hot, are you hot? Bobby, it's 
                         too damned hot back here...

               The pilot adjusts a valve. Crawford turns to her again.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         So. Three days. Then he shoots them,
                         skins them - usually just the torsos - 
                         and dumps them. Each body in a 
                         different river, in a different state, 
                         downstream from an interstate highway. 
                         The water leaves us no fingerprints, 
                         fibers, DNA fluids - no trace evidence 
                         at all. That's Fredrica Bimmel, the 
                         first one...

               A COLOR PHOTO - IN CLARICE'S HANDS

               shows a pretty, plump-cheeked brunette, in her high school 
               graduation cap and gown. She smiles at us with touching 
               optimism.

                                     CRAWFORD (O.S.)
                         A big girl, like all the rest. Went 
                         about 160... Her corpse was the only 
                         one he took the trouble to weight 
                         down, so actually, she was the third 
                         girl found. After her, he got lazy...

               NEW ANGLE

               as Clarice stares at the girl's face, moved. Crawford pulls 
               a map from the file, spreads it out. It shows the central 
               and eastern U.S., with widely-spaced, hand-drawn markings.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Blue square for Belvedere, Ohio, 
                         where the Bimmel girl was abducted. 
                         Blue triangle where her body was 
                         found - down here in Missouri. Same 
                         marks for the other four girls, in 
                         different colors. This new one, 
                         today... washed up here.
                              (he marks with a Flair 
                              pen)
                         Elk River, in West Virginia, about 
                         six miles below U.S. 79. Real boonies.

                                     CLARICE
                         There's no correlation at all between 
                         where they're kidnapped and where 
                         they're found...?
                              (he shakes his head)
                         What if - what if you trace the 
                         heaviest-traffic routes backwards 
                         from the dump sites? Do they converge 
                         at all?

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Good idea, but he thought of it, 
                         too. We've run simulations, using 
                         different vectors and the best dates 
                         we can assign. You put it all in the 
                         computer, and smoke comes out. No, 
                         this one is different. This one has 
                         seen us coming...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. RENTAL CAR - DAY (DRIVING)

               Crawford steers, following a highway patrol car along a 
               winding mountain road. Clarice has the file open on her lap. 
               He glances at her, inscrutable behind his sunglasses.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Talk about him, Starling. Tell me 
                         what you see.

                                     CLARICE
                              (choosing her words 
                              carefully)
                         He's a white male... Serial killers 
                         tend to hunt within their own ethnic 
                         group. And he's not a drifter - he's 
                         got his own house, somewhere. Not an 
                         apartment.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Why?

                                     CLARICE
                         What he does with them - takes 
                         privacy... Time, tools... He's in 
                         his 30's or 40's - he's got real 
                         physical strength, but combined with 
                         an older man's self-control. He's 
                         cautious, precise, never impulsive... 
                         This won't end in suicide, like they 
                         often do.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Why not?

                                     CLARICE
                         He's got a real taste for it now. 
                         And he's getting better at his work.

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (a beat; impressed)
                         Maybe you've got a knack for this... 
                         I guess we're about to find out.

                                     CLARICE
                              (quietly, evenly)
                         Like I have a "knack" for Dr. Lecter?

               He studies her a few moments, measuring her anger.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Okay, Starling. Let's have it.

                                     CLARICE
                         You haven't said a word today about 
                         that garage. Or what I found there.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         What should I say? You did fine work. 
                         We'll wait on the lab.

                                     CLARICE
                         You knew. You knew from the start 
                         that Lecter held the key to this... 
                         But you weren't up front with me. 
                         You sent me in to him naked.

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (beat)
                         Are you finished?

                                     CLARICE
                         He starts this - buzzing in me, in 
                         my head. He makes me feel violated... 
                         You used me, Mr. Crawford.

               A shadow of regret passes over his face, but he answers 
               sternly.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Number One. Maybe there's a 
                         connection, maybe not. Lying and 
                         breathing are the same thing to 
                         Lecter. Number Two. If I'd sent you 
                         in there with something to hide from 
                         him, he'd have known it, instantly. 
                         He'd never have trusted you.

               She starts to answer, then is silent. He is right.

               By now the two cars are entering a tidy little town - tree-
               lined streets, wooden houses, one-story shops, mountains in 
               the background. They slow, turn.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Number Three, I didn't bring you 
                         along today just because you can do 
                         first-rate forensics. If Lecter is 
                         becoming part of this case, you've 
                         got the most current read on him. 
                         And Number Four - you don't have to 
                         like me, or the way I do things. But 
                         you do have to keep a cool head. 
                         Especially now... Because from here 
                         on out, you'll know everything I do. 
                         Are we straight on that?

               Clarice nods, silently; it's as close to an apology as she's 
               likely to get. She stares out the windshield.

               JUST AHEAD OF THEM

               the highway patrol cruiser noses into a curb, next to other 
               police cars, facing a big white frame house. Its sign reads 
               "Potter Funeral Home." Two troopers climb from the car.

               Crawford parks too, then kills the engine. He turns to her, 
               removing his sunglasses, gestures to the case file.

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (softly)
                         You think about him long enough, you 
                         get a feel for him... Then, if you're 
                         lucky, out of all the stuff you know, 
                         one little part of it tugs at you, 
                         tries to get your attention... You 
                         let me know when that happens, 
                         Starling. Live right behind your 
                         eyes, today. Don't try to impose any 
                         patterns on this guy. Just stay open 
                         and let him show you...

               One of the troopers, impassive in his sunglasses and hat, 
               peers in through Crawford's window. Crawford nods to him, 
               then turns back to Clarice.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         School's out, Starling.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SIDEWALK OF THE FUNERAL HOME - POTTER, WEST VA. - DAY

               SOUND of organ music, as Clarice, carrying her fingerprint 
               kit, mounts some steps to the sidewalk. She stops, seeing -

               COUNTRY PEOPLE

               in their somber best, filing into the mortuary for a service. 
               The music - "Shall We Gather At The River?" - is issuing 
               from the open double doors. Several of the mourners glance 
               over at her curiously.

               ANGLE ON CLARICE

               staring back at the mourners, hearing the music, as a sense 
               memory is triggered in her...

               IN FLASHBACK - LOW ANGLE, MOVING

               as we approach, down the aisle of a country chapel, an open 
               wooden coffin. Sad country faces turn, looking at us from 
               the flanking pews. The b.g. organ hymn is "Shall We 
               Gather...?"

               THE SAD, 10 YEAR-OLD CLARICE

               in her best dress, is reluctantly approaching the casket. 
               Her hands are held by the plump hands of unseen matrons.

               CHILD'S POV

               on the looming coffin... closer and closer... until finally 
               she can see, lying inside it... her dead father, arms folded, 
               his marshal's badge still pinned to his lapel.

                                     CRAWFORD (V.O.)
                         Starling...?

               NEW ANGLE (PRESENT DAY)

               as the grownup Clarice turns towards the impatient Crawford. 
               Like her, he carries a large case.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         We're around back.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FUNERAL HOME - BACK CORRIDOR - DAY

               A young deputy, several state troopers, and a SHERIFF are 
               all waiting, as Crawford and Clarice enter. The dim, cluttered 
               corridor doubles as storage space - there's a treadle sewing 
               machine, a soft-drink machine, a tricycle. The MUSIC is 
               closer. Crawford shakes hands with the sheriff.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Sheriff Perkins? Jack Crawford, FBI... 
                         This is Officer Starling. We 
                         appreciate your phoning us.

                                     SHERIFF
                              (grim, unsociable)
                         I didn't call you. That was somebody 
                         from the state attorney's office... 
                         'For you do a thing else, I'm gon' 
                         find out if this girl's local. It 
                         could just be somethin' that outside 
                         elements has dumped on us.

               He casts a sidelong, unhappy glance at Clarice.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Well sir, that's where we can help. 
                         If -

                                     SHERIFF
                         I don't even know you, Mister... Now 
                         we'll extend you ever courtesy, just
                         soon as we can, but for right now -

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Sheriff, this, ah - this type of sex 
                         crime has some aspects I'd rather 
                         discuss just between the two of us. 
                         Know what I mean?

               He indicates Clarice with his eyes. The sheriff hesitates, 
               nods, then lets Crawford guide him into a small office, 
               closing the door behind them. Muffled WORDS from there.

               CLARICE

               burning at this slight, is left alone with the troopers, who 
               peek at her with shy curiosity. She pulls her blazer a bit 
               tighter, self-conscious about her bulging shoulder holster.

               ANGLE ON THE OFFICE DOOR

               as, after a few more moments, the sheriff and Crawford emerge. 
               The sheriff, still not very happy, addresses his deputy.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Oscar, run fetch Dr. Akin from the 
                         chapel. And tell Lamar to come on 
                         when he's done playin' that music.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EMBALMING ROOM - DAY

               Crawford, in one corner of the room, has set up a Litton 
               Policefax fingerprint transmitter. SOUND of many men's low 
               voices, in background. He is on the phone, and has to speak 
               loudly.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         I need a six-way linkup! Chicago, 
                         Detroit, Cleveland, St. Louis, 
                         Atlanta, and Dallas... What?... Can 
                         you hear me...?

               He looks around, frustrated by the noisy circus atmosphere.

               CLARICE

               is pulling on a pair of surgical gloves. She raises her voice, 
               turning up her natural accent by several notches.

                                     CLARICE
                         Gentlemen. You officers and gentlemen! 
                         Listen here a minute, please. There's 
                         things I need to do for her...

               WIDER ANGLE

               as we see that the small room is very crowded with deputies 
               and troopers. They gradually fall silent, looking at her.

                                     CLARICE (O.S.)
                         Y'all brought her this far, and I 
                         know her folks would thank you if 
                         they could. Now please - go on out 
                         and let me take care of her... Go 
                         on, now.

               The men look at one another, a little bashfully, then begin 
               to to file out, whispering among themselves. As they go, a 
               bright green body bag is REVEALED, tightly zipped, lying on 
               a porcelain embalming table. It is almost the only modern 
               object in this Victorian room, with its glass-paned cabinets 
               and faded wallpaper, decorated with cabbage roses.

               FAVORING CRAWFORD

               as he looks at Clarice with a new degree of respect. Men 
               brush by him, till finally only two are left: DR. AKIN, a 
               family g.p., and LAMAR, a lean, whiskey-reddened mortician. 
               SOUND of the door closing. Lamar dabs around his nostrils 
               with Vicks VapoRub.

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (on phone)
                         We're starting. Tell everybody to 
                         stand by for fingerprint transmission.

               CLARICE

               at a side counter, has turned back to her open fingerprint 
               kit. She is lifting out a camera when she hears the ZIPPER 
               of the body bag being slowly opened, behind her...

               One gloved hand flies to her mouth as she reacts, 
               involuntarily, to the sudden smell. She blinks at her 
               reflection in the cabinet glass, then steels herself to turn, 
               look at the corpse.

                                     CLARICE
                              (pause; softly)
                         Bill...

               She steadies herself by raising her camera, takes a FLASH 
               photo.

               LOW ANGLE - LOOKING UP, FROM BENEATH TABLE

               as Dr. Akin gently lifts aside one of the dead girl's arms. 
               A piece of fishing line, with multiple hooks, is still snagged 
               around it, dangling. Crawford leans in for a closer look.

                                     DR. AKIN
                         Wrongful death... She'll have to go 
                         to the state pathologist at Claxton 
                         when you're done.
                              (Crawford nods)
                         I better - get on back for the rest 
                         of that service. Lamar'll help you.
                              (shaken)
                         Lord almighty...

               He leaves, and Clarice leans INTO SHOT, taking another photo.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         What do you see, Starling?

                                     CLARICE
                         Well, she's not local. Her ears are 
                         pierced three times each, and she's 
                         wearing green glitter nail polish. 
                         Looks like town to me...

               CLOSE ANGLE

               on the calf of one of the girl's legs, as Clarice trails the 
               inside of her bare wrist along the skin.

                                     CLARICE (O.S.)
                         She waxed her legs, I think... A big 
                         girl, just like the others - but she 
                         was careful about her appearance...

               UPWARD ANGLE AGAIN

               as Lamar joins them for a closer look.

                                     CLARICE
                         Two of the fingernails are broken 
                         off, and there's - dirt or grit under 
                         the others. She tried to claw her 
                         way through something... I'll scrape 
                         out samples after I've printed her.

               She takes another FLASH, then quickly reloads film.

                                     LAMAR
                         Them fishhooks are set too close 
                         together. No wonder the Franklin 
                         boys was scared to say they found 
                         her.

                                     CLARICE
                         Think they were runnin' a trotline?

               Crawford and Lamar both look at her curiously.

                                     CLARICE
                              (to Crawford)
                         It's a Fish and Game violation. Like 
                         poaching. There's a big fine.

                                     LAMAR
                         Right... Are you from around here?

                                     CLARICE
                         They do it lots of places.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Get photos of her teeth. Then we'll 
                         fax her fingerprints to Washington, 
                         try to trace her through Missing 
                         Persons.

               SIDE ANGLE - CLOSE ON THE DEAD GIRL'S FACE

               staring blue eyes, short reddish hair. Clarice sets the 
               Polaroid, with its special attachments, against the face, 
               while Lamar gently retracts the lips. Each time the camera 
               FLASHES, there's a bright glow inside the cheeks.

               NEW ANGLE - CHEST HIGH

               as Clarice examines a developing print.

                                     CLARICE
                         She's got something in her throat.

               She hands the print to Crawford; he and Lamar look at it, as 
               she searches in her kit.

                                     LAMAR
                         When a body comes out of the water, 
                         alots of times there's like, leaves 
                         and things in the mouth.

               Clarice holds up a pair of forceps. She glances at Crawford, 
               who nods. She bends over, partially OUT OF SHOT, and after a 
               few moments reappears, holding up a small, brown cylindrical 
               object. She turns this in the air, as they all stare.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         What is it - some kind of seed pod?

                                     LAMAR
                         Nawsir, that's a bug cocoon. But how 
                         come that to get way down in there? 
                         'Less somebody shoved it in...

               Clarice and Crawford exchange a glance.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         She'll be easier to print if we turn 
                         her over. Lamar, will you give me a 
                         hand?

                                     LAMAR
                         Yessir, I will. Clarice takes a jar 
                         from her kit, carefully drops the 
                         cocoon inside.

               SOUND of the men's heavy efforts as they turn over the body, 
               off screen. She seals the jar, staring into it at the cocoon.

                                     CRAWFORD (O.S.)
                         Starling - what do you make of these?

               She turns to look.

               HER POV

               low on the corpse's back, over the shoulders, two neat, 
               triangular patches of skin are missing.

               NEW ANGLE - TWO SHOT

               as Clarice looks at Crawford.

                                     CLARICE
                         I don't know. I didn't see those on 
                         any of the other girls...

                                     CRAWFORD
                         They weren't there. Get close-ups.

               Clarice raises her camera, leans in for another FLASH.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BACK STEPS OF THE FUNERAL HOME - DAY

               Clarice sits outside, with her head on her knees, drained. 
               She looks up wanly as Lamar appears, offers her a can of 
               Coke.

                                     CLARICE
                         Thanks, I'm not thirsty.

                                     LAMAR
                         No, hold it under your chin, there, 
                         and on your temples. Cold'll make 
                         you feel better. It does me.

               She smiles, touched, and takes the can. When Lamar sees 
               Crawford coming outside, he tactfully departs. Crawford sits 
               beside her; there's a brief silence. She soothes herself 
               with the can.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         When I told that sheriff we shouldn't 
                         talk in front of a woman, that really 
                         burned you, didn't it?
                              (she is silent)
                         That was just smoke, Starling, I had 
                         to get rid of him. You did well in 
                         there.

                                     CLARICE
                         It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other 
                         cops know who you are. They look at 
                         you to see how to act... It matters.

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (beat)
                         Point taken.

               She looks at him a moment, then offers the can. He opens it.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         When we get back, I want you to run 
                         that bug by the Smithsonian, see if 
                         they can identify it. Maybe it's got 
                         some limited range, or it only breeds 
                         at certain times of year... You found 
                         it, Starling, you deserve the credit.

                                     CLARICE
                         I'm wondering if he's done that before - 
                         placed a cocoon, or an insect. It 
                         would be easy to miss in an autopsy, 
                         especially with a floater... Can we 
                         check back on that?

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (shakes his head)
                         The other girls are in the ground. 
                         Exhumations are upsetting for the 
                         families. I'll do it if I have to,
                         but -

                                     CLARICE
                         Then have the lab check Raspail's 
                         head.
                              (he looks at her)
                         Dr. Lecter's patient - have them 
                         probe his soft-palette tissues... 
                         They'll find another cocoon.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         You seem pretty sure of that.

                                     CLARICE
                         Raspail was killed by the same man 
                         who's killing these girls. And Lecter 
                         knows him. Maybe even treated him... 
                         You think so, too, don't you? Or 
                         you'd never have sent me to that 
                         asylum.

               He looks at her for a moment, then sips again.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Before we caught him, Lecter had a 
                         big psychiatric practice in Baltimore. 
                         But he traveled all over the country - 
                         teaching, consulting... Christ, even 
                         testifying in murder trials. Who 
                         knows how many potential psychos he 
                         turned loose, just for the fun of 
                         it...?

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. MR. GUMB'S CELLAR - DAY (DIM LIGHT)

               A shadowy male figure looks down at us, leaning over the 
               edge of a deep hole. He holds a little white poodle in his 
               arms, stroking it. This is MR. GUMB, aka "Buffalo Bill."

                                     MR. GUMB
                              (softly)
                         Rub the cream on your skin. Rub it 
                         in gooood...

               CATHERINE MARTIN

               looks up at him. She is standing on the cement bottom of the 
               pit, or oubliette, about 15 feet below floor level. The pit 
               is bare, except for a futon and a plastic toilet bucket, 
               from which a thin string rises up to the basement. She's 
               soaking wet, in an orange jumpsuit, and holds a squeeze bottle 
               of skin lotion. She struggles to sound calm.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Mister... my family will pay cash. 
                         Whatever ransom you're askin' for,
                         they -

               REVERSE ANGLE - UP TOWARDS MR. GUMB

                                     MR. GUMB
                         Rub it in! Or you'll get the hose 
                         again.

               The little dog squirms in his arms, BARKING excitedly.

                                     MR. GUMB
                         Yes, it will, Precious, won't it? It 
                         will get the hose!

               SIDE ANGLE - AT PIT BOTTOM

               as Catherine kneels, turning slightly away from him.

                                     CATHERINE
                              (under her breath)
                         Oh God... oh God...

               She unzips her jumpsuit, part-way, then squeezes some of the 
               lotion onto a palm. She reaches inside her suit, rubs it on.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Mister, if you let me go, I won't 
                         press charges, I promise. You've 
                         only had me here a couple days, and -

                                     MR. GUMB (O.S.)
                         No. Just one day...

                                     CATHERINE
                         Is that all...? See - see, my mom is 
                         a real important woman... Well, I 
                         guess you already know that. She'll 
                         pay you, no questions asked. Whatever 
                         cause you represent - Iran, Palestine - 
                         she'll see that -

               A sudden blinding glare of light silences her. She looks up, 
               shielding her eyes.

               HER POV

               a floodlamp is descending, attached to a small basket.

                                     MR. GUMB
                         Put the bottle in the basket. No 
                         funny business, or you'll be sorry...

               NEW ANGLE - CATHERINE

               as the basket stops, and she steadies it. But as she slips 
               the bottle in, she sees something, O.S., just at the fringe 
               of the light. She hesitates, looks closer... then begins to 
               scream, hysterically, again and again. Her outflung hand 
               hits the lamp, and in its swaying glare, we see - high on 
               the concrete walls, all around her -

               BLOODY FINGER TRACKS

               dried now, brownish - left by many pairs of frenzied hands...

               Ardelia sticks her head in the door, excited.

                         killer known only as "Buffalo Bill."

               The photo disappears, replaced by the TV ANCHOR himself.

                         identified, sliced up the back, in 
                         what has become a kind of grim calling 
                         card. Young Catherine Martin, as 
                         we've said, is the only daughter of 
                         U.S. Senator Ruth Martin -

               looks at Ardelia, surprised. Other trainees are drifting 
               into the rec room, some whispering among themselves. Clarice 
               stares back at the TV intently.

                         considered to be politically 
                         motivated, nevertheless it has stirred

                         Just moments ago, Senator Martin 
                         made this dramatic personal plea...

               SENATOR MARTIN (TV FOOTAGE)

               fills the screen, in a halo of lens flare, as she speaks to 
               a jostling crowd of reporters on the front steps of her 
               Georgetown home. A tall woman, late 40's, with a strong, 
               taut face.

                                     SEN. MARTIN
                         I'm speaking now to the person who 
                         is holding my daughter. Her name is 
                         Catherine... You have the power to 
                         let Catherine go, unharmed. She's 
                         very gentle and kind - talk to her 
                         and you'll see. Her name is 
                         Catherine...

               Clarice is moved by what she sees. Other trainees are all 
               around her.

                         trying to make him see Catherine as 
                         a person - not just an object.

                                     SEN. MARTIN
                         You have a chance to show the whole 
                         world that you can be merciful, as
                         well as strong. Please - I beg you -

                         Your West Virginia specimen gave us 
                         quite a bit of trouble, but I finally 
                         managed to narrow his species through 
                         chaetaxy - studying the skin.

                         proboscis! Are you wearing a gun, 
                         right now?

                         The whole trick is to remove the 
                         chrysalis without destroying it...

                         You're sure?

                                     RODEN
                              (points with his dental 
                              probe)
                         West Virginia... Baltimore. Officer 
                         Starling, meet Mister Acherontia 
                         Styx.

               He moves aside for Clarice to get a closer look at Pilcher's 
               specimen. She leans forward, intently.

               HER POV (MAGNIFICATION)

               the wide, furry, brown back of the moth. And there, right 
               between the wing bases - wonderful and terrible to see - is 
               nature's perfect reproduction of a ghostly human skull.

                                     RODEN (O.S.)
                         Better known to his friends as the 
                         Death's-head Moth...

                                     PILCHER (O.S.)
                         The Latin name comes from two rivers 
                         in Hell. Your man - he drops these 
                         girls into rivers, every time. Didn't 
                         I read that?

               FAVORING CLARICE

               as she looks up at him, awed, excited, almost trembling.

                                     CLARICE
                         And there's no way - no natural way - 
                         these could've wound up in the bodies?

                                     PILCHER
                              (shakes his head)
                         They live in Malaysia. In this 
                         country, they'd have to be specially 
                         raised, from imported eggs.

                                     CLARICE
                              (pause, then softly)
                         Dr. Lecter...

               As the two men stare at her, puzzled, we hear a SOUND UPCUT - 
               the wail of police SIRENS - and...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. U.S. ROUTE 95 - DAY (AERIAL SHOT)

               An awesome armada of police vehicles swings through an 
               intersection, while normal traffic is held back by highway 
               patrol cruisers.

               The lead cars turn off, hit the entrance ramp to the freeway - 
               SIRENS going, tires SQUEALING, red flashers...

               CLOSER ANGLE

               on a speeding surveillance van, with long antennas and a 
               small satellite dish, near the head of the motorcade.

                                     CRAWFORD (V.O.)
                         Maybe we can trace how he buys the 
                         bugs, starting with U.S. Customs...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE SURVEILLANCE VAN - DAY (DRIVING)

               The van is crammed with an impressive array of hi-tech 
               equipment, all CLICKING and HUMMING. Burroughs is talking 
               quietly on a scrambler phone, while another agent works a 
               computer.

                                     CRAWFORD (O.S.)
                         Maybe we can locate some of Raspail's 
                         old lovers. Maybe, someday...

               CLARICE AND CRAWFORD

               sit in swivel seats at the rear, by a big window. Clarice 
               can't resit an occasional peak at the trailing motorcade, 
               awed and a bit thrilled to be the center of so much attention.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         But for Catherine Martin, it all 
                         comes down to you and Lecter. You're 
                         the one he talks to.

                                     CLARICE
                         He's already offered to help... What 
                         would happen if we just showed our 
                         cards - asked him for Bill?

                                     CRAWFORD
                         He offered to help, Starling, not to 
                         snitch. That wouldn't give him enough 
                         chance to show off. Remember, Lecter 
                         looks mainly for fun. Never forget 
                         fun.

                                     CLARICE
                         But if he knew we have so little 
                         time -

                                     CRAWFORD
                         If we act too anxious, he'll make us 
                         wait. He'll let the Senator keep 
                         hoping, day after day, until Catherine 
                         finally washes up. That'd be the 
                         most fun of all.

                                     CLARICE
                         I think he means it, this time. I 
                         think he'll deal.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         What would it take?

                                     CLARICE
                         Transfer to a new prison. With a 
                         view of trees, he said, or even 
                         water... Can we swing that?

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (shakes his head)
                         State to federal jurisdiction... We 
                         can do it - eventually - but we'll 
                         never get all the clearances in time. 
                         Can you convince him a deal's already 
                         in place?

                                     CLARICE
                         You'll back me up with some paperwork?
                              (he nods)
                         Then I'll try. But wouldn't this 
                         have more weight coming from the 
                         Senator herself?

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (hesitates)
                         She doesn't know what we're up to. 
                         And we can't afford to let her find 
                         out.

               Clarice looks at him, surprised.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         She's the mother, Starling. She can't 
                         possibly comprehend what Lecter is. 
                         She'd make the mistake of pleading 
                         with him. Begging him... He'd feast 
                         on her pain till the last second of 
                         that girl's life...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BALTIMORE STATE HOSP. FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE - DAY

               Chilton approaches, walking briskly down a corridor in the 
               administration wing. He looks quite agitated.

                                     CRAWFORD (V.O.)
                         We can't trust Frederick Chilton, 
                         either. He's greedy and ambitious. 
                         If he knew about Lecter's link to 
                         Bill, he's go straight to the 
                         newspapers...

               Chilton falls into step beside Clarice, who has her briefcase. 
               He points his gold pen at her accusingly.

                                     CHILTON
                         What you're doing, Miss Starling, is 
                         coming into my hospital to conduct 
                         an interview, and refusing to share 
                         information with me. For the third 
                         time!

                                     CLARICE
                         Dr. Chilton, I told you - this is 
                         just routine follow-up on the Raspail 
                         case.

                                     CHILTON
                         He's my patient! I have rights!
                              (grabs her arm, 
                              stopping her)
                         I'm not just some turnkey, Miss 
                         Starling. I shouldn't even be here 
                         this afternoon. I had a ticket to 
                         Holiday on Ice.

               She stares at him, with pity and distaste, till he lets go.

                                     CLARICE
                         I'm acting on instruction, Dr. 
                         Chilton.
                              (handing him a card)
                         This is the U.S. Attorney's number. 
                         Now please - either discuss this 
                         with him, or let me do my job.

               She walks away, leaving him speechless with frustration and 
               hostility. He clicks his pen, watching her go.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DR. LECTER'S CELL AND CORRIDOR - DAY

               Dr. Lecter sits at his table, languidly sketching with 
               charcoal on butcher paper.

               He uses his own hand and forearm as a model. His other 
               drawings, books, and bedding have been restored.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Wouldn't you say, Clarice, that for 
                         a United States Senator, you're an 
                         odd choice of messenger?

               Clarice, sitting again at the desk-chair, is taking papers 
               from her briefcase.

                                     CLARICE
                         I was your choice, Dr. Lecter. You 
                         chose to speak to me. Would you prefer 
                         someone else now? Or perhaps you 
                         don't think you can help us.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         That is both impudent and untrue... 
                         Tell me, how did you feel when you 
                         viewed our Billy's latest effort?
                              (beat; he smiles)
                         Or should I say, his "next-to-latest"?

                                     CLARICE
                         By the book, he's a sadist.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Life's too slippery for books, 
                         Clarice. Typhoid and swans came from 
                         the same God.
                              (beat)
                         Tell me, Miss West Virginia - was 
                         she a large girl?

                                     CLARICE
                         Yes.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Big through the hips. Roomy.

                                     CLARICE
                         They all were.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Mmm. And what else...?

                                     CLARICE
                         She had an insect deliberately 
                         inserted in her throat. That hasn't 
                         been made public yet. We don't know 
                         what is means.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Was it a butterfly?

                                     CLARICE
                              (pause; staring at 
                              him)
                         A moth... How did you predict that?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         I'm waiting for your offer, Clarice. 
                         Enchant me.

               Clarice looks down at her papers, taking a moment to collect 
               her thoughts. She looks up at him again, evenly.

                                     CLARICE
                         If you help us find Buffalo Bill in 
                         time to save Catherine Martin, the 
                         Senator promises you a transfer to 
                         the V.A. hospital at Oneida Park, 
                         New York, with a view of the woods 
                         nearby. Maximum security still 
                         applies, but you'd have reasonable 
                         access to books.

               He is silent. She rises, moves closer, carrying papers.

                                     CLARICE
                         Best of all, though - one week a 
                         year you'd get to leave the hospital 
                         and go here.
                              (points to a map)
                         Plum Island. Every afternoon of that 
                         week you can walk on the beach or 
                         swim in the ocean for up to one hour. 
                         Under SWAT team surveillance, of 
                         course...

               His face remains neutral. She puts the papers in his food 
               tray.

                                     CLARICE
                         Copy of the Buffalo Bill case file, 
                         copy of Senator Martin's terms. Her 
                         offer is final and non-negotiable. 
                         If Catherine dies -
                              (she slides his tray 
                              through)
                         You get nothing.

               A measured beat, before he rises smoothly, crosses, and looks 
               down at the papers, without touching them.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         "Plum Island Animal Disease Research 
                         Center." Sounds charming.

                                     CLARICE
                         That's just part of the island. It 
                         has a very nice beach. Terns nest 
                         there.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Terns... If I help you, Clarice, it 
                         will be "turns" with us, too. Quid 
                         pro quo. I tell you things, you tell 
                         me things. Not about this case, though - 
                         about yourself. Yes or no?
                              (she is silent)
                         Yes or no, Clarice. Catherine is 
                         waiting. Tick-tock, tick-tock...

               She looks at him. A beat. They are standing uncomfortably 
               close.

                                     CLARICE
                         Go, Doctor.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         What's your worst memory of childhood?
                              (she hesitates)
                         Quicker than that. I'm not interested 
                         in your worst invention.

                                     CLARICE
                         The death of my father.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Tell me. Don't lie, or I'll know.

               Clarice cannot bear the feverish excitement in his eyes. She 
               looks past him, hesitating again.

                                     CLARICE
                         He was a town marshal... one night 
                         he surprised two burglars, coming 
                         out the back of a drugstore... They 
                         shot him.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Killed outright?

                                     CLARICE
                         No. He was strong, he lasted almost 
                         a month. My mother - died when I was
                         very young, so my father had become - 
                         the whole world to me... After he 
                         left me, I had nobody. I was ten 
                         years old.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         You're very frank, Clarice. I think - 
                         it would be quite something to know 
                         you in private life.

                                     CLARICE
                         Quid pro quo, Doctor.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         The significance of the moth is 
                         change. Caterpillar into cocoon into 
                         beauty... Billy wants to change, 
                         too, Clarice. But there's the problem 
                         of his size, you see. Even if he 
                         were a woman, he'd have to be a big 
                         one...

                                     CLARICE
                              (puzzled)
                         Dr. Lecter, there's no correlation 
                         in the literature between 
                         transsexualism and violence. 
                         Transsexuals are very passive.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Clever girl. You're so close to the 
                         way you're going to catch him - do 
                         you realize that?

                                     CLARICE
                         No. Tell me why.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         After your father's death, you were 
                         orphaned. What happened next?
                              (Clarice drops her 
                              gaze)
                         I don't imagine the answer's on those 
                         second-rate shoes, Clarice.

                                     CLARICE
                         I went to live with my mother's cousin 
                         and her husband in Montana. They had 
                         a ranch.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         A cattle ranch?

                                     CLARICE
                         Horses - and sheep...

                                     DR. LECTER
                         How long did you live there?

                                     CLARICE
                         Two months.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Why so briefly?

                                     CLARICE
                         I - ran away...

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Why, Clarice? Did the rancher fuck 
                         you?

                                     CLARICE
                              (angrily)
                         No.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Did he try to?

                                     CLARICE
                         No...! Quid pro quo, Doctor.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Billy's not a real transsexual, but 
                         he thinks he is. He tries to be. 
                         He's tried to be a lot of things, I 
                         expect.

                                     CLARICE
                         You said - I was very close to the 
                         way we'd catch him.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         There are three major centers for 
                         transsexual surgery: Johns Hopkins, 
                         the University of Minnesota, and 
                         Columbus Medical center. I wouldn't 
                         be surprised if Billy has applied 
                         for sex reassignment at one or all 
                         of them, and been rejected.

                                     CLARICE
                         On what basis would they reject him?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         The personality inventories would 
                         trip him up. Rorschach, Wechsler, 
                         House-Tree-Person... He wouldn't 
                         test like a real transsexual.

                                     CLARICE
                         How would he test?

               Suddenly Dr. Lecter snarls, loudly, stretching. Clarice take 
               a sharp step backwards before he smiles, turning his movement 
               into an elaborate yawn. He gathers the papers from his tray.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         That's enough, I think. Happy hunting. 
                         Oh, and Clarice - next time you will 
                         tell me why you ran away. Shall I 
                         summarize?

                                     CLARICE
                              (shaken)
                         Yes, Doctor. Please.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MR. GUMB'S CELLAR - DAY

               VERY CLOSE ON a cocoon, split along its back, as a living 
               Death's-head Moth wriggles torturously free. Trembling and 
               damp, the new creature clings to a sprig of nightshade.

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         You should try to obtain a list of 
                         males rejected from all three gender 
                         reassignment centers...

               PULLING BACK

               we see a big wire cage, holding several of the moths. They 
               crawl over the humus floor or feed at honeycombs, wings 
               pumping lazily. In the distant background, the incongruous 
               SOUND of show music.

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         Check first the ones rejected for 
                         lying about criminal records...

               CONTINUOUS MOVING ANGLE

               at about knee level, as we leave the cage, and begin to TRAVEL 
               through this eerie, dimly-lit warren of a cellar.

               As we go - occasionally TURNING corners, or skirting the 
               dark openings of unexplored passages - various objects loom 
               briefly INTO VIEW, overhead - a stainless-steel work table... 
               a big sink... jars of chemicals... neat racks of gleaming 
               knives...

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         Among those who tried to conceal 
                         their past, look for severe childhood 
                         disturbances, associated with 
                         violence... Possibly you'll find a 
                         childhood incarceration... Then go 
                         to their personality tests...

               We pass a row of female mannequins, some nude, some wearing 
               colorful leather jackets, designer knockoffs, in various 
               stages of completion... then a huge maroon armoire, in Chinese 
               lacquer; its double doors are slightly ajar... The jaunty 
               background.

               MUSIC is growing even louder: Fats Waller singing "Bye Bye 
               Baby." And now we hear something else, too - the rapid 
               CLICKING of a sewing machine...

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         Study their drawings, especially. 
                         Billy's house drawings will show no 
                         happy future... No baby carriage, 
                         out in the yard. No pets, no toys, 
                         no flowers, no sun...

               We TURN another corner, and there is Mr. Gumb himself. As we 
               APPROACH, his wide back is to us; he's hunched over an old-
               fashioned sewing machine, humming cheerfully, and working a 
               piece of material that we mercifully cannot see. A female 
               wig rests near him on a head form. He wears a hairnet and a 
               beautiful kimono, and pumps the treadle with his bare feet.

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         His females will be more crudely 
                         sketched than him males - but he'll 
                         compensate by adding exaggerated 
                         adornments... jewelry, big breasts... 
                         And his tree drawings - oh, his trees 
                         will be frightful...

               Next to Mr. Gumb is an antique phonograph - source of the 
               MUSIC. His little dog, Precious, perches by his plump ankles. 
               As we PASS Mr. Gumb, Precious scurries away from him, panting 
               happily, and we FOLLOW the little dog down another corridor, 
               the music starting to fade behind us...

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         Billy hates his own identity, he 
                         always has - and he thinks that makes 
                         him a transsexual. But his pathology 
                         is a thousand times more savage... 
                         He wants to be reborn, Clarice. He 
                         will be reborn...

               At the end of this final corridor, the cellar widens into a 
               low-ceilinged chamber, with two additional doorways, and in 
               the center of this is the gaping circle of the oubliette. 
               Precious sniffs her way over to the edge - excited, tail 
               wagging - than BARKS happily as we hear a hoarse, ghostly 
               moan from below.

                                     CATHERINE (O.S.)
                         Pleeeeeeeease.....!

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               MOVING ANGLE - CLOSE ON Dr. Lecter's slippered feet, which 
               rest on the shelf of a rolling hand truck. RISING along his 
               tilted form, we see that his ankles are linked by steel 
               restraints... his legs, waist, upper torso, and arms are 
               bound by heavy canvas webbing... beneath the webbing is a 
               strait-jacket... and over his face is a hockey mask.

                                     CHILTON (V.O.)
                         Bad news, Hannibal...

               WIDER ANGLE

               shows that Dr. Lecter, on the handtruck, is being pushed 
               down his corridor by Barney, and back into his open cell.

                                     CHILTON (V.O.)
                         Gourmet magazine has rejected your 
                         recipe for braised kidneys...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DR. LECTER'S CELL - DAY

               Chilton lounges on Dr. Lecter's cot, casually reading his 
               large stack of private correspondence, and making notations 
               with his gold pen on a little pad. Another orderly mops the 
               floor.

                                     CHILTON
                         Perhaps you should have been less 
                         specific about what kind.
                              (to Barney)
                         Stand him by the toilet. Then leave 
                         us.

               Barney props the hand truck into position, then both orderlies 
               go. Chilton finishes another letter, sighs happily.

                                     CHILTON
                         Such a lot of correspondence! I can 
                         hardly wait to analyze it in more 
                         detail... But first things first.

               Tossing letters onto the cot, he rises, crosses out into the 
               corridor, and bends to remove a small tape recorder from 
               underneath Clarice's desk. He waggles it triumphantly at Dr. 
               Lecter.

                                     CHILTON
                         I thought she might be looking for a 
                         civil rights violation in Migg's 
                         death, so I bugged you... Not a word 
                         to me in all these years, Hannibal. 
                         Then Crawford sends his bit of fluff 
                         over here, and you just turn to jelly. 
                         It's too pathetic.

               SIDE ANGLE - TWO SHOT

               as Chilton, back in the cell, leans tauntingly close to the 
               front of Dr. Lecter's mask.

                                     CHILTON
                         You still think you're going to walk 
                         on some beach, and see the birdies? 
                         I don't think so, Hannibal... I called 
                         Senator Ruth Martin, and she never 
                         heard of any deal with you. She never 
                         heard of Clarice Starling, either. 
                         They scammed you, Hannibal...

               CLOSE ON Dr. Lecter's glittering eyes, behind their slits.

                                     CHILTON
                         When Crawford gets through milking 
                         you, he's giving you to Baltimore 
                         Homicide for the Raspail murder. And 
                         they're preparing some special 
                         surprises for you right now, in my 
                         electroshock room.

               DR. LECTER'S POV (FRAMED BY EYE-SLITS)

               first looking at Chilton's moving lips... then LOWERING to 
               his soft, white, inviting throat...

                                     CHILTON
                         The Starling bitch wants you to rot 
                         here, in this little box, till your 
                         teeth fall out and you're soiling 
                         diapers. You've seen the old ones, 
                         Hannibal. They weep when their stewed 
                         peaches get cold. That'll be you, 
                         too. Unless - you trade with me.

               FAVORING CHILTON

               as he sits chummily on the table.

                                     CHILTON
                         There never was a deal with Senator 
                         Martin - but there is now. I've been 
                         on the phone for hours, Hannibal, on 
                         your behalf. Here's what you get: if 
                         you identify Buffalo Bill, and the 
                         girl is found in time, Senator Martin 
                         will have you transferred to Brushy 
                         Mountain State Prison, in Tennessee...

               CLOSE AGAIN ON DR. LECTER'S EYES

               as they shift restlessly, away from Chilton - then suddenly 
               lock onto something. They widen with interest.

                                     CHILTON (O.S.)
                         The Governor has already agreed. You 
                         get books, a view of the woods, and 
                         plenty of exercise time...

               DR. LECTER'S POV - EXTREME CLOSEUP

               On the cot, carelessly left there, lying half-hidden under 
               the letters and the rumpled sheet... is Chilton's gold pen.

                                     CHILTON (O.S.)
                         And best of all, you'd be out of 
                         Jack Crawford's reach, forever. The 
                         Senator will verify these terms on 
                         the phone, and guarantee them in 
                         writing...

               BACK ON DR. LECTER

               as he stares a moment longer at the pen, then shifts his 
               eyes towards Chilton. We can almost hear his brain clicking.

                                     CHILTON (O.S.)
                         In exchange, I get your full 
                         cooperation in publishing a 
                         professional account of this - my 
                         successful interviews with you. You 
                         publish nothing. And I get exclusive 
                         access to any material from Catherine 
                         Martin... So. Do you accept my 
                         demands?
                              (pause)
                         Answer me, Hannibal.

               A beat. Dr. Lecter is silent. Chilton sticks his face INTO 
               SHOT, almost intimately close to the mask. He is agitated.

                                     CHILTON
                         You'll answer me now, or by God, 
                         you'll answer to Baltimore Homicide. 
                         Who is Buffalo Bill?

                                     DR. LECTER
                              (pause; then softly)
                         I'll tell the Senator herself. But 
                         only in Tennessee...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. JOHNS HOPKINS - GENDER IDENTITY CLINIC - DAY

               MOVING ANGLE - as the very impatient Crawford, clutching a 
               folder, strides down a hall beside DR. DANIELSON - early 
               50's, severe, in a lab coat. Nurses, doctors, glance as they 
               pass.

                                     DR. DANIELSON
                         I'm not having a witch hunt here, 
                         Mr. Crawford! Our patients are decent, 
                         non-violent people with a real 
                         problem.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Dr. Danielson, the man we want was 
                         never your patient. It would be 
                         someone you refused because he tries 
                         to conceal a record of criminal 
                         violence. Please, Doctor - time is 
                         eating us up. Just show me the ones 
                         you've turned away.

               Danielson enters a cramped, stainless steel nurse's gallery, 
               with Crawford following, and pours himself a cup of coffee.

                                     DR. DANIELSON
                              (adamantly)
                         Examination and interview materials 
                         are confidential. We've never violated 
                         an applicant's trust, and we never 
                         will.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         You want to see a violation? This is 
                         a violation...

               He takes a black & white photo from his folder, slaps it 
               down in front of Danielson. From our angle, we can't see it 
               clearly.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Her name is Kimberly Jane Emberg, 
                         she was just ID'd. I met her on a 
                         slab in West Virginia. And sometime 
                         tomorrow, or tomorrow night, he's 
                         going to do the same thing to 
                         Catherine Martin.

                                     DR. DANIELSON
                         That's a childish, bullying stunt, 
                         Mr. Crawford. I was a battlefield 
                         surgeon, so you can put away your 
                         picture.

               Burroughs sticks his head in, looking for Crawford.

                                     BURROUGHS
                         Phone, Jack. Director Burke.

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (snaps)
                         In a minute!

               Burroughs hurriedly retreats. Crawford strains for patience.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Look... search your own records, if 
                         you prefer. You can do it a lot faster 
                         than us, anyway. If we find Buffalo 
                         Bill through your information, I'll 
                         suppress it. Nobody has to know this 
                         hospital cooperated.

                                     DR. DANIELSON
                         I doubt very much that the FBI or 
                         any other government agency can keep 
                         a secret, Mr. Crawford. Truth will 
                         out... And then what? Will you give 
                         Johns Hopkins a new identity? Put a 
                         big pair of sunglasses on this 
                         building, and a funny nose?

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Oh, that's clever, Dr. Danielson. 
                         Very humorous. You like the truth? 
                         Try this.
                              (right in his face, 
                              enraged)
                         He kidnaps young women and kills 
                         them and rips their skin off. We 
                         don't want him to do that anymore. 
                         If you don't help me, just as fast 
                         as you can, then the Justice 
                         Department is going to ask publicly 
                         for a court order, We'll ask twice a 
                         day, just in time for the morning 
                         and evening news. And each one of 
                         our press conferences will focus on 
                         Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins, 
                         and how we're still hoping for his 
                         cooperation. And every time there's 
                         any news on the case - when Catherine 
                         Martin floats, when the next one 
                         floats, and the next one - why, we'll 
                         just issue another press release 
                         about good ol' Dr. Danielson, over 
                         at Johns Hopkins - complete with all 
                         his humorous fucking remarks.

                                     DR. DANIELSON
                              (pause; stiffly)
                         It may be that - I could confer with 
                         my colleagues on this. And get back 
                         to you.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Would you, Doctor? That would be so 
                         kind.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE SURVEILLANCE VAN - DAY

               Crawford is on the scrambler phone. Burroughs watches 
               silently.

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (on phone; stunned)

               INT. FBI BUILDING - OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR - DAY

               HAYDEN BURKE, the FBI Director, swivels in his big chair. 
               Lean, late 40's, very distinguished. His desk is flanked by 
               flags.

                                     DIRECTOR BURKE
                              (on phone)
                         Already airborne for Memphis. Senator 
                         Martin's meeting him at the airport.
                              (uneasily)
                         Jack - did you make some sort of 
                         promise to Lecter, in the Senator's 
                         name?

               Listening to the answer, he looks uncomfortably across his 
               desk at PAUL KRENDLER, the Deputy Attorney General - 40, 
               very tanned, modish haircut. Krendler is irritable, impatient.

                                     DIRECTOR BURKE
                              (on phone)
                         We're going to have to talk about 
                         this, Jack. The Senator's mad as 
                         hell. Paul Krendler's over here from 
                         Justice, she's asking him to take 
                         charge in Memphis... I know that... 
                         But you're still in command of the 
                         task force, and Lecter's plane can 
                         still be ordered back. It's your 
                         call, Jack - but I want it now.

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

               INT. THE SURVEILLANCE VAN - DAY

               Burroughs starts to make an objection, but Crawford stills 
               him with a hand motion. He is taut, frustrated. Long pause.

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (into phone)
                         Let him land.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT.CLARICE'S DORM ROOM - DOORWAY - DAY

               Clarice opens her door, stares out at Crawford. She's just 
               slipping on her blazer, over her shoulder holster. She's 
               furious.

                                     CLARICE
                         Chilton has killed her, hasn't he? 
                         That slimy little bastard! We were 
                         so close with Lecter - and now her 
                         last chance is gone.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Let's get some coffee and talk.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. FBI ACADEMY GROUNDS - QUANTICO - DAY

               MOVING ANGLE on Clarice and Crawford, as they walk along a 
               sidewalk, sipping from paper cups. The surveillance van trails 
               them slowly, radios CRACKLING.

                                     CLARICE
                         Are you in trouble over this, Mr. 
                         Crawford? Can Senator Martin do 
                         something to you?

                                     CRAWFORD
                         I'm 53, Starling. If I found Jimmy 
                         Hoffa on national TV, I'd still have 
                         to retire in two years. It's not a 
                         consideration. But you are...
                              (beat)
                         You've done enough. If I keep you 
                         out of school any longer, you'll be 
                         recycled. Cost you six months, at 
                         least. I can guarantee you readmission 
                         here, but that's about it.
                              (he stops, looks at 
                              her)
                         Now's your chance, Starling. Go back 
                         to class. Leave Bill to me.

                                     CLARICE
                         If you didn't want me chasing him, 
                         you shouldn't have taken me to that 
                         funeral home.

               He looks at her steadily, then nods. They walk on.

                                     CLARICE
                         Lecter is still the key, I know he 
                         is. Whatever he told me about Bill 
                         is just as good now as it was before.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Or just as worthless. But I want you 
                         in Memphis, close to him. Maybe when 
                         he gets tired of toying with Senator 
                         Martin, he'll talk to you again. 
                         There's a plane waiting for you now 
                         at the airstrip.

               She smiles at this acknowledgment; he never thought she's 
               quit.

                                     CLARICE
                         I lied to Lecter. I'll need some 
                         kind of peace offering... Can I get 
                         the drawings from his cell?

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Good idea. Meantime, try to get a 
                         feel for Catherine Martin. Her 
                         apartment, her friends... how he 
                         might've stalked her. I'm going to 
                         the other two clinics, Minnesota and 
                         Ohio.
                              (he crumples his cup, 
                              tosses it)
                         Now's the hardest part, Starling. 
                         Use your anger, don't let it keep 
                         you from thinking. Just keep your 
                         eyes on Catherine. We've got less 
                         than 30 hours.

                                     CLARICE
                              (hesitates)
                         Mr. Crawford... can those cops down 
                         there handle Dr. Lecter?

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (grimly)
                         They'll use their best men. But they 
                         better be paying attention...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. AIR NATIONAL GUARD HANGER - MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE - DAY

               CLOSE ON Dr. Lecter. Behind his mask, the alert, searching 
               eyes.

                                     CRAWFORD (V.O.)
                         He will...

               OFFICERS PEMBRY AND BOYLE

               two sturdy, well-armed, veteran prison guards - are checking 
               Dr. Lecter's restraints with clever, careful fingers.

                                     BOYLE
                         Welcome to Memphis, Dr. Lecter. I'm 
                         Officer Boyle, this is Officer Pembry. 
                         We aim to treat you just as nice as 
                         you treat us. Act like a gentlemen, 
                         you'll get three hots and a cot.

                                     PEMBRY
                         But we ain't pussy-footin' with you, 
                         buddy ruff. You get cute, try to 
                         bite somebody? - we'll tie your 
                         asshole in a knot. You savvy?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Oh yes, Officer Pembry. I certainly 
                         do.

               The officers turn away, Boyle signing a clipboarded form.

                                     PEMBRY
                              (under his breath)
                         Shit, he's just an ol' broke-dick. 
                         Won't be no trouble as all if he 
                         don't flip out.

                                     BOYLE
                         Dr. Chilton...?

               NEW ANGLE - WIDER

               as we see that we're in a vast, dusty hangar. Parked to one 
               side: an EMS ambulance and four highway patrol cruisers; a 
               dozen troopers stand quietly chatting and smoking over there. 
               Prentiss is pacing impatiently, casting anxious glances 
               towards the open hanger doorway.

                                     BOYLE
                         If you'll please sign right here, 
                         sir, we'll have us a legal transfer.

               Chilton instinctively pats his shirt pocket for his gold 
               pen; it's gone. He searches other pockets, with growing 
               unhappiness.

                                     BOYLE
                         Use mine.

                                     PEMBRY
                         Here they come.

               TWO BLACK STRETCH LIMOUSINES

               glide smoothly into the hangar, stop. Secret Service agents 
               pour out of the lead car, form a cordon. A driver opens the 
               rear door of the second car, and Krendler steps out, followed 
               by the Senator's assistant, with a briefcase, followed, as 
               last, by the Senator herself. Barely glancing around, she 
               strides towards Lecter.

               NEW ANGLE - DR. LECTER AND SEN. MARTIN

               as she stops, struck by the bizarre spectacle of his 
               restraints. The others instinctively keep a distance, but 
               Chilton, with theatrical relish, unstraps and removes Dr. 
               Lecter's mask.

                                     CHILTON
                         Senator Martin, meet Dr. Hannibal 
                         Lecter.

               They stare at one another for a long moment: the Senator 
               tense, almost haggard, the madman with his unearthly poise.

                                     SEN. MARTIN
                         Dr. Lecter, I've brought an affidavit 
                         guaranteeing your new rights... You'll 
                         want to read it before I sign.

               He assistant unsnaps his briefcase, reaches for the form.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         I won't waste your time and 
                         Catherine's time bargaining for petty 
                         privileges. Clarice Starling and 
                         that awful Jack Crawford have wasted 
                         far too much already. I only pray 
                         they haven't doomed the poor girl... 
                         Let me help you now, and I'll trust 
                         you when it's all over.

                                     SEN. MARTIN
                         You have my word. Paul?

               Krendler raises a pad, poised to take notes.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Buffalo Bill's real name is William 
                         Rubin. I met him just once. He was 
                         referred to me in April or May, 1980, 
                         by my patient Benjamin Raspail. They 
                         were lovers, but Raspail had become 
                         very frightened. Apparently Rubin 
                         had murdered a transient, and - done 
                         things with the skin. He thought if 
                         I could cure Billy, then Billy'd be 
                         safe from the police, and he's be 
                         safe from Billy... Obviously, he was 
                         wrong.

                                     KRENDLER
                         We need his address, a physical descr-

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Did you nurse Catherine?

                                     SEN. MARTIN
                              (pause; startled)
                         What...?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Did you breast-feed her?

               He flicks his tongue obscenely.

                                     KRENDLER
                         You son-of-a -

               The Senator stills him with a hand. She is trembling.

                                     SEN. MARTIN
                         Yes... I did.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Toughened your nipples, didn't it...?
                              (a beat; then rapidly, 
                              bored)
                         Six foot one, strongly built, about 
                         190 pounds. Hair brown, eyes pale 
                         blue. He'd be about 35 now. He said 
                         he lived in Philadelphia, but may 
                         have lied. That's really all I can 
                         remember, Senator - but if I think 
                         of any more, I'll let you know.

                                     SEN. MARTIN
                              (to the others)
                         Let's go with it.

               They start towards the car, but he calls out, stopping her.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Senator Martin...! You can't trust 
                         Jack Crawford or Clarice Starling. 
                         It's such a game with these people. 
                         They're determined to get the arrest 
                         for themselves. The "collar," I think 
                         they say.

                                     SEN. MARTIN
                         Thank you, Doctor. I'll keep it in 
                         mind.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Oh, and Senator...? Love you suit.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. MR. GUMB'S BASEMENT - DAY (DIMLY LIT)

               CLOSE ON scraps of food - peas, chicken bones - lying on the 
               cement floor of the pit, near the foil tray of a TV dinner.

                                     CATHERINE (O.S.)
                              (muttering, feisty)
                         Close enough to fuck is close enough 
                         to fight...

               CATHERINE

               is hunched over in concentration. The plastic toilet bucket 
               is on her lap, and she has yanked down its cotton string.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Get my legs round your neck, you 
                         goddamn creep, I'll send you home to 
                         Jesus...

               HER FINGERS

               are tying a chicken bone to the bucket's handle, where it 
               meets the string. The other end of the string is tied to her 
               wrist.

               SHE STANDS

               gathers the coiled string in one hand, and swings the bucket 
               by its handle, calculating this distance up to the basement 
               floor.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Okay, Precious. Time for a treat...

               She hurls the bucket upwards.

               AT THE LIP OF THE OUBLIETTE

               the bucket sails out, bounces LOUDLY, then falls back inside.

               ANGLE ON THE DOG, PRECIOUS

               who is elsewhere in the basement, worrying a toy. She cocks 
               an ear, making a low GROWL, then sets off to investigate.

               DOWN IN THE PIT

               Catherine swings the bucket again, trying another cast.

               THE BUCKET LANDS

               two feet beyond the pit's edge, rolls a bit, stops.

               PRECIOUS TROTS UP

               then pauses, staring curiously towards...

               VERY LOW ANGLE (DOG'S POV)

               the enticing chicken bone, six feet away. It twitches as 
               Catherine tugs on the string, edging the bucket back towards 
               the pit.

               Precious with her tail wagging, BARKS - greedy but suspicious.

               CATHERINE

               staring upwards, pulls again, even so gently, at the string.

                                     CATHERINE
                              (softly)
                         Preeeeecious...! C'mon, boy, nice 
                         yummy bone... c'mon, you little 
                         shit...

               PRECIOUS

               edges reluctantly closer... then suddenly rushes in, seizing 
               the bone in her teeth. She tries to run away with it, but 
               Catherine is pulling her towards the hole, working her like 
               a hooked fish. Her toenails scrabble as she tries to stop.

               CATHERINE

               stares desperately, unable to see how she's doing.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Hang on, boy... hang on...

               PRECIOUS

               still fights for the bone, GROWLING, as the bucket rocks 
               precariously on the edge of the pit. A long, seesaw battle... 
               until finally, when one of her forelegs slips momentarily 
               into the hole, she panics and lets go. The bucket flops over 
               the edge.

               CATHERINE

               crouches, covering her head as the bucket bounces off her.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Nooooo...!

               THE LITTLE DOG

               furious, BARKS down at her, then trots away in disgust.

               CLOSE ON CATHERINE

               as she sinks to the cold cement. She slaps aside the foil 
               tray, the scraps of food, sobbing in utter despair...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. CATHERINE MARTIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

               CLOSE ON a framed photo of Sen. Martin and Catherine, held 
               in Clarice's cotton-gloved hands. Powdered fingerprints on 
               the glass.

               Clarice glances up from the photo, smiles disarmingly at -

               A young STATE TROOPER sitting in Catherine's easy chair. He 
               smiles back at her, then relaxes, returns to his newspaper. 
               He also wears gloves.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KITCHEN

               Clarice closes the refrigerator door, glances around.

               A big REEL-TO-REEL TAPE RECORDER has been set up on the 
               breakfast counter, attached to Catherine's phone. Two new 
               red phones are hooked up as well.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BATHROOM

               Clarice slides open the medicine cabinet's mirror, looks 
               inside. She reaches in, pokes carefully amongst the lotions.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ATTIC CRAWL-SPACE

               A ceiling hatch bangs open, sending up dust clouds. Clarice, 
               lit from underneath, pokes her head through, looking around.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BEDROOM

               Flat on her back, Clarice wriggles out from under Catherine's 
               bed. She sits up, brushing dust from her face and hair.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BEDROOM

               CLOSE ON an open, multi-tiered jewelry box, resting atop a 
               bureau, as Clarice's fingers pick through costume jewelry.

               Clarice closes the box, and is just turning away when a figure 
               suddenly looms INTO SHOT, giving her a bad start; she cries 
               out softly.

               Senator Martin is revealed, staring at her suspiciously.

                                     SEN. MARTIN
                         Who are you, please? I thought the 
                         police were through in here.

                                     CLARICE
                         I'm Clarice Starling, Senator. FBI.

                                     SEN. MARTIN
                              (softly, very angry)
                         Clarice Starling...
                              (calls out)
                         Paul? Would you come in here, 
                         please...?

               Krendler enters from the hallway, looks at Clarice.

                                     SEN. MARTIN
                         Miss Starling, you may know the Deputy 
                         Attorney General, Mr. Krendler. Paul, 
                         this is the trainee that Jack Crawford 
                         sent to Lecter... She lied to him, 
                         pretending to have my authority, and 
                         thus jeopardized this entire 
                         investigation. Now she has the further 
                         gall to invade my daughter's privacy, 
                         again without permission. If her 
                         little games have killed my baby...

               Overcome, she hurries from the room. Krendler shuts the door 
               behind her, points sternly at Clarice.

                                     KRENDLER
                         You're out of line, Starling, and 
                         you're off this case. Back to 
                         Quantico.

                                     CLARICE
                         Sir, Mr. Crawford instructed me -

                                     KRENDLER
                         Your instructions are what I'm giving 
                         you now. Jack Crawford answers to 
                         the Director, and the Director answers 
                         to me. My God, Crawford's losing 
                         it...! He shouldn't even be on this, 
                         with his wife sick as she is... How 
                         the hell did you get in here, anyway? 
                         He gave you - what? Some kind of 
                         special ID? Let's have it.

                                     CLARICE
                              (stubbornly)
                         I need the ID to fly with my gun. 
                         The gun belongs in Quantico.

                                     KRENDLER
                         Gun. Jesus. Turn in the ID as soon 
                         as you get back. The gun, too. Be on 
                         the next plane, Starling, there's 
                         one in 90 minutes.

               Clarice, burning, starts for the door, then turns back.

                                     CLARICE
                         Mr. Krendler... Dr. Lecter trusts 
                         me. Or at least, he used to. If I 
                         could just -

                                     KRENDLER
                         Lecter has already named Buffalo 
                         Bill.

               Clarice reacts, surprised. Krendler takes a folded computer 
               sheet from his pocket, shoves it at her. She takes it, reads.

                                     KRENDLER
                         He gave us a perfectly good 
                         description, and we're on it now, so 
                         we won't be needing your little 
                         novelty act any longer - or his, 
                         either. He's under close guard at 
                         the courthouse, pending a prison 
                         transfer. The next plane, Officer.

                                     CLARICE
                         Sir, doesn't this "William Rubin" 
                         strike you as - I don't know - kind 
                         of vague?

               Krendler moves in very close to her, pale with anger.

                                     KRENDLER
                         Do you need a police escort, Starling? 
                         Or do you think you can find the 
                         airport by yourself?

                                     CLARICE
                         Yes sir. I can find it by myself.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SHELBY COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY

               The old courthouse is a massive Gothic stronghold, with an 
               armada of police cruisers parked at the curb.

               Clarice climbs from her rented car, SLAMMING the door angrily. 
               Holding a rolled-up pile of papers - Dr. Lecter's drawings - 
               she starts determinedly up the steps. A nearby commotion 
               makes her pause.

               Dr. Frederick Chilton in a sea of interviewers and mini-cams, 
               is preening grandly. 

               Clarice carefully avoiding his gaze, slips up the steps and 
               inside.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. COURTHOUSE - GROUND FLOOR - DAY

               SGT. TATE, a Memphis policeman, is studying Clarice's ID. He 
               looks up at her from his command desk, a bit doubtfully.

                                     SGT. TATE
                         Are you with Mr. Krendler's people?

                                     CLARICE
                         I just left him.

                                     SGT. TATE
                         Access to Lecter is strictly limited. 
                         We've been getting death threats.
                              (hesitates again)
                         Log in, and check your weapon.

               He picks up a phone, murmurs into it. As he does so, Clarice 
               glances around this main ground floor lobby.

               HER POV

               The building looks like an armed fort. Cops with shotguns 
               guard the front door, both ends of the hall, the foot of the 
               stairs, the single elevator. More of them are coming and 
               going.

                                     MURRAY (V.O.)
                         Shoot, we haven't had this kinda 
                         security since the President came 
                         through town...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ELEVATOR - MOVING

               Clarice and OFFICER MURRAY, a young patrolman, ride up in an 
               old-fashioned, CREAKING, metal-cage elevator. He is excited.

                                     MURRAY
                         Every cop in Tennessee wants a look 
                         at this guy. 'Sit true what they're 
                         sayin' - he's some kinda vampire?

                                     CLARICE
                              (beat)
                         I don't have a name for what he is.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HISTORICAL SOCIETY ROOM - 5TH FLOOR

               Pembry, at a desk by the door, looks up from examining the 
               unrolled pile of Dr. Lecter's drawings.

                                     PEMBRY
                         You know the rules, ma'am?

                                     CLARICE
                         Yes, Officer Pembry. I've questioned 
                         him before.

               He waves her on her way, but retains the drawings for now.

               MOVING ANGLE - WITH CLARICE

               as she crosses the big, spare, white octagonal room. A 
               massive, temporary iron cage has been installed; Officer 
               Boyle sits facing its barred door. He rises, nods, moving 
               away to allow her privacy.

               INSIDE THE CAGE

               a cot and a small table, each bolted to the floor, and a 
               flimsy paper screen, hiding a toilet. Dr. Lecter sits at the 
               table, his back to her, studying the Buffalo Bill case file. 
               He now wears a green prison jumpsuit. A small cassette player 
               is chained to the steel table.

                                     DR. LECTER
                              (without turning)
                         Good afternoon, Clarice.

               She stops at a striped police barricade, before his bars.

                                     CLARICE
                         I thought you might want your drawings 
                         back... Just until you get your view.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         How very thoughtful... Or did Crawford
                         send you here for one last wheedle - 
                         before you're both booted off the 
                         case?

                                     CLARICE
                         Nobody sent me. I came on my own.

               He spins in his swivel chair, stops neatly. A coy smile.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         People will say we're in love.
                              (beat)
                         Pity you tried to fool me, isn't it? 
                         Pity for poor Catherine. Tick-tock...

               He spins again in his chair, playfully.

               MOVING ANGLE - FAVORING CLARICE

               as she circles the cage, trying to keep his face in sight.

                                     CLARICE
                         Dr. Lecter, you find out everything. 
                         You couldn't have talked with this 
                         "William Rubin", even once, and come 
                         out knowing so little about him... 
                         You made him up, didn't you?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Clarice... you're hardly in a position 
                         to accuse me of lying.

                                     CLARICE
                         I think you were telling me the truth 
                         in Baltimore - or starting to. Tell 
                         me the rest now.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         I've studied the case file, have 
                         you...? Everything you need to find 
                         him is right in these pages. Whatever 
                         his name is.

                                     CLARICE
                         Then tell me how.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         First principles, Clarice. Simplicity. 
                         Read Marcus Aurelius. Of each 
                         particular thing, ask: What is it, 
                         in itself, what is its nature...? 
                         What does he do, this man you seek?

                                     CLARICE
                         He kills w-

                                     DR. LECTER
                              (sharply, as he stops)
                         No! That's incidental.

               CLOSE ANGLE - TWO SHOT as he rises, pained by her ignorance, 
               and crosses to the bars.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         What is the first and principal thing 
                         he does, what need does he serve by 
                         killing?

                                     CLARICE
                         Anger, social resentment, sexual 
                         frus-

                                     DR. LECTER
                         No, he covets. That's his nature. 
                         And how do we begin to covet, Clarice? 
                         Do we seek out things to covet? Make 
                         an effort to answer.

                                     CLARICE
                         No. We just -

                                     DR. LECTER
                         No. Precisely. We begin by coveting 
                         what we see every day. Don't you 
                         feel eyes moving over your body, 
                         Clarice? I hardly see how you 
                         couldn't. And don't your eyes move 
                         over the things you want?

                                     CLARICE
                         All right, then tell me how -

                                     DR. LECTER
                         No. It's your turn to tell me, 
                         Clarice. You don't have any more 
                         vacations to sell, on Anthrax Island. 
                         Why did you run away from that ranch?

                                     CLARICE
                         Dr. Lecter, when there's time I'll -

                                     DR. LECTER
                         We don't reckon time the same way, 
                         Clarice. This is all the time you'll 
                         ever have.

                                     CLARICE
                         Later, listen, I'll -

                                     DR. LECTER
                         I'll listen now. After your father's 
                         murder, you were orphaned. You were 
                         ten years old. You went to live with 
                         cousins, on a sheep and horse ranch 
                         in Montana. And - ?

                                     CLARICE
                         And - one morning I just - ran away...

               She turns from him. He presses closer, gripping the bars.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Not "just," Clarice. What set you 
                         off? You started what time?

                                     CLARICE
                         Early. Still dark.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Then something woke you. What? Did 
                         you dream...? What was it?

               IN FLASHBACK

               The 10-year old Clarice sits up abruptly in her bed, 
               frightened. She is in a Montana ranch house; it almost dawn. 
               Strange, fearful shadows on her ceiling and walls... a window, 
               partly fogged by the cold; eerie brightness outside.

                                     CLARICE (V.O.)
                         I heard a strange sound...

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         What was it?

               THE CHILD RISES

               crosses to the window in her nightgown, rubs the glass.

                                     CLARICE (V.O.)
                         I didn't know. I went to look...

               HIGH ANGLES (2ND STORY) - THE CHILD'S POV

               Shadowy men, ranch hands, are moving in and out of a nearby 
               barn, carrying mysterious bundles. The mens' breath is 
               steaming... A refrigerated truck idles nearby, its engine 
               adding more steam. A strange, almost surrealistic scene...

                                     CLARICE (V.O.)
                         Screaming! Some kind of - screaming. 
                         Like a child's voice...

               THE LITTLE GIRL

               is terrified; she covers her ears.

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         What did you do?

                                     CLARICE (V.O.)
                         Got dressed without turning on the 
                         light. I went downstairs... outside...

               THE LITTLE GIRL

               in her winter coat, slips noiselessly towards the open barn 
               door. She ducks into the shadows to avoid a ranch hand, who 
               passes her with a squirming bundle of some kind. He goes 
               into the barn, and she edges after him reluctantly.

                                     CLARICE (V.O.)
                         I crept up to the barn... I was so 
                         scared to look inside - but I had 
                         to...

               THE LITTLE GIRL'S POV

               as the open doorway LOOMS CLOSER... Bright lights inside, 
               straw bales, the edges of stalls, then moving figures...

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         And what did you see, Clarice?

               A SQUIRMING LAMB

               is held down on a table by two ranch hands.

                                     CLARICE (V.O.)
                         Lambs. The lambs were screaming...

               A third cowboy stretches out the lamb's neck, raises a bloody 
               knife. Just as he's about to slice its throat -

               BACK TO THE ADULT CLARICE

               staring into the distance, shaken, still trembling from the 
               child's shock. We see Dr. Lecter, over her shoulder, studying 
               her intently.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         They were slaughtering the spring 
                         lambs?

                                     CLARICE
                         Yes...! They were screaming.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         So you ran away...

                                     CLARICE
                         No. First I tried to free them... I 
                         opened the gate of their pen - but 
                         they wouldn't run. They just stood 
                         there, confused. They wouldn't run...

                                     DR. LECTER
                         But you could. You did.

                                     CLARICE
                         I took one lamb. And I ran away, as 
                         fast as I could...

               IN FLASHBACK

               a vast Montana plain, and crossing this, a tiny figure - the 
               little Clarice, holding a lamb in her arms.

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         Where were you going?

                                     CLARICE (V.O.)
                         I don't know. I had no food or water. 
                         It was very cold. I thought - if I 
                         can even save just one... but he got 
                         so heavy. So heavy...

               The tiny figure stops, and after a few moments sinks to the 
               ground, hunched over in dispair.

                                     CLARICE (V.O.)
                         I didn't get more than a few miles 
                         before the sheriff's car found me. 
                         The rancher was so angry he sent me 
                         to live at the Lutheran orphanage in 
                         Bozeman. I never saw the ranch 
                         again...

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         But what became of your lamb?
                              (no response)
                         Clarice...?

               BACK TO SCENE

               as the adult Clarice turns, staring into his feverish eyes. 
               She shakes her head, unwilling - or unable - to say more.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         You still wake up sometimes, don't 
                         you? Wake up in the dark, with the 
                         lambs screaming?

                                     CLARICE
                         Yes...

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Do you think if you saved Catherine, 
                         you could make them stop...? Do you 
                         think, if Catherine lives, you won't 
                         wake up in the dark, ever again, to 
                         the screaming of the lambs? Do you...?

                                     CLARICE
                         Yes! I don't know...! I don't know.

                                     DR. LECTER
                              (a pause; then, oddly 
                              at peace)
                         Thank you, Clarice.

                                     CLARICE
                              (a whisper)
                         Tell me his name, Dr. Lecter.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Dr. Chilton... I believe you know 
                         each other?

               NEW ANGLE

               as Clarice turns, startled, and the fuming Chilton seizes 
               her elbow. Pembry and Boyle are beside him, looking grim.

                                     CHILTON
                         Out. Let's go.

                                     PEMBRY
                         Sorry, ma'a m - we've got orders to 
                         have you put on a place.

               Clarice struggles, pulling free of them for a moment.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Brave Clarice. Will you let me know 
                         if ever the lambs stop screaming?

                                     CLARICE
                              (moving closer to the 
                              bars)
                         Yes. I'll tell you.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Promise...?
                              (she nods. He smiles)
                         Then why not take your case file? I 
                         won't be needing it anymore.

               He holds out the file, arm extended between the bars. She 
               hesitates, then reaches to take it.

               VERY CLOSE ANGLE - SLOW MOTION

               as the exchange is made, his index finger touches her hand, 
               and lingers there, just for a moment.

               DR. LECTER'S EYES

               widen, crackling at this touch, like sparks in a cave.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Good-bye, Clarice.

               CLARICE

               hugging the case file to her chest, stares back at him as 
               the men crowd in on her, pushing her away.

               HER POV - MOVING

               as Dr. Lecter, head cocked in a smile, slowly recedes...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. GARMENT SWEATSHOP - DAY

               MOVING ANGLE - MR. GUMB'S POV as he pushes a rolling rack of 
               completed leather garments, each wrapped in plastic, down as 
               aisle. SOUND of many sewing machines, all clattering at once, 
               as he passes row on row of work tables. The seamstresses, 
               mostly black or Hispanic, glance up as he passes, then quickly 
               avert their eyes, his presence disturbing them in some 
               nameless way.

               A thin FOREMAN in a flowery shirt, sees him approaching. He 
               rises from his desk and comes over cheerfully, as the rack 
               rolls to a stop.

                                     FOREMAN
                         Hello, dear! Punctual as always. And 
                         what have you brought us today?

               He seizes one of the dangling jackets, pulling up the plastic 
               wrapper. He examines it, stroking the sleeve.

                                     FOREMAN
                         Oh, marvelous... You know, I always 
                         say you're the Leonardo of leather.

                                     MR. GUMB (O.S.)
                              (a harsh whisper)
                         Oil.

                                     FOREMAN
                         Pardon...?

                                     MR. GUMB (O.S.)
                         You're leaving oil on the skin.

               The foreman quickly releases the jacket.

                                     FOREMAN
                         Of course... You'll be wanting your -

               Mr. Gumb's hand reaches INTO SHOT, snatching an envelope 
               from him. The foreman is watching him walk away, as a 
               seamstress comes over to take the rack of garments. The 
               foreman is vaguely troubled, but shakes it off. He strokes 
               the jacket again, admiringly.

                                     FOREMAN
                              (to seamstress)

               Clarice, in a line of other passengers, is moving slowly 
               towards a departure ramp. Through a huge plate glass window, 
               we can see her plane. She glances back over her shoulder at

               A pair of UNIFORMED COPS brawny and impassive, their arms 
               folded, waiting to make sure she board the flight.

               Clarice sighs, turning wearily back towards the jetway. The 
               BACH CONTINUES, as we...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SHELBY CO. COURTHOUSE - HISTORICAL SOCIETY ROOM -

               NIGHT

               CLOSE ON a steaming, rather elegant dinner tray, being carried 
               by Pembry, as he approaches Dr. Lecter's cell.

                                     PEMBRY
                              (shouts)
                         Ready when you are, Doc!

               IN THE CELL

               the BACH is issuing from the cassette player. Beside it, on 
               the table, the pile of Dr. Lecter's drawings. The top one is 
               an accurate, sensitive portrait, from memory, of Clarice. 
               Beyond the table, we see Lecter's shadowy form, seated behind 
               the paper screen. He calls out from there.

                                     DR. LECTER (O.S.)
                         Just another minute, please!

               Pembry grunts, sets the tray down. Boyle joins him, handing 
               him a riot baton and a Mace cannister, which Pembry fastens 
               to belt clips. Boyle is similarly armed, and carries a ring 
               of keys.

                                     PEMBRY
                         Sumbitch demanded lamb chops for 
                         dinner, extra rare.

                                     BOYLE
                              (laughs)
                         What you reckon he'll want for 
                         breakfast - some fuckin' thing from 
                         the zoo?

               INSIDE THE SCREEN

               Dr. Lecter sits fully clothed on the toilet - swaying 
               slightly, eyes closed, lost in the music, tongue working in 
               his cheek. Suddenly, like magic, a little shiny piece of 
               metal protrudes from his lips. He plucks it out, opens his 
               eyes.

               IN EXTREME CLOSEUP

               he is holding the pocket clip from Prentice's disassembled 
               pen - a straight, thin strip of metal, with a circular collar 
               at one end, a square edge at the other.

               DR. LECTER

               lines up his thumbnail just shy of the square edge, then 
               braces it against the stainless steel toilet rim. He pushes 
               down, hard, using both hands for leverage. After a moment he 
               smiles, holding up the result, and twirling it before his 
               eyes.

               IN EXTREME CLOSEUP

               the straight end of the clip now forms a tiny right angle, 
               and the circular end anchors nicely between his fingers.

               OUTSIDE THE CELL

               Pembry and Boyle turn as the toilet FLUSHES, and Dr. Lecter 
               reappears, looking jaunty.

                                     PEMBRY
                         Okay, Doc, grab some floor. Same 
                         drill as lunchtime.

               Dr. Lecter sits on the floor, legs straight, then wriggles 
               backwards. He stretches his arms behind him, hands and wrists 
               through the bars, with two bars between them, and clasps his 
               hands.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         I'm ready when you are, Officer 
                         Pembry.

               Pembry comes around the cell to squat behind Dr. Lecter. He 
               tugs his hands farther out, rather roughly, handcuffs his 
               wrists. He shakes the cuffs, making sure of them, then nods 
               to Boyle.

               NEW ANGLE - AT CELL DOOR

               as Boyle picks up the dinner tray, and Pembry crosses around. 
               Pembry takes the keys from Boyle, unlocks the cell door, and 
               pushes it inward. Boyle goes inside with the tray.

               DR. LECTER

               watches as Boyle approaches the table, above five feet from 
               him. Boyle has to set his tray down on the floor to clear 
               off some of the mess of drawings. The MUSIC plays on.

               VERY CLOSE ON

               ...Dr. Lecter's hands, outside the bars, as the makeshift 
               key, held between the tips of his right index and middle 
               fingers, searches for the keyhole of the cuffs. And finds 
               it.

               NEW ANGLE - FAVORING BOYLE

               as he finishes clearing the drawings, then turns back towards 
               Dr. Lecter, stooping to pick up the tray.

               BOYLE'S RIGHT HAND

               is just inches from the tray when Dr. Lecter's hand darts 
               INTO SHOT, snapping a handcuff onto his wrist.

               BOYLE

               looks up, astonished, to find himself right in the grinning 
               face of Dr. Lecter - who just as quickly rolls sideways, and 
               snaps -

               THE OTHER CUFF

               around the bolted leg of the table. And suddenly all natural 
               SOUND and MOTION are suspended, as the MUSIC soars much 
               louder, each separate note of it now echoing distinctly, and 
               we see...

               VARIOUS ANGLES - EACH BLURRING INTO STOP-ACTION

               Pembry starting into the cell, reaching for his riot baton... 

               Dr. Lecter smashing against the cell door, driving it into 
               Pembry, pinning him across the chest, against the door 
               frame...

               Boyle, on one knee on the floor, digging desperately in his 
               pants pocket for his handcuff key...

               Pembry's hand, mashed against his body by the door, as he 
               strains frantically to reach the baton at his waist... 

               Pembry's eyes, widening in horror as he stares at...

               Dr. Lecter's bared teeth, flashing towards him...

               Dr. Lecter gripping Pembry's face in his jaws, shaking it 
               like a dog shakes a rat...

               Boyle finding his key, but in his terror dropping it...

               Dr. Lecter yanking the mace can and riot baton from the dazed 
               Pembry's belt, spraying him in his bloody face, then clubbing 
               him to his knees...

               Boyle, mouth open in a silent scream, finding his key again, 
               unlocking the handcuff, but then, as he starts to rise, 
               seeing...

               Dr. Lecter standing over him, with the riot baton raised 
               high; he swings it viciously down, again and again and 
               again...

               Then normal SOUND and MOTION are restored as we go to -

               CLOSE ANGLE ON

               the cassette player, and the portrait of Clarice, both now 
               flecked with blood. In addition to the Bach, we now hear 
               soft PANTING, close by, and whimpering SOBS in the background.

               ANGLE ON DR. LECTER

               eyes closed, lost in a favorite passage of the music. His 
               bloody fingers drift airily with the notes, as his breathing 
               slows to normal. He opens his eyes, sighs contentedly, looks 
               down.

               HIS POV

               By the sprawled legs of Boyle lie various objects that spilled 
               from his pants pocket - coins, a comb, a big pocketknife.

               DR. LECTER

               picks up the pocketknife, examines it happily. About a four-
               inch blade. He becomes aware of the WHIMPERING, off screen, 
               turns.

               LOW ANGLE ON PEMBRY

               as he crawls, with torturous slowness, towards the command 
               desk, and the phone. He is crying, but frantically determined.

               PEMBRY'S POV - PARTIALLY BLURRED, THEN CLEARING

               Above the desk, hanging from pegs, are his and Boyle's 
               holstered revolvers...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. COURTHOUSE - GROUND FLOOR LOBBY - NIGHT

               The bronze arrow above the elevator swings towards "5," then 
               indicates a stop there, at the top floor.

               FAVORING SGT. TATE

               at his command desk, as he stares at the indicator. Another 
               cop, JACOBS, sits on the desk's edge, flipping through a 
               magazine; many more cops can be seen beyond them, idling in 
               the lobby.

                                     SGT. TATE
                         What is this shit...? Did somebody 
                         go up to five?
                              (Jacobs shakes his 
                              head)
                         Call Pembry, ask him what -

               A GUNSHOT, and then, moments later, TWO MORE quick ones, 
               echo down the nearby stairwell. Sgt. Tate jumps to his feet, 
               grabs a radio mike, as the other cops stir, confused and 
               noisy.

               THE BRONZE ARROW

               has begun to descend. Down to 4, then past 4...

               BACK ON SGT. TATE

               as he reacts. The other cops, behind him, are now in a full 
               uproar, shouting, pulling out guns.

                                     SGT. TATE
                              (to the others)
                         SHUT UP...! Guard mount, double up 
                         on your outside posts. Bobby, get 
                         the vests. Rainey, Howard, cover 
                         that fucking elevator if it comes 
                         all the way to -

                                     A COP (O.S.)
                         It stopped!

               THE BRONZE ARROW

               has, indeed, frozen at 3. Sgt. Tate lifts the microphone 
               again.

                                     SGT. TATE
                              (into mike)
                         Seal off a ten-block radius. Get me 
                         the SWAT team and an ambulance, double 
                         quick. We're going up.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT (DIMLY LIT)

               HIGH ANGLE on Sgt. Tate as he leads a five-man squad, all in 
               bulletproof vests, up the stone stairs. They move fast but 
               carefully, covering each other from landing to landing with 
               drawn revolvers, shotguns. The distant Back MUSIC makes a 
               ghostly echo in here...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT (DIMLY LIT)

               A thin rectangle of light on the floor from the open elevator 
               door. We can't see inside. The MUSIC sounds closer.

               SGT. TATE

               approaches very cautiously, gun aimed. The other cops, behind 
               him, fan out silently to set up angles of fire, checking the 
               various office doors - all locked - as they creep up.

               MOVING ANGLE - OVER TATE'S SHOULDER

               as he reaches the side of the elevator, hesitates, then spins 
               to point his gun inside. It's empty. He backs away.

                                     SGT. TATE
                              (shouts at ceiling)
                         Pembry? Boyle...?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HISTORICAL SOCIETY ROOM - NIGHT (BRIGHTLY LIT)

               ANGLE on the door, from inside, its lettering reversed on 
               the frosted glass. The Bach is VERY LOUD.

               After a moment the door is shouldered open, hard enough for 
               the glass to shatter, Tate following his gun inside, moving 
               low, then other cops appearing behind him in the doorframe. 
               They all freeze, staring in utter horror.

                                     SGT. TATE
                         Oh no... no...

               THEIR POV

               is a brief snapshot from hell. The two uniformed bodies, one 
               sprawled on its back near the door, the other still in the 
               cell, have been savaged by a knife. Blood and gore everywhere. 
               The faces are unrecognizable.

               SGT. TATE

               struggles for control, as the other cops move grimly around 
               him, into the room. He pulls his walkie-talkie from his belt.

                                     SGT. TATE
                              (into mike)
                         Command post... Two offi-
                              (a beat; clears his 
                              throat)
                         Two officers down. Prisoner is 
                         missing. Repeat, Lecter is missing... 
                         He's stripped the bed, might be making 
                         a rope, check all windows. Where the 
                         fuck is my ambulance?

               IN THE CELL

               a cop angrily punches OFF the music. Jacobs kneels with his 
               fingers on Boyle's neck.

                                     JACOBS
                         Boyle is dead, Sarge. His gun's 
                         gone...

               AT THE OTHER BODY

               a cop gently removes a revolver from the bloody fist. Murray, 
               the young patrolman, brings his ear reluctantly close to the 
               gory face. A bloody bubble appears there; the wreckage GROANS, 
               very softly.

                                     MURRAY
                         This one's alive!

               Tate crosses, kneels to see for himself. Murray looks green.

                                     SGT. TATE
                         Take ahold of him where he can feel 
                         your hands, son. Talk to him.

                                     MURRAY
                         What's his name, Sarge?

                                     SGT. TATE
                         It's Pembry, now talk to him, God 
                         dammit.
                              (into radio, looking 
                              around)
                         Boyle's dead, Pembry's read bad. 
                         Lecter is missing and armed - he 
                         took Boyle's gun...

               The other cop, checking the cylinder of Pembry's gun, holds 
               up one finger to Tate.

                                     SGT. TATE
                              (into radio)
                         Pembry got off one round - there's a 
                         chance Lecter was hit. We heard a 
                         total of three shots fired, so he's 
                         got four left... He's got a knife, 
                         too.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF COURTHOUSE - NIGHT

               VARIOUS ANGLES on a floodlit scene of barely controlled 
               pandemonium. Flashing red lights, men shouting commands, 
               SIRENS in the distance. SWAT members, in full gear, leap 
               from a black van... fan out... swarm up the steps... EMS 
               orderlies unload a gurney from an ambulance... Cops kneel 
               for cover behind cars, aiming guns and rifles up at the 
               windows...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HISTORICAL SOCIETY ROOM - NIGHT

               A trio of EMS orderlies work fast over the body, already 
               strapped on its gurney. They bandage a big plastic airway 
               into place, over the butchered face, checking for a pulse at 
               the neck. Young Murray crouches, sickened, gripping a bloody 
               fist.

                                     MURRAY
                         You're just fine, Pembry, lookin' 
                         good, buddy, you're gonna make it...

               One orderly massages the heart. Another is popping a plasma 
               bag, ready to insert the needle, when the body starts 
               convulsing.

                                     ORDERLY
                         Downstairs - let's go!

               Quickly the gurney is elevated, wheeled out of the room, 
               with cops rushing forward to open the doors, help push, SWAT 
               men are running by in the hall, automatic rifles at the 
               ready...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE ELEVATOR - DESCENDING - NIGHT

               Sgt. Tate, riding down with Jacobs, has his radio out.

                         Ten-four, Lieutenant. I'm on the 
                         elevator, bringing it down. Pembry 
                         and Boyle are both cleared, top three 
                         floors secured, main stairwell 
                         secured. He's somewhere on -

               A spot of blood falls on his cheek. He and Jacobs stare at 
               each other. Another spot hits his shoulder. They look up.

               THEIR POV

               Blood is dripping slowly from the corner of the service hatch.

               Sgt. Tate motions for silence, as both men draw their guns.

                                     SGT. TATE
                              (into mike)
                         Uh, we're pretty sure he's somewhere 
                         on two, sir... That's all for now, 
                         over.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. GROUND FLOOR LOBBY - NIGHT

               The elevator doors open, and Tate and Jacobs hurry out, 
               stepping quickly to the side. Tate reaches back in and -

               CLOSE ANGLE

               Locks the elevator into position, with its doors open.

               OTHER COPS are rushing up to them, curious, as Tate 
               frantically pushes them aside, gesturing for silence.

                                     SGT. TATE
                              (whispers)
                         He's on the roof of the elevator!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               Two SWAT officers, PETERSON and KUBELL, turn a key, unlocking 
               and opening this floor's elevator doorway. The shaft is dark. 
               Lying prone, they inch up to the edge, Peterson extends a 
               mirror, on a long pole, out into the shaft.

               IN THE MIRROR (DISTORTED BY THE ANGLE)

               Is a distant figure, in a green prison jumpsuit, lying on 
               his stomach, atop the elevator. A shiny revolver is near one 
               hand.

               PETERSON

               whispers into a radio, as Kubell carefully tips an assault 
               rifle, with a flashlight taped to its barrel, over the edge.

                                     PETERSON
                         I see him... There's a weapon by his 
                         hand. He's not moving...

                                     RADIO VOICE
                         Can you get the drop?

                                     PETERSON
                         We got the drop.

                                     RADIO VOICE
                         One warning. Then take him out.

               Peterson nods to Kubell, who switches ON the flashlight, as 
               Peterson shouts down the shaft.

                                     PETERSON
                         Quinn!! put your hands on your head!!

               IN THE MIRROR

               the green figure shows no movement.

               ANGLE ON THE COPS AGAIN

               as Peterson mutters to Kubell.

                                     PETERSON
                         Put one in his leg.

               VERY CLOSE ON

               The figure below, as Kubell's gunshot ROARS, echoing hugely 
               in the shaft, and a slug rips through the jumpsuited leg. 
               The figure doesn't stir.

               PETERSON

               staring down the shaft, raises his mike again.

                                     PETERSON
                         No movement.

                                     RADIO VOICE
                         Okay, Johnny, hold your fire...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. GROUND FLOOR LOBBY - NIGHT

               A small army of cops is now covering the elevator doorway, 
               from both sides. Tate crouches next to the SWAT COMMANDER.

                                     SWAT COMMANDER
                              (into radio mike)
                         We're coming into the car, we're 
                         opening the hatch. Watch his hands. 
                         Any fire will come from us. Affirm?

                                     PETERSON'S VOICE
                         Got it.

               The SWAT commander hands his radio to another cop, then looks 
               at Tate. A long, tense moment. Then he waves a signal.

               MOVING ANGLE

               as we follow a picked team of four SWAT cops, in full body 
               armor, rushing into the elevator car. Two men move to the 
               corners, aim assault rifles at the ceiling. A third man sets 
               a stepladder in place, and the fourth man, armed with a big 
               Colt, hurries up the ladder and unclips the hatch.

               CLOSE ON

               ...the service hatch, as the hinged cover drops open, and a 
               body tumbles through, dangling head first, until it's caught 
               at the waist. We see the back of the head.

               SGT. TATE

               shoulders through the SWAT cops for a closer look. He turns 
               towards the SWAT commander, astonished.

                                     SGT. TATE
                         That's Pembry!

               In the rear chamber, a young EMS ATTENDANT is braced against 
               the vehicle's sway. Behind him, the stretchered form of his 
               patient, and, through a curtained opening, the driver. SOUND 
               of the siren.

                                     ATTENDANT

               Behind him, in slightly BLURRED FOCUS, the bloody figure 
               sits slowly upright...

                                     ATTENDANT
                         His convulsions have stopped, but 
                         he's got so much loose skin on his 
                         face, it's hard to tell if -

               Suddenly he stops, becoming aware of a strange HISSING. He 
               turns, puzzled...

               THE POCKETKNIFE BLADE

               in Lecter's fist, flashes high in the air...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SIX-LANE FREEWAY - NIGHT (ARC LIGHTS)

               MOVING ANGLE on the EMS ambulance, as it races along normally, 
               its SIREN blazing, the heavy flow of traffic parting to make 
               way for it.

               Then suddenly it begins to weave erratically, changing lanes, 
               before drifting dangerously to a full stop, almost side-ways. 
               Cars swerve to avoid hitting it, HONKING angrily...

               CLOSER ANGLE

               on the stopped ambulance. After a long, still moment, the 
               wind-shield wipes come on, incongruously, then stop. Then 
               the SIREN is shut OFF, and the flashers. The ambulance starts 
               rolling again - at first jerkingly, then with increasing 
               speed. We follow it for several more moments, until is passes - 
               and we LINGER on...

               BIG GREEN INTERSTATE SIGN

               ...that reads "Memphis International Airport / 2 miles."

               CLOSE ANGLE - THROUGH AMBULANCE WINDSHIELD

               Dr. Lecter's face is slowly REVEALED, as he wipes across it 
               with a fistful of gauze, tossing it aside...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. MONTANA PLAIN - DUSK - (IN FLASHBACK)

               MOVING ANGLE, rushing with dizzy swiftness over the prairie, 
               over waving grasses... a long passage... before we come at 
               last to the girl Clarice, sitting with her lamb, hunched in 
               despair. She rises, her face tear-stained, and turns from 
               us. Holding the lamb, she starts back the way she came...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. COUNTRY DIRT ROAD - NIGHT - BRIGHT MOONLIGHT

               MOVING ANGLE, very rapid, down this road... coming at last 
               to a stopped highway patrol car. Clarice, with her lamb, is 
               standing in the car's headlights. She starts wearily towards 
               the sheriff...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. RANCH BARNYARD - NEAR DAWN

               CRANE ANGLE - sweeping rapidly DOWN into the barnyard towards 
               the arriving highway patrol car, as it stops... RUSHING to 
               the little girl as she steps from the car, holding the lamb.

               The dark figure of the rancher ENTERS FRAME. As he roughly 
               takes the lamb from her, we HOLD on a CLOSEUP of her face - 
               stunned, blank. She EXITS FRAME...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BARN - NIGHT

               MOVING ANGLE - CLARICE'S POV as she walks towards the open 
               barn doorway... It looms CLOSER... The rancher is revealed, 
               a shadowy figure, pinning the lamb on the killing table. His 
               knife hand sweeps up high, then holds... He turns TO CAMERA, 
               his face breaking into the light - and it is the face of Dr. 
               Lecter. He smiles his terrible smile at the young Clarice...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FBI DORM - PAY PHONE IN HALLWAY - NIGHT

               MOVING ANGLE - coming in very CLOSE on the adult Clarice's 
               face - shocked, devastated - as she stands alone by the 
               dangling receiver...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SHOWER STALL - FBI DORM - NIGHT

               CLOSE ON a shower head, as water suddenly blasts out. Clarice 
               moves INTO SHOT, as she scrubs her face and hair compulsively, 
               almost desperately, unable to get clean...

                                     ARDELIA (V.O.)
                         They found the ambulance...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CLARICE'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT

               Clarice is hunched on her cot, in a bathrobe, her hair wet. 
               The Buffalo Bill case file, a thick bundle, rests by her 
               feet. Ardelia hovers anxiously nearby.

                                     ARDELIA
                         In the parking garage at Memphis 
                         airport. The crew was dead. He killed 
                         a tourist, too. Got his clothes, 
                         cash... By now he could be anywhere.

               Clarice looks up. Her eyes are red-rimmed with exhaustion, 
               and something close to despair. She reads Ardelia's thought.

                                     CLARICE
                         No. He won't come after me.

                                     ARDELIA
                         Why not?

                                     CLARICE
                              (bitterly)
                         It would be rude. And he wouldn't 
                         get to ask any more questions...

               Ardelia sits beside her, touches her arm.

                                     ARDELIA
                         Clarice - you did the best anybody 
                         could have for Catherine Martin. You 
                         stuck your neck out for her and you 
                         got your butt kicked for her and you 
                         tried. It's not your fault it ended 
                         this way.

                                     CLARICE
                         The worst part - the thing that's 
                         making me crazy - is that Bill is 
                         right in front of me. Only I can't 
                         see him...
                              (touching the case 
                              file)
                         Lecter said, everything I need to 
                         catch him is right here, in these 
                         pages...

                                     ARDELIA
                         Lecter said a lot of things.

                                     CLARICE
                              (shakes her head)
                         He's here, Ardelia.

               Ardelia stares back at her.

               SOUND UPCUT - the low throb of a washing machine...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - ACADEMY DORM - NIGHT (VERY LATE)

               Clarice has spread out the case file across two washing 
               machines. Ardelia, cross-legged on a dryer, studies another 
               pile of forms. Nearby is their laundry basket, detergent 
               box.

                                     ARDELIA
                              (surprised)
                         Hey, is this Lecter's handwriting? 
                         She holds up the map, with its 
                         location markings for the kidnapping 
                         and body dump sites. Clarice takes 
                         it, looks.

               INSERT - THE MAP

               with newly inked words in Dr. Lecter's precise, elegant hand.

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         Clarice, doesn't this random 
                         scattering of sites seem overdone to 
                         you? Doesn't it seem desperately 
                         random - like the elaborations of a 
                         bad liar? Ta... Hannibal Lecter.

               NEW ANGLE - TWO SHOT

               as Clarice looks up at Ardelia, puzzled but excited.

                                     CLARICE
                         "Desperately random." What does he 
                         mean?

                                     ARDELIA
                         Not random at all, maybe. Like there's 
                         some pattern here...?

                                     CLARICE
                         But there is no pattern. There's no 
                         connection at all among these places, 
                         or the computers would've nailed it! 
                         They're even found in random order.

                                     ARDELIA
                         Well, except for the one girl.

                                     CLARICE
                              (beat)
                         What girl?

                                     ARDELIA
                         The one that was weighted down. Where 
                         is she...? Fred something.

               They search among the inserts. Clarice finds the graduation 
               photo.

                                     CLARICE
                         Fredrica Bimmel, from Belvedere, 
                         Ohio. The first girl taken, but the 
                         third body found... Why?

                                     ARDELIA
                         'Cause she didn't drift. He weighted 
                         her down.

                                     CLARICE
                         But why? He didn't weight the others.

               Clarice moves, on fire, unable to keep still.

                                     CLARICE
                         The first, what the hell did Lecter 
                         say about... "First principles," he 
                         said. Simplicity... What does this 
                         guy do, he "covets." How do we first 
                         start to covet? "We covet what we 
                         see -"

               She stops, turns. She grabs the photo of Fredrica from 
               Ardelia, stares at it. She looks up, trembling.

                                     CLARICE
                         "- every day."

                                     ARDELIA
                              (softly)
                         Hot damn, Clarice.

                                     CLARICE (V.O.)
                         He knew her...!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FBI BUILDING - OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR - DAY

               Clarice and Crawford are seated in front of Director Burke, 
               who's at his desk. Another chair is empty, because Krendler 
               is pacing. All four are nearing their boiling points.

                                     CLARICE
                         Maybe he lives in this, this 
                         Belvedere, Ohio, too! Maybe he saw 
                         her every day, and killed her sort 
                         of spontaneously. Maybe he just meant 
                         to... give her a 7-Up and talk about 
                         the choir. But then -

                                     KRENDLER
                         Starling -

                                     CLARICE
                         But then he had to cover up, make 
                         her seem just like all the rest of 
                         them. That's what Lecter was hinting!

                                     KRENDLER
                         The market in Lecter hints is way 
                         down, today, okay? I've got two good 
                         men dead in Memphis, and three
                         civilians. I've got -

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Who the hell's fault is -

                                     KRENDLER
                         - a U.S. Senator who's half out of 
                         her head because her daughter's going 
                         to be murdered today! And all because 
                         of your mind games with fucking 
                         Lecter!

                                     CRAWFORD
                         If you hadn't interfered, he'd still 
                         be in custody in Baltimore!

                                     BURKE
                         Jack -

                                     KRENDLER
                         You sent in a green recruit, with a
                         phony goddamn offer -

                                     CRAWFORD
                         You're just trying to cover your ass 
                         for letting him escape!

                                     BURKE
                         THAT'S ENOUGH! All of you...

               A long silence, as they all struggle to regain composure. 
               Crawford, who was at the point of striking Krendler, finally 
               retakes his seat. Burke looks sadly at Crawford and Clarice.

                                     BURKE
                              (very reluctantly)
                         Starling, I'm afraid I have no choice. 
                         You're suspended from the Academy.
                              (Crawford starts to 
                              interrupt)
                         Not another word!
                              (to Clarice)
                         This is pending a reevaluation of 
                         your fitness for the service. I 
                         promise you'll get a fair hearing.
                              (pause)
                         Jack... you're ordered to take 
                         compassionate leave. You'll spend 
                         the rest of the day briefing the 
                         AG's office, then transfer command 
                         of the task force, effective by 1800 
                         hours.
                              (beat)
                         I'm sorry, Jack... Go home. Take 
                         care of Bella.

               Clarice and Crawford stare back at him, drained. A long and 
               very painful silence. Not even Krendler looks happy.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SIDEWALK OUTSIDE FBI BUILDING - DAY

               Clarice and Crawford walk out slowly, stand there a moment, 
               not knowing what to say, not wanting to face each other.

                                     CLARICE
                         All his victims are women... His 
                         obsession is women, he lives to hunt 
                         women. But not one women is hunting 
                         him - except me. I can walk in a 
                         woman's room and know three times as 
                         much about her as a man would.
                              (beat)
                         I have to go to Belvedere.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         You heard them. I don't have that 
                         authority anymore.

                                     CLARICE
                         You do until six p.m.

               He stares at her sadly. He looks, for the first time, 
               defeated, old beyond his years.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Ohio is cold ground. Picked over, 
                         ten months ago. Our people worked 
                         it, so did the locals.

                                     CLARICE
                         But not from this angle. Not thinking 
                         he knew her. You've got to send me!

                                     CRAWFORD
                         I'm Bureau for 28 years, Starling. I 
                         won't disobey orders, not even now.

                                     CLARICE
                         But I just became a private citizen. 
                         I can go anywhere I want to.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         With ID and a gun...? Impersonating 
                         a federal agent is a felony.

                                     CLARICE
                         He's going to kill her, Mr. Crawford. 
                         This morning, or maybe at noon, but 
                         today, and Belvedere's our last 
                         chance. I'm flying there, right now, 
                         unless you stop me. You want my ID? 
                         Here - take it...

               He stares at her, a long moment. Catherine's life. Clarice's 
               passion, and future. His loyalty to the Bureau. Call it.

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (pulls out his wallet)
                         There's about $300 here... And a 
                         hotline code number. They'll patch 
                         you through to me, wherever I am.

               She raises her hand to him. She wants to touch him face, or 
               his neck, but can't. Finally she takes his money and card.

                                     CLARICE
                         Thank you.

               He watches, frightened for both of them, as she backs away, 
               smiles, then turns, racing towards the surveillance van.

               SOUND UPCUT - the scratchy recording of Fats Waller SINGING, 
               as we...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MR. GUMB'S CELLAR - DAY (DIM LIGHT)

               CLOSE ON the needle of the Victrola, on the spinning record, 
               as Mr. Gumb's fingers lift away. MUSIC continues in 
               background.

                                     MR. GUMB (O.S.)
                              (calling out)
                         Preeeeecious...!

               CLOSE ON the moth cage, as Mr. Gumb's fingers search through 
               the humus, and find a plump new cocoon, lifting it out. The 
               door of the cage is left open, and one or two of the adult 
               moths flutter out.

                                     MR. GUMB (O.S.)
                         Precious, come on Precious! Busy 
                         busy day today...

               CLOSE ON a clean towel, beside the sink. The cocoon is gently 
               placed in readiness alongside four shiny skinning knives.

                                     MR. GUMB (O.S.)
                         Momma's gonna be sooo beautiful!

               CLOSE ON a stainless steel Colt Python, with a six-inch 
               barrel, as the cylinder is spun, and the hammer gets a 
               practice cock. The metallic CLICK is deep and loud. A note 
               of alarm has entered Mr. Gumb's voice.

                                     MR. GUMB (O.S.)
                         You come here this minute, you little 
                         scamp!

               LOW ANGLE on Mr. Gumb, wearing the kimono, as he walks through 
               his sewing workroom. His back is to us; he is looking 
               anxiously under the furniture. He stops, straightens. 
               Genuinely scared.

                                     MR. GUMB
                         Precious...?

               LOW ANGLE - OVER THE PIT OPENING

               Towards Mr. Gumb, as he stops at one of the doorways of the 
               oubliette chamber. He stares inside; his face in shadows.

                                     MR. GUMB
                         Sweetheart...?

               From the distant bottom of the pit, we hear Catherine's voice.

                                     CATHERINE (O.S.)
                         She'd down here you sack of shit.

               Mr. Gumb's fist flies to his mouth, and he sags against the 
               doorframe. A little groan escaped him; the dog answers with 
               a series of YIPS.

               UPWARD ANGLE, FROM THE PIT BOTTOM

               as Mr. Gumb's dark shape leans cautiously over the edge.

                                     MR. GUMB
                         Precious, are you all right?

               REVERSE ANGLE ON CATHERINE

               crouched to one side, clutching the dog to her chest. Seeing 
               Mr. Gumb, the dog squirms frantically, BARKING.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Get me a telephone. Lower it down to 
                         me. Do it now, mister! I don't want 
                         to have to hurt this little dog.

               UPWARD ANGLE

               on Mr. Gumb, as, with a cry of fury, he whips the Colt from 
               inside his kimono. The muzzle gleams as he takes aim.

               Catherine yanks the dog up, into his line of fire, screaming 
               at him.

                                     CATHERINE
                         You shoot motherfucker you better 
                         kill me quick or I'll break her 
                         fucking neck, I swear to God!

                                     MR. GUMB (O.S.)
                              (wails)
                         Nooooooo!

               Tucking the dog under one arm, she grabs its muzzle, twisting 
               the head. The dog WHINES piteously.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Back off, you son of a bitch! Back 
                         off!

               UPWARD ANGLE

               as Mr. Gumb cries out again - a terrible, inarticulate scream 
               of rage and anguish. But then he slowly lowers his gun.

               REVERSE ANGLE

               On Catherine, as she maintains her grip.

                                     CATHERINE
                         That's better... Now get me a live 
                         telephone. Get a long extension and 
                         lower is down here... And you better 
                         do it fast, too, 'cause I think her 
                         leg's broken. She's in pain, mister, 
                         she needs a vet.

               MR. GUMB

               stares down at her, a long beat, breathing heavily.

                                     MR. GUMB
                         You think she's in pain? You don't 
                         know what pain is. But you're going 
                         to find out...

               And abruptly he vanishes. SOUND of his footsteps, rushing 
               off.

               CATHERINE

               begins shaking, hands and arms twitching uncontrollably. She 
               hugs the little dog tight to her chest, buries her face in 
               its fur, sobbing...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - BELVEDERE, OHIO - DAY

               HIGH ANGLE as a rented sedan pulls up to the curb, stops. 
               After a moment Clarice climbs out, a bit stiffly. Double-
               checking this address, she glances up from a folded street 
               map to -

               AN OLD, THREE-STORY WOODEN HOUSE

               in a row of similarly shabby homes, all backing onto a narrow 
               river. A path of boards, laid over mud, leads back along 
               this house towards the brown water. SOUND of hammering from 
               there.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BIMMEL HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY

               An awesome huddle of pigeon coops sprawls by the brackish 
               water. The birds' COOING mixes with the HAMMERING. A tall, 
               gaunt man in a knit cap is obsessively pounding nails into a 
               new coop.

               CLARICE

               approaches him, and the man lowers his hammer. He has red-
               rimmed eyes of watery blue. His face is deeply seamed.

                                     CLARICE
                         Mr. Bimmel...? 

               He stares back at her, warily.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BIMMEL HOUSE - STAIRCASE - DAY

               HIGH ANGLE - LOOKING DOWN as Mr. Bimmel leads Clarice up a 
               steep flight of steps. The bannister is worn, sags a bit.

                                     MR. BIMMEL
                         I don't know nothin' new to tell ya. 
                         The police been back here so many 
                         times already... Fredrica went into 
                         Columbus on the bus to see about a 
                         job. She left the interview OK. She 
                         never come home.

               Clarice pauses, at the landing, to look at a framed photo: 
               the familiar graduation portrait. Others pictures show 
               Fredrica as a young girl, toddler, infant - plump and hopeful 
               at each age.

                                     MR. BIMMEL
                         Her room's how she left it. Just 
                         shut the door when you're done.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FREDRICA'S BEDROOM - DAY

               CLARICE'S POV - MOVING SLOWLY as she takes in flowery chintz 
               curtains... posters of Madonna and Blondie... a twin bed, 
               with worn, stuffed animals on the pillow... a big sewing 
               machine in the corner.

               CLARICE

               turns, absorbing nuances. There is loneliness here, an echo 
               of desperation under this steeply pitches ceiling. A shrill 
               MEOW, and she looks down...

               BIG TORTOISESHELL CAT

               is rubbing against her ankles.

               CLARICE

               picks up the cat, scratches behind his ears. She glances up.

               IN A FULL-LENGTH MIRROR

               she and the cat stares back at their own reflection...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CLARICE

               sitting at the desk, turns the pages of a high school 
               yearbook. The cat is curled on her lap...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CLARICE

               kneeling by the old Decca record player, flips through LPs 
               and singles. The cat has wandered off...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CLARICE

               pulling a string to light up the closet. She is surprised 
               and intrigued to see an extensive wardrobe, groaning from 
               the rod. A shelf above the rod is stacked high with sewing 
               supplies, in clear plexiboxes. She flips through the hanging 
               clothes, pulls out one dress, on its hanger, for a closer 
               look.

               THE DRESS

               is very big, to fit Fredrica, but beautifully cut. Some of 
               the seams still look unfinished. She turns it around, sees a 
               blue tissue dressmaker's pattern still pinned to the back.

               FAVORING THE SEWING MACHINE

               as Clarice turns, looks towards it. She hangs the dress on 
               the closet door knob, crosses to sit at the machine. She 
               takes off its dust cover. She runs one hand over the cool 
               metal, as a taunting memory forms in her mind.

                         Billy wants to change, too, Clarice. 
                         But there's the problem of his size, 
                         you see...

               She turns, looks again at the unfinished dress. Suddenly she 
               straightens, her attention riveted by something...

               CLARICE'S POV

               On the printed pattern, down at the lower back of the outlined 
               dress, are two bold black triangles. We RUSH CLOSER to there 
               shapes, before jumping back to -

               CLARICE

               who stares at them, starting to tremble.

                         Even if he were a woman, he'd have 
                         to be a big one...

               IN FLASHBACK

               those missing triangles of skin on the dead girl's back, in 
               the funeral home in West Virginia...

               CLOSE ON CLARICE

               as she jumps to her feet, with a fierce joy.

               Clarice paces, in an exuberant rush, amidst the worn

                         And he can sew, this guy, he's really
                         skilled. A dressmaker, or a tailor -

                         That's why they're all so big - 
                         because he needs a lot of skin! He 
                         keeps them alive to starve them awhile - 
                         to loosen their skin, so that -

                         Starling, we know who he is! And 
                         where he is. We're on our way now.

                                     CLARICE

               INT. FBI TURBOJET - FLYING - DAY

               Crawford sits at a communications console, with Burroughs, 
               in headphones, by his side. This forward section of the cabin 
               is crammed with hi-tech equipment, all lit up and WHIRRING. 
               Through a window we see clouds, part of the jet's wing.

                         be on the ground in 45 minutes with 
                         the Hostage Rescue Team. I'm back in 
                         charge, Starling. He's mine.

               INTERCUTTING

               as Clarice reacts; her happiness for Crawford is tinged with 
               disappointment at being so suddenly out of the hunt.

                                     CLARICE
                              (on phone)
                         Sir, that's great news. But how -

                         Johns Hopkins finally came up with a 
                         name for us. We fed him into Known 
                         Offenders, and he came up cherries.
                              (takes a paper from 
                              Burroughs)
                         Subject's name is "Jamie Gumb," AKA 
                         "John Grant." Lecter's description 
                         was accurate, he just lied about the 
                         name.

               INSIDE THE JET - MOVING ANGLE

               from the rear of the cabin forward, as we slowly PASS the 
               twelve-man HRT. They're seated in full gear, hardshell armor, 
               quietly checking and rechecking their bulging cases of weapons - 
               silencer automatics, shotguns, stun grenades...

                         This Gumb's a real beauty. Slaughtered 
                         both his grandparents when he was 
                         twelve, and did nine years in juvenile 
                         psychiatric. Where, Starling, he 
                         took vocational rehab, and learned a 
                         useful trade...

                         Take a bow. Customs had some paper 
                         on his alias. They stopped a carton 
                         two years ago at LAX - live 
                         caterpillars from Surinam. The 
                         addressee was "John Grant." Calumet 
                         Power & Light's given us two possible 
                         residences under that alias. We're 
                         hitting one, Chicago SWAT's taking 
                         the other.

                              (eagerly)
                         Chicago's only about 400 miles from
                         here. I could be there in -

                                     CRAWFORD
                         No, Starling, there isn't time. And 
                         you've still got crucial work to do 
                         in Ohio. We want him for murder, not 
                         kidnapping. I'm counting on you to 
                         link him to the Bimmel girl, before 
                         he's indicted.

               Clarice tries hard to swallow her disappointment.

                                     CLARICE
                         Yes sir... I'll do my best.

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (pause; gently)
                         Starling - you've earned back your 
                         place in the Academy. We never 
                         would've found him without you, and 
                         nobody's ever going to forget that. 
                         Least of all me.

                                     CLARICE

               CRAWFORD

               switches off, feeling bad for her. On the console near him, 
               the fax machine starts to CHATTER. He turns, looks.

               Clarice walks slowly across the yard, absorbing all this 
               news, before suddenly leaping into the air and pumping her 
               fist in triumph, with a happy yelp. Then she sees -

               MR. BIMMEL

               staring at her in surprise. He sits by his coops, smoking.

               CLARICE

               somewhat embarrassed, crosses over to him.

                         Mr. Bimmel... did Fredrica ever

               STACY HUBKA - short, perky, early 20's - sits nervously at 
               her desk, talking to Clarice, who jots in her notebook. In

                              (Stacy shakes her 
                              head)
                         Do you think she could've had a friend 
                         you didn't know about?

                         No way. She had a guy, I'da known, 
                         believe me. Sewing was her life, she 
                         was really great at it. Poor Freddie.

                         Did you ever work with her?

                         Oh sure, me'n Pam Malavesi used to 
                         help her do alterations for old Mrs. 
                         Lippman. Lots of people worked for 
                         her, she had the business from all 
                         these retail stores? But she was 
                         like, totally old, it was more'n she 
                         could handle.

                         own there.

               Clarice reacts, disappointed at the ending of this trail.

                         I think so.

                         You get to travel around and stuff? 
                         I mean, better places then this?

                         Freddie was so happy for me when I

                         know, big dummy...

               Suddenly she's fighting tears. Clarice reaches to hug her.

               WIDE ANGLE on what appears to be, at first, a calm, ordinary 
               neighborhood of working class two- and three-story houses. 
               But the street is strangely quiet, deserted.

               After a few moments, we become aware of movement - armed, 
               dark-clad figures creeping swiftly and in silence from shrubs 
               to garage corners, from parked cars to porches, appearing 
               and then disappearing...

               INT. MR. GUMB'S CELLAR - DAY (DIM LIGHT)

               CLOSE ON Mr. Gumb, as he settles a big pair of infra-red 
               night-vision goggles over his eyes. Moths flutter past his 
               face. His mouth is set in a grim line...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               An HRT cop, prone beneath a hedge, is joined by a 2nd HRT 
               Cop, who throws himself to the grass beside him. They both 
               take aim with their scoped rifles at -

               TELEPHOTO ANGLE (WITH RIFLE CROSSHAIRS)

               The front door of a big, nearby, split-level house...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MR. GUMB'S CELLAR - DAY (DIM LIGHT)

               CLOSE ON a fuse box, as Mr. Gumb reaches in, flips a switch. 
               The lights go out. SOUND of a second switch, and the cellar 
               is bathed in a green glow...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A little boy, riding his tricycle in his driveway, is suddenly 
               startled to find himself staring into the grim face of -

               A MEMBER OF THE HRT

               crouched by his garage, armed to the teeth. As the little 
               boy starts to cry, the cop pulls him into the shadows, 
               covering his mouth.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MR. GUMB'S CELLAR - DAY (GREEN LIGHT)

               Mr. Gumb, in his kimono and goggles, creeps silently through 
               his workrooms - knees bent, painted toes places ever so 
               delicately, the Colt held aloft - as more moths flutter past 
               him in the eerie light...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. STREET IN CALUMENT CITY - DAY

               A florist's van turns the corner, comes slowly down the street 
               and stops at the curb in front of the split-level. The driver, 
               in a gray deliveryman's uniform and cap, climbs out of the 
               cab, walks briskly to the panel door, on the street side of 
               the van, and slides it open. He leans in, comes out with a 
               long, thin red-ribboned floral box, starts calmly towards 
               the house...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               MR. GUMB'S POV - MOVING ANGLE on the top of the oubliette, a 
               glowing green circle in the dark, as it draws closer and 
               closer... and then Catherine comes INTO VIEW, at the bottom 
               of the pit. She is crouched, exhausted, staring straight up 
               at him - but she can't see him in this infra-red darkness. 
               Precious is curled into her stomach, asleep. The futon is up 
               to Catherine's waist, but there's a clear shot at her head 
               and neck.

               MR. GUMB

               Looking down at her, smiles...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. STREET IN CALUMET CITY - SUSPECT'S HOUSE - DAY

               MOVING ANGLE on the "deliveryman," seen from behind, as he 
               mounts three steps to the split-level's front porch. Tucked 
               into the small of his back if a 9 mm. automatic.

               CRAWFORD AND BURROUGHS

               have slipped out of the van, and are crouched behind it now, 
               with drawn guns, watching tensely as -

               THE "DELIVERYMAN"

               settles the floral box in the crook of his left arm, reaches 
               out with his right hand towards the buzzer...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MR. GUMB'S CELLAR - DAY (GREEN LIGHT)

               Slowly, savoring the moment, Mr. Gumb aims the big Colt, 
               which is already cocked, using both hands... He is just about 
               to squeeze the trigger, when we hear his DOOR BUZZER, 
               surprisingly loud and close by. He turns, startled, and sees -

               DUSTY BLACK METAL BOX

               the extension buzzer, mounted high on the wall, which is 
               making the hideous, grating JANGLE. It finally stops, but 
               not before waking Precious, who starts frantically BARKING, 
               off screen, as -

               MR. GUMB

               raises his gun again, spinning back towards -

               HIS POV - THE PIT BOTTOM

               where Catherine, hearing but still not seeing him, quickly 
               yanks the futon over both herself and the dog. Instantly the 
               two of them become one squirming, indistinguishable mass.

               MR. GUMB

               bites his lip, his aim wavering, as he can't decide where to 
               safely place his shot. The maddening BUZZER sounds again, 
               even more insistently, and he cries out with frustration and 
               fury. But as the BUZZER continues, he reluctantly uncocks 
               his gun, looking up angrily towards his front door...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MR. GUMB'S FRONT DOOR - DAY

               The door opens, on a chain, and Clarice peers in, smiling.

                                     CLARICE
                         Good afternoon... I wonder if you 
                         could help me. I'm looking for Mrs. 
                         Lippman's family?

               Mr. Gumb frowns out at Clarice. For the first time ever, we 
               get a well-lit view of his bland, pale-eyed moon of a face.

                                     MR. GUMB
                         They don't live here anymore.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. FRONT DOOR OF SUSPECT'S HOUSE - CALUMET CITY

               The "deliveryman" yanks a 12 lb. sledgehammer from the floral 
               box, swings it with all his might against the door knob, 
               blowing it through as -

               MOVING ANGLE

               Crawford and Burroughs race towards the door, guns up...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MR. GUMB'S FRONT DOOR - DAY

               Mr. Gumb starts to close the door, only to have Clarice push 
               back against it, politely but firmly. She holds up her ID.

                                     CLARICE
                         Excuse me, but I really do need to 
                         talk to you. This was Mrs. Lippman's 
                         house. Did you know her?

                                     MR. GUMB
                              (beat)
                         Just briefly. What's the problem, 
                         Officer?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A bedroom window disintegrates as a flash grenade is shot 
               through it, EXPLODING on the floor. An instant later, a black-
               clad HRT cop dives through the shattered glass, rolls across 
               the floor, comes up on one knee swiveling his sawed-off 
               shotgun...

               Clarice and Mr. Gumb, still eyeing each other through the 
               door crack...

                                     CLARICE
                         I'm investigating the death of 
                         Fredrica Bimmel. Who are you, please?

                         Jack Gordon.

                                     CLARICE
                         Mr. Gordon, did you know Fredrica 
                         when she worked for Mrs. Lippman?

                                     MR. GUMB
                         No. Wait... Was she a great, fat 
                         person? I may have seen her, I'm not 
                         sure...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               MOVING ANGLE as Burroughs moves quickly down a hallway and 
               enters the living room, where Crawford is standing, with his 
               gun held down by his side, surrounded by several other cops. 
               Burroughs shakes his head: Nothing here...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MR. GUMB'S FRONT HALLWAY - DAY

               Mr. Gumb glances briefly over his shoulder, towards his 
               kitchen, then turns back to Clarice with a smile.

                                     MR. GUMB
                         Mrs. Lippman had a son, maybe he 
                         could help you. I have his card 
                         somewhere. Do you mind stepping 
                         inside, while I looks for it?

                                     CLARICE
                         Thanks.

               ANGLE FAVORING THE COLT PYTHON

               which rests on a counter, just inside the open kitchen 
               doorway. THROUGH this doorway, we watch as Mr. Gumb, at the 
               end of his front hall, slips the chain. Clarice enters, 
               closing the door behind her.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               MOVING ANGLE - towards the front door, as frustrated HRT 
               cops file out of the empty house, rifles slung across their 
               shoulders.

               WE PICK OUT CRAWFORD

               walking across the grass towards the van, when all at once 
               he stops in his tracks, shaken by a sudden flash of intuition.

               CAMERA RUSHES VERY CLOSE

               on his stricken face...

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Clarice.

               INT. MR. GUMB'S PARLOR - DAY

               Clarice, pulling her notebook from her shoulder bag, glances 
               around the musty-looking room.

                                     MR. GUMB (O.S.)
                         That horrible business, I shiver 
                         every time I think about it...

               Overstuffed furniture, porcelain figurines. One archway onto 
               the front hall, another onto a dining alcove, and through 
               there, the kitchen. Mr. Gumb is crossing to a rolling desk, 
               raising the top. He bends over, begins poking through cubby 
               holes. His tone is casual, neutral.

                                     MR. GUMB
                         Are they close to catching somebody, 
                         do you think?

                                     CLARICE
                         I think we may be, yes.

               Mr. Gumb stiffens, almost imperceptibly. His back is to her, 
               as he continues opening drawers, rustling papers.

                                     CLARICE
                         Mr. Gordon, did you take over this 
                         place after Mrs. Lippman died?

                                     MR. GUMB
                         Yes. I bought the house from her, 
                         two years ago.

                                     CLARICE
                         Did she leave any records here? Tax 
                         or business records? Maybe a list of 
                         employees?

               CLOSE ON MR. GUMB'S BACK

               as he continues his rummaging.

                                     MR. GUMB
                         No, nothing at all. Has the FBI 
                         learned something? Because the police 
                         here don't seem to have the first 
                         clue...

               Out of the folds of his kimono crawls a Death's-head Moth. 
               It creeps slowly to the center of his back, raising its wings.

                                     MR. GUMB
                         Do you have his description yet, or 
                         some fingerprints...?

               CLARICE

               unaware, is still glancing around the room. For several 
               agonizing moments, we think she won't see the moth - but 
               then she turns, does see it, and her eyes freeze. A beat of 
               pure fear. A tremendous struggle to keep her voice calm.

                                     CLARICE
                         No... no, we don't.

               Very carefully, she drops her notebook back into her bag, 
               lowers the bag to the floor. With her fingertips she brushes 
               back the edge of her blazer, loosening its drape.

               MR. GUMB

               turns back towards her cheerfully, holding out a business 
               card.

                                     MR. GUMB
                         Ahhh. Here's that number.

               CLARICE

               keeps her distance. They are about ten feet apart.

                                     CLARICE
                         Good, thank you. Mr. Gordon, do you 
                         have a phone I can use?

               MR. GUMB

               is about to reply when the moth suddenly flies up from behind 
               him, flutters past his face. He turns, looking at it. He 
               looks back at Clarice, his mouth still open.

               HER EYES

               are unmoving, locked on his.

               HIS EYES

               stare back at her, widen. And they know each other.

                                     MR. GUMB
                              (softly)
                         In the kitchen. I'll show you.

               CLARICE

               whips her gun out, gripping it in both shaking hands.

                                     CLARICE
                         Freeze!

               MR. GUMB

               slowly tilts his head to one side, smiles at her.

               CLARICE

               tries to force more authority into her voice.

                                     CLARICE
                         Okay... Okay, Mr. Gumb, you're under 
                         arrest. Down on the floor, hands and 
                         legs spread, move it.

               MR. GUMB

               turns, then all at once, in two quick steps, he is gone, 
               disappearing into his dining alcove, then kitchen.

               CLARICE

               hesitates, just a split second, to shoot him in the back - 
               and then it's too late.

                                     CLARICE
                         Shit!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MR. GUMB'S KITCHEN - DAY

               Clarice hurries inside, moving low, swivelling her gun.

               HER POV - MOVING

               The kitchen is empty. To one side, a door still shuddering 
               on its hinges...

               CLARICE

               rushes to this - pauses - then elbows the door aside, aiming 
               her gun down -

               AN EMPTY STAIRWELL

               brightly lit, leading to the cellar. Two doors facing the 
               bottom, both open. No sign of Mr. Gumb.

               CLARICE

               hates this, hates this, which door, it's a trap, what to do: 
               she is very scared, but suddenly hears -

               The distant SCREAM of Catherine Martin, somewhere down there 
               in that killing maze.

               CLARICE

               rushes through the doorway, and down the stairs.

               BEHIND HER, ON THE KITCHEN COUNTER there's an empty space; 
               the Colt Python is gone.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MR. GUMB'S CELLAR - DAY

               MOVING ANGLE - WITH CLARICE - hurrying down the steps. More 
               SCREAMS; they seem to be coming from the left door. Clarice 
               goes that way, entering a brick-walled passage - pipes over-
               head, naked bulbs. The lighting, though dim, is incandescent; 
               Mr. Gumb has switched off his infra-red system. Clarice comes 
               to a T-shaped intersection, stops. Another SCREAM, again to 
               her left, and the BARKING of a dog...

               CLARICE

               follows her gun around the corner, looking right.

               EMPTY PASSAGEWAY

               but doors opening off it - he could be lurking behind any of 
               them. She looks left... sees an opening onto some kind of 
               chamber. The noises are LOUDER, coming from there.

               CLARICE

               moves cautiously towards this chamber...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. OUBLIETTE CHAMBER - DAY (DIMLY LIT)

               Clarice moves in, hugging the wall, gun swivelling...

               HER POV - MOVING

               the open top of the pit... beyond it, the other two doorways, 
               opening onto this room - Jesus, he could come through either 
               one of them, or come up behind her... She moves to the pit, 
               looks down, very briefly, sees Catherine SCREAMING, 
               hysterical, and a little white dog BARKING...

               CLARICE

               kneels, staring up from one door to another, she can't cover 
               them all, she's totally exposed - and what's a dog doing 
               there?

                                     CLARICE
                         FBI, Catherine, you're safe.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Safe, SHIT, he's got a gun! Getmeout.
                         GET ME OUT!

                                     CLARICE
                         You're all right! Where is he?

                                     CATHERINE
                         Get me out!

                                     CLARICE
                         I'll get you out! Just be quiet so I 
                         can hear. Shut that dog up.
                              (still swivelling)
                         Is there a ladder? Is there a rope?

                                     CATHERINE
                         I don't know! Get me out!!

                                     CLARICE
                         Catherine. Listen to me. I have to 
                         find a rope. I have to leave this
                         room, just for a minute, but -

                                     CATHERINE
                         NOOOOO! You fucking bitch don't you 
                         LEAVE ME down here, DON'T YOU - YOU 

                                     CLARICE
                         Shut UP!
                              (then, louder)
                         The other officers will be here any 
                         minute! you're perfectly safe now!

               Ignoring Catherine, whose shouts turn to sobs, she backs 
               away, turns, picks one of the other doorways, moves into it 
               quickly.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. NEW PASSAGEWAY - DAY (DIMLY LIT)

               CLARICE'S POV - MOVING down this passageway, towards a new 
               room... pausing at the doorway, straining to hear... no sound 
               except Catherine's CRYING, not in the background, and 
               Clarice's own RAPID BREATHING. Then she crouches -

               LOWER ANGLE - bursts forward, through the doorframe, 
               sidestepping...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. WORKROOM - DAY (DIMLY LIT)

               Clarice weaves back and forth, half-crouched, gun out, back 
               to the wall. Her face glistens with sweat, as she takes in...

               HER POV - MOVING NERVOUSLY

               Mr. Gumb's sewing machine... his swivel chair... the old 
               Victrola... Big moths are crashing into the light bulbs, 
               overhead; they're everywhere. Suddenly, from just behind 
               her, a CLICK and a HUM, and -

               CLARICE

               spins, almost shoots, before seeing -

               A SMALL REFRIGERATOR

               with its thermostat just switching ON.

               CLARICE

               gasps for breath, fighting for calm. She turns again, slashing 
               her free hand at the moths, moving quickly on...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SKINNING ROOM - DAY (DIMLY LIT)

               Clarice moves past the mannequins, all of them naked now... 
               then quickly past the huge Chinese armoire, ready to shoot 
               into it. Its doors yawn open; it is empty except for several 
               padded hangers... She moves on, past the big sink, with its 
               DRIPPING faucet... the counter, with its gleaming knives... 
               the rows of chemical jars. At the end of this room is

               A CLOSED DOOR

               Clarice starts to open it, then hesitates. Looking around, 
               she seizes a wooden chair, wedges it under the door know, 
               sealing off this section of the cellar. With her back thus 
               defended, she turns, softly retracing her steps.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. WORKROOM - DAY (DIMLY LIT)

               Passing again through the workroom, Clarice pauses, seeing a 
               half-curtained door, to one side, that she had previously 
               skirted. She crosses to the door, listens and hears no sound 
               inside, takes a deep breath and reaches for the knob. She 
               twists it, and, as it turns, shoves hard and follows her gun 
               inside, all in one quick move...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BATHROOM - DAY (BRIGHTLY LIT)

               An old-fashioned bathroom: tiled floor, sink, toilet - and a 
               big, free-standing tub. An opaque shower curtain, suspended 
               from an oval ring, hides whatever might be inside.

               CLARICE

               centers her gun on the curtain, at chest height, and yanks 
               it aside with her left hand. No one standing there. Something 
               lower down catches her eye.

               She leans in, stares more closely, not understanding, at 
               first, that she's seeing -

               FEMALE HAND AND WRIST

               sticking up from the tub, which is filled with hard red-purple 
               plaster. The hand is dark and shriveled, with pink nail polish 
               and a dainty wristwatch. As -

               CLARICE

               is reacting with horror to this sight, the lights go out, to 
               be replaced, a split-second later, by the eerie green glow 
               of Mr. Gumb's infra-red system. Clarice cries out, turns 
               blindly, reaching for the door, can't find it, free hand 
               clawing desperately into what is, for her, utter darkness. 
               SOUND of Catherine KEENING again, in the far distance. Clarice 
               stumbles, goes to her knees, rights herself, finally clutches 
               the door frame...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MR. GUMB'S WORKROOM - DAY (GREEN LIGHT)

               Clarice emerges from the bathroom in a half-crouch, arms 
               out, both hands on the gun, extended just below the level of 
               her unseeing eyes. She stops, listens. In her raw-nerved 
               darkness, every SOUND is unnaturally magnified - the HUM of 
               the refrigerator... the TRICKLE of water... her own terrified 
               BREATHING, and Catherine's faraway, echoing SOBS... Moths 
               smack against her face and arms. She eases forward, then 
               stops again, listens... She eases forward again, following 
               her gun, and creeps directly in front of, and then past -

               MR. GUMB

               who has flattened himself against a wall, arms spread like a 
               high priest, Colt in one hand. He wears his goggles and 
               kimono, and under that - draping down over his naked arms, 
               like some hideous mantle - his terrifying, half-completed 
               suit of human skins. This is an exquisite moment for him - a 
               ritual of supreme exaltation. He smiles at Clarice as, 
               completely unaware, she moves beyond him, exposing her back. 
               Very slowly and quietly he steps out behind her, taking his 
               gun in both hands, aiming...

               CLOSE ON

               the Colt Python as - in SLOW MOTION - his thumbs cock the 
               hammer, the SOUND registering as a LOUD METALLIC CLICK, and -

               CLARICE

               spins, still in SLOW MOTION, flame already leaping from her 
               gun muzzle, as we see -

               THE TWO FIGURES

               almost at point-black range, guns ROARING hugely, one FLASH 
               from Mr. Gumb, and one two three four FLASHES from Clarice, 
               overlapping his, and then, as the ECHOES crash deafeningly -

               CLOSE ON CLARICE - LOW ANGLE -

               with NORMAL SPEED RESTORED, as the side of her face hits the 
               floor, and she is gasping, stunned by the noise and flames; 
               there is blood on her check, and an ugly powder burn, but 
               she ignores them, twisting to yank her speedloader from her 
               jacket pocket, locking it blindly onto her gun's cylinder, 
               reloading, right in front of her face, then rolling onto her 
               stomach, aiming her gun upward again, blinking her dazzled 
               eyes, straining to locate him in the darkness... Where is 
               he, where...? Then, as the ECHOES finally fade, she hears 
               something else - a tortured, sucking, WHISTLE from perhaps 
               eight feet away...

               MOVING ANGLE - WITH CLARICE

               as she crawls forward, on her elbows, following her gun, 
               until it bumps against Mr. Gumb's shoulder. He is lying on 
               his back, chest a bloody mess. She slides her muzzle against 
               his head, hard, but he doesn't move; another shot isn't 
               needed. He stares upwards, through his goggles, bloody lips 
               working. He tries to speak, but cannot. One hand reaches 
               slowly upwards, the fingers twitching, as if to seize 
               something, overhead... Then a final, ghastly groan, his hand 
               drops, he is dead. Clarice feels for a pulse at his neck, 
               making sure. Then, and only then, does she permit herself to 
               roll over, collapsing onto her back beside him.

               OVERHEAD ANGLE

               down at the two faces - intimately close together, like lovers 
               on their pillow. Then, as we PULL SLOWLY AWAY, we see that 
               her staring eyes, and his dead gaze, are both locked onto -

               A DEATH'S-HEAD MOTH -

               perched on an infra-red bulb, overhead, its wings pumping 
               slowly.

               SOUND UPCUT - wailing SIRENS, many excited VOICES, as we...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. MR. GUMB'S HOUSE - DUSK

               The front porch of the tall Victorian house is bathed in a 
               glare of TV lights, police and ambulance flashers. Cars and 
               vans and even a firetruck choke the street; cops, reporters, 
               EMS workers and curious civilians swarm around the ineffective 
               barricades. The BUZZ of their voices goes even higher as

               CLARICE

               dazed, her face bandaged - comes out of the house, walking 
               protectively beside Catherine, who is wheeled on a gurney.

               They are followed out by uniformed cops, then two firemen 
               with an extension ladder. Catherine, blinking in confusion, 
               is still clutching the little dog, and refuses to give her 
               up even as she's trundled into an ambulance. Clarice sways 
               with exhaustion; everyone seems to be shouting at her at 
               once, pulling her sleeve. She tries to fight free of them, 
               desperate for a familiar face.

               AN OHIO HIGHWAY PATROL CAR

               pulls up, stops, and Crawford climbs out of the back seat. 
               He makes his way anxiously through the press of bodies, 
               stopping when he sees Clarice.

               THEY LOOK AT ONE ANOTHER

               for a long moment, Crawford choked with pride for her, with 
               sorrow for her ordeal, with love, but unable to find any 
               words. And then he does.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Starling... your father sees you.

               And then all at once she is sobbing, her knees giving way, 
               but he is there to catch her, he is hugging her fiercely. 
               HOLD ON them for a long beat.

                                     DIRECTOR BURKE (V.O.)
                              (over loudspeaker)
                         Congratulations! You are now officers 
                         of the Federal Bureau of 
                         Investigation...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. GROUNDS OF THE FBI ACADEMY - WEEKS LATER - DAY

               The forty members of Clarice's class, resplendent in their 
               best dark suits and dresses, rise, cheering themselves, then 
               turn happily to wave to their audience, as APPLAUSE mounts. 
               Beyond them, on a gaily tented platform, the Director stands 
               behind his podium.

               CLARICE AND ARDELIA

               look at one another solemnly. Ardelia holds up both fists, 
               in a power shake, and Clarice taps them with her own. She is 
               radiantly beautiful in a navy dress and pearls, the thin 
               scar on her cheek almost healed. Ardelia turns, waving towards 
               the crowd, the Clarice's thoughts are elsewhere. She turns, 
               searching among the dignitaries on the platform, till she 
               locates

               CRAWFORD

               who smiles back at her with quiet pride, and offers a little 
               salute.

               CLARICE

               grins - more happy than we've ever seen her - then turns to 
               wave towards the crowd with the others.

               MOVING ANGLE

               over the admiring sea of spectators, several hundred of them, 
               still rising from their folding chairs, APPLAUDING in 
               celebration of these special young people, this perfect, 
               sunlit day.

               SOUND UPCUT - rock music, laughter - as we...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. ACADEMY DORM - REC ROOM - THAT NIGHT

               A LOUD party is underway - food, beer, dancing - as the new 
               grads celebrate ferociously. Ardelia weaves her way through 
               the crowded room, reaches Clarice, who is flanked by her 
               special guests - Pilcher and Roden, the two ardent scientists. 
               Ardelia has to shout at Clarice over the din.

                                     ARDELIA
                         Agent Starling! Telephone!

                                     CLARICE
                              (surprised)
                         Agent Mapp! Thank you!

               She nods to Pilcher, leaves them. Roden, who is quite happily 
               drunk, grabs the startled Ardelia around the waist.

                                     RODEN
                         Hel-lo, gorgeous! Let's get down.

               Ardelia looks at Pilcher, confused.

                                     PILCHER
                         Just ignore him. He's not a Ph.D.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Clarice picks up the dangling pay phone, speaks happily.

                                     CLARICE
                         Starling.

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         Well, Clarice, have the lambs stopped 
                         screaming...?

               She freezes, stunned by the familiar voice. Then she turns, 
               waving frantically towards

               ARDELIA

               who is just inside the rec room door, at the end of the hall, 
               lost in conversation with Pilcher and Roden. Ardelia glances 
               at her briefly but misunderstands, waves cheerfully back.

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         Don't bother with a trace, I won't 
                         be on long enough.

               CLARICE

               turns back, gripping the phone more tightly.

                                     CLARICE
                         Where are you, Dr. Lecter?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. A CLEAR NIGHT SKY

               Very beautiful, glittering with countless stars.

                                     DR. LECTER (O.S.)
                         Where I have a view, Clarice...

               MOVING DOWN

               we see a rolling lawn, a curving bay. Boats ride at anchor, 
               lights shimmering...

                                     DR. LECTER (O.S.)
                         Orion is looking splendid tonight, 
                         and Arcturus, the Herdsman, with his 
                         flock...

               DR. LECTER

               smiles into his mobile phone. He is stretched out on a 
               lounger, on a tiled patio, languidly paring an orange with a 
               penknife. His appearance is quite altered - a beard, glasses, 
               lighter hair. He's has some cosmetic surgery, as well.

                                     DR. LECTER
                              (into phone)
                         Your lambs are still for now, Clarice, 
                         but not forever... You'll have to 
                         earn it again and again, this blessed 
                         silence. Because it's the plight 
                         that drives you, and the plight will 
                         never end.

                                     CLARICE
                         Dr. Lecter -

                                     DR. LECTER
                         I have no plans to call on you, 
                         Clarice, the world being more 
                         interesting with you in it. Be sure 
                         you extend me the same courtesy.

                                     CLARICE (V.O.)
                         You know I can't make that promise.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Goodbye, Clarice...
                              (and then, softly)
                         You looked - so very lovely today, 
                         in your blue suit.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT

               As Clarice reacts, the fill weight of his words sinking in.

                                     CLARICE
                         Dr. Lecter... Dr. Lecter...!

               But only a DIAL TONE comes from the phone. She is still 
               staring at her receiver, in shock, as we -

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

               EXT. THE MOONLIT PATIO

               Dr. Lecter sighs, sets his phone down, then rises. Popping 
               an orange section into his mouth, he turns towards the 
               brightly lit house. Stepping delicately over the sprawled 
               body of a uniformed security guard, he walks in through open 
               french doors.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. A BOOKLINED STUDY

               In a swivel chair, amidst the wreckage of his papers and 
               books, is the writhing figure of Dr. Frederick Chilton. The 
               extreme intricacy of his bindings recalls Dr. Lecter's own 
               former restraints. His screams are muffled by the tape over 
               his mouth; he stares at Dr. Lecter like a rabbit trapped in 
               headlights.

               DR. LECTER

               Considers him for a genial moment, then raises the little 
               pen-knife. His eyes are twinkling.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Well, Dr. Chilton. Shall we begin?

                                                                   FADE OUT

               FADE IN:

               INT. GRUBBY HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY (DIMLY LIT)

               A woman's face BACKS INTO SHOT, her head resting against 
               grimy wallpaper. She is tense, sweaty, wide-eyed with 
               concentration. This is CLARICE STARLING, mid-20's, trim, 
               very pretty. She wears Kevlar body armor over a navy 
               windbreaker, khaki pants. Her thick hair is piled under a 
               navy baseball cap. A revolver, clutched in her right hand, 
               hovers by her ear. She raises a speedloader, in her left 
               hand, locks it into her cylinder, twists and reloads.

               CLOSE ON

               A guest room door, with a small, wired pack attached to its 
               knob. Suddenly, wish a sharp CRACK!, the knob explodes, and 
               the door bursts open.

               WITH CLARICE - MOVING SHOT

               as she runs around a corner, through a cloud of smoke. She 
               shoulders aside the shattered door and rushes inside, gun at 
               the ready in both hands...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

               CLARICE'S POV - MOVING - as she first sees, sitting on the 
               edge of a bed - a FEMALE HOSTAGE. Black, late 20's, gagged, 
               hands behind her back. Then, SWIVELLING... she sees a startled 
               MALE SUSPECT, white, mid-20's, standing by a window with a 
               rifle in his hands. He is turning towards her...

               Clarice drops into a combat crouch, gun extended, and shouts.

                                     CLARICE
                         Freeze! FBI!

               CLARICE'S POV - SLOW MOTION

               all natural SOUND suspended - as the Suspect faces her with 
               a strange, pleading expression. The rifle is rising in his 
               hands, but oddly enough, it is held across his chest, not 
               pointing. Then another puzzling detail registers...

               THE SUSPECT'S HANDS

               are taped to his gun, away from the trigger; he couldn't use 
               it even if he tried. Suddenly we hear a metallic CLICK, which 
               registers with unnatural amplification, as - Clarice reacts, 
               drops to the floor, rolling sideways, and -

               THE "HOSTAGE"

               pulls a revolver out from behind her back, still in SLOW 
               MOTION, raising it in her untied hands. She fires repeatedly, 
               flames leaping from the muzzle; the SOUND is an echoing roar 
               in these close quarters, but -

               Clarice has come up on one knee, beside an armchair, and is 
               already firing back herself, two quick SHOTS, which send -

               THE "HOSTAGE"

               pitching over the bed, backwards, to shudder and lie still 
               in a haze of gunsmoke. Clarice rushes to her, clamping one 
               knee down on her gun hand, still keeping her covered in case 
               of movement. HOLD for a few beats... then we hear the shrill 
               blast of a WHISTLE from somewhere, off screen, as normal 
               ACTION and SOUND are restored.

                                     BRIGHAM (O.S.)
                         Okay, people, good exercise...

               Clarice relaxes, lowering her gun. The lights brighten.

               PULLING BACK

               we see that we're in some sort of auditorium, with the "hotel 
               room" and its "corridor" built as a training set. JOHN BRIGHAM 
               walks onto this set, thumbing a stopwatch. Mid-40's, ex-
               Marine. His T-shirt's lettering says "Firearms Instructor / 
               FBI Academy."

                                     BRIGHAM
                         Starling's reaction time was 
                         excellent. Let's break. Critique in 
                         five.

               A class of about forty young FBI trainees, of both sexes, 
               begins to rise from their seats, mingling and chatting. 

               Clarice nods amiably to the "Suspect", then gives her 
               "Hostage" a hand up. It's ARDELIA MAPP, her roommate. Her 
               broad, clever face breaks into a big smile, as they both 
               remove ear plugs. Clarice's voice has just a soft trace of 
               southern accent.

                                     ARDELIA
                         Damn, Clarice, how'd you make me?

                                     CLARICE
                              (indicating her gun)
                         Never cock. Just squeeze.

                                     ARDELIA
                              (grins)
                         I love it when you talk dirty.

               As Brigham joins them, Clarice can't resist a star pupil's 
               little smile of pride. He frowns good-naturedly.

                                     BRIGHAM
                         What're you laughin' at, Junior G-
                         Man? She got off four rounds to your 
                         two.

               He takes out a steel-coiled grip flexer, drops it onto her 
               palm.

                                     BRIGHAM
                              (continuing)
                         One hundred reps, each hand, every 
                         day. Now tidy up, the Section Chief 
                         wants to see you.

               He nods a direction, then moves off. Clarice, with her smile 
               finally fading, looks out into the auditorium.

               SPECIAL AGENT JACK CRAWFORD

               sits on the top step of the aisle, looking down at her. He 
               is 53, strongly built. He rises impassively, exits through 
               the back door. He carries a think manila envelope under one 
               arm.

               Ardelia who is helping Clarice unbuckle her bullet-proof 
               vest, follows her worried gaze.

                                     CLARICE
                         What'd I do?

                                     ARDELIA
                         Stay cool. Just remember to call him 
                         "God."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. FBI ACADEMY GROUNDS, QUANTICO, VIRGINIA - DAY

               Crawford is watching a group of trainees on the firing range, 
               as Clarice joins him. He looks tired, haunted. Between master 
               and student, we sense a subtle, muted tug of sexuality.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Starling, Clarice M., good morning.

                                     CLARICE
                         Good morning, Mr. Crawford.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Your instructors tell me you're doing 
                         well. Top quarter of the class.

                                     CLARICE
                         I hope so. They haven't posted 
                         anything.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         A job's come up and I thought about 
                         you. Not really a job, more of - an 
                         interesting errand. Walk me to my 
                         car, Starling.

               They begin to cross the academy grounds. A group of trainees 
               jogs by, in matching sweats, following a p.e. coach.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         We're trying to interview all of the 
                         serial killers now in custody, for a 
                         psychobehavioral profile. Could be a 
                         big help in unsolved cases. Most of 
                         them have been happy to talk to us. 
                         They have a compulsion to boast, 
                         these people... Do you spook easily, 
                         Starling?

                                     CLARICE
                         Not yet.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         You see, the one we want most refuses 
                         to cooperate. I want you to go after 
                         him again today, in the asylum.

                                     CLARICE
                         Who's the subject?

                                     CRAWFORD
                         The psychiatrist - Dr. Hannibal 
                         Lecter.

               Clarice stops walking, goes very still. A beat.

                                     CLARICE
                         The cannibal...

               Crawford doesn't respond, except to study her face.

                                     CLARICE
                         Yes, well... Okay, right. I'm glad 
                         for the chance, sir, but - why me?

                                     CRAWFORD
                         You're qualified and available. And 
                         frankly, I can't spare a real agent 
                         right now.

               He walks on again, at a faster clip. She hurried to keep up.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         I don't expect him to talk to you, 
                         but I have to be able to say we 
                         tried... Lecter was a brilliant 
                         psychiatrist, and he knows all the 
                         dodges.
                              (hands her the manila 
                              envelope)
                         Dossier on him, copy of our 
                         questionnaire, special ID for you... 
                         If he won't talk, then I want straight 
                         reporting. How's he look, how's his 
                         cell look, what's he writing? The 
                         Director himself will see your report, 
                         over your own signature - if I decide 
                         it's good enough. I want that by 
                         0800 Wednesday, and keep this to 
                         yourself.

               They're reached his car. His driver stamps on a cigarette, 
               climbs in behind the wheel. BURROUGHS, his assistant, says 
               something into a walkie-talkie, then opens the back door. 
               But Crawford pulls her aside, a hand on her shoulder. His 
               intensity is scary.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Now. I want your full attention, 
                         Starling. Are you listening to me?

                                     CLARICE
                         Yes sir.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Be very careful with Hannibal Lecter. 
                         Dr. Chilton at the asylum will go 
                         over the physical procedures used 
                         with him. Do not deviate from them, 
                         for any reason. You tell him nothing 
                         personal, Starling. Believe me, you 
                         don't want Hannibal Lecter inside 
                         your head... Just do your job, but 
                         never forget what he is.

                                     CLARICE
                              (a bit unnerved)
                         And what is that, sir?

                                     CHILTON (V.O.)
                         Oh, he's a monster. A pure 
                         psychopath...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CHILTON'S OFFICE - BALTIMORE STATE HOSPITAL FOR THE 
               CRIMINALLY INSANE - DAY

               CLOSE ON an ID card held in a male hand. Clarice's photo, 
               official-looking graphics. It calls her a "Federal 
               Investigator."

                                     CHILTON (O.S.)
                         It's so rare to capture one alive. 
                         From a research point of view, Dr. 
                         Lecter is our most prized asset...

               DR. FREDERICK CHILTON looks up from her card. A smarmy little 
               peacock, behind a vast desk; he's conceived an instant, 
               hopeless letch for Clarice. He smiles, stroking her card 
               with his beloved gold pen.

                                     CHILTON
                         You know, we get a lot of detectives 
                         here, but I must say, I can't ever 
                         remember one so attractive...

               NEW ANGLE - REVEALS CLARICE

               now wearing a more feminine skirt suit. Hair neatly coiled, 
               elegant shoulder bag, briefcase. He has rudely left her 
               standing.

                                     CHILTON
                         Will you be in Baltimore overnight...? 
                         Because this can be quite a fun town, 
                         if you have the right guide.

               Clarice tries, unsuccessfully, to hide her distaste for him.

                                     CLARICE
                         I'm sure it's a great town, Dr. 
                         Chilton, but my instructions are to 
                         talk to Lecter and report back this 
                         afternoon.

                                     CHILTON
                              (pause, sourly)
                         I see.
                              (beat)
                         Let's make this quick, then. I'm 
                         busy.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ASYLUM CORRIDOR - UPPER FLOOR - DAY

               Clarice flinches as a heavy steel gate CLANGS shut behind 
               her, the bolt shooting home. Chilton walks ahead of her.

                                     CHILTON
                         Lecter carved up nine people - that 
                         we're sure of - and cooked his 
                         favorite bits. We've tried to study 
                         him, of course - but he's much too 
                         sophisticated for the standard tests. 
                         And my, does he hate us! Thinks I'm 
                         his nemesis... Crawford's very clever, 
                         isn't he? Using you.

                                     CLARICE
                         How do you mean, Dr. Chilton?

                                     CHILTON
                         A pretty young woman, to turn him 
                         on? I don't believe Lecter's ever 
                         seen a woman in eight years. And oh, 
                         are you ever his "taste" - so to 
                         speak.

                                     CLARICE
                         I graduated magna from UVA, Doctor. 
                         It's not a charm school.

                                     CHILTON
                         Good. Then you should be able to 
                         remember the rules.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DIFFERENT CORRIDOR - LOWER FLOOR - DAY

               A darker, even grimmer area. Heavy grids over the lights. 
               Distant SLAMMINGS and faint, hoarse SHOUTS. They walk briskly.

                                     CHILTON
                         Do not reach through the bars, do 
                         not touch the bars. You pass him 
                         nothing but soft paper - no pens or 
                         pencils. No staples or paperclips in 
                         his paper. Use the sliding food 
                         carrier, no exceptions. Do not accept 
                         anything he attempts to hold out to 
                         you. Do you understand me?

                                     CLARICE
                         I understand.

                                     CHILTON
                         I'm going to show you why we insist 
                         on such precautions... On the 
                         afternoon of July 8, 1981, he 
                         complained of chest pains and was 
                         taken to the dispensary. His 
                         mouthpiece and restraints were removed 
                         for an EKG. When the nurse bent over 
                         him, he did this to her...

               He hands Clarice a small, dog-eared photo. Looking at it, 
               she is stopped in her tracks. This pleases Chilton.

                                     CHILTON
                         The doctors managed to re-set her 
                         jaw, more or less, and save one of 
                         her eyes. His pulse never got over 
                         eighty-five, even when he ate her 
                         tongue.
                              (pauses, he smiles)
                         I keep him in here.

               He turns, pushes a button. A steel door BUZZES slowly open, 
               and BARNEY - a big, impassive orderly - awaits them in an 
               anteroom. On its walls: restraints, mouthpieces, Mace, 
               tranquilizer guns.

                                     CLARICE
                              (quickly blocking him)
                         Dr. Chilton - if Lecter feels you're 
                         his enemy - as you've said - then 
                         maybe I'll have more luck by myself. 
                         What do you think?

                                     CHILTON
                              (annoyed)
                         You might have suggested that in my 
                         office, and saved me the time.

                                     CLARICE
                         But then I would've missed the 
                         pleasure of your company.

               She holds out the photo. A beat. He grabs it, jaw twitching.

                                     CHILTON
                         When she's finished, bring her out.

               He turns on his heel, goes. Barney smiles reassuringly.

                                     BARNEY
                         Hi, I'm Barney. He told you, don't 
                         get near the bars?

                                     CLARICE
                              (shaking his hand)
                         Clarice Starling. Yes, he did.

                                     BARNEY
                         Okay. Past the others, it's the last 
                         cell. Stay to the middle. I put out 
                         a chair for you.

               Sensing her tension, he indicates a nearby security monitor.

                                     BARNEY
                         I'm watching. You'll do fine.

               Clarice nods gratefully. She looks down the long corridor, 
               takes a deep breath, walks into it. He watches her go.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DR. LECTER'S CORRIDOR - DAY

               MOVING SHOT - with Clarice, as her footsteps ECHO. High to 
               her right, surveillance cameras. On her left, cells. Some 
               are padded, with narrow observation slits, others are normal, 
               barred... Shadowy occupants pacing, MUTTERING... Suddenly a 
               dark figure in the next-to-last cell hurtles towards her, 
               his face mashing grotesquely against his bars as he hisses.

                                     DARK FIGURE
                         I c-can sssmell your cunt!

               Clarice flinches momentarily, but then walks on.

               DR. LECTER'S CELL

               is coming slowly INTO VIEW... Behind its barred front wall 
               is a second barrier of stout nylon net... Sparse, bolted-
               down furniture, many softcover books and papers. On the walls, 
               extraordinarily detailed, skillful drawings, mostly European 
               cityscapes, in charcoal or crayon.

               Clarice stops, at a polite distance from his bars, clears 
               her throat.

                                     CLARICE
                         Dr. Lecter... My name is Clarice 
                         Starling. May I talk with you?

               Dr. Hannibal Lecter is lounging on his bunk, in white pajamas, 
               reading an Italian Vogue. He turns, considers her... A face 
               so long out of the sun, it seems almost leached - except for 
               the glittering eyes, and the wet red mouth. He rises smoothly, 
               crossing to stand before her; the gracious host. His voice 
               is cultured, soft.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Good morning.

               CUTTING BETWEEN THEM

               as Clarice comes a measured distance closer.

                                     CLARICE
                         Doctor, we have a hard problem in 
                         psychological profiling. I want to 
                         ask for your help with a 
                         questionnaire.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         "We" being the Behavioral Science 
                         Unit, at Quantico. You're one of 
                         Jack Crawford's, I expect.

                                     CLARICE
                         I am, yes.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         May I see your credentials?

               Clarice is surprised, but fishes her ID card from her bag, 
               holds it up for his inspection. He smiles, soothingly.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Closer, please... Clo-ser...

               She complies each time, trying to hide her fear. Dr. Lecter's 
               nostrils lift, as he gently, like an animal, tests the air. 
               Then he smiles, glancing at her card.

                                     DR. LECTER
                              (continuing)
                         That expires in one week. You're not 
                         real FBI, are you?

                                     CLARICE
                         I'm - still in training at the 
                         Academy.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?

                                     CLARICE
                         We're talking about psychology, 
                         Doctor, not the Bureau. Can you decide 
                         for yourself whether or not I'm 
                         qualified?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Mmmmm... That's rather slippery of 
                         you, Officer Starling. Sit. Please.

               She sits in the folding metal desk-chair. He waits politely 
               till she's settled, then sits down himself, faces her happily.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Now then. What did Miggs say to you?
                              (she is puzzled)
                         "Multiple Miggs," in the next cell. 
                         He hissed at you. What did he say?

                                     CLARICE
                         He said - "I can smell your cunt."

                                     DR. LECTER
                         I see. I myself cannot. You use Evyan 
                         skin cream, and sometimes you wear 
                         L'Air du Temps, but not today. You 
                         brought your best bag, though, didn't 
                         you?

                                     CLARICE
                              (beat)
                         Yes.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         It's much better than your shoes.

                                     CLARICE
                         Maybe they'll catch up.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         I have no doubt of it.

                                     CLARICE
                              (shifting uncomfortably)
                         Did you do those drawings, Doctor?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Yes. That's the Duomo, seen from the 
                         Belvedere. Do you know Florence?

                                     CLARICE
                         All that detail, just from memory...?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Memory, Officer Starling, is what I 
                         have instead of view.

               A pause, then Clarice takes the questionnaire from her case.

                                     CLARICE
                         Dr. Lecter, if you'd please consider -

                                     DR. LECTER
                         No, no, no. You were doing fine, 
                         you'd been courteous and receptive 
                         to courtesy, you'd established trust 
                         with the embarrassing truth about 
                         Miggs, and now this ham-handed segue 
                         into your questionnaire. It won't 
                         do. It's stupid and boring.

                                     CLARICE
                         I'm only asking you to look at this, 
                         Doctor. Either you will or you won't.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed 
                         if he's recruiting help from the 
                         student body. Busy hunting that new 
                         one, Buffalo Bill... Such a naughty 
                         boy! Did Crawford send you to ask 
                         for my advice on him?

                                     CLARICE
                         No, I came because we need -

                                     DR. LECTER
                         How many women has he used, our Bill?

                                     CLARICE
                         Five... so far.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         All flayed...?

                                     CLARICE
                         Partially, yes. But Doctor, that's 
                         an active case, I'm not involved. If -

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Do you know why he's called Buffalo 
                         Bill? Tell me. The newspapers won't 
                         say.

                                     CLARICE
                         I'll tell you if you'll look at this 
                         form.
                              (he considers, then 
                              nods)
                         It started as a bad joke in Kansas 
                         City Homicide. They said... this one 
                         likes to skin his humps.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Witless and misleading. Why do you 
                         think he takes their skins, Officer 
                         Starling? Thrill me with your wisdom.

                                     CLARICE
                         It excites him. Most serial killers 
                         keep some sort of trophies.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         I didn't.

                                     CLARICE
                         No. You ate yours.

               A tense beat, then a smile from him, at this small boldness.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Send that through.

               She rolls him the questionnaire, in his sliding food tray. 
               He rises, glances at it, turning a page or two disdainfully.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Oh, Officer Starling... do you think 
                         you can dissect me with this blunt 
                         little tool?

                                     CLARICE
                         No. I only hoped that your knowledge -

               Suddenly he whips the tray back at her, with a metallic CLANG 
               that makes her start. His voice remains a pleasant purr.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         You're sooo ambitious, aren't you...? 
                         You know what you look like to me, 
                         with your good bag and your cheap 
                         shoes? You look like a rube. A well-
                         scrubbed, hustling rube with a little, 
                         taste... Good nutrition has given 
                         you some length of bone, but you're 
                         not more than one generation from 
                         poor white trash, are you Officer 
                         Starling...? That accent you're trying 
                         so desperately to shed - pure West 
                         Virginia. What was your father, dear? 
                         Was he a coal miner? Did he stink of 
                         the lamp...? And oh, how quickly the 
                         boys found you! All those tedious, 
                         sticky fumblings, in the back seats 
                         of cars, while you could only dream 
                         of getting out. Getting anywhere -
                         yes? Getting all the way - to the 
                         F...B...I.

               His every word has struck her like a tiny, precise dart. But 
               she squares her jaw and won't give ground.

                                     CLARICE
                         You see a lot, Dr. Lecter. But are 
                         you strong enough to point that high-
                         powered perception at yourself? How 
                         about it...? Look at yourself and 
                         write down the truth.
                              (she slams the tray 
                              back at him)
                         Or maybe you're afraid to.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         You're a tough one, aren't you?

                                     CLARICE
                         Reasonably so. Yes.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         And you'd hate to think you were 
                         common. My, wouldn't that sting! 
                         Well you're far from common, Officer 
                         Starling. All you have is the fear 
                         of it.
                              (beat)
                         Now please excuse me. Good day.

                                     CLARICE
                         And the questionnaire...?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         A census taker once tried to test 
                         me. I ate his liver with some fava 
                         beans and a nice chianti... Fly back 
                         to school, little Starling.

               He steps backwards, then returns to his cot, becoming as 
               still and remote as a statue. Frustrated, Clarice hesitates, 
               then finally shoulders her bag and goes, leaving the 
               questionnaire in his tray. But after just a few steps, as 
               she passes -

               MIGG'S CELL

               She sees that creature at his bars again, hissing at her.

                                     MIGGS
                         I b-bit my wrist so I c-can diiiieeee! 
                         S-ee how it bleeeeeeeeds?

               The dark figure suddenly flings his palm towards her, and -

               CLARICE

               is spattered on the face and neck - not with blood, but with 
               pale droplets of semen. She gives a little cry, touching her 
               fingers to the wetness. Stunned, near tears, she forces 
               herself to straighten up and walk on, fumbling for a tissue. 
               From behind her, Dr. Lecter calls out, very agitated.

                                     DR. LECTER (O.S.)
                         Officer Starling... Officer Starling!

               Clarice slows, stops. She shudders, but makes the very 
               difficult choice to turn, walk back, stand again in front of -

               DR. LECTER

               Who's shivering with rage. For an instant his face opens, 
               and we catch a glimpse into hell itself. Then he's composed 
               again.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         I would not have had that happen to 
                         you. Discourtesy is - unspeakably 
                         ugly to me.

                                     CLARICE
                         Then please - do this test for me.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         No. But I will make you happy... 
                         I'll give you a chance for what you 
                         love most, Clarice Starling.

                                     CLARICE
                         What's that, Dr. Lecter?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Advancement, of course.
                              (beat)
                         Go to Split City. See Miss Mofet, an 
                         old patient of mine. M-O-F-E-T... 
                         Now go. Go.
                              (a smile)
                         I don't think Miggs could manage 
                         again so soon, even if he is crazy - 
                         do you?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE HOSPITAL - PARKING LOT - DAY

               The grim gothic pile of the asylum looms overhead as Clarice 
               rushes out the front doors. She is badly shaken, almost 
               stumbling, as she rubs at her face. She looks around for, 
               and finally, with some relief, spots -

               HER CAR

               an old Pinto, parked nearby. This image begins to BLUR...

               CLOSE ON

               her face, fighting tears, as the CAMERA begins to WHIRL AROUND 
               her, almost dizzily. She is seeing, in her mind's eye -

               IN FLASHBACK

               a screen door banging open, on a wooden porch, and a 10-year 
               old girl - the young Clarice - rushing outside, down the 
               front steps, and running joyfully across her front yard to -

               MOVING ANGLE - THE GIRL'S POV

               a car - late 60's vintage - parked in the dirt road. A MAN, 
               Clarice's father, is just climbing out. He's tall, handsome, 
               and has a marshal's badge pinned on his dark suit. He grins, 
               seeing her, and spreads his arms wide as...

               THE YOUNG CLARICE

               rushes into them, and he sweeps her up in a hug, spinning 
               her around, the CAMERA SPINNING with them, and capturing 
               both their laughing faces, before we abruptly return to -

               THE ADULT CLARICE

               alone in the parking lot, sagging against her car. Her face 
               is buried in her arms, she shoulders shaking. SOUND UPCUT - 
               a steady, rapid series of GUNSHOTS, as we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FBI ACADEMY FIRING RANGE - DAY

               Clarice, in a combat stance, and wearing a sound-muffling 
               headset, is squeezing off ROUND after ROUND at

               A MOVING TARGET

               The silhouette of a man, approaching along a track. Her shots, 
               tightly grouped, are all finding the center chest. The target 
               stops, quite close to her, still swaying.

               Clarice stares at it, deftly working her speedloader. Then 
               she puts a final, emphatic shot right through THE FIGURE'S 
               FOREHEAD.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FBI ACADEMY LIBRARY - NIGHT

               CLOSE ON a microfilm monitor - a grainy newsphoto of Dr. 
               Lecter, scrawling past, with an accompanying story ("New 
               Horrors in Cannibal Trial"), dated 1980.

               Clarice is punching keys on the terminal. Other trainees 
               study at nearby tables.

               She pauses, jotting a note on her pad, as Ardelia comes by, 
               carrying an armful of books.

                                     ARDELIA
                         Phone call, Clarice. It's God.

                                     CLARICE
                         Thanks, Ardelia.

               MOVING ANGLE

               as Clarice rises, grabbing her notebook, and follows Ardelia 
               past high metal bookstacks.

                                     ARDELIA
                         You missed Fourth Amendment law. 
                         Unlawful seizure, real juicy stuff. 
                         Where were you all afternoon?

                                     CLARICE
                         Pleading with a crazy man, with come 
                         all over my face.

               Ardelia stares at her, figures it's a put-on, laughs.

                                     ARDELIA
                         Damn. Wish I had time for a social 
                         life.

               Clarice grins, as Ardelia indicates a phone receiver resting 
               on the check-out desk, then moves on. Clarice picks it up.

                                     CLARICE
                              (on phone)
                         Mr. Crawford?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CRAWFORD'S HOUSE - STUDY - NIGHT

               Crawford, in a cardigan, sits in a wing chair in the book- 
               lined study of his suburban home. He turns the pages of 
               Clarice's memo as they talk. His tone is sharp.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         I've read your interim memo on Lecter. 
                         You sure you've left nothing out?

               INTERCUTTING

                                     CLARICE
                         It's all there, sir, practically 
                         verbatim.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Every word, Starling? Every gesture?

                                     CLARICE
                              (a bit heatedly)
                         Right down to the kleenex I used.
                              (he is silent)
                         Sir, why? Is something wrong?

                                     CRAWFORD
                         He mentioned a name, at the very 
                         end. "Mofet..." Any followup on her?

                                     CLARICE
                         I spent all evening on the mainframe. 
                         Lecter altered or destroyed most of 
                         his patient histories, prior to 
                         capture. No record of anyone named 
                         Mofet. But "Split City" sounded like 
                         it might have have something to do 
                         with divorce. I tracked it down in 
                         the library's catalogue of national 
                         yellow pages.
                              (glancing at her notes)
                         It's a mini-storage facility outside 
                         Baltimore, where Lecter had his 
                         practice.

               She pauses, expecting some soft of approval for her 
               cleverness.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Well? Why aren't you there right 
                         now?

                                     CLARICE
                         Sir, that's a field job. It's outside 
                         the scope of my assignment. And I've
                         got a test tomorrow on -

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Do you recall my instructions to 
                         you, Starling? What were they?

                                     CLARICE
                         To complete and file my report by 
                         0800 Wednesday. But sir -

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Then do that, Starling. Do just 
                         exactly that.

                                     CLARICE
                         Sir, what is it? There's something 
                         you're not telling me.

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (beat)
                         Miggs has been murdered.

                                     CLARICE
                              (startled, upset)
                         Murdered...? How?

                                     CRAWFORD
                         The orderly heard Lecter whispering 
                         to him, all afternoon, and Miggs 
                         crying. They found him at bed check. 
                         He'd swallowed his own tongue... 
                         Chilton is scared stiff the family 
                         will file a civil rights lawsuit, 
                         and he's trying to blame it on you. 
                         I told the little prick your conduct 
                         was flawless.
                              (beat)
                         Starling...?

                                     CLARICE
                         I'm here, sir, I just - I don't know 
                         how to feel about it.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         You don't have to feel any way about 
                         it. Lecter did it to amuse himself. 
                         Why not, what can they do? Take away 
                         his books for awhile, and no jello...
                              (a bit softer)
                         I know it got ugly today. But this 
                         is your report, Starling - take it 
                         as far as you can. On your own time, 
                         outside of class. Now carry on.

               ANGLE ON CLARICE

               as we hear the loud CLICK of Crawford hanging up. She stares 
               at her receiver, stung by his abruptness.

                                     CLARICE
                         Well God damn it! You old creep. 
                         Creepo son of a bitch. Let Miggs 
                         squirt you and see how you like it.

               She slams her receiver into its cradle.

               ANGLE ON CRAWFORD

               as he flips aside her memo, then rises, wearily. He leaves 
               his study, flicking off the lamp, and pads away in his 
               slippers.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CRAWFORD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               A private nurse, in white, stands marking a clipboard chart, 
               as Crawford enters his tidy bedroom.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         I'll take over, Patricia. You get 
                         some rest.

               The nurse nods, hands him the chart, and goes. He glances at 
               it, then sets it aside. He crosses to -

               BELLA CRAWFORD

               who lies in an elevated hospital bed. Nearby are an oxygen 
               tank and mask, floral arrangements. Her breathing is shallow, 
               very labored. Crawford looks down at his comatose wife for a 
               long moment, tenderly brushes a strand of her hair back into 
               place, then bends over to kiss her forehead. SOUND UPCUT - 
               THUNDER and RAIN...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. "SPLIT CITY MINI-STORAGE" - DUSK (RAINING)

               An orange neon sign, streaked with rain, identifies out 
               location. It looms over a hurricane fence, topped with barbed 
               wire. Inside, row on row of garage-sized, cinderblock sheds.

               Clarice, kneeling before a closed, roll-up metal door, takes 
               a FLASH photo of its sealed padlock. EVERETT YOW, a fat, 
               60ish Chinaman, holds an umbrella over them both. He looks 
               unhappy.

                                     CLARICE
                         So no one's been in here since - 
                         1980?

               She opens the padlock, using a fat ring of tagged keys, then 
               sets aside both keys and lock.

                                     MR. YOW
                         Not to my knowledge. Privacy is a 
                         great concern to my customers. But, 
                         if you say this is an FBI matter...

                                     CLARICE
                         I won't disturb anything, Mr. Yow, I 
                         promise. Be gone before you know it.

               Slinging her camera over a shoulder, she tugs at the handle, 
               but the door won't budge. Another tug, harder - no good. Mr. 
               Yow stoops to help, puffing hard, but it's firmly stuck. He 
               sighs.

                                     MR. YOW
                         We could return tomorrow, with my 
                         son. Or perhaps some workmen...?

               Clarice crosses to her Pinto, which faces the shed, reaches 
               in to turn on her headlights. Mr. Yow blinks in the sudden 
               brightness. Then she opens her truck, rummaging inside, and 
               returns with a bumper jack, a flashlight, and a rubber floor 
               mat.

                                     CLARICE
                         Would you hold these, please?

               She gives him her flashlight and camera, drops the mat on 
               the ground, then sets the bumper jack in place, under the 
               center of the door. She pumps on the jack handle as the door 
               SQUEALS slowly up, but it won't go higher than about 18 
               inches, despite all her exertions. She spreads out the rubber 
               mat on the cement, takes the flashlight from Mr. Yow, then 
               lies on the mat.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE STORAGE SHED - DUSK (VERY DARK)

               Clarice, backlit, peers under the door. She reaches in, makes 
               a sweep with her flashlight. We catch shadowy outlines - 
               boxes, then the flattened tires of a car...

               SOUND of rain on the tin roof, and other noises, too - small 
               RUSTLINGS. Mr. Yow's chubby face appears down beside 
               Clarice's.

                                     MR. YOW
                         It smells like mice... I think I 
                         hear them, too - don't you?

               Clarice turns onto her back, starts squirming under the door.

                                     MR. YOW
                         You're going in there?

               CUT BACK TO:

               EXT. STORAGE UNIT NUMBER 31 - DUSK

               Clarice pulls her head back out again, reaching to take her 
               camera from him. She hands him a card, trying to appear 
               nonchalant.

                                     CLARICE
                         Mr. Yow, if this door should fall
                         down -ha ha! - or anything else - 
                         would you be kind enough to call 
                         this number? It's our Baltimore field 
                         office. They know you're here with 
                         me... Do you understand?

                                     MR. YOW
                         Might I suggest tucking your pants 
                         into your socks? To prevent mouse 
                         intrusion.

                                     CLARICE
                              (beat)
                         Good idea.

               CUT BACK TO:

               INT. STORAGE SHED - DUSK (VERY DARK)

               Clarice squirms, on her back, through the narrow opening. As 
               she squeezes all the way in, she snags one thigh on the metal 
               edge of the door. She curses softly, shining her flashlight 
               on her ripped khakis - there's a small streak of blood.

                                     MR. YOW (O.S.)
                         Okay, Miss Starling?

                                     CLARICE
                         Okay, Mr. Yow...

               She shines her light around. In its narrow beam, we see -

               CLARICE'S POV - UPWARD, SHIFTING

               spiderwebs, everywhere... high stacks of cardboard boxes... 
               a few dusty pieces of furniture... the big car, oddly long 
               and tall, covered with a tarp... Suddenly there's a scurrying 
               of loud MUSICAL NOTES. Clarice turns, scared, her beam 
               capturing... an old upright piano.

                                     MR. YOW (O.S.)
                         You're playing a piano, Miss Starling?

                                     CLARICE
                         That wasn't me.

                                     MR. YOW (O.S.)
                         Oh.

               Clarice crawls a bit further. There's hardly room to stand, 
               but she finally manages to wriggle upright, clawing away 
               cobwebs, next to the car. Holding her light under one arm, 
               she takes several FLASH photos of the shed's interior, ending 
               with the car. Then, slinging her camera over the shoulder, 
               she folds back the tarp, resting it on the roof. The resulting 
               clouds of dust make her cough.

               THE CAR

               is an antique beauty, a 1931 Packard. It's very dusty, despite 
               the tarp. Curtains close off the back passenger compartment, 
               but there's a narrow gap in them. More mousy RUSTLINGS.

               CLARICE

               peers in through the gap, aiming her flashlight.

               HER POV - SHIFTING

               as the thin flashlight beam picks out: the broad back seat... 
               as open album of lacy, old-fashioned Valentines... a crumpled 
               lap rug, on the floor... and then a pair of women's shiny, 
               high-heeled pumps... Above these, the hem of a fancy satin 
               evening gown - and a pair of pale, stockinged legs.

               Clarice recoils, alarmed, then steadies herself.

                                     CLARICE
                         Mr. Yow? Oh Mr. Yow...? It looks 
                         like somebody is sitting in this 
                         car.

                                     MR. YOW (O.S.)
                         Oh my! Oh my... Maybe you better 
                         come out now, Miss Starling.

                                     CLARICE
                         Not yet! - just wait for me.
                              (under the breath)
                         Maybe in about two seconds.

               She leans down with her camera, takes a FLASH through the 
               gap, then tries the door handle. Locked. So is the front 
               door. She looks around, aiming her light, and locates a tangle 
               of coat-hangers, sticking out of a carton of bric-a-brac. 
               She pulls out one of these, straightens it quickly, bends 
               the tip into a hook.

               CLOSE ANGLE

               as she jams this tool inside the join at the top of the back 
               passenger window, then fishes around till she can snag the 
               inside door latch, pulling up. A satisfying CLICK.

               Clarice opens the door - it hits stacked boxes, and won't 
               open far - then very cautiously leans inside, aiming her 
               flashlight.

               HER POV - MOVING LIGHT BEAM

               revealing more of the evening gown... a pair of hands, in 
               white, elbow-length gloves - one rests on the lap, the other 
               atop a large, beaded, drawstring evening bag... thick strands 
               of costume pearls over the breasts... and finally the white 
               neck stub of a female mannequin. No face or head.

               CLARICE

               sighs with relief. She takes a couple more FLASHES, then 
               very carefully lifts out the Valentine album, holding it by 
               the corners, and setting it atop the car. Then she eases 
               herself inside, onto the back seat, as the springs SQUEAK 
               loudly.

               ONE GLOVED HAND slides off the lap, brushing Clarice's thigh. 

               Clarice starts a bit, then pokes at the gloved arm, hard. 
               She peels back a bit of glove, revealing the white, synthetic 
               elbow. She smiles, shaking her head at her own jumpiness, as 
               she reaches over the mannequin's lap to loosen the evening 
               bag's drawstring.

               A SEVERED HUMAN HEAD stares back at her, as the beaded 
               material slides away.

               Clarice lurches back, gasping loudly, and several long, heart-
               pounding moments pass before she can make herself look more 
               closely.

               The head bobs gently in a pool of alcohol, in a laboratory 
               specimen jar. It is a man's head, but grotesquely transformed, 
               by the addition of heavy makeup, earrings, and a sodden wig, 
               into a woman's face. Over the years the makeup has smeared 
               badly, and the pupils have gone almost milky white.

               CLARICE

               staring at this terrible thing, is pleased to find herself 
               quickly regaining control. She murmurs to herself.

                                     CLARICE
                         Well, Toto, we're not in Kansas 
                         anymore.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. QUINN'S HOSPITAL - PARKING LOT - NIGHT (RAINING)

               A loud clap of THUNDER, as a flash of LIGHTNING illuminates 
               the eerie towers and barred windows of the asylum.

               MOVING ANGLE on Clarice as she climbs from her car, runs 
               through heavy rain towards the main entrance, where a guard 
               admits her.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DR. LECTER'S CELL AND CORRIDOR - NIGHT (DIM LIGHT)

               On a noiseless TV screen, an evangelist rants, waving his 
               arms. Behind him, a swaying choir in gaudy robes.

                                     CLARICE (O.S.)
                         It's an anagram, isn't it, Doctor?

               PAN TO Clarice, with her wet hair plastered flat, sitting on 
               the corridor floor to one side of this TV, which has been 
               stationed so that Dr. Lecter cannot avoid seeing it.

                                     CLARICE
                         Hester Mofet... "The rest of me." 
                         Miss The-Rest-of-Me... Meaning, you 
                         rented that place.

               HER POV

               he's lost in shadows; we can't see him. He doesn't respond.

               CUTTING BETWEEN THEM

               Clarice and the darkened call - as she tries again.

                                     CLARICE
                         You put those - things in there. 
                         Paid for it in advance, ten years 
                         ago... Why, Dr. Lecter?

               The food carrier suddenly SWISHES out of the cell, making 
               her jump up. In its tray is a clean, folded white towel. She 
               hesitates, then crosses, takes this.

                                     CLARICE
                         Thank you.

               She sits again, rubbing her wet hair. When he finally speaks, 
               he's on the floor, too - a deeper, hunching darkness in the 
               shadows, occasionally striped by the flickering TV light.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Your bleeding has stopped.

                                     CLARICE
                         How did -
                              (she stops herself)
                         It's nothing. A scratch.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Why don't you ask me about Buffalo 
                         Bill?

                                     CLARICE
                              (surprised, a beat)
                         Why? Do you know something about 
                         him?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         I might if I saw the case file. You 
                         could get that for me.

                                     CLARICE
                         Why don't you tell me about "Miss 
                         Mofet?" You wanted me to find him. 
                         Or do I have to wait for the lab?

                                     DR. LECTER
                              (sighs)
                         His real name is Benjamin Raspail. A 
                         former patient of mine, whose romantic 
                         attachments ran to, shall we say, 
                         the exotic...? I didn't kill him, 
                         merely tucked him away. Very much as 
                         I found him, in that ridiculous car, 
                         in his own garage, after he's missed 
                         three appointments. You'd have him 
                         under "Missing Person" - which, in 
                         poor Raspail's case, could hardly be 
                         more true.

                                     CLARICE
                         If you didn't kill him, then who 
                         did?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Who can say...? Best thing for him, 
                         really. His therapy was going nowhere.

                                     CLARICE
                         Wouldn't it have been easier to just 
                         leave him for the police to find?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         And have them clomping about in my 
                         life? Oh dear, no... At that time I 
                         still had certain private amusements 
                         of my own.
                              (beat)
                         How did you feel when you saw him, 
                         Clarice? May I call you Clarice?

                                     CLARICE
                         Scared, at first. Then - exhilarated.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Ahhh... Why?

                                     CLARICE
                         Because you weren't wasting my time.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Do you have something you use, when 
                         you need to get up your courage? 
                         Memories, tableaux... scenes from 
                         your early life?

                                     CLARICE
                         I don't know. Next time I'll have to 
                         check.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Jack Crawford is helping your career, 
                         isn't he? Apparently he likes you. 
                         And you like him, too.

                                     CLARICE
                         I never thought about it.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Your first lie to me, Clarice. How 
                         sad. Tell me - do you think Crawford 
                         wants you, sexually? True, he's much 
                         older, but - do you think he 
                         visualizes... scenarios, exchanges...? 
                         Fucking you?

                                     CLARICE
                         That doesn't interest me, Doctor. 
                         And it's the sort of thing Miggs 
                         would ask.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Not anymore.
                              (beat)
                         Surely the odd confluence of events 
                         hasn't escaped you, Clarice. Crawford 
                         dangles you before me. Then I give 
                         you a bit of help. Do you think it's 
                         because I like to look at you, and 
                         imagine how good you would taste...?

                                     CLARICE
                         I don't know. Is it?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Or doesn't this all begin to suggest 
                         to you a kind of... negotiation? 
                         There's something Crawford can give 
                         me, and I want to trade for it. I 
                         even wrote to him, offering my help. 
                         But he hates me, so he won't deal 
                         directly.

               Dr. Lecter slowly turns up the rheostat in his cell. As his 
               lights rise, we see that the cell's been stripped bare. Gone 
               are his books, drawings, mattress - even his toilet seat. 
               She stands, too, startled. They face each other.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Punishment, you see. For Miggs. Just 
                         like that gospel program. When you 
                         leave, they'll turn the volume way 
                         up. Chilton does enjoy his petty 
                         torments.

                                     CLARICE
                         Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You 
                         know, don't you?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         I've been in this room for eight 
                         years, Clarice. I know they will 
                         never, ever let me out while I'm 
                         alive. What I want is a view. I want 
                         a window where I can see a tree, or 
                         even water. I want to be in a federal 
                         institution, away from Chilton - and 
                         I want a view. I'll give good value 
                         for it. Crawford could do that for 
                         me, but he won't. You persuade him.

                                     CLARICE
                              (almost a whisper)
                         Who killed your patient?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Oh, a very naughty boy. Someone you 
                         and Jack Crawford are most anxious 
                         to meet.

                                     CLARICE
                         Buffalo Bill...?
                              (incredulous)
                         Bill killed him, all those years 
                         ago...? That's impossible.

               But Dr. Lecter only smiles, enigmatically.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Who is he stalking right now, Clarice? 
                         I wonder, don't you? How many more 
                         young women will have to die, before 
                         you trade with me...?

               As Clarice stares at him, unsure how to respond -

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. CATHERINE MARTIN'S APARTMENT - MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE - 
               NIGHT

               CATHERINE MARTIN takes a long toke from a bong pipe. She is 
               21, a tall, big-boned, rather fleshy girl with long brown 
               fair. Her head is on the lap of her boyfriend, CODY; they're 
               sprawled on a couch in the den of her well-furnished 
               apartment. The TV in on, with low SOUND.

                                     CATHERINE
                         This stuff's givin' me the munchies. 
                         Where's that bag of popcorn?

                                     CODY
                         Shit. Left the groceries in the car.

               He starts to rise, but she pushes him back.

                                     CATHERINE
                         'S okay, I'll go.

               She rises, goes out the front door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. PARKING LOT - THE APARTMENT COMPLEX - NIGHT

               Catherine straightens, with her bag of groceries, shutting 
               her car's back door. She sees, a short distance away -

               A MAN

               standing at the open rear door of a brown panel truck. His 
               right forearm is in a cast and sling; he is struggling, 
               unsuccessfully, to hoist an armchair into the truck. Parked 
               nearby, other cars, RVs, a boat on a trailer. A thin, breast-
               high fog fills the lot; arc lights make yellow pools. 

               Catherine hesitates, then crosses towards the man.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Help you with that?

                                     MAN
                         Would you? Thanks.

               His voice is odd, strained, very soft. A fog lamp, set on 
               end on the ground, distorts his features from below. We can't 
               get a good glimpse of his face, but his body is plump, above 
               average height; he's in his mid 30's. She sets down the bag, 
               then together they easily lift the chair into the truck.

                                     MAN (O.S.)
                         Let's slide it up, you mind?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE PANEL TRUCK - NIGHT

               He climbs inside the truck, ducking under a small hand winch, 
               and grabs the chair. She hesitates again, but climbs in after 
               him; together they slide the chair forward, behind the seats.

                                     MAN
                         Are you about a size 14?

                                     CATHERINE
                              (surprised)
                         What?

               Suddenly, in the shadowy dark, he clubs her over the back of 
               her head with his cast. She moans, slumps unconscious, sliding 
               off the armchair to lie on her stomach. He pulls off his 
               cast and sling, tosses them aside, then hops out of the truck, 
               grabs his lamp, climbs back inside, and pulls the door shut. 
               He bends over her face with the lamp.

               We hear her shallow BREATHING.

                                     MAN
                         Good.

               He peels back the collar of her blouse, reading the size 
               tag.

                                     MAN
                         Good.

               He carefully slits her blouse up the back, with a pair of 
               bandage scissors, peeling apart the two halves. There's no 
               bra strap. He strokes her bare skin delicately, very happily.

                                     MAN
                         Gooood...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               LOW ANGLE - CLOSE - on Catherine's grocery bag, as her blouse 
               is tossed out beside it. SOUND of the truck's motor starting. 
               The truck backs up, one rear wheel knocking over the bag, 
               partly squashing it. Then is drives away, taillights 
               shrinking, as a lone orange rolls slowly away from the bag...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. FBI ACADEMY CLASSROOM - QUANTICO - DAY

               CLOSE ON a large video screen, where a BLURRY image gradually 
               sharpens, resolving into two separate pieces of fabric.

                                     INSTRUCTOR (O.S.)
                         Electron microscopy reveals fiber 
                         "signatures" that are nearly as 
                         distinct as fingerprints...

               Clarice sits at a long table, with other trainees. Ardelia 
               is beside her. Other tables and students in the background. 
               Each trainee has his own microscope. Clarice is tired, but 
               straightens, hearing -

                                     INSTRUCTOR (O.S.)
                         Both of these blouses were worn by 
                         victims of Buffalo Bill. They were 
                         found in two different states, and 
                         four months apart. He always slits 
                         them up the back, like a funeral 
                         suit...

               ON THE SCREEN

               successively CLOSER VIEWS of the cut fabric edges, until we 
               are seeing individual threads, big as tree limbs. The cuts 
               match.

                                     INSTRUCTOR (O.S.)
                         The bunching you see - this 
                         compression - is characteristic of 
                         scissor cuts, rather than a single 
                         blade. And, as you see - Bill always 
                         uses the same pair...

               ANGLE ON THE DOOR

               as John Brigham, the gunnery instructor, sticks his head in.

                                     BRIGHAM
                         Clarice Starling! Are you in here?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HALLWAY - CLASSROOM BUILDING - DAY

               Clarice and Brigham walk briskly down the hall, passing other 
               trainees. He carries a small canvas bag.

                                     BRIGHAM
                         Get your field gear, take stuff for 
                         overnight. You're goin' with Crawford.

                                     CLARICE
                         Where?

                                     BRIGHAM
                         Some fishermen in West Virginia found 
                         an unidentified girl's body. It's a 
                         Buffalo Bill-type situation. Been in 
                         the water about a week, and Jack 
                         needs somebody that can print a 
                         floater. Think you can handle it?

                                     CLARICE
                              (thinking quickly)
                         I'll need the big fingerprint kit... 
                         and the one-to-one Polaroid, the CU-
                         5, with film packs and batteries.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BRIGHAM'S JEEP CHEROKEE - DAY (DRIVING)

               Brigham steers as they pass hangars, parked planes, an 
               airstrip. Clarice holds a big fingerprint kit and a weekend 
               bag.

                                     BRIGHAM
                         Jack's pretty tough on you, isn't 
                         he? Impatient...

                                     CLARICE
                         Sometimes.

                                     BRIGHAM
                         He's got a lot on his mind besides 
                         Buffalo Bill... His wife, Bella, is 
                         real sick. Comatose... I'm tellin' 
                         you about it now, 'cause he may never.

               Clarice absorbs this in silence as they stop near an ancient, 
               rather dilapidated Beechcraft. Its door is open, the twin 
               props and beacons already turning. Brigham turns to her, 
               holding out his small canvas bag.

                                     BRIGHAM
                         You're goin' in the field, so you 
                         gotta have full kit. Take this - 
                         it's my own...

               Clarice opens the bag, stares at the big blue gun nestled in 
               its shoulder holster. She looks up at him, touched.

                                     BRIGHAM
                         Wear it, don't ever leave it in your 
                         purse. Dry fire it whenever you get 
                         the chance. And do your exercises.

                                     CLARICE
                         I will... I promise.

                                     BRIGHAM
                         Listen, I hope you never need a thing 
                         I've taught you. But you've got 
                         something... Jack sees it, I do too. 
                         If you ever need to, you can shoot.

               She nods, climbs out. Then she looks back in at him. They're 
               both moved by this rite of passage, but a little embarrassed.

                                     BRIGHAM
                         Bless you, Starling...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BEECHCRAFT PLANE - DAY (FLYING)

               CLARICE'S POV - Out the plane's window, at the landscape far 
               below. Wisps of cloud, a quilt of farms.

               Clarice turns from the window, looks at a think folder in 
               her lap. The cover reads "Case File: / BUFFALO BILL." Clarice 
               is moody, distracted. She hesitates, then opens the file, 
               begins to scan.

               INSERTS - HER POV

               Police forms, some handwritten... Typed lab reports; we catch 
               words, phrases: "Autopsy Protocols", "Histamine Analysis"... 
               Grainy enlargements of bullet slugs, showing matched 
               grooves... And then a stack of victim photos. The first one, 
               taken from a good distance away, shows a nude female body, 
               face down on a pebbly riverbank, surrounded by bits of litter.

               Clarice hesitates again, then flips this photo to look at 
               the next. It makes her flinch, just slightly. Quickly she 
               turns through several more photographs, trying hard to 
               concentrate.

                                     CRAWFORD (O.S.)
                         He keeps them alive for three days.

               NEW ANGLE

               shows Crawford standing over her, swaying with the plane's 
               motion. Behind him, the open cockpit door, the pilot's back. 
               Crawford sits, removing sunglasses. He rubs his eyes.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Why, we don't yet know... There's no 
                         evidence of rape or physical abuse 
                         prior to death. All the mutilation 
                         you see there is post-mortem.
                              (a beat; he glances 
                              at her)
                         I'm hot, are you hot? Bobby, it's 
                         too damned hot back here...

               The pilot adjusts a valve. Crawford turns to her again.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         So. Three days. Then he shoots them,
                         skins them - usually just the torsos - 
                         and dumps them. Each body in a 
                         different river, in a different state, 
                         downstream from an interstate highway. 
                         The water leaves us no fingerprints, 
                         fibers, DNA fluids - no trace evidence 
                         at all. That's Fredrica Bimmel, the 
                         first one...

               A COLOR PHOTO - IN CLARICE'S HANDS

               shows a pretty, plump-cheeked brunette, in her high school 
               graduation cap and gown. She smiles at us with touching 
               optimism.

                                     CRAWFORD (O.S.)
                         A big girl, like all the rest. Went 
                         about 160... Her corpse was the only 
                         one he took the trouble to weight 
                         down, so actually, she was the third 
                         girl found. After her, he got lazy...

               NEW ANGLE

               as Clarice stares at the girl's face, moved. Crawford pulls 
               a map from the file, spreads it out. It shows the central 
               and eastern U.S., with widely-spaced, hand-drawn markings.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Blue square for Belvedere, Ohio, 
                         where the Bimmel girl was abducted. 
                         Blue triangle where her body was 
                         found - down here in Missouri. Same 
                         marks for the other four girls, in 
                         different colors. This new one, 
                         today... washed up here.
                              (he marks with a Flair 
                              pen)
                         Elk River, in West Virginia, about 
                         six miles below U.S. 79. Real boonies.

                                     CLARICE
                         There's no correlation at all between 
                         where they're kidnapped and where 
                         they're found...?
                              (he shakes his head)
                         What if - what if you trace the 
                         heaviest-traffic routes backwards 
                         from the dump sites? Do they converge 
                         at all?

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Good idea, but he thought of it, 
                         too. We've run simulations, using 
                         different vectors and the best dates 
                         we can assign. You put it all in the 
                         computer, and smoke comes out. No, 
                         this one is different. This one has 
                         seen us coming...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. RENTAL CAR - DAY (DRIVING)

               Crawford steers, following a highway patrol car along a 
               winding mountain road. Clarice has the file open on her lap. 
               He glances at her, inscrutable behind his sunglasses.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Talk about him, Starling. Tell me 
                         what you see.

                                     CLARICE
                              (choosing her words 
                              carefully)
                         He's a white male... Serial killers 
                         tend to hunt within their own ethnic 
                         group. And he's not a drifter - he's 
                         got his own house, somewhere. Not an 
                         apartment.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Why?

                                     CLARICE
                         What he does with them - takes 
                         privacy... Time, tools... He's in 
                         his 30's or 40's - he's got real 
                         physical strength, but combined with 
                         an older man's self-control. He's 
                         cautious, precise, never impulsive... 
                         This won't end in suicide, like they 
                         often do.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Why not?

                                     CLARICE
                         He's got a real taste for it now. 
                         And he's getting better at his work.

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (a beat; impressed)
                         Maybe you've got a knack for this... 
                         I guess we're about to find out.

                                     CLARICE
                              (quietly, evenly)
                         Like I have a "knack" for Dr. Lecter?

               He studies her a few moments, measuring her anger.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Okay, Starling. Let's have it.

                                     CLARICE
                         You haven't said a word today about 
                         that garage. Or what I found there.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         What should I say? You did fine work. 
                         We'll wait on the lab.

                                     CLARICE
                         You knew. You knew from the start 
                         that Lecter held the key to this... 
                         But you weren't up front with me. 
                         You sent me in to him naked.

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (beat)
                         Are you finished?

                                     CLARICE
                         He starts this - buzzing in me, in 
                         my head. He makes me feel violated... 
                         You used me, Mr. Crawford.

               A shadow of regret passes over his face, but he answers 
               sternly.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Number One. Maybe there's a 
                         connection, maybe not. Lying and 
                         breathing are the same thing to 
                         Lecter. Number Two. If I'd sent you 
                         in there with something to hide from 
                         him, he'd have known it, instantly. 
                         He'd never have trusted you.

               She starts to answer, then is silent. He is right.

               By now the two cars are entering a tidy little town - tree-
               lined streets, wooden houses, one-story shops, mountains in 
               the background. They slow, turn.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Number Three, I didn't bring you 
                         along today just because you can do 
                         first-rate forensics. If Lecter is 
                         becoming part of this case, you've 
                         got the most current read on him. 
                         And Number Four - you don't have to 
                         like me, or the way I do things. But 
                         you do have to keep a cool head. 
                         Especially now... Because from here 
                         on out, you'll know everything I do. 
                         Are we straight on that?

               Clarice nods, silently; it's as close to an apology as she's 
               likely to get. She stares out the windshield.

               JUST AHEAD OF THEM

               the highway patrol cruiser noses into a curb, next to other 
               police cars, facing a big white frame house. Its sign reads 
               "Potter Funeral Home." Two troopers climb from the car.

               Crawford parks too, then kills the engine. He turns to her, 
               removing his sunglasses, gestures to the case file.

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (softly)
                         You think about him long enough, you 
                         get a feel for him... Then, if you're 
                         lucky, out of all the stuff you know, 
                         one little part of it tugs at you, 
                         tries to get your attention... You 
                         let me know when that happens, 
                         Starling. Live right behind your 
                         eyes, today. Don't try to impose any 
                         patterns on this guy. Just stay open 
                         and let him show you...

               One of the troopers, impassive in his sunglasses and hat, 
               peers in through Crawford's window. Crawford nods to him, 
               then turns back to Clarice.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         School's out, Starling.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SIDEWALK OF THE FUNERAL HOME - POTTER, WEST VA. - DAY

               SOUND of organ music, as Clarice, carrying her fingerprint 
               kit, mounts some steps to the sidewalk. She stops, seeing -

               COUNTRY PEOPLE

               in their somber best, filing into the mortuary for a service. 
               The music - "Shall We Gather At The River?" - is issuing 
               from the open double doors. Several of the mourners glance 
               over at her curiously.

               ANGLE ON CLARICE

               staring back at the mourners, hearing the music, as a sense 
               memory is triggered in her...

               IN FLASHBACK - LOW ANGLE, MOVING

               as we approach, down the aisle of a country chapel, an open 
               wooden coffin. Sad country faces turn, looking at us from 
               the flanking pews. The b.g. organ hymn is "Shall We 
               Gather...?"

               THE SAD, 10 YEAR-OLD CLARICE

               in her best dress, is reluctantly approaching the casket. 
               Her hands are held by the plump hands of unseen matrons.

               CHILD'S POV

               on the looming coffin... closer and closer... until finally 
               she can see, lying inside it... her dead father, arms folded, 
               his marshal's badge still pinned to his lapel.

                                     CRAWFORD (V.O.)
                         Starling...?

               NEW ANGLE (PRESENT DAY)

               as the grownup Clarice turns towards the impatient Crawford. 
               Like her, he carries a large case.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         We're around back.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FUNERAL HOME - BACK CORRIDOR - DAY

               A young deputy, several state troopers, and a SHERIFF are 
               all waiting, as Crawford and Clarice enter. The dim, cluttered 
               corridor doubles as storage space - there's a treadle sewing 
               machine, a soft-drink machine, a tricycle. The MUSIC is 
               closer. Crawford shakes hands with the sheriff.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Sheriff Perkins? Jack Crawford, FBI... 
                         This is Officer Starling. We 
                         appreciate your phoning us.

                                     SHERIFF
                              (grim, unsociable)
                         I didn't call you. That was somebody 
                         from the state attorney's office... 
                         'For you do a thing else, I'm gon' 
                         find out if this girl's local. It 
                         could just be somethin' that outside 
                         elements has dumped on us.

               He casts a sidelong, unhappy glance at Clarice.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Well sir, that's where we can help. 
                         If -

                                     SHERIFF
                         I don't even know you, Mister... Now 
                         we'll extend you ever courtesy, just
                         soon as we can, but for right now -

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Sheriff, this, ah - this type of sex 
                         crime has some aspects I'd rather 
                         discuss just between the two of us. 
                         Know what I mean?

               He indicates Clarice with his eyes. The sheriff hesitates, 
               nods, then lets Crawford guide him into a small office, 
               closing the door behind them. Muffled WORDS from there.

               CLARICE

               burning at this slight, is left alone with the troopers, who 
               peek at her with shy curiosity. She pulls her blazer a bit 
               tighter, self-conscious about her bulging shoulder holster.

               ANGLE ON THE OFFICE DOOR

               as, after a few more moments, the sheriff and Crawford emerge. 
               The sheriff, still not very happy, addresses his deputy.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Oscar, run fetch Dr. Akin from the 
                         chapel. And tell Lamar to come on 
                         when he's done playin' that music.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EMBALMING ROOM - DAY

               Crawford, in one corner of the room, has set up a Litton 
               Policefax fingerprint transmitter. SOUND of many men's low 
               voices, in background. He is on the phone, and has to speak 
               loudly.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         I need a six-way linkup! Chicago, 
                         Detroit, Cleveland, St. Louis, 
                         Atlanta, and Dallas... What?... Can 
                         you hear me...?

               He looks around, frustrated by the noisy circus atmosphere.

               CLARICE

               is pulling on a pair of surgical gloves. She raises her voice, 
               turning up her natural accent by several notches.

                                     CLARICE
                         Gentlemen. You officers and gentlemen! 
                         Listen here a minute, please. There's 
                         things I need to do for her...

               WIDER ANGLE

               as we see that the small room is very crowded with deputies 
               and troopers. They gradually fall silent, looking at her.

                                     CLARICE (O.S.)
                         Y'all brought her this far, and I 
                         know her folks would thank you if 
                         they could. Now please - go on out 
                         and let me take care of her... Go 
                         on, now.

               The men look at one another, a little bashfully, then begin 
               to to file out, whispering among themselves. As they go, a 
               bright green body bag is REVEALED, tightly zipped, lying on 
               a porcelain embalming table. It is almost the only modern 
               object in this Victorian room, with its glass-paned cabinets 
               and faded wallpaper, decorated with cabbage roses.

               FAVORING CRAWFORD

               as he looks at Clarice with a new degree of respect. Men 
               brush by him, till finally only two are left: DR. AKIN, a 
               family g.p., and LAMAR, a lean, whiskey-reddened mortician. 
               SOUND of the door closing. Lamar dabs around his nostrils 
               with Vicks VapoRub.

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (on phone)
                         We're starting. Tell everybody to 
                         stand by for fingerprint transmission.

               CLARICE

               at a side counter, has turned back to her open fingerprint 
               kit. She is lifting out a camera when she hears the ZIPPER 
               of the body bag being slowly opened, behind her...

               One gloved hand flies to her mouth as she reacts, 
               involuntarily, to the sudden smell. She blinks at her 
               reflection in the cabinet glass, then steels herself to turn, 
               look at the corpse.

                                     CLARICE
                              (pause; softly)
                         Bill...

               She steadies herself by raising her camera, takes a FLASH 
               photo.

               LOW ANGLE - LOOKING UP, FROM BENEATH TABLE

               as Dr. Akin gently lifts aside one of the dead girl's arms. 
               A piece of fishing line, with multiple hooks, is still snagged 
               around it, dangling. Crawford leans in for a closer look.

                                     DR. AKIN
                         Wrongful death... She'll have to go 
                         to the state pathologist at Claxton 
                         when you're done.
                              (Crawford nods)
                         I better - get on back for the rest 
                         of that service. Lamar'll help you.
                              (shaken)
                         Lord almighty...

               He leaves, and Clarice leans INTO SHOT, taking another photo.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         What do you see, Starling?

                                     CLARICE
                         Well, she's not local. Her ears are 
                         pierced three times each, and she's 
                         wearing green glitter nail polish. 
                         Looks like town to me...

               CLOSE ANGLE

               on the calf of one of the girl's legs, as Clarice trails the 
               inside of her bare wrist along the skin.

                                     CLARICE (O.S.)
                         She waxed her legs, I think... A big 
                         girl, just like the others - but she 
                         was careful about her appearance...

               UPWARD ANGLE AGAIN

               as Lamar joins them for a closer look.

                                     CLARICE
                         Two of the fingernails are broken 
                         off, and there's - dirt or grit under 
                         the others. She tried to claw her 
                         way through something... I'll scrape 
                         out samples after I've printed her.

               She takes another FLASH, then quickly reloads film.

                                     LAMAR
                         Them fishhooks are set too close 
                         together. No wonder the Franklin 
                         boys was scared to say they found 
                         her.

                                     CLARICE
                         Think they were runnin' a trotline?

               Crawford and Lamar both look at her curiously.

                                     CLARICE
                              (to Crawford)
                         It's a Fish and Game violation. Like 
                         poaching. There's a big fine.

                                     LAMAR
                         Right... Are you from around here?

                                     CLARICE
                         They do it lots of places.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Get photos of her teeth. Then we'll 
                         fax her fingerprints to Washington, 
                         try to trace her through Missing 
                         Persons.

               SIDE ANGLE - CLOSE ON THE DEAD GIRL'S FACE

               staring blue eyes, short reddish hair. Clarice sets the 
               Polaroid, with its special attachments, against the face, 
               while Lamar gently retracts the lips. Each time the camera 
               FLASHES, there's a bright glow inside the cheeks.

               NEW ANGLE - CHEST HIGH

               as Clarice examines a developing print.

                                     CLARICE
                         She's got something in her throat.

               She hands the print to Crawford; he and Lamar look at it, as 
               she searches in her kit.

                                     LAMAR
                         When a body comes out of the water, 
                         alots of times there's like, leaves 
                         and things in the mouth.

               Clarice holds up a pair of forceps. She glances at Crawford, 
               who nods. She bends over, partially OUT OF SHOT, and after a 
               few moments reappears, holding up a small, brown cylindrical 
               object. She turns this in the air, as they all stare.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         What is it - some kind of seed pod?

                                     LAMAR
                         Nawsir, that's a bug cocoon. But how 
                         come that to get way down in there? 
                         'Less somebody shoved it in...

               Clarice and Crawford exchange a glance.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         She'll be easier to print if we turn 
                         her over. Lamar, will you give me a 
                         hand?

                                     LAMAR
                         Yessir, I will. Clarice takes a jar 
                         from her kit, carefully drops the 
                         cocoon inside.

               SOUND of the men's heavy efforts as they turn over the body, 
               off screen. She seals the jar, staring into it at the cocoon.

                                     CRAWFORD (O.S.)
                         Starling - what do you make of these?

               She turns to look.

               HER POV

               low on the corpse's back, over the shoulders, two neat, 
               triangular patches of skin are missing.

               NEW ANGLE - TWO SHOT

               as Clarice looks at Crawford.

                                     CLARICE
                         I don't know. I didn't see those on 
                         any of the other girls...

                                     CRAWFORD
                         They weren't there. Get close-ups.

               Clarice raises her camera, leans in for another FLASH.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BACK STEPS OF THE FUNERAL HOME - DAY

               Clarice sits outside, with her head on her knees, drained. 
               She looks up wanly as Lamar appears, offers her a can of 
               Coke.

                                     CLARICE
                         Thanks, I'm not thirsty.

                                     LAMAR
                         No, hold it under your chin, there, 
                         and on your temples. Cold'll make 
                         you feel better. It does me.

               She smiles, touched, and takes the can. When Lamar sees 
               Crawford coming outside, he tactfully departs. Crawford sits 
               beside her; there's a brief silence. She soothes herself 
               with the can.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         When I told that sheriff we shouldn't 
                         talk in front of a woman, that really 
                         burned you, didn't it?
                              (she is silent)
                         That was just smoke, Starling, I had 
                         to get rid of him. You did well in 
                         there.

                                     CLARICE
                         It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other 
                         cops know who you are. They look at 
                         you to see how to act... It matters.

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (beat)
                         Point taken.

               She looks at him a moment, then offers the can. He opens it.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         When we get back, I want you to run 
                         that bug by the Smithsonian, see if 
                         they can identify it. Maybe it's got 
                         some limited range, or it only breeds 
                         at certain times of year... You found 
                         it, Starling, you deserve the credit.

                                     CLARICE
                         I'm wondering if he's done that before - 
                         placed a cocoon, or an insect. It 
                         would be easy to miss in an autopsy, 
                         especially with a floater... Can we 
                         check back on that?

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (shakes his head)
                         The other girls are in the ground. 
                         Exhumations are upsetting for the 
                         families. I'll do it if I have to,
                         but -

                                     CLARICE
                         Then have the lab check Raspail's 
                         head.
                              (he looks at her)
                         Dr. Lecter's patient - have them 
                         probe his soft-palette tissues... 
                         They'll find another cocoon.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         You seem pretty sure of that.

                                     CLARICE
                         Raspail was killed by the same man 
                         who's killing these girls. And Lecter 
                         knows him. Maybe even treated him... 
                         You think so, too, don't you? Or 
                         you'd never have sent me to that 
                         asylum.

               He looks at her for a moment, then sips again.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Before we caught him, Lecter had a 
                         big psychiatric practice in Baltimore. 
                         But he traveled all over the country - 
                         teaching, consulting... Christ, even 
                         testifying in murder trials. Who 
                         knows how many potential psychos he 
                         turned loose, just for the fun of 
                         it...?

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. MR. GUMB'S CELLAR - DAY (DIM LIGHT)

               A shadowy male figure looks down at us, leaning over the 
               edge of a deep hole. He holds a little white poodle in his 
               arms, stroking it. This is MR. GUMB, aka "Buffalo Bill."

                                     MR. GUMB
                              (softly)
                         Rub the cream on your skin. Rub it 
                         in gooood...

               CATHERINE MARTIN

               looks up at him. She is standing on the cement bottom of the 
               pit, or oubliette, about 15 feet below floor level. The pit 
               is bare, except for a futon and a plastic toilet bucket, 
               from which a thin string rises up to the basement. She's 
               soaking wet, in an orange jumpsuit, and holds a squeeze bottle 
               of skin lotion. She struggles to sound calm.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Mister... my family will pay cash. 
                         Whatever ransom you're askin' for,
                         they -

               REVERSE ANGLE - UP TOWARDS MR. GUMB

                                     MR. GUMB
                         Rub it in! Or you'll get the hose 
                         again.

               The little dog squirms in his arms, BARKING excitedly.

                                     MR. GUMB
                         Yes, it will, Precious, won't it? It 
                         will get the hose!

               SIDE ANGLE - AT PIT BOTTOM

               as Catherine kneels, turning slightly away from him.

                                     CATHERINE
                              (under her breath)
                         Oh God... oh God...

               She unzips her jumpsuit, part-way, then squeezes some of the 
               lotion onto a palm. She reaches inside her suit, rubs it on.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Mister, if you let me go, I won't 
                         press charges, I promise. You've 
                         only had me here a couple days, and -

                                     MR. GUMB (O.S.)
                         No. Just one day...

                                     CATHERINE
                         Is that all...? See - see, my mom is 
                         a real important woman... Well, I 
                         guess you already know that. She'll 
                         pay you, no questions asked. Whatever 
                         cause you represent - Iran, Palestine - 
                         she'll see that -

               A sudden blinding glare of light silences her. She looks up, 
               shielding her eyes.

               HER POV

               a floodlamp is descending, attached to a small basket.

                                     MR. GUMB
                         Put the bottle in the basket. No 
                         funny business, or you'll be sorry...

               NEW ANGLE - CATHERINE

               as the basket stops, and she steadies it. But as she slips 
               the bottle in, she sees something, O.S., just at the fringe 
               of the light. She hesitates, looks closer... then begins to 
               scream, hysterically, again and again. Her outflung hand 
               hits the lamp, and in its swaying glare, we see - high on 
               the concrete walls, all around her -

               BLOODY FINGER TRACKS

               dried now, brownish - left by many pairs of frenzied hands...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT.CLARICE'S DORM ROOM - FBI ACADEMY - DAWN

               Clarice is at her desk, exercising her right hand with the 
               grip flexer, while simultaneously studying a thick law book. 
               Ardelia sticks her head in the door, excited.

                                     ARDELIA
                         You better come see this.

               CLOSE ON a TV screen, filled with a photo of Catherine Martin.

                                     TV ANCHOR (V.O.)
                         ...was listed at first simply as a 
                         missing person, but is now believed 
                         to have been kidnapped by the serial 
                         killer known only as "Buffalo Bill."

               The photo disappears, replaced by the TV ANCHOR himself.

                         Memphis Police sources indicate that 
                         the missing girl's blouse has been 
                         identified, sliced up the back, in 
                         what has become a kind of grim calling 
                         card. Young Catherine Martin, as 
                         we've said, is the only daughter of 
                         U.S. Senator Ruth Martin -

               CLARICE

               looks at Ardelia, surprised. Other trainees are drifting 
               into the rec room, some whispering among themselves. Clarice 
               stares back at the TV intently.

                                     TV ANCHOR (O.S.)
                         ...the Republican junior senator 
                         from Tennessee. And while her 
                         kidnapping is not at this point 
                         considered to be politically 
                         motivated, nevertheless it has stirred 
                         the government -

                         and I quote, "intensely concerned." 
                         Just moments ago, Senator Martin 
                         made this dramatic personal plea...

               SENATOR MARTIN (TV FOOTAGE)

               fills the screen, in a halo of lens flare, as she speaks to 
               a jostling crowd of reporters on the front steps of her 
               Georgetown home. A tall woman, late 40's, with a strong, 
               taut face.

                                     SEN. MARTIN
                         I'm speaking now to the person who 
                         is holding my daughter. Her name is 
                         Catherine... You have the power to 
                         let Catherine go, unharmed. She's 
                         very gentle and kind - talk to her 
                         and you'll see. Her name is 
                         Catherine...

               Clarice is moved by what she sees. Other trainees are all 
               around her.

                                     CLARICE
                              (whispers)
                         Boy, is that smart...

                         Why does she keep repeating the name?

                                     CLARICE
                         Somebody's coaching her... They're 
                         trying to make him see Catherine as 
                         a person - not just an object.

               ON THE TV AGAIN

                                     SEN. MARTIN
                         You have a chance to show the whole 
                         world that you can be merciful, as
                         well as strong. Please - I beg you - 
                         release my Catherine...

               NEW FOOTAGE

               as we see (NIGHT, TELEPHOTO) - a taped-off section of 
               Catherine's parking lot. Technicians, with instruments, are 
               kneeling by the crushed grocery bag.

                         investigation continued throughout 
                         the night, as state and local 
                         authorities were joined at the kidnap 
                         scene by agents of the FBI...

               MOVING ANGLE (STILL TV FOOTAGE)

               as Jack Crawford is seen striding towards the front door of 
               Catherine's apartment, followed by Burroughs and other agents. 
               One of them moves quickly towards the CAMERA, waving it back.

               REC ROOM ANGLE - FAVORING ARDELIA

               as the other trainees send up a brief, ironic cheer. But 
               Ardelia turns sympathetically towards the troubled Clarice.

                                     ARDELIA
                         I don't know whether to say "I'm 
                         sorry," or "Congratulations." But 
                         girl? - you just went prime time.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         I don't think he knew that she's a 
                         Senator's child. She's a big girl, 
                         Starling, like all the rest. We're 
                         going on the theory she was randomly 
                         targeted by size...

               Clarice, now accompanied by a museum guard, walks through an 
               eerie landscape of dinosaur bones - crouching skeletons with 
               blank eye sockets, gaping fangs.

                                     CRAWFORD (V.O.)
                         By now, Bill's had her for 36 hours. 
                         That leaves us just 36 more, before 
                         he kills her... But maybe, just maybe, 
                         Starling, we caught a real break 
                         this time - thanks to you.
                              (beat)
                         We found another bug, in Raspail's 
                         head.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MUSEUM OFFICE - DAY

               CLOSE ON an live, enormous, rhinoceros beetle, as it weaves 
               its clumsy way among the men on a chessboard, before finally 
               stepping off the edge, onto a lettuce leaf.

                                     RODEN (V.O.)
                         Time, Pilch! My move.

                                     PILCHER (V.O.)
                         No fair! You lured him with produce.

               WIDER ANGLE

               shows two entomologists, both 30ish, hunched over the board. 
               RODEN is a pudgy redhead; PILCHER is lean, quite handsome.

                                     RODEN
                         Tough noogies! It's still my turn.

                                     CLARICE (O.S.)
                         If the beetle moves one of your men, 
                         does that count?

               They look up, delighted to see Clarice in the doorway. Both 
               men are hopelessly smitten by her.

                                     RODEN
                         Of course it counts. How do you play?

                                     PILCHER
                              (grins)
                         Officer Starling. Welcome back.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ENTOMOLOGY CORRIDOR - DAY

               MOVING ANGLE as Clarice and the two men go briskly down a 
               hall lined with mounted insects, in all shapes and sizes. 
               Roden peers at Clarice's new cocoon, in its box.

                                     RODEN
                         Where the hell did this one come 
                         from? It's practically mush.

                                     CLARICE
                         You really don't want to know.

                                     PILCHER
                         Your West Virginia specimen gave us 
                         quite a bit of trouble, but I finally 
                         managed to narrow his species through 
                         chaetaxy - studying the skin.

                                     RODEN
                         I'm the one who found his perforating 
                         proboscis! Are you wearing a gun, 
                         right now?
                              (Clarice nods)
                         Ooh, cool! Can I see it? Can I?

                                     PILCHER
                         Just ignore him. He's not a Ph.D.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LABORATORY - DAY

               VERY CLOSE (MAGNIFICATION) on the sliced cocoon, as Roden 
               uses tweezers and a dental probe to ease out the sodden 
               chrysalis.

                                     RODEN (O.S.)
                         The whole trick is to remove the 
                         chrysalis without destroying it... 
                         The wings are just like wet tissue 
                         paper...

               THE TWO MEN

               are hunched over a formica table, peering through square 
               magnifiers into stainless trays. Clarice watches curiously. 
               Of their two specimens, Pilcher's moth is in much better 
               condition - a big brown creature, its wings outspread on 
               towel paper.

                                     PILCHER
                              (without looking up)
                         What do you do when you're not 
                         detecting, Officer Starling?

                                     CLARICE
                         I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.

                                     PILCHER
                         Ever get out for cheeseburgers and 
                         beer? The amusing house wine...?

                                     CLARICE
                              (smiles)
                         Not lately. But maybe someday.

               He looks up at her, shyly. A little moment passes between 
               them, before Roden straightens, exultant.

                                     RODEN
                         Positive match!

                                     CLARICE
                         You're sure?

                                     RODEN
                              (points with his dental 
                              probe)
                         West Virginia... Baltimore. Officer 
                         Starling, meet Mister Acherontia 
                         Styx.

               He moves aside for Clarice to get a closer look at Pilcher's 
               specimen. She leans forward, intently.

               HER POV (MAGNIFICATION)

               the wide, furry, brown back of the moth. And there, right 
               between the wing bases - wonderful and terrible to see - is 
               nature's perfect reproduction of a ghostly human skull.

                                     RODEN (O.S.)
                         Better known to his friends as the 
                         Death's-head Moth...

                                     PILCHER (O.S.)
                         The Latin name comes from two rivers 
                         in Hell. Your man - he drops these 
                         girls into rivers, every time. Didn't 
                         I read that?

               FAVORING CLARICE

               as she looks up at him, awed, excited, almost trembling.

                                     CLARICE
                         And there's no way - no natural way - 
                         these could've wound up in the bodies?

                                     PILCHER
                              (shakes his head)
                         They live in Malaysia. In this 
                         country, they'd have to be specially 
                         raised, from imported eggs.

                                     CLARICE
                              (pause, then softly)
                         Dr. Lecter...

               As the two men stare at her, puzzled, we hear a SOUND UPCUT - 
               the wail of police SIRENS - and...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. U.S. ROUTE 95 - DAY (AERIAL SHOT)

               An awesome armada of police vehicles swings through an 
               intersection, while normal traffic is held back by highway 
               patrol cruisers.

               The lead cars turn off, hit the entrance ramp to the freeway - 
               SIRENS going, tires SQUEALING, red flashers...

               CLOSER ANGLE

               on a speeding surveillance van, with long antennas and a 
               small satellite dish, near the head of the motorcade.

                                     CRAWFORD (V.O.)
                         Maybe we can trace how he buys the 
                         bugs, starting with U.S. Customs...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE SURVEILLANCE VAN - DAY (DRIVING)

               The van is crammed with an impressive array of hi-tech 
               equipment, all CLICKING and HUMMING. Burroughs is talking 
               quietly on a scrambler phone, while another agent works a 
               computer.

                                     CRAWFORD (O.S.)
                         Maybe we can locate some of Raspail's 
                         old lovers. Maybe, someday...

               CLARICE AND CRAWFORD

               sit in swivel seats at the rear, by a big window. Clarice 
               can't resit an occasional peak at the trailing motorcade, 
               awed and a bit thrilled to be the center of so much attention.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         But for Catherine Martin, it all 
                         comes down to you and Lecter. You're 
                         the one he talks to.

                                     CLARICE
                         He's already offered to help... What 
                         would happen if we just showed our 
                         cards - asked him for Bill?

                                     CRAWFORD
                         He offered to help, Starling, not to 
                         snitch. That wouldn't give him enough 
                         chance to show off. Remember, Lecter 
                         looks mainly for fun. Never forget 
                         fun.

                                     CLARICE
                         But if he knew we have so little 
                         time -

                                     CRAWFORD
                         If we act too anxious, he'll make us 
                         wait. He'll let the Senator keep 
                         hoping, day after day, until Catherine 
                         finally washes up. That'd be the 
                         most fun of all.

                                     CLARICE
                         I think he means it, this time. I 
                         think he'll deal.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         What would it take?

                                     CLARICE
                         Transfer to a new prison. With a 
                         view of trees, he said, or even 
                         water... Can we swing that?

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (shakes his head)
                         State to federal jurisdiction... We 
                         can do it - eventually - but we'll 
                         never get all the clearances in time. 
                         Can you convince him a deal's already 
                         in place?

                                     CLARICE
                         You'll back me up with some paperwork?
                              (he nods)
                         Then I'll try. But wouldn't this 
                         have more weight coming from the 
                         Senator herself?

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (hesitates)
                         She doesn't know what we're up to. 
                         And we can't afford to let her find 
                         out.

               Clarice looks at him, surprised.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         She's the mother, Starling. She can't 
                         possibly comprehend what Lecter is. 
                         She'd make the mistake of pleading 
                         with him. Begging him... He'd feast 
                         on her pain till the last second of 
                         that girl's life...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BALTIMORE STATE HOSP. FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE - DAY

               Chilton approaches, walking briskly down a corridor in the 
               administration wing. He looks quite agitated.

                                     CRAWFORD (V.O.)
                         We can't trust Frederick Chilton, 
                         either. He's greedy and ambitious. 
                         If he knew about Lecter's link to 
                         Bill, he's go straight to the 
                         newspapers...

               Chilton falls into step beside Clarice, who has her briefcase. 
               He points his gold pen at her accusingly.

                                     CHILTON
                         What you're doing, Miss Starling, is 
                         coming into my hospital to conduct 
                         an interview, and refusing to share 
                         information with me. For the third 
                         time!

                                     CLARICE
                         Dr. Chilton, I told you - this is 
                         just routine follow-up on the Raspail 
                         case.

                                     CHILTON
                         He's my patient! I have rights!
                              (grabs her arm, 
                              stopping her)
                         I'm not just some turnkey, Miss 
                         Starling. I shouldn't even be here 
                         this afternoon. I had a ticket to 
                         Holiday on Ice.

               She stares at him, with pity and distaste, till he lets go.

                                     CLARICE
                         I'm acting on instruction, Dr. 
                         Chilton.
                              (handing him a card)
                         This is the U.S. Attorney's number. 
                         Now please - either discuss this 
                         with him, or let me do my job.

               She walks away, leaving him speechless with frustration and 
               hostility. He clicks his pen, watching her go.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DR. LECTER'S CELL AND CORRIDOR - DAY

               Dr. Lecter sits at his table, languidly sketching with 
               charcoal on butcher paper.

               He uses his own hand and forearm as a model. His other 
               drawings, books, and bedding have been restored.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Wouldn't you say, Clarice, that for 
                         a United States Senator, you're an 
                         odd choice of messenger?

               Clarice, sitting again at the desk-chair, is taking papers 
               from her briefcase.

                                     CLARICE
                         I was your choice, Dr. Lecter. You 
                         chose to speak to me. Would you prefer 
                         someone else now? Or perhaps you 
                         don't think you can help us.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         That is both impudent and untrue... 
                         Tell me, how did you feel when you 
                         viewed our Billy's latest effort?
                              (beat; he smiles)
                         Or should I say, his "next-to-latest"?

                                     CLARICE
                         By the book, he's a sadist.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Life's too slippery for books, 
                         Clarice. Typhoid and swans came from 
                         the same God.
                              (beat)
                         Tell me, Miss West Virginia - was 
                         she a large girl?

                                     CLARICE
                         Yes.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Big through the hips. Roomy.

                                     CLARICE
                         They all were.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Mmm. And what else...?

                                     CLARICE
                         She had an insect deliberately 
                         inserted in her throat. That hasn't 
                         been made public yet. We don't know 
                         what is means.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Was it a butterfly?

                                     CLARICE
                              (pause; staring at 
                              him)
                         A moth... How did you predict that?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         I'm waiting for your offer, Clarice. 
                         Enchant me.

               Clarice looks down at her papers, taking a moment to collect 
               her thoughts. She looks up at him again, evenly.

                                     CLARICE
                         If you help us find Buffalo Bill in 
                         time to save Catherine Martin, the 
                         Senator promises you a transfer to 
                         the V.A. hospital at Oneida Park, 
                         New York, with a view of the woods 
                         nearby. Maximum security still 
                         applies, but you'd have reasonable 
                         access to books.

               He is silent. She rises, moves closer, carrying papers.

                                     CLARICE
                         Best of all, though - one week a 
                         year you'd get to leave the hospital 
                         and go here.
                              (points to a map)
                         Plum Island. Every afternoon of that 
                         week you can walk on the beach or 
                         swim in the ocean for up to one hour. 
                         Under SWAT team surveillance, of 
                         course...

               His face remains neutral. She puts the papers in his food 
               tray.

                                     CLARICE
                         Copy of the Buffalo Bill case file, 
                         copy of Senator Martin's terms. Her 
                         offer is final and non-negotiable. 
                         If Catherine dies -
                              (she slides his tray 
                              through)
                         You get nothing.

               A measured beat, before he rises smoothly, crosses, and looks 
               down at the papers, without touching them.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         "Plum Island Animal Disease Research 
                         Center." Sounds charming.

                                     CLARICE
                         That's just part of the island. It 
                         has a very nice beach. Terns nest 
                         there.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Terns... If I help you, Clarice, it 
                         will be "turns" with us, too. Quid 
                         pro quo. I tell you things, you tell 
                         me things. Not about this case, though - 
                         about yourself. Yes or no?
                              (she is silent)
                         Yes or no, Clarice. Catherine is 
                         waiting. Tick-tock, tick-tock...

               She looks at him. A beat. They are standing uncomfortably 
               close.

                                     CLARICE
                         Go, Doctor.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         What's your worst memory of childhood?
                              (she hesitates)
                         Quicker than that. I'm not interested 
                         in your worst invention.

                                     CLARICE
                         The death of my father.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Tell me. Don't lie, or I'll know.

               Clarice cannot bear the feverish excitement in his eyes. She 
               looks past him, hesitating again.

                                     CLARICE
                         He was a town marshal... one night 
                         he surprised two burglars, coming 
                         out the back of a drugstore... They 
                         shot him.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Killed outright?

                                     CLARICE
                         No. He was strong, he lasted almost 
                         a month. My mother - died when I was
                         very young, so my father had become - 
                         the whole world to me... After he 
                         left me, I had nobody. I was ten 
                         years old.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         You're very frank, Clarice. I think - 
                         it would be quite something to know 
                         you in private life.

                                     CLARICE
                         Quid pro quo, Doctor.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         The significance of the moth is 
                         change. Caterpillar into cocoon into 
                         beauty... Billy wants to change, 
                         too, Clarice. But there's the problem 
                         of his size, you see. Even if he 
                         were a woman, he'd have to be a big 
                         one...

                                     CLARICE
                              (puzzled)
                         Dr. Lecter, there's no correlation 
                         in the literature between 
                         transsexualism and violence. 
                         Transsexuals are very passive.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Clever girl. You're so close to the 
                         way you're going to catch him - do 
                         you realize that?

                                     CLARICE
                         No. Tell me why.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         After your father's death, you were 
                         orphaned. What happened next?
                              (Clarice drops her 
                              gaze)
                         I don't imagine the answer's on those 
                         second-rate shoes, Clarice.

                                     CLARICE
                         I went to live with my mother's cousin 
                         and her husband in Montana. They had 
                         a ranch.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         A cattle ranch?

                                     CLARICE
                         Horses - and sheep...

                                     DR. LECTER
                         How long did you live there?

                                     CLARICE
                         Two months.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Why so briefly?

                                     CLARICE
                         I - ran away...

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Why, Clarice? Did the rancher fuck 
                         you?

                                     CLARICE
                              (angrily)
                         No.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Did he try to?

                                     CLARICE
                         No...! Quid pro quo, Doctor.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Billy's not a real transsexual, but 
                         he thinks he is. He tries to be. 
                         He's tried to be a lot of things, I 
                         expect.

                                     CLARICE
                         You said - I was very close to the 
                         way we'd catch him.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         There are three major centers for 
                         transsexual surgery: Johns Hopkins, 
                         the University of Minnesota, and 
                         Columbus Medical center. I wouldn't 
                         be surprised if Billy has applied 
                         for sex reassignment at one or all 
                         of them, and been rejected.

                                     CLARICE
                         On what basis would they reject him?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         The personality inventories would 
                         trip him up. Rorschach, Wechsler, 
                         House-Tree-Person... He wouldn't 
                         test like a real transsexual.

                                     CLARICE
                         How would he test?

               Suddenly Dr. Lecter snarls, loudly, stretching. Clarice take 
               a sharp step backwards before he smiles, turning his movement 
               into an elaborate yawn. He gathers the papers from his tray.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         That's enough, I think. Happy hunting. 
                         Oh, and Clarice - next time you will 
                         tell me why you ran away. Shall I 
                         summarize?

                                     CLARICE
                              (shaken)
                         Yes, Doctor. Please.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MR. GUMB'S CELLAR - DAY

               VERY CLOSE ON a cocoon, split along its back, as a living 
               Death's-head Moth wriggles torturously free. Trembling and 
               damp, the new creature clings to a sprig of nightshade.

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         You should try to obtain a list of 
                         males rejected from all three gender 
                         reassignment centers...

               PULLING BACK

               we see a big wire cage, holding several of the moths. They 
               crawl over the humus floor or feed at honeycombs, wings 
               pumping lazily. In the distant background, the incongruous 
               SOUND of show music.

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         Check first the ones rejected for 
                         lying about criminal records...

               CONTINUOUS MOVING ANGLE

               at about knee level, as we leave the cage, and begin to TRAVEL 
               through this eerie, dimly-lit warren of a cellar.

               As we go - occasionally TURNING corners, or skirting the 
               dark openings of unexplored passages - various objects loom 
               briefly INTO VIEW, overhead - a stainless-steel work table... 
               a big sink... jars of chemicals... neat racks of gleaming 
               knives...

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         Among those who tried to conceal 
                         their past, look for severe childhood 
                         disturbances, associated with 
                         violence... Possibly you'll find a 
                         childhood incarceration... Then go 
                         to their personality tests...

               We pass a row of female mannequins, some nude, some wearing 
               colorful leather jackets, designer knockoffs, in various 
               stages of completion... then a huge maroon armoire, in Chinese 
               lacquer; its double doors are slightly ajar... The jaunty 
               background.

               MUSIC is growing even louder: Fats Waller singing "Bye Bye 
               Baby." And now we hear something else, too - the rapid 
               CLICKING of a sewing machine...

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         Study their drawings, especially. 
                         Billy's house drawings will show no 
                         happy future... No baby carriage, 
                         out in the yard. No pets, no toys, 
                         no flowers, no sun...

               We TURN another corner, and there is Mr. Gumb himself. As we 
               APPROACH, his wide back is to us; he's hunched over an old-
               fashioned sewing machine, humming cheerfully, and working a 
               piece of material that we mercifully cannot see. A female 
               wig rests near him on a head form. He wears a hairnet and a 
               beautiful kimono, and pumps the treadle with his bare feet.

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         His females will be more crudely 
                         sketched than him males - but he'll 
                         compensate by adding exaggerated 
                         adornments... jewelry, big breasts... 
                         And his tree drawings - oh, his trees 
                         will be frightful...

               Next to Mr. Gumb is an antique phonograph - source of the 
               MUSIC. His little dog, Precious, perches by his plump ankles. 
               As we PASS Mr. Gumb, Precious scurries away from him, panting 
               happily, and we FOLLOW the little dog down another corridor, 
               the music starting to fade behind us...

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         Billy hates his own identity, he 
                         always has - and he thinks that makes 
                         him a transsexual. But his pathology 
                         is a thousand times more savage... 
                         He wants to be reborn, Clarice. He 
                         will be reborn...

               At the end of this final corridor, the cellar widens into a 
               low-ceilinged chamber, with two additional doorways, and in 
               the center of this is the gaping circle of the oubliette. 
               Precious sniffs her way over to the edge - excited, tail 
               wagging - than BARKS happily as we hear a hoarse, ghostly 
               moan from below.

                                     CATHERINE (O.S.)
                         Pleeeeeeeease.....!

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. DR. LECTER'S CORRIDOR - DAY

               MOVING ANGLE - CLOSE ON Dr. Lecter's slippered feet, which 
               rest on the shelf of a rolling hand truck. RISING along his 
               tilted form, we see that his ankles are linked by steel 
               restraints... his legs, waist, upper torso, and arms are 
               bound by heavy canvas webbing... beneath the webbing is a 
               strait-jacket... and over his face is a hockey mask.

                                     CHILTON (V.O.)
                         Bad news, Hannibal...

               WIDER ANGLE

               shows that Dr. Lecter, on the handtruck, is being pushed 
               down his corridor by Barney, and back into his open cell.

                                     CHILTON (V.O.)
                         Gourmet magazine has rejected your 
                         recipe for braised kidneys...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DR. LECTER'S CELL - DAY

               Chilton lounges on Dr. Lecter's cot, casually reading his 
               large stack of private correspondence, and making notations 
               with his gold pen on a little pad. Another orderly mops the 
               floor.

                                     CHILTON
                         Perhaps you should have been less 
                         specific about what kind.
                              (to Barney)
                         Stand him by the toilet. Then leave 
                         us.

               Barney props the hand truck into position, then both orderlies 
               go. Chilton finishes another letter, sighs happily.

                                     CHILTON
                         Such a lot of correspondence! I can 
                         hardly wait to analyze it in more 
                         detail... But first things first.

               Tossing letters onto the cot, he rises, crosses out into the 
               corridor, and bends to remove a small tape recorder from 
               underneath Clarice's desk. He waggles it triumphantly at Dr. 
               Lecter.

                                     CHILTON
                         I thought she might be looking for a 
                         civil rights violation in Migg's 
                         death, so I bugged you... Not a word 
                         to me in all these years, Hannibal. 
                         Then Crawford sends his bit of fluff 
                         over here, and you just turn to jelly. 
                         It's too pathetic.

               SIDE ANGLE - TWO SHOT

               as Chilton, back in the cell, leans tauntingly close to the 
               front of Dr. Lecter's mask.

                                     CHILTON
                         You still think you're going to walk 
                         on some beach, and see the birdies? 
                         I don't think so, Hannibal... I called 
                         Senator Ruth Martin, and she never 
                         heard of any deal with you. She never 
                         heard of Clarice Starling, either. 
                         They scammed you, Hannibal...

               CLOSE ON Dr. Lecter's glittering eyes, behind their slits.

                                     CHILTON
                         When Crawford gets through milking 
                         you, he's giving you to Baltimore 
                         Homicide for the Raspail murder. And 
                         they're preparing some special 
                         surprises for you right now, in my 
                         electroshock room.

               DR. LECTER'S POV (FRAMED BY EYE-SLITS)

               first looking at Chilton's moving lips... then LOWERING to 
               his soft, white, inviting throat...

                                     CHILTON
                         The Starling bitch wants you to rot 
                         here, in this little box, till your 
                         teeth fall out and you're soiling 
                         diapers. You've seen the old ones, 
                         Hannibal. They weep when their stewed 
                         peaches get cold. That'll be you, 
                         too. Unless - you trade with me.

               FAVORING CHILTON

               as he sits chummily on the table.

                                     CHILTON
                         There never was a deal with Senator 
                         Martin - but there is now. I've been 
                         on the phone for hours, Hannibal, on 
                         your behalf. Here's what you get: if 
                         you identify Buffalo Bill, and the 
                         girl is found in time, Senator Martin 
                         will have you transferred to Brushy 
                         Mountain State Prison, in Tennessee...

               CLOSE AGAIN ON DR. LECTER'S EYES

               as they shift restlessly, away from Chilton - then suddenly 
               lock onto something. They widen with interest.

                                     CHILTON (O.S.)
                         The Governor has already agreed. You 
                         get books, a view of the woods, and 
                         plenty of exercise time...

               DR. LECTER'S POV - EXTREME CLOSEUP

               On the cot, carelessly left there, lying half-hidden under 
               the letters and the rumpled sheet... is Chilton's gold pen.

                                     CHILTON (O.S.)
                         And best of all, you'd be out of 
                         Jack Crawford's reach, forever. The 
                         Senator will verify these terms on 
                         the phone, and guarantee them in 
                         writing...

               BACK ON DR. LECTER

               as he stares a moment longer at the pen, then shifts his 
               eyes towards Chilton. We can almost hear his brain clicking.

                                     CHILTON (O.S.)
                         In exchange, I get your full 
                         cooperation in publishing a 
                         professional account of this - my 
                         successful interviews with you. You 
                         publish nothing. And I get exclusive 
                         access to any material from Catherine 
                         Martin... So. Do you accept my 
                         demands?
                              (pause)
                         Answer me, Hannibal.

               A beat. Dr. Lecter is silent. Chilton sticks his face INTO 
               SHOT, almost intimately close to the mask. He is agitated.

                                     CHILTON
                         You'll answer me now, or by God, 
                         you'll answer to Baltimore Homicide. 
                         Who is Buffalo Bill?

                                     DR. LECTER
                              (pause; then softly)
                         I'll tell the Senator herself. But 
                         only in Tennessee...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. JOHNS HOPKINS - GENDER IDENTITY CLINIC - DAY

               MOVING ANGLE - as the very impatient Crawford, clutching a 
               folder, strides down a hall beside DR. DANIELSON - early 
               50's, severe, in a lab coat. Nurses, doctors, glance as they 
               pass.

                                     DR. DANIELSON
                         I'm not having a witch hunt here, 
                         Mr. Crawford! Our patients are decent, 
                         non-violent people with a real 
                         problem.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Dr. Danielson, the man we want was 
                         never your patient. It would be 
                         someone you refused because he tries 
                         to conceal a record of criminal 
                         violence. Please, Doctor - time is 
                         eating us up. Just show me the ones 
                         you've turned away.

               Danielson enters a cramped, stainless steel nurse's gallery, 
               with Crawford following, and pours himself a cup of coffee.

                                     DR. DANIELSON
                              (adamantly)
                         Examination and interview materials 
                         are confidential. We've never violated 
                         an applicant's trust, and we never 
                         will.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         You want to see a violation? This is 
                         a violation...

               He takes a black & white photo from his folder, slaps it 
               down in front of Danielson. From our angle, we can't see it 
               clearly.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Her name is Kimberly Jane Emberg, 
                         she was just ID'd. I met her on a 
                         slab in West Virginia. And sometime 
                         tomorrow, or tomorrow night, he's 
                         going to do the same thing to 
                         Catherine Martin.

                                     DR. DANIELSON
                         That's a childish, bullying stunt, 
                         Mr. Crawford. I was a battlefield 
                         surgeon, so you can put away your 
                         picture.

               Burroughs sticks his head in, looking for Crawford.

                                     BURROUGHS
                         Phone, Jack. Director Burke.

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (snaps)
                         In a minute!

               Burroughs hurriedly retreats. Crawford strains for patience.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Look... search your own records, if 
                         you prefer. You can do it a lot faster 
                         than us, anyway. If we find Buffalo 
                         Bill through your information, I'll 
                         suppress it. Nobody has to know this 
                         hospital cooperated.

                                     DR. DANIELSON
                         I doubt very much that the FBI or 
                         any other government agency can keep 
                         a secret, Mr. Crawford. Truth will 
                         out... And then what? Will you give 
                         Johns Hopkins a new identity? Put a 
                         big pair of sunglasses on this 
                         building, and a funny nose?

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Oh, that's clever, Dr. Danielson. 
                         Very humorous. You like the truth? 
                         Try this.
                              (right in his face, 
                              enraged)
                         He kidnaps young women and kills 
                         them and rips their skin off. We 
                         don't want him to do that anymore. 
                         If you don't help me, just as fast 
                         as you can, then the Justice 
                         Department is going to ask publicly 
                         for a court order, We'll ask twice a 
                         day, just in time for the morning 
                         and evening news. And each one of 
                         our press conferences will focus on 
                         Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins, 
                         and how we're still hoping for his 
                         cooperation. And every time there's 
                         any news on the case - when Catherine 
                         Martin floats, when the next one 
                         floats, and the next one - why, we'll 
                         just issue another press release 
                         about good ol' Dr. Danielson, over 
                         at Johns Hopkins - complete with all 
                         his humorous fucking remarks.

                                     DR. DANIELSON
                              (pause; stiffly)
                         It may be that - I could confer with 
                         my colleagues on this. And get back 
                         to you.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Would you, Doctor? That would be so 
                         kind.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE SURVEILLANCE VAN - DAY

               Crawford is on the scrambler phone. Burroughs watches 
               silently.

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (on phone; stunned)
                         Transferred...?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FBI BUILDING - OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR - DAY

               HAYDEN BURKE, the FBI Director, swivels in his big chair. 
               Lean, late 40's, very distinguished. His desk is flanked by 
               flags.

                                     DIRECTOR BURKE
                              (on phone)
                         Already airborne for Memphis. Senator 
                         Martin's meeting him at the airport.
                              (uneasily)
                         Jack - did you make some sort of 
                         promise to Lecter, in the Senator's 
                         name?

               Listening to the answer, he looks uncomfortably across his 
               desk at PAUL KRENDLER, the Deputy Attorney General - 40, 
               very tanned, modish haircut. Krendler is irritable, impatient.

                                     DIRECTOR BURKE
                              (on phone)
                         We're going to have to talk about 
                         this, Jack. The Senator's mad as 
                         hell. Paul Krendler's over here from 
                         Justice, she's asking him to take 
                         charge in Memphis... I know that... 
                         But you're still in command of the 
                         task force, and Lecter's plane can 
                         still be ordered back. It's your 
                         call, Jack - but I want it now.

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

               INT. THE SURVEILLANCE VAN - DAY

               Burroughs starts to make an objection, but Crawford stills 
               him with a hand motion. He is taut, frustrated. Long pause.

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (into phone)
                         Let him land.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT.CLARICE'S DORM ROOM - DOORWAY - DAY

               Clarice opens her door, stares out at Crawford. She's just 
               slipping on her blazer, over her shoulder holster. She's 
               furious.

                                     CLARICE
                         Chilton has killed her, hasn't he? 
                         That slimy little bastard! We were 
                         so close with Lecter - and now her 
                         last chance is gone.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Let's get some coffee and talk.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. FBI ACADEMY GROUNDS - QUANTICO - DAY

               MOVING ANGLE on Clarice and Crawford, as they walk along a 
               sidewalk, sipping from paper cups. The surveillance van trails 
               them slowly, radios CRACKLING.

                                     CLARICE
                         Are you in trouble over this, Mr. 
                         Crawford? Can Senator Martin do 
                         something to you?

                                     CRAWFORD
                         I'm 53, Starling. If I found Jimmy 
                         Hoffa on national TV, I'd still have 
                         to retire in two years. It's not a 
                         consideration. But you are...
                              (beat)
                         You've done enough. If I keep you 
                         out of school any longer, you'll be 
                         recycled. Cost you six months, at 
                         least. I can guarantee you readmission 
                         here, but that's about it.
                              (he stops, looks at 
                              her)
                         Now's your chance, Starling. Go back 
                         to class. Leave Bill to me.

                                     CLARICE
                         If you didn't want me chasing him, 
                         you shouldn't have taken me to that 
                         funeral home.

               He looks at her steadily, then nods. They walk on.

                                     CLARICE
                         Lecter is still the key, I know he 
                         is. Whatever he told me about Bill 
                         is just as good now as it was before.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Or just as worthless. But I want you 
                         in Memphis, close to him. Maybe when 
                         he gets tired of toying with Senator 
                         Martin, he'll talk to you again. 
                         There's a plane waiting for you now 
                         at the airstrip.

               She smiles at this acknowledgment; he never thought she's 
               quit.

                                     CLARICE
                         I lied to Lecter. I'll need some 
                         kind of peace offering... Can I get 
                         the drawings from his cell?

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Good idea. Meantime, try to get a 
                         feel for Catherine Martin. Her 
                         apartment, her friends... how he 
                         might've stalked her. I'm going to 
                         the other two clinics, Minnesota and 
                         Ohio.
                              (he crumples his cup, 
                              tosses it)
                         Now's the hardest part, Starling. 
                         Use your anger, don't let it keep 
                         you from thinking. Just keep your 
                         eyes on Catherine. We've got less 
                         than 30 hours.

                                     CLARICE
                              (hesitates)
                         Mr. Crawford... can those cops down 
                         there handle Dr. Lecter?

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (grimly)
                         They'll use their best men. But they 
                         better be paying attention...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               OFFICERS PEMBRY AND BOYLE

               two sturdy, well-armed, veteran prison guards - are checking 
               Dr. Lecter's restraints with clever, careful fingers.

                                     BOYLE
                         Welcome to Memphis, Dr. Lecter. I'm 
                         Officer Boyle, this is Officer Pembry. 
                         We aim to treat you just as nice as 
                         you treat us. Act like a gentlemen, 
                         you'll get three hots and a cot.

                                     PEMBRY
                         But we ain't pussy-footin' with you, 
                         buddy ruff. You get cute, try to 
                         bite somebody? - we'll tie your 
                         asshole in a knot. You savvy?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Oh yes, Officer Pembry. I certainly 
                         do.

               The officers turn away, Boyle signing a clipboarded form.

                                     PEMBRY
                              (under his breath)
                         Shit, he's just an ol' broke-dick. 
                         Won't be no trouble as all if he 
                         don't flip out.

                                     BOYLE
                         Dr. Chilton...?

               NEW ANGLE - WIDER

               as we see that we're in a vast, dusty hangar. Parked to one 
               side: an EMS ambulance and four highway patrol cruisers; a 
               dozen troopers stand quietly chatting and smoking over there. 
               Prentiss is pacing impatiently, casting anxious glances 
               towards the open hanger doorway.

                                     BOYLE
                         If you'll please sign right here, 
                         sir, we'll have us a legal transfer.

               Chilton instinctively pats his shirt pocket for his gold 
               pen; it's gone. He searches other pockets, with growing 
               unhappiness.

                                     BOYLE
                         Use mine.

                                     PEMBRY
                         Here they come.

               TWO BLACK STRETCH LIMOUSINES

               glide smoothly into the hangar, stop. Secret Service agents 
               pour out of the lead car, form a cordon. A driver opens the 
               rear door of the second car, and Krendler steps out, followed 
               by the Senator's assistant, with a briefcase, followed, as 
               last, by the Senator herself. Barely glancing around, she 
               strides towards Lecter.

               NEW ANGLE - DR. LECTER AND SEN. MARTIN

               as she stops, struck by the bizarre spectacle of his 
               restraints. The others instinctively keep a distance, but 
               Chilton, with theatrical relish, unstraps and removes Dr. 
               Lecter's mask.

                                     CHILTON
                         Senator Martin, meet Dr. Hannibal 
                         Lecter.

               They stare at one another for a long moment: the Senator 
               tense, almost haggard, the madman with his unearthly poise.

                                     SEN. MARTIN
                         Dr. Lecter, I've brought an affidavit 
                         guaranteeing your new rights... You'll 
                         want to read it before I sign.

               He assistant unsnaps his briefcase, reaches for the form.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         I won't waste your time and 
                         Catherine's time bargaining for petty 
                         privileges. Clarice Starling and 
                         that awful Jack Crawford have wasted 
                         far too much already. I only pray 
                         they haven't doomed the poor girl... 
                         Let me help you now, and I'll trust 
                         you when it's all over.

                                     SEN. MARTIN
                         You have my word. Paul?

               Krendler raises a pad, poised to take notes.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Buffalo Bill's real name is William 
                         Rubin. I met him just once. He was 
                         referred to me in April or May, 1980, 
                         by my patient Benjamin Raspail. They 
                         were lovers, but Raspail had become 
                         very frightened. Apparently Rubin 
                         had murdered a transient, and - done 
                         things with the skin. He thought if 
                         I could cure Billy, then Billy'd be 
                         safe from the police, and he's be 
                         safe from Billy... Obviously, he was 
                         wrong.

                                     KRENDLER
                         We need his address, a physical descr-

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Did you nurse Catherine?

                                     SEN. MARTIN
                              (pause; startled)
                         What...?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Did you breast-feed her?

               He flicks his tongue obscenely.

                                     KRENDLER
                         You son-of-a -

               The Senator stills him with a hand. She is trembling.

                                     SEN. MARTIN
                         Yes... I did.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Toughened your nipples, didn't it...?
                              (a beat; then rapidly, 
                              bored)
                         Six foot one, strongly built, about 
                         190 pounds. Hair brown, eyes pale 
                         blue. He'd be about 35 now. He said 
                         he lived in Philadelphia, but may 
                         have lied. That's really all I can 
                         remember, Senator - but if I think 
                         of any more, I'll let you know.

                                     SEN. MARTIN
                              (to the others)
                         Let's go with it.

               They start towards the car, but he calls out, stopping her.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Senator Martin...! You can't trust 
                         Jack Crawford or Clarice Starling. 
                         It's such a game with these people. 
                         They're determined to get the arrest 
                         for themselves. The "collar," I think 
                         they say.

                                     SEN. MARTIN
                         Thank you, Doctor. I'll keep it in 
                         mind.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Oh, and Senator...? Love you suit.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. MR. GUMB'S BASEMENT - DAY (DIMLY LIT)

               CLOSE ON scraps of food - peas, chicken bones - lying on the 
               cement floor of the pit, near the foil tray of a TV dinner.

                                     CATHERINE (O.S.)
                              (muttering, feisty)
                         Close enough to fuck is close enough 
                         to fight...

               CATHERINE

               is hunched over in concentration. The plastic toilet bucket 
               is on her lap, and she has yanked down its cotton string.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Get my legs round your neck, you 
                         goddamn creep, I'll send you home to 
                         Jesus...

               HER FINGERS

               are tying a chicken bone to the bucket's handle, where it 
               meets the string. The other end of the string is tied to her 
               wrist.

               SHE STANDS

               gathers the coiled string in one hand, and swings the bucket 
               by its handle, calculating this distance up to the basement 
               floor.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Okay, Precious. Time for a treat...

               She hurls the bucket upwards.

               AT THE LIP OF THE OUBLIETTE

               the bucket sails out, bounces LOUDLY, then falls back inside.

               ANGLE ON THE DOG, PRECIOUS

               who is elsewhere in the basement, worrying a toy. She cocks 
               an ear, making a low GROWL, then sets off to investigate.

               DOWN IN THE PIT

               Catherine swings the bucket again, trying another cast.

               THE BUCKET LANDS

               two feet beyond the pit's edge, rolls a bit, stops.

               PRECIOUS TROTS UP

               then pauses, staring curiously towards...

               VERY LOW ANGLE (DOG'S POV)

               the enticing chicken bone, six feet away. It twitches as 
               Catherine tugs on the string, edging the bucket back towards 
               the pit.

               Precious with her tail wagging, BARKS - greedy but suspicious.

               CATHERINE

               staring upwards, pulls again, even so gently, at the string.

                                     CATHERINE
                              (softly)
                         Preeeeecious...! C'mon, boy, nice 
                         yummy bone... c'mon, you little 
                         shit...

               PRECIOUS

               edges reluctantly closer... then suddenly rushes in, seizing 
               the bone in her teeth. She tries to run away with it, but 
               Catherine is pulling her towards the hole, working her like 
               a hooked fish. Her toenails scrabble as she tries to stop.

               CATHERINE

               stares desperately, unable to see how she's doing.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Hang on, boy... hang on...

               PRECIOUS

               still fights for the bone, GROWLING, as the bucket rocks 
               precariously on the edge of the pit. A long, seesaw battle... 
               until finally, when one of her forelegs slips momentarily 
               into the hole, she panics and lets go. The bucket flops over 
               the edge.

               CATHERINE

               crouches, covering her head as the bucket bounces off her.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Nooooo...!

               THE LITTLE DOG

               furious, BARKS down at her, then trots away in disgust.

               CLOSE ON CATHERINE

               as she sinks to the cold cement. She slaps aside the foil 
               tray, the scraps of food, sobbing in utter despair...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. CATHERINE MARTIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

               CLOSE ON a framed photo of Sen. Martin and Catherine, held 
               in Clarice's cotton-gloved hands. Powdered fingerprints on 
               the glass.

               Clarice glances up from the photo, smiles disarmingly at -

               A young STATE TROOPER sitting in Catherine's easy chair. He 
               smiles back at her, then relaxes, returns to his newspaper. 
               He also wears gloves.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KITCHEN

               Clarice closes the refrigerator door, glances around.

               A big REEL-TO-REEL TAPE RECORDER has been set up on the 
               breakfast counter, attached to Catherine's phone. Two new 
               red phones are hooked up as well.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BATHROOM

               Clarice slides open the medicine cabinet's mirror, looks 
               inside. She reaches in, pokes carefully amongst the lotions.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ATTIC CRAWL-SPACE

               A ceiling hatch bangs open, sending up dust clouds. Clarice, 
               lit from underneath, pokes her head through, looking around.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BEDROOM

               Flat on her back, Clarice wriggles out from under Catherine's 
               bed. She sits up, brushing dust from her face and hair.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BEDROOM

               CLOSE ON an open, multi-tiered jewelry box, resting atop a 
               bureau, as Clarice's fingers pick through costume jewelry.

               Clarice closes the box, and is just turning away when a figure 
               suddenly looms INTO SHOT, giving her a bad start; she cries 
               out softly.

               Senator Martin is revealed, staring at her suspiciously.

                                     SEN. MARTIN
                         Who are you, please? I thought the 
                         police were through in here.

                                     CLARICE
                         I'm Clarice Starling, Senator. FBI.

                                     SEN. MARTIN
                              (softly, very angry)
                         Clarice Starling...
                              (calls out)
                         Paul? Would you come in here, 
                         please...?

               Krendler enters from the hallway, looks at Clarice.

                                     SEN. MARTIN
                         Miss Starling, you may know the Deputy 
                         Attorney General, Mr. Krendler. Paul, 
                         this is the trainee that Jack Crawford 
                         sent to Lecter... She lied to him, 
                         pretending to have my authority, and 
                         thus jeopardized this entire 
                         investigation. Now she has the further 
                         gall to invade my daughter's privacy, 
                         again without permission. If her 
                         little games have killed my baby...

               Overcome, she hurries from the room. Krendler shuts the door 
               behind her, points sternly at Clarice.

                                     KRENDLER
                         You're out of line, Starling, and 
                         you're off this case. Back to 
                         Quantico.

                                     CLARICE
                         Sir, Mr. Crawford instructed me -

                                     KRENDLER
                         Your instructions are what I'm giving 
                         you now. Jack Crawford answers to 
                         the Director, and the Director answers 
                         to me. My God, Crawford's losing 
                         it...! He shouldn't even be on this, 
                         with his wife sick as she is... How 
                         the hell did you get in here, anyway? 
                         He gave you - what? Some kind of 
                         special ID? Let's have it.

                                     CLARICE
                              (stubbornly)
                         I need the ID to fly with my gun. 
                         The gun belongs in Quantico.

                                     KRENDLER
                         Gun. Jesus. Turn in the ID as soon 
                         as you get back. The gun, too. Be on 
                         the next plane, Starling, there's 
                         one in 90 minutes.

               Clarice, burning, starts for the door, then turns back.

                                     CLARICE
                         Mr. Krendler... Dr. Lecter trusts 
                         me. Or at least, he used to. If I 
                         could just -

                                     KRENDLER
                         Lecter has already named Buffalo 
                         Bill.

               Clarice reacts, surprised. Krendler takes a folded computer 
               sheet from his pocket, shoves it at her. She takes it, reads.

                                     KRENDLER
                         He gave us a perfectly good 
                         description, and we're on it now, so 
                         we won't be needing your little 
                         novelty act any longer - or his, 
                         either. He's under close guard at 
                         the courthouse, pending a prison 
                         transfer. The next plane, Officer.

                                     CLARICE
                         Sir, doesn't this "William Rubin" 
                         strike you as - I don't know - kind 
                         of vague?

               Krendler moves in very close to her, pale with anger.

                                     KRENDLER
                         Do you need a police escort, Starling? 
                         Or do you think you can find the 
                         airport by yourself?

                                     CLARICE
                         Yes sir. I can find it by myself.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SHELBY COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY

               The old courthouse is a massive Gothic stronghold, with an 
               armada of police cruisers parked at the curb.

               Clarice climbs from her rented car, SLAMMING the door angrily. 
               Holding a rolled-up pile of papers - Dr. Lecter's drawings - 
               she starts determinedly up the steps. A nearby commotion 
               makes her pause.

               Dr. Frederick Chilton in a sea of interviewers and mini-cams, 
               is preening grandly. 

               Clarice carefully avoiding his gaze, slips up the steps and 
               inside.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. COURTHOUSE - GROUND FLOOR - DAY

               SGT. TATE, a Memphis policeman, is studying Clarice's ID. He 
               looks up at her from his command desk, a bit doubtfully.

                                     SGT. TATE
                         Are you with Mr. Krendler's people?

                                     CLARICE
                         I just left him.

                                     SGT. TATE
                         Access to Lecter is strictly limited. 
                         We've been getting death threats.
                              (hesitates again)
                         Log in, and check your weapon.

               He picks up a phone, murmurs into it. As he does so, Clarice 
               glances around this main ground floor lobby.

               HER POV

               The building looks like an armed fort. Cops with shotguns 
               guard the front door, both ends of the hall, the foot of the 
               stairs, the single elevator. More of them are coming and 
               going.

                                     MURRAY (V.O.)
                         Shoot, we haven't had this kinda 
                         security since the President came 
                         through town...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ELEVATOR - MOVING

               Clarice and OFFICER MURRAY, a young patrolman, ride up in an 
               old-fashioned, CREAKING, metal-cage elevator. He is excited.

                                     MURRAY
                         Every cop in Tennessee wants a look 
                         at this guy. 'Sit true what they're 
                         sayin' - he's some kinda vampire?

                                     CLARICE
                              (beat)
                         I don't have a name for what he is.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HISTORICAL SOCIETY ROOM - 5TH FLOOR

               Pembry, at a desk by the door, looks up from examining the 
               unrolled pile of Dr. Lecter's drawings.

                                     PEMBRY
                         You know the rules, ma'am?

                                     CLARICE
                         Yes, Officer Pembry. I've questioned 
                         him before.

               He waves her on her way, but retains the drawings for now.

               MOVING ANGLE - WITH CLARICE

               as she crosses the big, spare, white octagonal room. A 
               massive, temporary iron cage has been installed; Officer 
               Boyle sits facing its barred door. He rises, nods, moving 
               away to allow her privacy.

               INSIDE THE CAGE

               a cot and a small table, each bolted to the floor, and a 
               flimsy paper screen, hiding a toilet. Dr. Lecter sits at the 
               table, his back to her, studying the Buffalo Bill case file. 
               He now wears a green prison jumpsuit. A small cassette player 
               is chained to the steel table.

                                     DR. LECTER
                              (without turning)
                         Good afternoon, Clarice.

               She stops at a striped police barricade, before his bars.

                                     CLARICE
                         I thought you might want your drawings 
                         back... Just until you get your view.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         How very thoughtful... Or did Crawford
                         send you here for one last wheedle - 
                         before you're both booted off the 
                         case?

                                     CLARICE
                         Nobody sent me. I came on my own.

               He spins in his swivel chair, stops neatly. A coy smile.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         People will say we're in love.
                              (beat)
                         Pity you tried to fool me, isn't it? 
                         Pity for poor Catherine. Tick-tock...

               He spins again in his chair, playfully.

               MOVING ANGLE - FAVORING CLARICE

               as she circles the cage, trying to keep his face in sight.

                                     CLARICE
                         Dr. Lecter, you find out everything. 
                         You couldn't have talked with this 
                         "William Rubin", even once, and come 
                         out knowing so little about him... 
                         You made him up, didn't you?

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Clarice... you're hardly in a position 
                         to accuse me of lying.

                                     CLARICE
                         I think you were telling me the truth 
                         in Baltimore - or starting to. Tell 
                         me the rest now.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         I've studied the case file, have 
                         you...? Everything you need to find 
                         him is right in these pages. Whatever 
                         his name is.

                                     CLARICE
                         Then tell me how.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         First principles, Clarice. Simplicity. 
                         Read Marcus Aurelius. Of each 
                         particular thing, ask: What is it, 
                         in itself, what is its nature...? 
                         What does he do, this man you seek?

                                     CLARICE
                         He kills w-

                                     DR. LECTER
                              (sharply, as he stops)
                         No! That's incidental.

               CLOSE ANGLE - TWO SHOT as he rises, pained by her ignorance, 
               and crosses to the bars.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         What is the first and principal thing 
                         he does, what need does he serve by 
                         killing?

                                     CLARICE
                         Anger, social resentment, sexual 
                         frus-

                                     DR. LECTER
                         No, he covets. That's his nature. 
                         And how do we begin to covet, Clarice? 
                         Do we seek out things to covet? Make 
                         an effort to answer.

                                     CLARICE
                         No. We just -

                                     DR. LECTER
                         No. Precisely. We begin by coveting 
                         what we see every day. Don't you 
                         feel eyes moving over your body, 
                         Clarice? I hardly see how you 
                         couldn't. And don't your eyes move 
                         over the things you want?

                                     CLARICE
                         All right, then tell me how -

                                     DR. LECTER
                         No. It's your turn to tell me, 
                         Clarice. You don't have any more 
                         vacations to sell, on Anthrax Island. 
                         Why did you run away from that ranch?

                                     CLARICE
                         Dr. Lecter, when there's time I'll -

                                     DR. LECTER
                         We don't reckon time the same way, 
                         Clarice. This is all the time you'll 
                         ever have.

                                     CLARICE
                         Later, listen, I'll -

                                     DR. LECTER
                         I'll listen now. After your father's 
                         murder, you were orphaned. You were 
                         ten years old. You went to live with 
                         cousins, on a sheep and horse ranch 
                         in Montana. And - ?

                                     CLARICE
                         And - one morning I just - ran away...

               She turns from him. He presses closer, gripping the bars.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Not "just," Clarice. What set you 
                         off? You started what time?

                                     CLARICE
                         Early. Still dark.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Then something woke you. What? Did 
                         you dream...? What was it?

               IN FLASHBACK

               The 10-year old Clarice sits up abruptly in her bed, 
               frightened. She is in a Montana ranch house; it almost dawn. 
               Strange, fearful shadows on her ceiling and walls... a window, 
               partly fogged by the cold; eerie brightness outside.

                                     CLARICE (V.O.)
                         I heard a strange sound...

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         What was it?

               THE CHILD RISES

               crosses to the window in her nightgown, rubs the glass.

                                     CLARICE (V.O.)
                         I didn't know. I went to look...

               HIGH ANGLES (2ND STORY) - THE CHILD'S POV

               Shadowy men, ranch hands, are moving in and out of a nearby 
               barn, carrying mysterious bundles. The mens' breath is 
               steaming... A refrigerated truck idles nearby, its engine 
               adding more steam. A strange, almost surrealistic scene...

                                     CLARICE (V.O.)
                         Screaming! Some kind of - screaming. 
                         Like a child's voice...

               THE LITTLE GIRL

               is terrified; she covers her ears.

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         What did you do?

                                     CLARICE (V.O.)
                         Got dressed without turning on the 
                         light. I went downstairs... outside...

               THE LITTLE GIRL

               in her winter coat, slips noiselessly towards the open barn 
               door. She ducks into the shadows to avoid a ranch hand, who 
               passes her with a squirming bundle of some kind. He goes 
               into the barn, and she edges after him reluctantly.

                                     CLARICE (V.O.)
                         I crept up to the barn... I was so 
                         scared to look inside - but I had 
                         to...

               THE LITTLE GIRL'S POV

               as the open doorway LOOMS CLOSER... Bright lights inside, 
               straw bales, the edges of stalls, then moving figures...

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         And what did you see, Clarice?

               A SQUIRMING LAMB

               is held down on a table by two ranch hands.

                                     CLARICE (V.O.)
                         Lambs. The lambs were screaming...

               A third cowboy stretches out the lamb's neck, raises a bloody 
               knife. Just as he's about to slice its throat -

               BACK TO THE ADULT CLARICE

               staring into the distance, shaken, still trembling from the 
               child's shock. We see Dr. Lecter, over her shoulder, studying 
               her intently.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         They were slaughtering the spring 
                         lambs?

                                     CLARICE
                         Yes...! They were screaming.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         So you ran away...

                                     CLARICE
                         No. First I tried to free them... I 
                         opened the gate of their pen - but 
                         they wouldn't run. They just stood 
                         there, confused. They wouldn't run...

                                     DR. LECTER
                         But you could. You did.

                                     CLARICE
                         I took one lamb. And I ran away, as 
                         fast as I could...

               IN FLASHBACK

               a vast Montana plain, and crossing this, a tiny figure - the 
               little Clarice, holding a lamb in her arms.

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         Where were you going?

                                     CLARICE (V.O.)
                         I don't know. I had no food or water. 
                         It was very cold. I thought - if I 
                         can even save just one... but he got 
                         so heavy. So heavy...

               The tiny figure stops, and after a few moments sinks to the 
               ground, hunched over in dispair.

                                     CLARICE (V.O.)
                         I didn't get more than a few miles 
                         before the sheriff's car found me. 
                         The rancher was so angry he sent me 
                         to live at the Lutheran orphanage in 
                         Bozeman. I never saw the ranch 
                         again...

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         But what became of your lamb?
                              (no response)
                         Clarice...?

               BACK TO SCENE

               as the adult Clarice turns, staring into his feverish eyes. 
               She shakes her head, unwilling - or unable - to say more.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         You still wake up sometimes, don't 
                         you? Wake up in the dark, with the 
                         lambs screaming?

                                     CLARICE
                         Yes...

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Do you think if you saved Catherine, 
                         you could make them stop...? Do you 
                         think, if Catherine lives, you won't 
                         wake up in the dark, ever again, to 
                         the screaming of the lambs? Do you...?

                                     CLARICE
                         Yes! I don't know...! I don't know.

                                     DR. LECTER
                              (a pause; then, oddly 
                              at peace)
                         Thank you, Clarice.

                                     CLARICE
                              (a whisper)
                         Tell me his name, Dr. Lecter.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Dr. Chilton... I believe you know 
                         each other?

               NEW ANGLE

               as Clarice turns, startled, and the fuming Chilton seizes 
               her elbow. Pembry and Boyle are beside him, looking grim.

                                     CHILTON
                         Out. Let's go.

                                     PEMBRY
                         Sorry, ma'a m - we've got orders to 
                         have you put on a place.

               Clarice struggles, pulling free of them for a moment.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Brave Clarice. Will you let me know 
                         if ever the lambs stop screaming?

                                     CLARICE
                              (moving closer to the 
                              bars)
                         Yes. I'll tell you.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Promise...?
                              (she nods. He smiles)
                         Then why not take your case file? I 
                         won't be needing it anymore.

               He holds out the file, arm extended between the bars. She 
               hesitates, then reaches to take it.

               VERY CLOSE ANGLE - SLOW MOTION

               as the exchange is made, his index finger touches her hand, 
               and lingers there, just for a moment.

               DR. LECTER'S EYES

               widen, crackling at this touch, like sparks in a cave.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Good-bye, Clarice.

               CLARICE

               hugging the case file to her chest, stares back at him as 
               the men crowd in on her, pushing her away.

               HER POV - MOVING

               as Dr. Lecter, head cocked in a smile, slowly recedes...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. GARMENT SWEATSHOP - DAY

               MOVING ANGLE - MR. GUMB'S POV as he pushes a rolling rack of 
               completed leather garments, each wrapped in plastic, down as 
               aisle. SOUND of many sewing machines, all clattering at once, 
               as he passes row on row of work tables. The seamstresses, 
               mostly black or Hispanic, glance up as he passes, then quickly 
               avert their eyes, his presence disturbing them in some 
               nameless way.

               A thin FOREMAN in a flowery shirt, sees him approaching. He 
               rises from his desk and comes over cheerfully, as the rack 
               rolls to a stop.

                                     FOREMAN
                         Hello, dear! Punctual as always. And 
                         what have you brought us today?

               He seizes one of the dangling jackets, pulling up the plastic 
               wrapper. He examines it, stroking the sleeve.

                                     FOREMAN
                         Oh, marvelous... You know, I always 
                         say you're the Leonardo of leather.

                                     MR. GUMB (O.S.)
                              (a harsh whisper)
                         Oil.

                                     FOREMAN
                         Pardon...?

                                     MR. GUMB (O.S.)
                         You're leaving oil on the skin.

               The foreman quickly releases the jacket.

                                     FOREMAN
                         Of course... You'll be wanting your -

               Mr. Gumb's hand reaches INTO SHOT, snatching an envelope 
               from him. The foreman is watching him walk away, as a 
               seamstress comes over to take the rack of garments. The 
               foreman is vaguely troubled, but shakes it off. He strokes 
               the jacket again, admiringly.

                                     FOREMAN
                              (to seamstress)
                         I wish we had a dozen like him...

               SOUND UPCUT - Glenn Gould playing Bach's Goldberg 
               Variations...

               INT. MEMPHIS INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - LOUNGE AREA - DUSK

               Clarice, in a line of other passengers, is moving slowly 
               towards a departure ramp. Through a huge plate glass window, 
               we can see her plane. She glances back over her shoulder at

               A pair of UNIFORMED COPS brawny and impassive, their arms 
               folded, waiting to make sure she board the flight.

               Clarice sighs, turning wearily back towards the jetway. The 
               BACH CONTINUES, as we...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SHELBY CO. COURTHOUSE - HISTORICAL SOCIETY ROOM -

               NIGHT

               CLOSE ON a steaming, rather elegant dinner tray, being carried 
               by Pembry, as he approaches Dr. Lecter's cell.

                                     PEMBRY
                              (shouts)
                         Ready when you are, Doc!

               IN THE CELL

               the BACH is issuing from the cassette player. Beside it, on 
               the table, the pile of Dr. Lecter's drawings. The top one is 
               an accurate, sensitive portrait, from memory, of Clarice. 
               Beyond the table, we see Lecter's shadowy form, seated behind 
               the paper screen. He calls out from there.

                                     DR. LECTER (O.S.)
                         Just another minute, please!

               Pembry grunts, sets the tray down. Boyle joins him, handing 
               him a riot baton and a Mace cannister, which Pembry fastens 
               to belt clips. Boyle is similarly armed, and carries a ring 
               of keys.

                         Sumbitch demanded lamb chops for 
                         dinner, extra rare.

                                     BOYLE
                              (laughs)
                         What you reckon he'll want for 
                         breakfast - some fuckin' thing from 
                         the zoo?

               INSIDE THE SCREEN

               Dr. Lecter sits fully clothed on the toilet - swaying 
               slightly, eyes closed, lost in the music, tongue working in 
               his cheek. Suddenly, like magic, a little shiny piece of 
               metal protrudes from his lips. He plucks it out, opens his 
               eyes.

               IN EXTREME CLOSEUP

               he is holding the pocket clip from Prentice's disassembled 
               pen - a straight, thin strip of metal, with a circular collar 
               at one end, a square edge at the other.

               DR. LECTER

               lines up his thumbnail just shy of the square edge, then 
               braces it against the stainless steel toilet rim. He pushes 
               down, hard, using both hands for leverage. After a moment he 
               smiles, holding up the result, and twirling it before his 
               eyes.

               IN EXTREME CLOSEUP

               the straight end of the clip now forms a tiny right angle, 
               and the circular end anchors nicely between his fingers.

               OUTSIDE THE CELL

               Pembry and Boyle turn as the toilet FLUSHES, and Dr. Lecter 
               reappears, looking jaunty.

                         Okay, Doc, grab some floor. Same 
                         drill as lunchtime.

               Dr. Lecter sits on the floor, legs straight, then wriggles 
               backwards. He stretches his arms behind him, hands and wrists 
               through the bars, with two bars between them, and clasps his 
               hands.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         I'm ready when you are, Officer 
                         Pembry.

               Pembry comes around the cell to squat behind Dr. Lecter. He 
               tugs his hands farther out, rather roughly, handcuffs his 
               wrists. He shakes the cuffs, making sure of them, then nods 
               to Boyle.

               NEW ANGLE - AT CELL DOOR

               as Boyle picks up the dinner tray, and Pembry crosses around. 
               Pembry takes the keys from Boyle, unlocks the cell door, and 
               pushes it inward. Boyle goes inside with the tray.

               DR. LECTER

               watches as Boyle approaches the table, above five feet from 
               him. Boyle has to set his tray down on the floor to clear 
               off some of the mess of drawings. The MUSIC plays on.

               VERY CLOSE ON

               ...Dr. Lecter's hands, outside the bars, as the makeshift 
               key, held between the tips of his right index and middle 
               fingers, searches for the keyhole of the cuffs. And finds 
               it.

               NEW ANGLE - FAVORING BOYLE

               as he finishes clearing the drawings, then turns back towards 
               Dr. Lecter, stooping to pick up the tray.

               BOYLE'S RIGHT HAND

               is just inches from the tray when Dr. Lecter's hand darts 
               INTO SHOT, snapping a handcuff onto his wrist.

               BOYLE

               looks up, astonished, to find himself right in the grinning 
               face of Dr. Lecter - who just as quickly rolls sideways, and 
               snaps -

               THE OTHER CUFF

               around the bolted leg of the table. And suddenly all natural 
               SOUND and MOTION are suspended, as the MUSIC soars much 
               louder, each separate note of it now echoing distinctly, and 
               we see...

               VARIOUS ANGLES - EACH BLURRING INTO STOP-ACTION

               Pembry starting into the cell, reaching for his riot baton... 

               Dr. Lecter smashing against the cell door, driving it into 
               Pembry, pinning him across the chest, against the door 
               frame...

               Boyle, on one knee on the floor, digging desperately in his 
               pants pocket for his handcuff key...

               Pembry's hand, mashed against his body by the door, as he 
               strains frantically to reach the baton at his waist... 

               Pembry's eyes, widening in horror as he stares at...

               Dr. Lecter's bared teeth, flashing towards him...

               Dr. Lecter gripping Pembry's face in his jaws, shaking it 
               like a dog shakes a rat...

               Boyle finding his key, but in his terror dropping it...

               Dr. Lecter yanking the mace can and riot baton from the dazed 
               Pembry's belt, spraying him in his bloody face, then clubbing 
               him to his knees...

               Boyle, mouth open in a silent scream, finding his key again, 
               unlocking the handcuff, but then, as he starts to rise, 
               seeing...

               Dr. Lecter standing over him, with the riot baton raised 
               high; he swings it viciously down, again and again and 
               again...

               Then normal SOUND and MOTION are restored as we go to -

               CLOSE ANGLE ON

               the cassette player, and the portrait of Clarice, both now 
               flecked with blood. In addition to the Bach, we now hear 
               soft PANTING, close by, and whimpering SOBS in the background.

               ANGLE ON DR. LECTER

               eyes closed, lost in a favorite passage of the music. His 
               bloody fingers drift airily with the notes, as his breathing 
               slows to normal. He opens his eyes, sighs contentedly, looks 
               down.

               HIS POV

               By the sprawled legs of Boyle lie various objects that spilled 
               from his pants pocket - coins, a comb, a big pocketknife.

               DR. LECTER

               picks up the pocketknife, examines it happily. About a four-
               inch blade. He becomes aware of the WHIMPERING, off screen, 
               turns.

               LOW ANGLE ON PEMBRY

               as he crawls, with torturous slowness, towards the command 
               desk, and the phone. He is crying, but frantically determined.

               PEMBRY'S POV - PARTIALLY BLURRED, THEN CLEARING

               Above the desk, hanging from pegs, are his and Boyle's 
               holstered revolvers...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. COURTHOUSE - GROUND FLOOR LOBBY - NIGHT

               The bronze arrow above the elevator swings towards "5," then 
               indicates a stop there, at the top floor.

               FAVORING SGT. TATE

               at his command desk, as he stares at the indicator. Another 
               cop, JACOBS, sits on the desk's edge, flipping through a 
               magazine; many more cops can be seen beyond them, idling in 
               the lobby.

                                     SGT. TATE
                         What is this shit...? Did somebody 
                         go up to five?
                              (Jacobs shakes his 
                              head)
                         Call Pembry, ask him what -

               A GUNSHOT, and then, moments later, TWO MORE quick ones, 
               echo down the nearby stairwell. Sgt. Tate jumps to his feet, 
               grabs a radio mike, as the other cops stir, confused and 
               noisy.

                                     SGT. TATE
                              (into mike)
                         CP, shots fired on five! Repeat, 
                         shots fires on five! Outside posts 
                         look sharp, we've got a... Ho-ly 
                         shit.

               THE BRONZE ARROW

               has begun to descend. Down to 4, then past 4...

               BACK ON SGT. TATE

               as he reacts. The other cops, behind him, are now in a full 
               uproar, shouting, pulling out guns.

                                     SGT. TATE
                              (to the others)
                         SHUT UP...! Guard mount, double up 
                         on your outside posts. Bobby, get 
                         the vests. Rainey, Howard, cover 
                         that fucking elevator if it comes 
                         all the way to -

                                     A COP (O.S.)
                         It stopped!

               THE BRONZE ARROW

               has, indeed, frozen at 3. Sgt. Tate lifts the microphone 
               again.

                         the SWAT team and an ambulance, double 
                         quick. We're going up.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT (DIMLY LIT)

               HIGH ANGLE on Sgt. Tate as he leads a five-man squad, all in 
               bulletproof vests, up the stone stairs. They move fast but 
               carefully, covering each other from landing to landing with 
               drawn revolvers, shotguns. The distant Back MUSIC makes a 
               ghostly echo in here...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT (DIMLY LIT)

               A thin rectangle of light on the floor from the open elevator 
               door. We can't see inside. The MUSIC sounds closer.

               SGT. TATE

               approaches very cautiously, gun aimed. The other cops, behind 
               him, fan out silently to set up angles of fire, checking the 
               various office doors - all locked - as they creep up.

               MOVING ANGLE - OVER TATE'S SHOULDER

               as he reaches the side of the elevator, hesitates, then spins 
               to point his gun inside. It's empty. He backs away.

                                     SGT. TATE
                              (shouts at ceiling)
                         Pembry? Boyle...?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HISTORICAL SOCIETY ROOM - NIGHT (BRIGHTLY LIT)

               ANGLE on the door, from inside, its lettering reversed on 
               the frosted glass. The Bach is VERY LOUD.

               After a moment the door is shouldered open, hard enough for 
               the glass to shatter, Tate following his gun inside, moving 
               low, then other cops appearing behind him in the doorframe. 
               They all freeze, staring in utter horror.

                                     SGT. TATE
                         Oh no... no...

               THEIR POV

               is a brief snapshot from hell. The two uniformed bodies, one 
               sprawled on its back near the door, the other still in the 
               cell, have been savaged by a knife. Blood and gore everywhere. 
               The faces are unrecognizable.

               SGT. TATE

               struggles for control, as the other cops move grimly around 
               him, into the room. He pulls his walkie-talkie from his belt.

                                     SGT. TATE
                              (into mike)

                              throat)
                         Two officers down. Prisoner is 
                         missing. Repeat, Lecter is missing... 
                         He's stripped the bed, might be making 
                         a rope, check all windows. Where the 
                         fuck is my ambulance?

               IN THE CELL

               a cop angrily punches OFF the music. Jacobs kneels with his 
               fingers on Boyle's neck.

                                     JACOBS
                         Boyle is dead, Sarge. His gun's 
                         gone...

               AT THE OTHER BODY

               a cop gently removes a revolver from the bloody fist. Murray, 
               the young patrolman, brings his ear reluctantly close to the 
               gory face. A bloody bubble appears there; the wreckage GROANS, 
               very softly.

                                     MURRAY
                         This one's alive!

               Tate crosses, kneels to see for himself. Murray looks green.

                                     SGT. TATE
                         Take ahold of him where he can feel 
                         your hands, son. Talk to him.

                                     MURRAY
                         What's his name, Sarge?

                                     SGT. TATE
                         It's Pembry, now talk to him, God 
                         dammit.
                              (into radio, looking 
                              around)
                         Boyle's dead, Pembry's read bad. 
                         Lecter is missing and armed - he 
                         took Boyle's gun...

               The other cop, checking the cylinder of Pembry's gun, holds 
               up one finger to Tate.

                                     SGT. TATE
                              (into radio)
                         Pembry got off one round - there's a 
                         chance Lecter was hit. We heard a 
                         total of three shots fired, so he's 
                         got four left... He's got a knife, 
                         too.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF COURTHOUSE - NIGHT

               VARIOUS ANGLES on a floodlit scene of barely controlled 
               pandemonium. Flashing red lights, men shouting commands, 
               SIRENS in the distance. SWAT members, in full gear, leap 
               from a black van... fan out... swarm up the steps... EMS 
               orderlies unload a gurney from an ambulance... Cops kneel 
               for cover behind cars, aiming guns and rifles up at the 
               windows...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HISTORICAL SOCIETY ROOM - NIGHT

               A trio of EMS orderlies work fast over the body, already 
               strapped on its gurney. They bandage a big plastic airway 
               into place, over the butchered face, checking for a pulse at 
               the neck. Young Murray crouches, sickened, gripping a bloody 
               fist.

                                     MURRAY
                         You're just fine, Pembry, lookin' 
                         good, buddy, you're gonna make it...

               One orderly massages the heart. Another is popping a plasma 
               bag, ready to insert the needle, when the body starts 
               convulsing.

                                     ORDERLY
                         Downstairs - let's go!

               Quickly the gurney is elevated, wheeled out of the room, 
               with cops rushing forward to open the doors, help push, SWAT 
               men are running by in the hall, automatic rifles at the 
               ready...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE ELEVATOR - DESCENDING - NIGHT

               Sgt. Tate, riding down with Jacobs, has his radio out.

                         Ten-four, Lieutenant. I'm on the 
                         elevator, bringing it down. Pembry 
                         and Boyle are both cleared, top three 
                         floors secured, main stairwell 
                         secured. He's somewhere on -

               A spot of blood falls on his cheek. He and Jacobs stare at 
               each other. Another spot hits his shoulder. They look up.

               THEIR POV

               Blood is dripping slowly from the corner of the service hatch.

               Sgt. Tate motions for silence, as both men draw their guns.

                                     SGT. TATE
                              (into mike)
                         Uh, we're pretty sure he's somewhere 
                         on two, sir... That's all for now, 
                         over.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. GROUND FLOOR LOBBY - NIGHT

               The elevator doors open, and Tate and Jacobs hurry out, 
               stepping quickly to the side. Tate reaches back in and -

               CLOSE ANGLE

               Locks the elevator into position, with its doors open.

               OTHER COPS are rushing up to them, curious, as Tate 
               frantically pushes them aside, gesturing for silence.

                                     SGT. TATE
                              (whispers)
                         He's on the roof of the elevator!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               Two SWAT officers, PETERSON and KUBELL, turn a key, unlocking 
               and opening this floor's elevator doorway. The shaft is dark. 
               Lying prone, they inch up to the edge, Peterson extends a 
               mirror, on a long pole, out into the shaft.

               IN THE MIRROR (DISTORTED BY THE ANGLE)

               Is a distant figure, in a green prison jumpsuit, lying on 
               his stomach, atop the elevator. A shiny revolver is near one 
               hand.

               PETERSON

               whispers into a radio, as Kubell carefully tips an assault 
               rifle, with a flashlight taped to its barrel, over the edge.

                                     PETERSON
                         I see him... There's a weapon by his 
                         hand. He's not moving...

                                     RADIO VOICE
                         Can you get the drop?

                                     PETERSON
                         We got the drop.

                                     RADIO VOICE
                         One warning. Then take him out.

               Peterson nods to Kubell, who switches ON the flashlight, as 
               Peterson shouts down the shaft.

                                     PETERSON
                         Quinn!! put your hands on your head!!

               IN THE MIRROR

               the green figure shows no movement.

               ANGLE ON THE COPS AGAIN

               as Peterson mutters to Kubell.

                                     PETERSON
                         Put one in his leg.

               VERY CLOSE ON

               The figure below, as Kubell's gunshot ROARS, echoing hugely 
               in the shaft, and a slug rips through the jumpsuited leg. 
               The figure doesn't stir.

               PETERSON

               staring down the shaft, raises his mike again.

                                     PETERSON
                         No movement.

                                     RADIO VOICE
                         Okay, Johnny, hold your fire...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. GROUND FLOOR LOBBY - NIGHT

               A small army of cops is now covering the elevator doorway, 
               from both sides. Tate crouches next to the SWAT COMMANDER.

                                     SWAT COMMANDER
                              (into radio mike)
                         We're coming into the car, we're 
                         opening the hatch. Watch his hands. 
                         Any fire will come from us. Affirm?

                                     PETERSON'S VOICE
                         Got it.

               The SWAT commander hands his radio to another cop, then looks 
               at Tate. A long, tense moment. Then he waves a signal.

               MOVING ANGLE

               as we follow a picked team of four SWAT cops, in full body 
               armor, rushing into the elevator car. Two men move to the 
               corners, aim assault rifles at the ceiling. A third man sets 
               a stepladder in place, and the fourth man, armed with a big 
               Colt, hurries up the ladder and unclips the hatch.

               CLOSE ON

               ...the service hatch, as the hinged cover drops open, and a 
               body tumbles through, dangling head first, until it's caught 
               at the waist. We see the back of the head.

               SGT. TATE

               shoulders through the SWAT cops for a closer look. He turns 
               towards the SWAT commander, astonished.

                                     SGT. TATE
                         That's Pembry!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EMS AMBULANCE - MOVING

               In the rear chamber, a young EMS ATTENDANT is braced against 
               the vehicle's sway. Behind him, the stretchered form of his 
               patient, and, through a curtained opening, the driver. SOUND 
               of the siren.

                                     ATTENDANT
                              (into radio mike)
                         He's comatose, but his vital signs 
                         are good. Pressure's 130 over 90... 
                         Yeah, 90! Pulse 85...

               Behind him, in slightly BLURRED FOCUS, the bloody figure 
               sits slowly upright...

                                     ATTENDANT
                         His convulsions have stopped, but 
                         he's got so much loose skin on his 
                         face, it's hard to tell if -

               Suddenly he stops, becoming aware of a strange HISSING. He 
               turns, puzzled...

               THE POCKETKNIFE BLADE

               in Lecter's fist, flashes high in the air...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SIX-LANE FREEWAY - NIGHT (ARC LIGHTS)

               MOVING ANGLE on the EMS ambulance, as it races along normally, 
               its SIREN blazing, the heavy flow of traffic parting to make 
               way for it.

               Then suddenly it begins to weave erratically, changing lanes, 
               before drifting dangerously to a full stop, almost side-ways. 
               Cars swerve to avoid hitting it, HONKING angrily...

               CLOSER ANGLE

               on the stopped ambulance. After a long, still moment, the 
               wind-shield wipes come on, incongruously, then stop. Then 
               the SIREN is shut OFF, and the flashers. The ambulance starts 
               rolling again - at first jerkingly, then with increasing 
               speed. We follow it for several more moments, until is passes - 
               and we LINGER on...

               BIG GREEN INTERSTATE SIGN

               ...that reads "Memphis International Airport / 2 miles."

               CLOSE ANGLE - THROUGH AMBULANCE WINDSHIELD

               Dr. Lecter's face is slowly REVEALED, as he wipes across it 
               with a fistful of gauze, tossing it aside...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. MONTANA PLAIN - DUSK - (IN FLASHBACK)

               MOVING ANGLE, rushing with dizzy swiftness over the prairie, 
               over waving grasses... a long passage... before we come at 
               last to the girl Clarice, sitting with her lamb, hunched in 
               despair. She rises, her face tear-stained, and turns from 
               us. Holding the lamb, she starts back the way she came...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. COUNTRY DIRT ROAD - NIGHT - BRIGHT MOONLIGHT

               MOVING ANGLE, very rapid, down this road... coming at last 
               to a stopped highway patrol car. Clarice, with her lamb, is 
               standing in the car's headlights. She starts wearily towards 
               the sheriff...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. RANCH BARNYARD - NEAR DAWN

               CRANE ANGLE - sweeping rapidly DOWN into the barnyard towards 
               the arriving highway patrol car, as it stops... RUSHING to 
               the little girl as she steps from the car, holding the lamb.

               The dark figure of the rancher ENTERS FRAME. As he roughly 
               takes the lamb from her, we HOLD on a CLOSEUP of her face - 
               stunned, blank. She EXITS FRAME...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BARN - NIGHT

               MOVING ANGLE - CLARICE'S POV as she walks towards the open 
               barn doorway... It looms CLOSER... The rancher is revealed, 
               a shadowy figure, pinning the lamb on the killing table. His 
               knife hand sweeps up high, then holds... He turns TO CAMERA, 
               his face breaking into the light - and it is the face of Dr. 
               Lecter. He smiles his terrible smile at the young Clarice...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FBI DORM - PAY PHONE IN HALLWAY - NIGHT

               MOVING ANGLE - coming in very CLOSE on the adult Clarice's 
               face - shocked, devastated - as she stands alone by the 
               dangling receiver...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SHOWER STALL - FBI DORM - NIGHT

               CLOSE ON a shower head, as water suddenly blasts out. Clarice 
               moves INTO SHOT, as she scrubs her face and hair compulsively, 
               almost desperately, unable to get clean...

                                     ARDELIA (V.O.)
                         They found the ambulance...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CLARICE'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT

               Clarice is hunched on her cot, in a bathrobe, her hair wet. 
               The Buffalo Bill case file, a thick bundle, rests by her 
               feet. Ardelia hovers anxiously nearby.

                                     ARDELIA
                         In the parking garage at Memphis 
                         airport. The crew was dead. He killed 
                         a tourist, too. Got his clothes, 
                         cash... By now he could be anywhere.

               Clarice looks up. Her eyes are red-rimmed with exhaustion, 
               and something close to despair. She reads Ardelia's thought.

                                     CLARICE
                         No. He won't come after me.

                                     ARDELIA
                         Why not?

                                     CLARICE
                              (bitterly)
                         It would be rude. And he wouldn't 
                         get to ask any more questions...

               Ardelia sits beside her, touches her arm.

                                     ARDELIA
                         Clarice - you did the best anybody 
                         could have for Catherine Martin. You 
                         stuck your neck out for her and you 
                         got your butt kicked for her and you 
                         tried. It's not your fault it ended 
                         this way.

                                     CLARICE
                         The worst part - the thing that's 
                         making me crazy - is that Bill is 
                         right in front of me. Only I can't 
                         see him...
                              (touching the case 
                              file)
                         Lecter said, everything I need to 
                         catch him is right here, in these 
                         pages...

                                     ARDELIA
                         Lecter said a lot of things.

                                     CLARICE
                              (shakes her head)
                         He's here, Ardelia.

               Ardelia stares back at her.

               SOUND UPCUT - the low throb of a washing machine...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - ACADEMY DORM - NIGHT (VERY LATE)

               Clarice has spread out the case file across two washing 
               machines. Ardelia, cross-legged on a dryer, studies another 
               pile of forms. Nearby is their laundry basket, detergent 
               box.

                                     ARDELIA
                              (surprised)
                         Hey, is this Lecter's handwriting? 
                         She holds up the map, with its 
                         location markings for the kidnapping 
                         and body dump sites. Clarice takes 
                         it, looks.

               INSERT - THE MAP

               with newly inked words in Dr. Lecter's precise, elegant hand.

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         Clarice, doesn't this random 
                         scattering of sites seem overdone to 
                         you? Doesn't it seem desperately 
                         random - like the elaborations of a 
                         bad liar? Ta... Hannibal Lecter.

               NEW ANGLE - TWO SHOT

               as Clarice looks up at Ardelia, puzzled but excited.

                                     CLARICE
                         "Desperately random." What does he 
                         mean?

                                     ARDELIA
                         Not random at all, maybe. Like there's 
                         some pattern here...?

                                     CLARICE
                         But there is no pattern. There's no 
                         connection at all among these places, 
                         or the computers would've nailed it! 
                         They're even found in random order.

                                     ARDELIA
                         Well, except for the one girl.

                                     CLARICE
                              (beat)
                         What girl?

                                     ARDELIA
                         The one that was weighted down. Where 
                         is she...? Fred something.

               They search among the inserts. Clarice finds the graduation 
               photo.

                                     CLARICE
                         Fredrica Bimmel, from Belvedere, 
                         Ohio. The first girl taken, but the 
                         third body found... Why?

                                     ARDELIA
                         'Cause she didn't drift. He weighted 
                         her down.

                                     CLARICE
                         But why? He didn't weight the others.

               Clarice moves, on fire, unable to keep still.

                                     CLARICE
                         The first, what the hell did Lecter 
                         say about... "First principles," he 
                         said. Simplicity... What does this 
                         guy do, he "covets." How do we first 
                         start to covet? "We covet what we 
                         see -"

               She stops, turns. She grabs the photo of Fredrica from 
               Ardelia, stares at it. She looks up, trembling.

                                     CLARICE
                         "- every day."

                                     ARDELIA
                              (softly)
                         Hot damn, Clarice.

                                     CLARICE (V.O.)
                         He knew her...!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FBI BUILDING - OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR - DAY

               Clarice and Crawford are seated in front of Director Burke, 
               who's at his desk. Another chair is empty, because Krendler 
               is pacing. All four are nearing their boiling points.

                                     CLARICE
                         Maybe he lives in this, this 
                         Belvedere, Ohio, too! Maybe he saw 
                         her every day, and killed her sort 
                         of spontaneously. Maybe he just meant 
                         to... give her a 7-Up and talk about 
                         the choir. But then -

                                     KRENDLER
                         Starling -

                                     CLARICE
                         But then he had to cover up, make 
                         her seem just like all the rest of 
                         them. That's what Lecter was hinting!

                                     KRENDLER
                         The market in Lecter hints is way 
                         down, today, okay? I've got two good 
                         men dead in Memphis, and three
                         civilians. I've got -

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Who the hell's fault is -

                                     KRENDLER
                         - a U.S. Senator who's half out of 
                         her head because her daughter's going 
                         to be murdered today! And all because 
                         of your mind games with fucking 
                         Lecter!

                                     CRAWFORD
                         If you hadn't interfered, he'd still 
                         be in custody in Baltimore!

                                     BURKE
                         Jack -

                                     KRENDLER
                         You sent in a green recruit, with a
                         phony goddamn offer -

                                     CRAWFORD
                         You're just trying to cover your ass 
                         for letting him escape!

                                     BURKE
                         THAT'S ENOUGH! All of you...

               A long silence, as they all struggle to regain composure. 
               Crawford, who was at the point of striking Krendler, finally 
               retakes his seat. Burke looks sadly at Crawford and Clarice.

                                     BURKE
                              (very reluctantly)
                         Starling, I'm afraid I have no choice. 
                         You're suspended from the Academy.
                              (Crawford starts to 
                              interrupt)
                         Not another word!
                              (to Clarice)
                         This is pending a reevaluation of 
                         your fitness for the service. I 
                         promise you'll get a fair hearing.
                              (pause)
                         Jack... you're ordered to take 
                         compassionate leave. You'll spend 
                         the rest of the day briefing the 
                         AG's office, then transfer command 
                         of the task force, effective by 1800 
                         hours.
                              (beat)
                         I'm sorry, Jack... Go home. Take 
                         care of Bella.

               Clarice and Crawford stare back at him, drained. A long and 
               very painful silence. Not even Krendler looks happy.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SIDEWALK OUTSIDE FBI BUILDING - DAY

               Clarice and Crawford walk out slowly, stand there a moment, 
               not knowing what to say, not wanting to face each other.

                                     CLARICE
                         All his victims are women... His 
                         obsession is women, he lives to hunt 
                         women. But not one women is hunting 
                         him - except me. I can walk in a 
                         woman's room and know three times as 
                         much about her as a man would.
                              (beat)
                         I have to go to Belvedere.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         You heard them. I don't have that 
                         authority anymore.

                                     CLARICE
                         You do until six p.m.

               He stares at her sadly. He looks, for the first time, 
               defeated, old beyond his years.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Ohio is cold ground. Picked over, 
                         ten months ago. Our people worked 
                         it, so did the locals.

                                     CLARICE
                         But not from this angle. Not thinking 
                         he knew her. You've got to send me!

                                     CRAWFORD
                         I'm Bureau for 28 years, Starling. I 
                         won't disobey orders, not even now.

                                     CLARICE
                         But I just became a private citizen. 
                         I can go anywhere I want to.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         With ID and a gun...? Impersonating 
                         a federal agent is a felony.

                                     CLARICE
                         He's going to kill her, Mr. Crawford. 
                         This morning, or maybe at noon, but 
                         today, and Belvedere's our last 
                         chance. I'm flying there, right now, 
                         unless you stop me. You want my ID? 
                         Here - take it...

               He stares at her, a long moment. Catherine's life. Clarice's 
               passion, and future. His loyalty to the Bureau. Call it.

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (pulls out his wallet)
                         There's about $300 here... And a 
                         hotline code number. They'll patch 
                         you through to me, wherever I am.

               She raises her hand to him. She wants to touch him face, or 
               his neck, but can't. Finally she takes his money and card.

                                     CLARICE
                         Thank you.

               He watches, frightened for both of them, as she backs away, 
               smiles, then turns, racing towards the surveillance van.

               SOUND UPCUT - the scratchy recording of Fats Waller SINGING, 
               as we...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MR. GUMB'S CELLAR - DAY (DIM LIGHT)

               CLOSE ON the needle of the Victrola, on the spinning record, 
               as Mr. Gumb's fingers lift away. MUSIC continues in 
               background.

                                     MR. GUMB (O.S.)
                              (calling out)
                         Preeeeecious...!

               CLOSE ON the moth cage, as Mr. Gumb's fingers search through 
               the humus, and find a plump new cocoon, lifting it out. The 
               door of the cage is left open, and one or two of the adult 
               moths flutter out.

                                     MR. GUMB (O.S.)
                         Precious, come on Precious! Busy 
                         busy day today...

               CLOSE ON a clean towel, beside the sink. The cocoon is gently 
               placed in readiness alongside four shiny skinning knives.

                                     MR. GUMB (O.S.)
                         Momma's gonna be sooo beautiful!

               CLOSE ON a stainless steel Colt Python, with a six-inch 
               barrel, as the cylinder is spun, and the hammer gets a 
               practice cock. The metallic CLICK is deep and loud. A note 
               of alarm has entered Mr. Gumb's voice.

                                     MR. GUMB (O.S.)
                         You come here this minute, you little 
                         scamp!

               LOW ANGLE on Mr. Gumb, wearing the kimono, as he walks through 
               his sewing workroom. His back is to us; he is looking 
               anxiously under the furniture. He stops, straightens. 
               Genuinely scared.

                                     MR. GUMB
                         Precious...?

               LOW ANGLE - OVER THE PIT OPENING

               Towards Mr. Gumb, as he stops at one of the doorways of the 
               oubliette chamber. He stares inside; his face in shadows.

                                     MR. GUMB
                         Sweetheart...?

               From the distant bottom of the pit, we hear Catherine's voice.

                                     CATHERINE (O.S.)
                         She'd down here you sack of shit.

               Mr. Gumb's fist flies to his mouth, and he sags against the 
               doorframe. A little groan escaped him; the dog answers with 
               a series of YIPS.

               UPWARD ANGLE, FROM THE PIT BOTTOM

               as Mr. Gumb's dark shape leans cautiously over the edge.

                                     MR. GUMB
                         Precious, are you all right?

               REVERSE ANGLE ON CATHERINE

               crouched to one side, clutching the dog to her chest. Seeing 
               Mr. Gumb, the dog squirms frantically, BARKING.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Get me a telephone. Lower it down to 
                         me. Do it now, mister! I don't want 
                         to have to hurt this little dog.

               UPWARD ANGLE

               on Mr. Gumb, as, with a cry of fury, he whips the Colt from 
               inside his kimono. The muzzle gleams as he takes aim.

               Catherine yanks the dog up, into his line of fire, screaming 
               at him.

                                     CATHERINE
                         You shoot motherfucker you better 
                         kill me quick or I'll break her 
                         fucking neck, I swear to God!

                                     MR. GUMB (O.S.)
                              (wails)
                         Nooooooo!

               Tucking the dog under one arm, she grabs its muzzle, twisting 
               the head. The dog WHINES piteously.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Back off, you son of a bitch! Back 
                         off!

               UPWARD ANGLE

               as Mr. Gumb cries out again - a terrible, inarticulate scream 
               of rage and anguish. But then he slowly lowers his gun.

               REVERSE ANGLE

               On Catherine, as she maintains her grip.

                                     CATHERINE
                         That's better... Now get me a live 
                         telephone. Get a long extension and 
                         lower is down here... And you better 
                         do it fast, too, 'cause I think her 
                         leg's broken. She's in pain, mister, 
                         she needs a vet.

               MR. GUMB

               stares down at her, a long beat, breathing heavily.

                                     MR. GUMB
                         You think she's in pain? You don't 
                         know what pain is. But you're going 
                         to find out...

               And abruptly he vanishes. SOUND of his footsteps, rushing 
               off.

               CATHERINE

               begins shaking, hands and arms twitching uncontrollably. She 
               hugs the little dog tight to her chest, buries her face in 
               its fur, sobbing...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - BELVEDERE, OHIO - DAY

               HIGH ANGLE as a rented sedan pulls up to the curb, stops. 
               After a moment Clarice climbs out, a bit stiffly. Double-
               checking this address, she glances up from a folded street 
               map to -

               AN OLD, THREE-STORY WOODEN HOUSE

               in a row of similarly shabby homes, all backing onto a narrow 
               river. A path of boards, laid over mud, leads back along 
               this house towards the brown water. SOUND of hammering from 
               there.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BIMMEL HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY

               An awesome huddle of pigeon coops sprawls by the brackish 
               water. The birds' COOING mixes with the HAMMERING. A tall, 
               gaunt man in a knit cap is obsessively pounding nails into a 
               new coop.

               CLARICE

               approaches him, and the man lowers his hammer. He has red-
               rimmed eyes of watery blue. His face is deeply seamed.

                                     CLARICE
                         Mr. Bimmel...? 

               He stares back at her, warily.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BIMMEL HOUSE - STAIRCASE - DAY

               HIGH ANGLE - LOOKING DOWN as Mr. Bimmel leads Clarice up a 
               steep flight of steps. The bannister is worn, sags a bit.

                                     MR. BIMMEL
                         I don't know nothin' new to tell ya. 
                         The police been back here so many 
                         times already... Fredrica went into 
                         Columbus on the bus to see about a 
                         job. She left the interview OK. She 
                         never come home.

               Clarice pauses, at the landing, to look at a framed photo: 
               the familiar graduation portrait. Others pictures show 
               Fredrica as a young girl, toddler, infant - plump and hopeful 
               at each age.

                                     MR. BIMMEL
                         Her room's how she left it. Just 
                         shut the door when you're done.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FREDRICA'S BEDROOM - DAY

               CLARICE'S POV - MOVING SLOWLY as she takes in flowery chintz 
               curtains... posters of Madonna and Blondie... a twin bed, 
               with worn, stuffed animals on the pillow... a big sewing 
               machine in the corner.

               CLARICE

               turns, absorbing nuances. There is loneliness here, an echo 
               of desperation under this steeply pitches ceiling. A shrill 
               MEOW, and she looks down...

               BIG TORTOISESHELL CAT

               is rubbing against her ankles.

               CLARICE

               picks up the cat, scratches behind his ears. She glances up.

               IN A FULL-LENGTH MIRROR

               she and the cat stares back at their own reflection...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CLARICE

               sitting at the desk, turns the pages of a high school 
               yearbook. The cat is curled on her lap...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CLARICE

               kneeling by the old Decca record player, flips through LPs 
               and singles. The cat has wandered off...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CLARICE

               pulling a string to light up the closet. She is surprised 
               and intrigued to see an extensive wardrobe, groaning from 
               the rod. A shelf above the rod is stacked high with sewing 
               supplies, in clear plexiboxes. She flips through the hanging 
               clothes, pulls out one dress, on its hanger, for a closer 
               look.

               THE DRESS

               is very big, to fit Fredrica, but beautifully cut. Some of 
               the seams still look unfinished. She turns it around, sees a 
               blue tissue dressmaker's pattern still pinned to the back.

               FAVORING THE SEWING MACHINE

               as Clarice turns, looks towards it. She hangs the dress on 
               the closet door knob, crosses to sit at the machine. She 
               takes off its dust cover. She runs one hand over the cool 
               metal, as a taunting memory forms in her mind.

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         Billy wants to change, too, Clarice. 
                         But there's the problem of his size, 
                         you see...

               She turns, looks again at the unfinished dress. Suddenly she 
               straightens, her attention riveted by something...

               CLARICE'S POV

               On the printed pattern, down at the lower back of the outlined 
               dress, are two bold black triangles. We RUSH CLOSER to there 
               shapes, before jumping back to -

               CLARICE

               who stares at them, starting to tremble.

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         Even if he were a woman, he'd have 
                         to be a big one...

               IN FLASHBACK

               those missing triangles of skin on the dead girl's back, in 
               the funeral home in West Virginia...

               CLOSE ON CLARICE

               as she jumps to her feet, with a fierce joy.

                                     CLARICE

               Clarice paces, in an exuberant rush, amidst the worn

                         Mr. Crawford - out of real women! 
                         And he can sew, this guy, he's really
                         skilled. A dressmaker, or a tailor -

                         That's why they're all so big - 
                         because he needs a lot of skin! He 
                         keeps them alive to starve them awhile - 
                         to loosen their skin, so that -

                         Starling, we know who he is! And 
                         where he is. We're on our way now.

               Crawford sits at a communications console, with Burroughs, 
               in headphones, by his side. This forward section of the cabin 
               is crammed with hi-tech equipment, all lit up and WHIRRING. 
               Through a window we see clouds, part of the jet's wing.

                         be on the ground in 45 minutes with 
                         the Hostage Rescue Team. I'm back in 
                         charge, Starling. He's mine.

               INTERCUTTING

               as Clarice reacts; her happiness for Crawford is tinged with 
               disappointment at being so suddenly out of the hunt.

                                     CLARICE
                              (on phone)
                         Sir, that's great news. But how -

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Johns Hopkins finally came up with a 
                         name for us. We fed him into Known 
                         Offenders, and he came up cherries.
                              (takes a paper from 
                              Burroughs)
                         Subject's name is "Jamie Gumb," AKA 
                         "John Grant." Lecter's description 
                         was accurate, he just lied about the 
                         name.

               INSIDE THE JET - MOVING ANGLE

               from the rear of the cabin forward, as we slowly PASS the 
               twelve-man HRT. They're seated in full gear, hardshell armor, 
               quietly checking and rechecking their bulging cases of weapons - 
               silencer automatics, shotguns, stun grenades...

                         This Gumb's a real beauty. Slaughtered 
                         both his grandparents when he was 
                         twelve, and did nine years in juvenile 
                         psychiatric. Where, Starling, he 
                         took vocational rehab, and learned a 
                         useful trade...

                         Take a bow. Customs had some paper 
                         on his alias. They stopped a carton 
                         two years ago at LAX - live 
                         caterpillars from Surinam. The 
                         addressee was "John Grant." Calumet 
                         Power & Light's given us two possible 
                         residences under that alias. We're 
                         hitting one, Chicago SWAT's taking 
                         the other.

                              (eagerly)
                         Chicago's only about 400 miles from
                         here. I could be there in -

                                     CRAWFORD
                         No, Starling, there isn't time. And 
                         you've still got crucial work to do 
                         in Ohio. We want him for murder, not 
                         kidnapping. I'm counting on you to 
                         link him to the Bimmel girl, before 
                         he's indicted.

               Clarice tries hard to swallow her disappointment.

                                     CLARICE
                         Yes sir... I'll do my best.

                                     CRAWFORD
                              (pause; gently)
                         Starling - you've earned back your 
                         place in the Academy. We never 
                         would've found him without you, and 
                         nobody's ever going to forget that. 
                         Least of all me.

               CRAWFORD

               switches off, feeling bad for her. On the console near him, 
               the fax machine starts to CHATTER. He turns, looks.

               Clarice walks slowly across the yard, absorbing all this 
               news, before suddenly leaping into the air and pumping her 
               fist in triumph, with a happy yelp. Then she sees -

               staring at her in surprise. He sits by his coops, smoking.

               CLARICE

               somewhat embarrassed, crosses over to him.

                                     CLARICE
                         Mr. Bimmel... did Fredrica ever 
                         mention a man named Jamie Gumb, from 
                         Calumet City? Or John Grant?
                              (he shakes his head)
                         Did she know any men that sew?

                                     MR. BIMMEL
                         She sewed for everybody. Stores, 
                         ladies, whatever. I don't know about 
                         men.

                                     CLARICE
                         Who was her best friend, Mr. Bimmel? 
                         Who'd she hang out with?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               The FBI turbojet is parked, its gangway down. Crawford, 
               Burroughs, and the HRT squad, carrying their bags of weapons, 
               CLATTER rapidly down the metal steps...

                                     STACY (V.O.)
                         Freaked me out. Get your skin peeled 
                         off, is that a bummer...?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SAVING & LOAN - BELVEDERE - DAY

               STACY HUBKA - short, perky, early 20's - sits nervously at 
               her desk, talking to Clarice, who jots in her notebook. In 
               the background. beyond them, bank tellers, lines of waiting 
               customers, MUZAK.

                                     STACY
                         They said she was just rags, like
                         somebody -

                                     CLARICE
                         Stacy, did Fredrica ever mention a 
                         man named Jamie Gumb? Or John Grant?
                              (Stacy shakes her 
                              head)
                         Do you think she could've had a friend 
                         you didn't know about?

                                     STACY
                         No way. She had a guy, I'da known, 
                         believe me. Sewing was her life, she 
                         was really great at it. Poor Freddie.

                                     CLARICE
                         Did you ever work with her?

                                     STACY
                         Oh sure, me'n Pam Malavesi used to 
                         help her do alterations for old Mrs. 
                         Lippman. Lots of people worked for 
                         her, she had the business from all 
                         these retail stores? But she was 
                         like, totally old, it was more'n she 
                         could handle.

                                     CLARICE
                         Where does Mrs. Lippman live? I'd 
                         like to talk to her.

                                     STACY
                         She died. She went to Florida to 
                         retire, like two years ago? She dies 
                         own there.

               Clarice reacts, disappointed at the ending of this trail.

                                     STACY
                              (beat; shyly)
                         Is that a pretty good job, FBI agent?

                                     CLARICE
                         I think so.

                                     STACY
                         You get to travel around and stuff? 
                         I mean, better places then this?

                                     CLARICE
                         Sometimes you do.

                                     STACY
                         Freddie was so happy for me when I 
                         got this job. This - toaster 
                         giveaways, and Barry Manilow on the 
                         speakers all day - she thought this 
                         was really hot shit. What did she 
                         know, big dummy...

               Suddenly she's fighting tears. Clarice reaches to hug her.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - CALUMET CITY, ILLINOIS - DAY

               WIDE ANGLE on what appears to be, at first, a calm, ordinary 
               neighborhood of working class two- and three-story houses. 
               But the street is strangely quiet, deserted.

               After a few moments, we become aware of movement - armed, 
               dark-clad figures creeping swiftly and in silence from shrubs 
               to garage corners, from parked cars to porches, appearing 
               and then disappearing...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MR. GUMB'S CELLAR - DAY (DIM LIGHT)

               CLOSE ON Mr. Gumb, as he settles a big pair of infra-red 
               night-vision goggles over his eyes. Moths flutter past his 
               face. His mouth is set in a grim line...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               An HRT cop, prone beneath a hedge, is joined by a 2nd HRT 
               Cop, who throws himself to the grass beside him. They both 
               take aim with their scoped rifles at -

               TELEPHOTO ANGLE (WITH RIFLE CROSSHAIRS)

               The front door of a big, nearby, split-level house...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MR. GUMB'S CELLAR - DAY (DIM LIGHT)

               CLOSE ON a fuse box, as Mr. Gumb reaches in, flips a switch. 
               The lights go out. SOUND of a second switch, and the cellar 
               is bathed in a green glow...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A little boy, riding his tricycle in his driveway, is suddenly 
               startled to find himself staring into the grim face of -

               A MEMBER OF THE HRT

               crouched by his garage, armed to the teeth. As the little 
               boy starts to cry, the cop pulls him into the shadows, 
               covering his mouth.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MR. GUMB'S CELLAR - DAY (GREEN LIGHT)

               Mr. Gumb, in his kimono and goggles, creeps silently through 
               his workrooms - knees bent, painted toes places ever so 
               delicately, the Colt held aloft - as more moths flutter past 
               him in the eerie light...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. STREET IN CALUMENT CITY - DAY

               A florist's van turns the corner, comes slowly down the street 
               and stops at the curb in front of the split-level. The driver, 
               in a gray deliveryman's uniform and cap, climbs out of the 
               cab, walks briskly to the panel door, on the street side of 
               the van, and slides it open. He leans in, comes out with a 
               long, thin red-ribboned floral box, starts calmly towards 
               the house...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               MR. GUMB'S POV - MOVING ANGLE on the top of the oubliette, a 
               glowing green circle in the dark, as it draws closer and 
               closer... and then Catherine comes INTO VIEW, at the bottom 
               of the pit. She is crouched, exhausted, staring straight up 
               at him - but she can't see him in this infra-red darkness. 
               Precious is curled into her stomach, asleep. The futon is up 
               to Catherine's waist, but there's a clear shot at her head 
               and neck.

               MR. GUMB

               Looking down at her, smiles...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. STREET IN CALUMET CITY - SUSPECT'S HOUSE - DAY

               MOVING ANGLE on the "deliveryman," seen from behind, as he 
               mounts three steps to the split-level's front porch. Tucked 
               into the small of his back if a 9 mm. automatic.

               CRAWFORD AND BURROUGHS

               have slipped out of the van, and are crouched behind it now, 
               with drawn guns, watching tensely as -

               THE "DELIVERYMAN"

               settles the floral box in the crook of his left arm, reaches 
               out with his right hand towards the buzzer...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MR. GUMB'S CELLAR - DAY (GREEN LIGHT)

               Slowly, savoring the moment, Mr. Gumb aims the big Colt, 
               which is already cocked, using both hands... He is just about 
               to squeeze the trigger, when we hear his DOOR BUZZER, 
               surprisingly loud and close by. He turns, startled, and sees -

               DUSTY BLACK METAL BOX

               the extension buzzer, mounted high on the wall, which is 
               making the hideous, grating JANGLE. It finally stops, but 
               not before waking Precious, who starts frantically BARKING, 
               off screen, as -

               MR. GUMB

               raises his gun again, spinning back towards -

               HIS POV - THE PIT BOTTOM

               where Catherine, hearing but still not seeing him, quickly 
               yanks the futon over both herself and the dog. Instantly the 
               two of them become one squirming, indistinguishable mass.

               MR. GUMB

               bites his lip, his aim wavering, as he can't decide where to 
               safely place his shot. The maddening BUZZER sounds again, 
               even more insistently, and he cries out with frustration and 
               fury. But as the BUZZER continues, he reluctantly uncocks 
               his gun, looking up angrily towards his front door...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MR. GUMB'S FRONT DOOR - DAY

               The door opens, on a chain, and Clarice peers in, smiling.

                                     CLARICE
                         Good afternoon... I wonder if you 
                         could help me. I'm looking for Mrs. 
                         Lippman's family?

               Mr. Gumb frowns out at Clarice. For the first time ever, we 
               get a well-lit view of his bland, pale-eyed moon of a face.

                                     MR. GUMB
                         They don't live here anymore.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. FRONT DOOR OF SUSPECT'S HOUSE - CALUMET CITY

               The "deliveryman" yanks a 12 lb. sledgehammer from the floral 
               box, swings it with all his might against the door knob, 
               blowing it through as -

               MOVING ANGLE

               Crawford and Burroughs race towards the door, guns up...

               Mr. Gumb starts to close the door, only to have Clarice push 
               back against it, politely but firmly. She holds up her ID.

                                     CLARICE
                         Excuse me, but I really do need to 
                         talk to you. This was Mrs. Lippman's 
                         house. Did you know her?

                                     MR. GUMB
                              (beat)
                         Just briefly. What's the problem, 
                         Officer?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A bedroom window disintegrates as a flash grenade is shot 
               through it, EXPLODING on the floor. An instant later, a black-
               clad HRT cop dives through the shattered glass, rolls across 
               the floor, comes up on one knee swiveling his sawed-off 
               shotgun...

                         I'm investigating the death of

                         Mr. Gordon, did you know Fredrica 
                         when she worked for Mrs. Lippman?

                                     MR. GUMB
                         No. Wait... Was she a great, fat 
                         person? I may have seen her, I'm not 
                         sure...

               MOVING ANGLE as Burroughs moves quickly down a hallway and 
               enters the living room, where Crawford is standing, with his 
               gun held down by his side, surrounded by several other cops. 
               Burroughs shakes his head: Nothing here...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MR. GUMB'S FRONT HALLWAY - DAY

               Mr. Gumb glances briefly over his shoulder, towards his 
               kitchen, then turns back to Clarice with a smile.

                                     MR. GUMB
                         Mrs. Lippman had a son, maybe he 
                         could help you. I have his card 
                         somewhere. Do you mind stepping 
                         inside, while I looks for it?

                                     CLARICE
                         Thanks.

               ANGLE FAVORING THE COLT PYTHON

               which rests on a counter, just inside the open kitchen 
               doorway. THROUGH this doorway, we watch as Mr. Gumb, at the 
               end of his front hall, slips the chain. Clarice enters, 
               closing the door behind her.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. FRONT YARD OF SUSPECT'S HOUSE - CALUMET CITY - DAY

               MOVING ANGLE - towards the front door, as frustrated HRT 
               cops file out of the empty house, rifles slung across their 
               shoulders.

               WE PICK OUT CRAWFORD

               walking across the grass towards the van, when all at once 
               he stops in his tracks, shaken by a sudden flash of intuition.

               CAMERA RUSHES VERY CLOSE

               on his stricken face...

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Clarice.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MR. GUMB'S PARLOR - DAY

               Clarice, pulling her notebook from her shoulder bag, glances 
               around the musty-looking room.

                                     MR. GUMB (O.S.)
                         That horrible business, I shiver 
                         every time I think about it...

               Overstuffed furniture, porcelain figurines. One archway onto 
               the front hall, another onto a dining alcove, and through 
               there, the kitchen. Mr. Gumb is crossing to a rolling desk, 
               raising the top. He bends over, begins poking through cubby 
               holes. His tone is casual, neutral.

                                     MR. GUMB
                         Are they close to catching somebody, 
                         do you think?

                                     CLARICE
                         I think we may be, yes.

               Mr. Gumb stiffens, almost imperceptibly. His back is to her, 
               as he continues opening drawers, rustling papers.

                                     CLARICE
                         Mr. Gordon, did you take over this 
                         place after Mrs. Lippman died?

                                     MR. GUMB
                         Yes. I bought the house from her, 
                         two years ago.

                                     CLARICE
                         Did she leave any records here? Tax 
                         or business records? Maybe a list of 
                         employees?

               CLOSE ON MR. GUMB'S BACK

               as he continues his rummaging.

                                     MR. GUMB
                         No, nothing at all. Has the FBI 
                         learned something? Because the police 
                         here don't seem to have the first 
                         clue...

               Out of the folds of his kimono crawls a Death's-head Moth. 
               It creeps slowly to the center of his back, raising its wings.

                                     MR. GUMB
                         Do you have his description yet, or 
                         some fingerprints...?

               CLARICE

               unaware, is still glancing around the room. For several 
               agonizing moments, we think she won't see the moth - but 
               then she turns, does see it, and her eyes freeze. A beat of 
               pure fear. A tremendous struggle to keep her voice calm.

                                     CLARICE
                         No... no, we don't.

               Very carefully, she drops her notebook back into her bag, 
               lowers the bag to the floor. With her fingertips she brushes 
               back the edge of her blazer, loosening its drape.

               MR. GUMB

               turns back towards her cheerfully, holding out a business 
               card.

                                     MR. GUMB
                         Ahhh. Here's that number.

               CLARICE

               keeps her distance. They are about ten feet apart.

                                     CLARICE
                         Good, thank you. Mr. Gordon, do you 
                         have a phone I can use?

               MR. GUMB

               is about to reply when the moth suddenly flies up from behind 
               him, flutters past his face. He turns, looking at it. He 
               looks back at Clarice, his mouth still open.

               HER EYES

               are unmoving, locked on his.

               HIS EYES

               stare back at her, widen. And they know each other.

                                     MR. GUMB
                              (softly)
                         In the kitchen. I'll show you.

               CLARICE

               whips her gun out, gripping it in both shaking hands.

                                     CLARICE
                         Freeze!

               MR. GUMB

               slowly tilts his head to one side, smiles at her.

               CLARICE

               tries to force more authority into her voice.

                                     CLARICE
                         Okay... Okay, Mr. Gumb, you're under 
                         arrest. Down on the floor, hands and 
                         legs spread, move it.

               MR. GUMB

               turns, then all at once, in two quick steps, he is gone, 
               disappearing into his dining alcove, then kitchen.

               CLARICE

               hesitates, just a split second, to shoot him in the back - 
               and then it's too late.

                                     CLARICE
                         Shit!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MR. GUMB'S KITCHEN - DAY

               Clarice hurries inside, moving low, swivelling her gun.

               HER POV - MOVING

               The kitchen is empty. To one side, a door still shuddering 
               on its hinges...

               CLARICE

               rushes to this - pauses - then elbows the door aside, aiming 
               her gun down -

               AN EMPTY STAIRWELL

               brightly lit, leading to the cellar. Two doors facing the 
               bottom, both open. No sign of Mr. Gumb.

               CLARICE

               hates this, hates this, which door, it's a trap, what to do: 
               she is very scared, but suddenly hears -

               The distant SCREAM of Catherine Martin, somewhere down there 
               in that killing maze.

               CLARICE

               rushes through the doorway, and down the stairs.

               BEHIND HER, ON THE KITCHEN COUNTER there's an empty space; 
               the Colt Python is gone.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MR. GUMB'S CELLAR - DAY

               MOVING ANGLE - WITH CLARICE - hurrying down the steps. More 
               SCREAMS; they seem to be coming from the left door. Clarice 
               goes that way, entering a brick-walled passage - pipes over-
               head, naked bulbs. The lighting, though dim, is incandescent; 
               Mr. Gumb has switched off his infra-red system. Clarice comes 
               to a T-shaped intersection, stops. Another SCREAM, again to 
               her left, and the BARKING of a dog...

               CLARICE

               follows her gun around the corner, looking right.

               EMPTY PASSAGEWAY

               but doors opening off it - he could be lurking behind any of 
               them. She looks left... sees an opening onto some kind of 
               chamber. The noises are LOUDER, coming from there.

               CLARICE

               moves cautiously towards this chamber...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. OUBLIETTE CHAMBER - DAY (DIMLY LIT)

               Clarice moves in, hugging the wall, gun swivelling...

               HER POV - MOVING

               the open top of the pit... beyond it, the other two doorways, 
               opening onto this room - Jesus, he could come through either 
               one of them, or come up behind her... She moves to the pit, 
               looks down, very briefly, sees Catherine SCREAMING, 
               hysterical, and a little white dog BARKING...

               CLARICE

               kneels, staring up from one door to another, she can't cover 
               them all, she's totally exposed - and what's a dog doing 
               there?

                                     CLARICE
                         FBI, Catherine, you're safe.

                                     CATHERINE
                         Safe, SHIT, he's got a gun! Getmeout.
                         GET ME OUT!

                                     CLARICE
                         You're all right! Where is he?

                                     CATHERINE
                         Get me out!

                                     CLARICE
                         I'll get you out! Just be quiet so I 
                         can hear. Shut that dog up.
                              (still swivelling)
                         Is there a ladder? Is there a rope?

                                     CATHERINE
                         I don't know! Get me out!!

                                     CLARICE
                         Catherine. Listen to me. I have to 
                         find a rope. I have to leave this
                         room, just for a minute, but -

                                     CATHERINE
                         NOOOOO! You fucking bitch don't you 
                         LEAVE ME down here, DON'T YOU - YOU 

                                     CLARICE
                         Shut UP!
                              (then, louder)
                         The other officers will be here any 
                         minute! you're perfectly safe now!

               Ignoring Catherine, whose shouts turn to sobs, she backs 
               away, turns, picks one of the other doorways, moves into it 
               quickly.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. NEW PASSAGEWAY - DAY (DIMLY LIT)

               CLARICE'S POV - MOVING down this passageway, towards a new 
               room... pausing at the doorway, straining to hear... no sound 
               except Catherine's CRYING, not in the background, and 
               Clarice's own RAPID BREATHING. Then she crouches -

               LOWER ANGLE - bursts forward, through the doorframe, 
               sidestepping...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. WORKROOM - DAY (DIMLY LIT)

               Clarice weaves back and forth, half-crouched, gun out, back 
               to the wall. Her face glistens with sweat, as she takes in...

               HER POV - MOVING NERVOUSLY

               Mr. Gumb's sewing machine... his swivel chair... the old 
               Victrola... Big moths are crashing into the light bulbs, 
               overhead; they're everywhere. Suddenly, from just behind 
               her, a CLICK and a HUM, and -

               CLARICE

               spins, almost shoots, before seeing -

               A SMALL REFRIGERATOR

               with its thermostat just switching ON.

               CLARICE

               gasps for breath, fighting for calm. She turns again, slashing 
               her free hand at the moths, moving quickly on...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SKINNING ROOM - DAY (DIMLY LIT)

               Clarice moves past the mannequins, all of them naked now... 
               then quickly past the huge Chinese armoire, ready to shoot 
               into it. Its doors yawn open; it is empty except for several 
               padded hangers... She moves on, past the big sink, with its 
               DRIPPING faucet... the counter, with its gleaming knives... 
               the rows of chemical jars. At the end of this room is

               A CLOSED DOOR

               Clarice starts to open it, then hesitates. Looking around, 
               she seizes a wooden chair, wedges it under the door know, 
               sealing off this section of the cellar. With her back thus 
               defended, she turns, softly retracing her steps.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. WORKROOM - DAY (DIMLY LIT)

               Passing again through the workroom, Clarice pauses, seeing a 
               half-curtained door, to one side, that she had previously 
               skirted. She crosses to the door, listens and hears no sound 
               inside, takes a deep breath and reaches for the knob. She 
               twists it, and, as it turns, shoves hard and follows her gun 
               inside, all in one quick move...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BATHROOM - DAY (BRIGHTLY LIT)

               An old-fashioned bathroom: tiled floor, sink, toilet - and a 
               big, free-standing tub. An opaque shower curtain, suspended 
               from an oval ring, hides whatever might be inside.

               CLARICE

               centers her gun on the curtain, at chest height, and yanks 
               it aside with her left hand. No one standing there. Something 
               lower down catches her eye.

               She leans in, stares more closely, not understanding, at 
               first, that she's seeing -

               FEMALE HAND AND WRIST

               sticking up from the tub, which is filled with hard red-purple 
               plaster. The hand is dark and shriveled, with pink nail polish 
               and a dainty wristwatch. As -

               CLARICE

               is reacting with horror to this sight, the lights go out, to 
               be replaced, a split-second later, by the eerie green glow 
               of Mr. Gumb's infra-red system. Clarice cries out, turns 
               blindly, reaching for the door, can't find it, free hand 
               clawing desperately into what is, for her, utter darkness. 
               SOUND of Catherine KEENING again, in the far distance. Clarice 
               stumbles, goes to her knees, rights herself, finally clutches 
               the door frame...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MR. GUMB'S WORKROOM - DAY (GREEN LIGHT)

               Clarice emerges from the bathroom in a half-crouch, arms 
               out, both hands on the gun, extended just below the level of 
               her unseeing eyes. She stops, listens. In her raw-nerved 
               darkness, every SOUND is unnaturally magnified - the HUM of 
               the refrigerator... the TRICKLE of water... her own terrified 
               BREATHING, and Catherine's faraway, echoing SOBS... Moths 
               smack against her face and arms. She eases forward, then 
               stops again, listens... She eases forward again, following 
               her gun, and creeps directly in front of, and then past -

               MR. GUMB

               who has flattened himself against a wall, arms spread like a 
               high priest, Colt in one hand. He wears his goggles and 
               kimono, and under that - draping down over his naked arms, 
               like some hideous mantle - his terrifying, half-completed 
               suit of human skins. This is an exquisite moment for him - a 
               ritual of supreme exaltation. He smiles at Clarice as, 
               completely unaware, she moves beyond him, exposing her back. 
               Very slowly and quietly he steps out behind her, taking his 
               gun in both hands, aiming...

               CLOSE ON

               the Colt Python as - in SLOW MOTION - his thumbs cock the 
               hammer, the SOUND registering as a LOUD METALLIC CLICK, and -

               CLARICE

               spins, still in SLOW MOTION, flame already leaping from her 
               gun muzzle, as we see -

               THE TWO FIGURES

               almost at point-black range, guns ROARING hugely, one FLASH 
               from Mr. Gumb, and one two three four FLASHES from Clarice, 
               overlapping his, and then, as the ECHOES crash deafeningly -

               CLOSE ON CLARICE - LOW ANGLE -

               with NORMAL SPEED RESTORED, as the side of her face hits the 
               floor, and she is gasping, stunned by the noise and flames; 
               there is blood on her check, and an ugly powder burn, but 
               she ignores them, twisting to yank her speedloader from her 
               jacket pocket, locking it blindly onto her gun's cylinder, 
               reloading, right in front of her face, then rolling onto her 
               stomach, aiming her gun upward again, blinking her dazzled 
               eyes, straining to locate him in the darkness... Where is 
               he, where...? Then, as the ECHOES finally fade, she hears 
               something else - a tortured, sucking, WHISTLE from perhaps 
               eight feet away...

               MOVING ANGLE - WITH CLARICE

               as she crawls forward, on her elbows, following her gun, 
               until it bumps against Mr. Gumb's shoulder. He is lying on 
               his back, chest a bloody mess. She slides her muzzle against 
               his head, hard, but he doesn't move; another shot isn't 
               needed. He stares upwards, through his goggles, bloody lips 
               working. He tries to speak, but cannot. One hand reaches 
               slowly upwards, the fingers twitching, as if to seize 
               something, overhead... Then a final, ghastly groan, his hand 
               drops, he is dead. Clarice feels for a pulse at his neck, 
               making sure. Then, and only then, does she permit herself to 
               roll over, collapsing onto her back beside him.

               OVERHEAD ANGLE

               down at the two faces - intimately close together, like lovers 
               on their pillow. Then, as we PULL SLOWLY AWAY, we see that 
               her staring eyes, and his dead gaze, are both locked onto -

               A DEATH'S-HEAD MOTH -

               perched on an infra-red bulb, overhead, its wings pumping 
               slowly.

               SOUND UPCUT - wailing SIRENS, many excited VOICES, as we...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. MR. GUMB'S HOUSE - DUSK

               The front porch of the tall Victorian house is bathed in a 
               glare of TV lights, police and ambulance flashers. Cars and 
               vans and even a firetruck choke the street; cops, reporters, 
               EMS workers and curious civilians swarm around the ineffective 
               barricades. The BUZZ of their voices goes even higher as

               CLARICE

               dazed, her face bandaged - comes out of the house, walking 
               protectively beside Catherine, who is wheeled on a gurney.

               They are followed out by uniformed cops, then two firemen 
               with an extension ladder. Catherine, blinking in confusion, 
               is still clutching the little dog, and refuses to give her 
               up even as she's trundled into an ambulance. Clarice sways 
               with exhaustion; everyone seems to be shouting at her at 
               once, pulling her sleeve. She tries to fight free of them, 
               desperate for a familiar face.

               AN OHIO HIGHWAY PATROL CAR

               pulls up, stops, and Crawford climbs out of the back seat. 
               He makes his way anxiously through the press of bodies, 
               stopping when he sees Clarice.

               THEY LOOK AT ONE ANOTHER

               for a long moment, Crawford choked with pride for her, with 
               sorrow for her ordeal, with love, but unable to find any 
               words. And then he does.

                                     CRAWFORD
                         Starling... your father sees you.

               And then all at once she is sobbing, her knees giving way, 
               but he is there to catch her, he is hugging her fiercely. 
               HOLD ON them for a long beat.

                                     DIRECTOR BURKE (V.O.)
                              (over loudspeaker)
                         Congratulations! You are now officers 
                         of the Federal Bureau of 
                         Investigation...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. GROUNDS OF THE FBI ACADEMY - WEEKS LATER - DAY

               The forty members of Clarice's class, resplendent in their 
               best dark suits and dresses, rise, cheering themselves, then 
               turn happily to wave to their audience, as APPLAUSE mounts. 
               Beyond them, on a gaily tented platform, the Director stands 
               behind his podium.

               CLARICE AND ARDELIA

               look at one another solemnly. Ardelia holds up both fists, 
               in a power shake, and Clarice taps them with her own. She is 
               radiantly beautiful in a navy dress and pearls, the thin 
               scar on her cheek almost healed. Ardelia turns, waving towards 
               the crowd, the Clarice's thoughts are elsewhere. She turns, 
               searching among the dignitaries on the platform, till she 
               locates

               CRAWFORD

               who smiles back at her with quiet pride, and offers a little 
               salute.

               CLARICE

               grins - more happy than we've ever seen her - then turns to 
               wave towards the crowd with the others.

               MOVING ANGLE

               over the admiring sea of spectators, several hundred of them, 
               still rising from their folding chairs, APPLAUDING in 
               celebration of these special young people, this perfect, 
               sunlit day.

               SOUND UPCUT - rock music, laughter - as we...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. ACADEMY DORM - REC ROOM - THAT NIGHT

               A LOUD party is underway - food, beer, dancing - as the new 
               grads celebrate ferociously. Ardelia weaves her way through 
               the crowded room, reaches Clarice, who is flanked by her 
               special guests - Pilcher and Roden, the two ardent scientists. 
               Ardelia has to shout at Clarice over the din.

                                     ARDELIA
                         Agent Starling! Telephone!

                                     CLARICE
                              (surprised)
                         Agent Mapp! Thank you!

               She nods to Pilcher, leaves them. Roden, who is quite happily 
               drunk, grabs the startled Ardelia around the waist.

                                     RODEN
                         Hel-lo, gorgeous! Let's get down.

               Ardelia looks at Pilcher, confused.

                                     PILCHER
                         Just ignore him. He's not a Ph.D.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Clarice picks up the dangling pay phone, speaks happily.

                                     CLARICE
                         Starling.

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         Well, Clarice, have the lambs stopped 
                         screaming...?

               She freezes, stunned by the familiar voice. Then she turns, 
               waving frantically towards

               ARDELIA

               who is just inside the rec room door, at the end of the hall, 
               lost in conversation with Pilcher and Roden. Ardelia glances 
               at her briefly but misunderstands, waves cheerfully back.

                                     DR. LECTER (V.O.)
                         Don't bother with a trace, I won't 
                         be on long enough.

               CLARICE

               turns back, gripping the phone more tightly.

                                     CLARICE
                         Where are you, Dr. Lecter?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. A CLEAR NIGHT SKY

               Very beautiful, glittering with countless stars.

                                     DR. LECTER (O.S.)
                         Where I have a view, Clarice...

               MOVING DOWN

               we see a rolling lawn, a curving bay. Boats ride at anchor, 
               lights shimmering...

                                     DR. LECTER (O.S.)
                         Orion is looking splendid tonight, 
                         and Arcturus, the Herdsman, with his 
                         flock...

               DR. LECTER

               smiles into his mobile phone. He is stretched out on a 
               lounger, on a tiled patio, languidly paring an orange with a 
               penknife. His appearance is quite altered - a beard, glasses, 
               lighter hair. He's has some cosmetic surgery, as well.

                                     DR. LECTER
                              (into phone)
                         Your lambs are still for now, Clarice, 
                         but not forever... You'll have to 
                         earn it again and again, this blessed 
                         silence. Because it's the plight 
                         that drives you, and the plight will 
                         never end.

                                     CLARICE
                         Dr. Lecter -

                                     DR. LECTER
                         I have no plans to call on you, 
                         Clarice, the world being more 
                         interesting with you in it. Be sure 
                         you extend me the same courtesy.

                                     CLARICE (V.O.)
                         You know I can't make that promise.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Goodbye, Clarice...
                              (and then, softly)
                         You looked - so very lovely today, 
                         in your blue suit.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DORM HALLWAY - NIGHT

               As Clarice reacts, the fill weight of his words sinking in.

                                     CLARICE
                         Dr. Lecter... Dr. Lecter...!

               But only a DIAL TONE comes from the phone. She is still 
               staring at her receiver, in shock, as we -

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

               EXT. THE MOONLIT PATIO

               Dr. Lecter sighs, sets his phone down, then rises. Popping 
               an orange section into his mouth, he turns towards the 
               brightly lit house. Stepping delicately over the sprawled 
               body of a uniformed security guard, he walks in through open 
               french doors.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. A BOOKLINED STUDY

               In a swivel chair, amidst the wreckage of his papers and 
               books, is the writhing figure of Dr. Frederick Chilton. The 
               extreme intricacy of his bindings recalls Dr. Lecter's own 
               former restraints. His screams are muffled by the tape over 
               his mouth; he stares at Dr. Lecter like a rabbit trapped in 
               headlights.

               DR. LECTER

               Considers him for a genial moment, then raises the little 
               pen-knife. His eyes are twinkling.

                                     DR. LECTER
                         Well, Dr. Chilton. Shall we begin?

                                                                   FADE OUT

     SISTER ACT

     FADE IN:

     INT. ST. ANNE'S ACADEMY - AKRON, OHIO - CLASSROOM
     We are in a parochial school classroom, in the late 
     Sixties.  The children all wear uniforms and sit at little 
     desks.  SISTER IMMACULATA stands at the front of the room; 
     she is a middle-aged nun, very severe.  The children are 
     all terrified of her.

                               SISTER IMMACULATA
               Who can name all the Apostles?  Yes?

     ANGLE ON CHRISTINE CARTER

     A thirteen-year-old girl sitting at a desk.  She raises 
     her hand.

                               SISTER IMMACULATA
               Christine?

                               CHRISTINE
               Sister, may I be excused?

                               SISTER IMMACULATA
               Christine...

                               CHRISTINE
               It's an emergency.  Real bad.

     Sister Immaculata nods, pursing her lips.  Christine 
     stands and heads for the door.

     
                                                          CUT TO:

     INT. GIRLS ROOM

     Christine is now in the deserted St. Anne's girls room. 
     She is standing on tiptoes, looking in the mirror.  She has 
     taken her hair out of its neat barrettes; she is combing it 
     out.  She applies lipstick.

     Christine reaches into her schoolbag; she pulls out a 
     stack of glittery bracelets and slips them on.  She 
     unbuttons the top few buttons of her stiff white blouse.  
     She sprays herself with dime store cologne.

                                                          CUT TO:

     EXT. HALLWAY

     Christine opens the girls' room door; she looks both ways.  
     No one is around; she saunters down the hall.

     Page 2.

     ANGLE ON A DOOR MARKED BROOM CLOSET
     Christine opens this door.  She looks into the closet. 
     There is a very nervous thirteen-year-old BOY waiting for 
     her inside.

                               CHRISTINE
               Hi, Jimmy.

     Christine slips inside the closet and closes the door 
     behind her.

     ANGLE ON SISTER IMMACULATA

     Striding down the hall, with a bloodthirsty look in her 
     eye, and a nasty-looking wooden ruler in her hand.  She 
     flings open the broom closet door,

     ANGLE ON CHRISTINE AND JIMMY

     in the broom closet.  Jimmy's face is covered with 
     lipstick.  Christine's hair is awry.  The couple has 
     clearly been making out.

                               SISTER IMMACULATA
                             (outraged)
               Miss Christine Carter!  Again!  Don't 
               you know what happens to girls like you?  
               Don't you know what they become?

     INT. CHRISTY'S APARTMENT - ANGLE ON A LARGE, TATTERED 
     POSTER-NIGHT (TODAY)

     Taped over a crack on a wall.  The poster shows a 
     glittering CHRISTY VAN CARTIER:  singing star of a fifth-
     rate Vegas lounge.  Christy wears tight spangles and a 
     major wig on the poster.  She has clearly lived up, or 
     down, to all of Sister Immaculata's expectations.

     The CAMERA PANS through the dark bedroom in which the 
     poster hangs; a neon sign flashes outside the window, 
     casting a red and blue haze over the premises.  A dressing 
     room table is cluttered with dozens of bottles of nail 
     polish and makeup, and garish clothing and flashy jewelry 
     are scattered everywhere.

     We hear the movement of BED SPRINGS as someone sits up in 
     the dark.

                               CHRISTY'S VOICE
               Come on, Vince -- hold me a minute.

                               VINCE'S VOICE
               I'd love to. babe -- but I've got to go.  
               It was great.  Like usual.

                               CHRISTY'S VOICE
               It was twenty minutes.  Like usual.

     Page 3.

                               VINCE'S VOICE
               The best.

     VINCE LAROCCA stands at the mirror, adjusting his clothing 
     and checking his hair.  Vince is a powerful, charismatic 
     man who rules an organized crime empire with personal 
     magnetism and threat.  Vince's hold over Christy is 
     obvious, if unfortunate; he can seem expansive and generous 
     one minute, ruthless and dangerous the next.

                               VINCE
                             (half to Christy, half 
                             to the mirror)
               You are something else.

     Christy turns on a lamp and lights a cigarette.

                               CHRISTY
               Come on -- stay.  Just a little.  We can 
               talk, I'll get a pizza.  Pizza in bed, 
               we'll have fun.  And you still haven't 
               told me what happened.  What did she say?

                               VINCE
               What did who say?

                               CHRISTY
               Who?  The other woman.  Your wife.

     Vince turns to face Christy, turning on the charm.

                               VINCE
               You are so damn sexy.

                               CHRISTY
               Vince...

                               VINCE
               How did I get so lucky?  What is it now, 
               five years we've been together?  Who do I 
               thank?

                               CHRISTY
                             (not buying it)
               Today was the deadline, Vince.

     Vince sits on the bed.  He takes Christy's hand, and 
     kisses it.

                               VINCE
               I want us to be together.  Like people.  
               Honest, decent people.  In the eyes of 
               God.  Babe, today... I went to 
               confession.

                               CHRISTY
               You did what?

     Page 4.

                               VINCE
               For the first time in I don't know how 
               long.  I wanted everything done right. 
               Open and above board.  I told Father 
               Antonelli I was in love.  I told him it 
               was a special love, for all the ages.

                               CHRISTY
                             (starting to fall for 
                             it)
               You said that?  And what did he say?  
               Did he say you could leave her?  Did he 
               say we'd be happy?

                               VINCE
                             (looking deep into her 
                             eyes)
               He said that if I got a divorce I'd burn 
               in Hell.  For all eternity.

     Vince kisses Christy's hands again and drops turns away 
     and starts putting on his shoes.

                               CHRISTY
               What?
                             (outraged)

                               VINCE
               You want me to go against a priest?  Get 
               excommunicated?  You think I'm nuts?

                               CHRISTY
               You bastard!

                               VINCE
                             (trying to calm her)
               We can still see each other.  Just like 
               always.  It's a different kind of sin. 
               Smaller.

                               CHRISTY
               You pig!

     Vince backs off, and starts searching for his jacket.

                               VINCE
               Babe, it's not me!  I love you!  It's 
               God!

                               CHRISTY
               You lying sleazeball!  The best years of 
               my life!  What am I, garbage?  Am I lint?

     Vince ducks as Christy throws an ashtray at him, and it 
     smashes against the wall.

                               VINCE
               You're upset.  I understand.  I should 
               go.  I hate to.

     Page 5.

     A CLOCK-RADIO hits the wall beside Vince's head.

                               CHRISTY
               Get out of here!  And never come back!

     A LAMP hits the wall, as Vince dodges it.  He makes a 
     phone gesture with his hand.

                               VINCE
               I'll call.

     Vince kisses two fingers, and blows the kiss to Christy. 
     He leaves.

     Christy is left standing on the bed, holding a 
     particularly garish stuffed animal she was about to hurl.  
     With Vince gone she slumps to the bed, cradling the stuffed 
     animal. She is caught between tears and rage.

                                                          CUT TO:

     EXT. LAS VEGAS - NIGHT

     ANGLE on various neon Vegas landmarks -- the Golden 
     Nugget, Caesar's Palace, Bally's, etc.  Scrunched in 
     between two larger hotels and casinos is the MOONLIGHT 
     HOTEL AND CASINO.  The Moonlight isn't all that small, it's 
     just seen better days.

     INT. LOUNGE - NIGHT

     A spotlight hits a solitary figure on a small stage.  The 
     man is caped and dramatic, but not especially talented; an 
     Elvis impersonator who's just a shade off in voice, looks 
     and style.

                               ELVIS
               Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.  Are 
               you lonesome tonight?  Welcome to the 
               Moonlight Hotel and Casino's incredible 
               Platinum Oldies Spectacular.

     Backstage, there's still a look of resolve in Christy's 
     eye as she waits to go on with MICHELLE and TINA, her back-
     up singers.

                               MICHELLE
               But you can't quit.  What'll happen to 
               us?
                             (to Tina)
               Tell her she can't quit.

                               TINA
               I told her.  She stuck pantyhose in my 
               mouth.

     Onstage, Elvis glances into the wings to be sure the 
     Ronelles are ready.

     Page 6.

                               ELVIS
               Please welcome our own girl group 
               extraordinaire, our beehives of beauty --
               the fabulous Ronelles!

     Elvis disappears.  The spotlight hits Christy, who wears a 
     high beehive wig and a sequinned, early Supremes-style 
     gown.  Michelle and Tina wear matching gowns and wigs.  The 
     band begins a doo-wop vamp.

                               CHRISTY
               Oh, girls.

                               RONELLES
               Yes, Betty?

                               CHRISTY
               This prom is a real drag.

                               RONELLES
               Oh-huh.

                               CHRISTY
               Oh my!
                             (gasping)

                               RONELLES
               What is it, Betty?

                               CHRISTY
               Look at that.  Get a gander.

                               RONELLES
               Oh my!
                             (sighing)

                               CHRISTY
               He's so dreamy.  He's like... a Greek 
               god.  He's the cutest guy here.    He's 
               boss.  He's fab.  He's...

                               RONELLES
               Yes, Betty?

                               CHRISTY
                             (singing)
               HE'S SO FINE.

                               RONELLES
               D00-LANG, DOO-LANG, D00-LANG.

                               CHRISTY
               WISH HE WAS MINE.  THAT HANDSOME BOY 
               OVER THERE, THE ONE WITH THE WAVY HAIR.

     As they sing, their moves and gestures are carefully 
     choreographed in vintage girl group style.

     Page 7.

     A lot of talent and hard work has clearly gone into the 
     number.  While Christy does her best, her singing voice is 
     not on a par with those of the other Ronelles.

     The lounge itself is practically empty, except for a few 
     drunken Shriners and a couple of college kids.  POLICE 
     LIEUTENANT EDDIE MULCAHY sits at a ringside table with his 
     eyes locked on Christy.  An easygoing charmer, Eddie gives 
     her a wink, but she responds with an up-yours look and a 
     turn to the other half of the room as the song continues.

     INT. DRESSING ROOM - LATER

     A small, cramped room with cracked plaster walls and a 
     sputtering fan for ventilation.  Christy has her own 
     dressing table and mirror, and the Ronelles share a table a 
     few feet away.  Clothing and costumes hang on nails or are 
     draped over chairs as the girls change into street wear.

                               CHRISTY
               Screw this dump.  It's a roach motel 
               with sequins.  Every guy I meet is either 
               married, a cop, or a lush from Des 
               Moines.

                               MICHELLE
               But what about us?

                               TINA
               You taught us the act.  The songs, all 
               the moves.

                               CHRISTY
               And where did it get me?  I'm stuck in 
               this rathole!  You're holding me back, 
               just like Vince!  I should be headlining!

     A pock-faced weasel of a man named JOEY opens the door and 
     leans into the room.

                               CHRISTY
               What do you want?  This is a private 
               area!  Get lost!

                               JOEY
               You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen.

                               CHRISTY
               Then stop trying to memorize it.  Hit 
               the road.

     Joey takes a step into the room and sets a box on the 
     chair near Christy.

                               JOEY
               From Vince.

     Page 8.

                               CHRISTY
               His ashes?

                               JOEY
               With love.

     Joey leaves.  Michelle and Tina hover around the box, very 
     excited.  They pick it up, trying to tempt Christy.

                               MICHELLE
               From Vince! With love!

                               TINA
               Michelle and Tina can't restrain 
               themselves: they open the box.  Inside is 
               a rather gaudy fur coat.  Michelle and 
               Tina are impressed.

                               MICHELLE
               It's a fur!

                               TINA
               It's new!

                               CHRISTY
               It's a bribe.  Five years of my 
               goddamned life!

                               MICHELLE
               So you earned it!

                               TINA
               Vince owns the casino!  Cash in

                               CHRISTY
               I should throw this in his facet

     There's a KNOCK on the door, and Tina opens it.  
     Lieutenant Eddie Mulcahy enters.  Christy is not pleased.

                               CHRISTY
               Oh, Jesus.  What is going on here?
                             (to heaven)
               Why me?  Whose dog did I kill?

                               MICHELLE
               Hi, Lieutenant.

                               TINA
               Hello, Eddie.

     Eddie picks up the coat.

                               EDDIE
               From Vince?  What a guy.  Doo-lang, doo-
               lang.

                               CHRISTY
               At least he's not a cop.  At least he 
               can afford a decent gift.

                               EDDIE
               I used to buy.you,..stuff.  On your 
               birthday .  When we were seeing each 
               other.

                               CHRISTY
               Yeah, like what?  Quilted coat hangers, 
               that your mother picked out?  Lottery 
               tickets?  A travel iron?

                               EDDIE
               So I don't shop.

                               CHRISTY
               'Cause you're always out, arresting 
               people.  Making trouble.  I don't know 
               why I went out with you in the first 
               place, it was embarrassing!  I couldn't 
               hold my head up, I used to tell people 
               you were a security guard!

                               EDDIE
               Oh, yeah? Well, how do you think I felt?  
               You were singing in bowling alleys back 
               then.  I told people you were a hooker!

                               MICHELLE
               Calm down, you two.  It's always like 
               this.

                               EDDIE
               Yeah, well, now, she goes out with a' 
               better class of people.  Vince Laflocca.

                               CHRISTY
               He's a businessman.

                               EDDIE
               A what? When are you qonna wake up?

                               CHRISTY
               When are you gonna get off my case?  
               Have you got a search warrant?  What do 
               you want -- cheap thrills?

                               EDDIE
               Information, baby.  I thought maybe 
               somebody around here might have a 
               conscience.

                               CHRISTY
               Think again!  And get out of here.

     Page 10.

                               EDDIE
               I'm going.  My regards to Vince,   And 
               the Mrs.

     Christy hurls a jar of cold cream at Eddie's head.  He 
     ducks, and the jar hits the door.

                               EDDIE
               Ladies.

     Eddie leaves.  Christy is standing, absolutely furious.

                               CHRISTY
               That's it!  I'm not taking it from him, 
               and I'm not taking it from Vince!  From 
               now on, it's all about me!  And if I 
               can't spend it, drink it, or sleep with 
               it -- it's gone.  Like Sister Immaculata 
               used to say, "Life is short, and then you 
               fry."  So long, girls -- see you in 
               church!

     Christy grabs the mink and heads out the door.

     INT. VINCE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     ERNIE SCHMIDT sits across the enormous mahogany desk from 
     Vince.  The young man's throat is dry; he's sweating 
     bullets.  The presence of Joey the weasel and WILLY, a 
     brutal thug, increases Ernie's tension.

                               VINCE
               Ernie Schmidt.  How long you been with 
               us, Ernie Schmidt?

                               ERNIE
               Three years, Mr. LaRocca.  One behind 
               the bar, two as croupier.

     Vince gestures to the lush office and its furnishings.

                               VINCE
               Ernie, you know what's important to me?  
               What counts?  It's not all this.  This is 
               '-- what?  Frosting.  Loyalty.  That's me, 
               Ernie.  That's home.

     Vince gestures to Joey, who takes out a revolver and 
     points it at Ernie's head.

                               VINCE
               You ain't been loyal, Ernie.  What did 
               you tell the cops?

     Ernie's eyes open wide with denial as the gun comes closer 
     to his temple.

     Page 11.

     INT. HOTEL LOBBY

     Holding the coat, Christy waits by the elevator.  It 
     arrives; she gets in.

     INT. VINCE'S OFFICE

     The interrogation continues.

                               ERNIE
               I didn't tell the cops anything. I 
               swear.

                               VINCE
               Joey?

     Joey slams Ernie on the side of the head with the gun.

     INT. CORRIDOR

     Christy steps out of the elevator and faces a maze of 
     office cubicles with half-wall partitions.  The floor is 
     deserted and dark as she makes her way through the 
     cubicles.

     INT. VINCE'S OFFICE

     Vince is standing over Ernie, holding his head up by the 
     hair.

                               VINCE
               Who else, Ernie?  Who else was in on it?

                               ERNIE
                             (moaning)
               No one...

                               VINCE
                             (dropping Ernie's head 
                             in disgust)
               Why am I wasting my time?

     INT. EXECUTIVE CORRIDOR

     Beyond the cubicles, Christy strides down a lush corridor 
     to an executive suite.  She tries the knob, but finds the 
     door locked.  Pulling a key from her purse, she unlocks the 
     door to the suite and enters a large outer office with a 
     reception area and doors to several inner offices.  She 
     tosses the key onto the receptionist's desk.

                               CHRISTY
               Won't need that anymore.  Ta-ta.

     Crossing to Vince's office, Christy squares her shoulders 
     and narrows her eyes with anger as she reaches for the 
     doorknob.  She pauses for a second, and then doubles her 
     resolve.

     Page 12.

     INT. VINCE'S OFFICE

                               VINCE
               Do it.
                             (to Joey)

     ANGLE on the door to the office, which opens.  Christy 
     appears, with the mink coat in her arms.

                               CHRISTY
               Stuff this up your...

     A GUNSHOT is heard, 0.S.  Christy's eyes widen, and her 
     jaw drops, at what she has just witnessed.

     ANGLE on the office.  Ernie is slumped in the chair, dead. 
     Joey stands over him, holding the revolver.  Joey, Willy 
     and Vince stare at Christy.

                               VINCE
               Babe.
                             (icy calm)

     Christy tries to speak; she can't.

                               VINCE
               Christy.  Is there a problem?  With the 
               coat?

     Christy glances around the room; she doesn't move.  She 
     quickly sizes up the situation.  She tries to appear 
     matter-of-fact. unaffected by what she's just seen.

                               CHRISTY
               No... it's fine. 

                               VINCE
               Yes?

                               CHRISTY
               Thanks.  A lot.

                               VINCE
               Is that why you came up here, Christy? 
               To thank me?

                               CHRISTY
               Sure.

                               VINCE
               And to say you're sorry.  About this 
               afternoon.  And the things you said. 
               Forgotten.  Completely.  Do you 
               understand?  Forgotten.

                               CHRISTY
                             (catching the subtext)
               Right.  Yeah.  Forgotten.

     Page 13.

     Vince crosses the room, to Christy.  He takes her hands in 
     his, and kisses them.

                               VINCE
               That's my girl.  My girl in mink.  Will 
               you be home?  Soon?

     Christy kisses Vince, quickly.

                               CHRISTY
               Right.  I'll be... at the apartment.  
               Call me.  Thanks.  Again.

     Christy reaches for the doorknob, without looking at the 
     door.  She fumbles a bit.  She finds the door.

                               CHRISTY
               Mink.  Wow.

     Christy walks backwards, out the door.  She turns; she is 
     gone.

                               JOEY
               Vince -- is she... okay?

                               VINCE
               Maybe.
                             (considering this)

                               WILLY
               I mean, won't she talk? She seemed kind 
               of upset.

                               VINCE
               She did.
                             (making a decision)
               Bring her back.  Now.  For a talk.

                               JOEY 
               And if she runs? 

                               VINCE
                             (icy)
               Take care of it.

     With guns drawn, Willy and Joey run after Christy.

     INT. RECEPTION AREA

     Christy, clearly terrified, is walking quickly away from 
     Vince's office.  She passes through a glass door which 
     leads to the cubicle area.

     LONG SHOT of the cubicle area, which resembles a darkened 
     maze.  Christy hears Joey approaching; she runs into the 
     cubicle area.

                               JOEY
               Christy?  He only wants to talk to you!

     Page 14.

     ANGLE on Christy, crouched behind a half-wall.  She is 
     clutching the coat.

                               WILLY
               Christy?

     There is a stuffed toy, a "Garfield the Cat," attached to 
     the wall near Christy, with suction cups.  Christy tries to 
     pull the cat's feet off the wall, very quietly.

                               JOEY
               Christy?

     Christy finally just yanks the cat off the wall.  She 
     hurls it as high and as far as she can, to the opposite end 
     of the room.

     ANGLE on the flying stuffed cat.

     Joey sees the blur of the cat; he SHOOTS it, and the cat 
     explodes.

                               JOEY
               Come on, Christy!  There's no place to 
               go!

     Christy steadies herself against a Xerox machine.  She 
     accidentally activates the machine, which lights up and 
     starts HUMMING.

     ANGLE on Willy, as he hears the Xerox machine.  He quickly 
     moves toward the SOUND.

     Willy reaches the Xerox machine; the area is deserted.  He 
     starts moving quickly down the aisle   A chair, the kind on 
     casters, comes rolling out of one of the cubicle doorways; 
     the chair hits Willy and he falls.

     Christy runs out of the cubicle; Willy is on the floor, 
     struggling to get up.  As Christy sprints away, Willy 
     SHOOTS at her.  He misses, but a glass partition SHATTERS.

     Christy runs for an open elevator, but it has been 
     summoned from another floor and the doors are beginning to 
     close. She runs even faster.  A BULLET whistles past her 
     ear and hits the back wall of the elevator.  She reaches 
     for the doors a moment too late, and the elevator is gone.

     Christy scrambles to the door beside the elevator and runs 
     into a stairwell as two more BULLETS bite pieces out of the 
     door.

     INT. STAIRWELL

     Taking the stairs three at a time, Christy is flying, 
     still clutching the mink.  The thugs are gaining on her.  A 
     BULLET hits metal and RICOCHETS off several walls and 
     steps.

     Page 15.

     At the next landing, Christy opens the door and ducks into 
     a corridor.

     INT. CORRIDOR

     Exhausted but powered by adrenaline, Christy sprints past 
     doors to the end of the hall, still with the mink.  Joey 
     appears from the stairwell just as Christy ducks into a 
     supply room.

     INT. SUPPLY ROOM

     Christy shoves a cleaning cart aside and wades through a 
     pile of dirty linen.  Joey opens the door just as Christy 
     dives head first into the laundry chute.

     INT. LAUNDRY CHUTE

     Christy, lying atop the mink, flies through the chute like 
     a subway train through a tunnel.

     INT. BASEMENT

     The chute spits Christy out like a bullet into a huge bin 
     of dirty linen.  Two workers glance around as they load 
     large washing machines with laundry.  Christy climbs out of 
     the bin and dashes for a door.  Working in a hotel, the 
     workers have seen everything.

     INT. LAUNDRY CHUTE

     Joey flies through the chute.

     INT. BASEMENT

     Joey suddenly flies into the bin.  He climbs out with his 
     gun in sight.

                               JOEY
               Which way?

     The workers point to the door, and Joey rushes across the 
     room.  One of the workers is now wearing the mink coat.

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     Joey comes out of the hotel and finds an empty street.  He 
     looks in every direction, but the nearby streets have 
     swallowed Christy into safety for the moment.

     EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

     The central offices of the Las Vegas Police Department.

     INT. MULCAHY'S OFFICE

     Eddie's office is a glassed-in area set in the middle of 
     the station's main floor.

     Page 16.

     Christy is huddled in a chair, surrounded by Eddie and two 
     other detectives, CLARKSON and TATE.

                               CHRISTY
               Right between the eyes!  Down and out! 
               The guy was gone!  I... I couldn't 
               believe it!

                               EDDIE
               You couldn't believe it?  Vince the 
               Prince?

                               CHRISTY
               I never said he was an altar boy, okay?  
               But he sent his goons after me!  They 
               tried to kill me!  I'm not kidding!

                               CLARKSON
               Tough break.  Whoa.

                               EDDIE
               What did you expect?  Vince is as dirty 
               as they come.  We've been finding bodies 
               around here for years.

                               CHRISTY
               I don't know anything about bodies!  I 
               mean, he didn't bring it home.  He was 
               good to me... sometimes.  He was sweet. 
               He took care of me.  Who am I supposed to 
               go out with?  He owns a casino.  He let 
               me sing.

                               EDDIE
               He didn't do you a favor.

                               CHRISTY
               Screw you!

                               TATE
               Come on, she'll sing great.  When she 
               sings for us.

                               CHRISTY
               Sing -- like testify?  Are you nuts?  I 
               just want you to protect me!  You're 
               cops!

                               TATE
               Busy cops.  We don't have time to be 
               bodyguards for anyone who comes in here 
               with some cockamamie story.  Mink coats 
               and laundry chutes.

                               CLARKSON
               Unless, of course, you're willing to 
               testify.

     Page 17.

                               CHRISTY
               What is this, some squeeze play?  Can't 
               you just protect me without any strings?

     The three detectives move in closer now and really apply 
     the pressure.

                               EDDIE
               We could put you into our witness 
               protection program.

               A hiding place. 

                               CLARKSON
               A new identity.

                               EDDIE
               But you'd have to agree to testify.  The 
               whole nine yards.

                               CHRISTY
               And if I don't?

                               EDDIE
               Then-you run.

                               TATE
               You wait.

                               CLARKSON
               You listen for the footsteps.

                               EDDIE
               Then one day they find you.

                               TATE
               They open a window.

                               CLARKSON
               It's ten flights up.

                               TATE
               Ten flights down.

                               CHRISTY
               Ten flights?

                               EDDIE
               You'd lose.  You'd die.  All over the 
               sidewalk.  And into the street.

                               CHRISTY
               All right!  I get the picture!  I'll do 
               it!  I'll testify!

                               EDDIE
                             (to Tate)

     Tate leaves.  Christy looks to Eddie for a bargain now.

                               CHRISTY
               Okay, here's what I want.  I know about 
               this stuff.  A five-star hotel.  With 
               room service.

                               EDDIE
               Maybe Hawaii.

                               CLARKSON
               Diamond Head.

                               CHRISTY
               Yeah.  And I'll need a new look.  Like a 
               disguise.

                               EDDIE
               Maybe Armani.

                               CLARKSON
               No -- Calvin Klein.

                               CHRISTY
               For sportswear.  And a limo.  And my 
               hair -- up?

                               CLARKSON
               It could work.

                               EDDIE
               Jesus, what do you think this is --
               Wheel of Fortune?  Let me spell it out 
               for you.  You have to hide like you don't 
               even exist.  You have to get so far 
               hidden away that you never see sunlight.

                               CHRISTY
                             (confused)
               Okay -- no limo.

                               EDDIE
               No nothing.

                               CHRISTY
               What're you gonna do, put me in a bag 
               and bury me?

                               EDDIE
               I'm gonna put you in the last place on 
               Earth that Vince would ever look for you.

     Eddie smiles.  Christy doesn't like the sound of this at 
     all a

     INT. STAINED CLASS WINDOW - DAY

     Jesus delivers the Sermon on the Mount in vibrant red, 
     blue and green stained glass.  An ORGAN plays a hymn -- 
     badly.  Notes are missed, skipped over and mutilated.

     PAN DOWN to a procession of nuns who march into a chapel 
     at the ancient St. Katherine's Convent.  The organ isn't 
     getting any better, and we see it is being played by SISTER 
     ALMA, a seventy-year-old nun with arthritis and a hearing 
     aid.  Apparently the hearing aid is malfunctioning, because 
     Sister Alma doesn't seem to realize how badly she's 
     playing.

     As the last nun in the procession enters the chapel, she 
     closes the door behind her.  Across the lobby, the front 
     door opens and Eddie enters with a very reluctant Christy.

                               CHRISTY
                             (to Eddie)
               I hate you.  I totally hate you.

                               EDDIE
               Safest place in the world.  You think 
               Vince would look for you here?

     As Christy looks around the lobby, various religious 
     artifacts loom at her; we see them from her terrified P0V. 
     ANGLE on a crucifix, casting an ominous shadow, a stack of 
     hymnals, and a large, framed Sunday School-style portrait 
     of St. Katherine.  Christy shudders.

                               CHRISTY
               Nuns, Eddie.  There are nuns here. 
               Everywhere.  It's crawling with 'em.

                               EDDIE
               It's a convent.  All you have to do is 
               shut up, behave yourself, and get along.

                               CHRISTY
               With nuns?  With rulers?  No way.  I'm 
               gonna go back, work things out with 
               Vince.

     Christy turns to head back to the entrance, but Eddie 
     catches her arm.

                               EDDIE
               Vince has put out a contract on you.  A 
               hundred grand.  You've seen him in 
               action.

     Christy searches his eyes for a lie, but realizes he's 
     telling the truth.

                               CHRISTY
               But... but Vince loves me.  How could 
               he... I mean, five years...

     Page 20.

                               EDDIE
               And one bullet.  That's all it's gonna 
               take.

                               CHRISTY
                             (suddenly scared)
               But Vince has contacts all over the 
               place!  This is San Francisco!  They'll 
               be looking for me!

                               EDDIE
               Everywhere but this little hole-in-the-
               wall convent.  Nobody knows you're here 
               but me.  We're trying to get a quick 
               court date.  A month, maybe two, tops. 
               I'll spring you as soon as I can.

                               CHRISTY
                             (panicking)
               I can't stay here!  I'll crack up! 
               Eddie, what am I gonna do?

                               EDDIE
               Pray.
                             (smiling)

     From inside the chapel, the CHOIR begins to sing a hymn --
     horribly.  The voices don't blend, and individual notes are 
     real migraine material.  Christy looks aghast.  Eddie urges 
     her into a corridor, and she follows.

     INT. MOTHER SUPERIOR'S OFFICE

     The office is bare and austere.  MOTHER SUPERIOR sits at 
     her desk with her hands folded.  Like all the nuns at the 
     convent, she wears the traditional full-length habit and 
     wimple.

     Mother Superior is in total command of all she surveys, 
     and she seldom raises her voice or her blood pressure as 
     she rules.  Control is her passion; within the walls of the 
     convent, she has created a world she can trust because it's 
     a world she controls.

               But Mother Superior is not in control at 
               this particular moment.  BISHOP GEORGE 
               O'HARA stands before her with a majestic 
               presence and some bad news.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Absolutely not.  I am very sorry, but 
               no.

                               O'HARA
               We can save this young woman's life, and 
               imprison a parasite -- all in one 
               gesture.

     Page 21.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               But she's been exposed to the underside 
               of life.  She is the underside of life.

                               O'HARA
               And therefore an ideal prospect for 
               rehabilitation.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               We're a small convent, Bishop.  Surely 
               there are... more appropriate shelters.

                               O'HARA
               Your small convent is in danger of 
               closing, Reverend Mother.  The Las Vegas 
               Police Department has offered to make a 
               generous financial donation.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               But, Bishop...

                               O'HARA
               St. Katherine's is a Benedictine Order. 
               You have taken a Vow of Hospitality.  To 
               all in need.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               I lied.

                               O'HARA
               I know.
                             (smiling)

     Mother Superior's jaw locks.  She realizes she is stuck 
     with the situation and will have to control it as best she 
     can.  There is a KNOCK at the door, and Eddie and Christy 
     enter.

                               O'HARA
               Welcome, Lieutenant.  Everything is in 
               order.

                               EDDIE
               Aces.  Bishop -- maybe a cup of coffee, 
               down at the corner?

     The thought of being left alone with Mother Superior 
     panics Christy, like a child left in the principal's 
     office.

                               CHRISTY
               Hey, you're not leaving me alone...

                               O'HARA
                             (reassuringly)
               You're never alone in this house, my 
               child.

     Eddie touches her gently on the arm.

     Page 22.

                               EDDIE
               One month, two tops.  Behave yourself.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Bishop...
                             (a last-ditch attempt)

                               O'HARA
                             (opening the door to 
                             leave)
               Lieutenant?

                                                          CUT TO:

     EXT. THE CONVENT - A FEW SECONDS LATER

     Eddie and Bishop 0'Hara are leaving, by the convent's 
     front door.  As they exit, they hear the CHOIR, singing 
     horribly. They both wince at the sound, and then chuckle.

     INT. MOTHER SUPERIOR'S OFFICE

     Christy is pacing, outraged at her new situation.

                               CHRISTY
               A convent?  They put me in a convent? 
               What's the problem?  Wasn't there any 
               more room in Hell?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
                             (very calm)
               What is your full name?  Your Christian 
               name?

                               CHRISTY
               Mother Theresa.  Gandhi.  Don't you 
               understand?  This is all a mistake.  I'm 
               the good guy.  I'm the witness.  And I'm 
               being punished!

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Your name?

                               CHRISTY
               Christy.  Christy Van Cartier.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Enough joking.

                               CHRISTY
               That's my real name!  Currently I'm a  
               singer.  Sort of.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Very well.

                               CHRISTY
               Oh my God.  This isn't happening, tell 
               me this isn't happening.  It's a 
               nightmare, I'm back at St. Anne's!

     Page 23.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               St. Anne's?

                               CHRISTY
               Parochial school.  Akron.  St. 
               Android's.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               You were unhappy?

                               CHRISTY
               I was expelled!  When I was fifteen?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               The reason?

                               CHRISTY
               Beats me!  What do you think?  Smoking! 
               Heavy petting, without a chaperone. Heavy 
               petting, with the chaperone.  And wearing 
               a black bra, under my uniform.  The demon 
               bra.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               I see.

                               CHRISTY
               You see?  You see?  I have to get out of 
               here   I have to make a phone call.  
               Don't you get  it?  I'm in a convent!  
               You're a nun!

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
                             (very stern)
               Sit down.

                               CHRISTY
               What?

     Mother Superior rises.  She is an extremely imposing 
     woman. 

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Sit.

     Christy sits in a wooden chair across from Mother 
     Superior.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Miss Van Cartier. 

                               CHRISTY
               What?
                             (belligerent)

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Your cigarette -- out.

     Christy inspects her cigarette.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
                             (ruefully)
               It has come to pass.

                               CHRISTY
               What?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               I joined this convent some thirty years 
               ago.  At that time, the world knew some 
               measure of peace.  And hope.  Our order 
               was a beacon of hospitality, to families, 
               to children, to a neighborhood filled 
               with promise.  And, as the years have 
               passed, I have watched that promise 
               destroyed.  Drugs.  Gangs.
                             (staring at Christy's 
                             outfit) Spandex.  And. 
                             so I have made this 
                             convent an oasis, a 
                             retreat from horror. 
                             And now that horror has 
                             invaded these sacred 
                             walls.

                               CHRISTY
               Are you talking about me?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               And all those like you.

                               CHRISTY
               You mean black people?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Absolutely not.  I mean the wicked.  The 
               heedless.  And their Las Vegas 
               concubines.

                               CHRISTY
                             (very suspicious) 
                             What's a concubine?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Check your driver's license.

     Christy stands, facing off with Mother Superior.

                               CHRISTY
               Fine.  Got it.  Look, the way I see it, 
               I'm stuck here, right?  I mean, I'm here 
               or I'm target practice.  So here's the 
               deal -- I don't bug you, you don't bug 
               me.  I'll catch up on some sleep, watch 
               some tube, lay back and lay low.  So just 
               get me a key and show me to my room, and 
               do not disturb.  Capisce?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
                             (suspiciously 
                             gracious)
               Of course.  But it's almost lunch.

     Page 25.

                               CHRISTY
               Cool.  Is there a menu?  Or buffet?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Before we do, you might like to freshen 
               up.  And you'll certainly want to change

                               CHRISTY
                             (sniffing her clothes, 
                             the same outfit she's 
                             had on since the night 
                             at Vince's office)
               Deal.

     INT. CONVENT CHANGING ROOM

     A small room, with a sewing machine, some bolts of fabric, 
     and several wooden cabinets.  There is a wooden screen in a 
     corner, marking a changing area.  Christy is behind the 
     screen; we hear her, but do not see her,  Mother Superior 
     stands beside the screen, catching the various items of 
     clothing which Christy tosses to her.

                               CHRISTY (O.S.)
               How about a robe?  One of those big 
               terry cloth jobs, with like embroidery on 
               the pocket.  "Guest of St. Katherine's"

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Would you like that?

     Mother Superior takes Christy's skirt and blouse, and 
     tosses them down a chute marked "INCINERATOR."

                               CHRISTY (O.S.)
               You should hand-wash that blouse, and 
               send somebody out for some things.  I 
               look good in reds, purples, hot pink --
               and shoes.  Five-inch heels.  Fuck-me 
               pumps.  Oh, man -- sorry.   'Scuse my 
               mouth.

     Mother Superior carries Christy's lacy bra at the end of a 
     ruler; it goes down the incinerator.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Excused.  Open the cabinet to your left. 
               You will find appropriate attire.

                               CHRISTY (O.S.)
               Can do.

     INT. CHAPEL

     A group of nuns are praying, their heads bowed.  They hear 
     a muffled SCREAM, from elsewhere in the convent. They look 
     up, puzzled.

     Page 26.

     INT. CONVENT CHANGING ROOM

     Christy is standing before a full-length mirror, staring 
     at herself, in complete shock.  She now wears a habit and 
     wimple.  Mother Superior is doing final adjustments on the 
     wimple.

                               CHRISTY
                             (almost unable to 
                             speak)
               No!  No!  I can't do this!

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Normally dressed, you are a sore thumb, 
               and you endanger us all.  While you are 
               here, you will conduct yourself as a nun.  
               Only I shall know who, and what, you 
               truly are.  You will not disrupt the 
               convent.  You will not influence the 
               Sisters with your colorful street talk. 
               You will draw no attention to yourself in 
               any way.

                               CHRISTY
                             (furious, in 
                             disbelief)
               But look at rites  Look at this!  I'm a 
               nun!  I'm invisible!  I'm a penguin!

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               As of now, and until you leave, you are 
               Sister Mary Clarence.

                               CHRISTY
                             (outraged)
               Mary Clarence?  Like a guy?  Like a dumb 
               guy?

     INT. CONVENT HALLWAY - A MINUTE LATER

     Mother Superior is striding down the hall.  Christy is 
     beside her, trying to get the hang of her new outfit.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               The Mary is in deference to the Holy 
               Mother, the Clarence in honor of Saint 
               Clarence Loyola.  There are three vows 
               that every nun must accept.  The vow of 
               poverty...

                               CHRISTY
                             (pulling out her 
                             pockets)
               No problem.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               The vow of obedience.

                               CHRISTY
               Like to who?

     Page 27.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               And the vow of chastity.

                               CHRISTY
               I'm outta here.

     Christy starts to leave; Mother Superior grabs her by the 
     wimple

     INT. CONVENT DINING HALL

     A large, whitewashed gothic room, with oak beams and a 
     crude iron chandelier.  There is a long, central wooden 
     table, with rough wooden benches.

     The convent's population is standing around the table in 
     silence.  There are about thirty nuns in all.

     Mother Superior moves to the head of the table, with 
     Christy following her.  She motions for Christy to stand at 
     her right.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Good afternoon, Sisters.  I apologize 
               for my tardiness.  I would like you to 
               welcome a new member of our order, Sister 
               Mary Clarence.

     ANGLE on SISTER MARY ROBERT, the nun standing beside 
     Christy.  Sister Mary Robert is naive and mouse- like, but 
     very sweet.  She has only been at the convent a few years; 
     she wears the simpler habit of a novice.  She sneaks a look 
     at Christy.  Her eyes widen, and then she resumes staring 
     at her hands.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Mary Clarence comes to us from a 
               somewhat more progressive convent.  She 
               is eager for a more disciplined life, and 
               will make every effort to conform to our 
               ways.

     Everyone sits, including Christy.  SISTER MARY PATRICK, a 
     nun seated at the middle of the table, waves her hand. Mary 
     Patrick is extremely cheerful, a truly upbeat person.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Yes, Mary Patrick?

                               MARY PATRICK
               Reverend Mother, on behalf of the 
               sisters, I'd like to welcome Mary 
               Clarence to St. Katherine's.

     ANGLE on Christy, looking thoroughly disgusted. 

     Page 28.

                               MARY PATRICK
               As part of our welcome, I've had a 
               little thought, just for fun.  Could we 
               have our new friend offer today's 
               blessing?

     ANGLE on the nuns, watching Christy.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
                             (reluctantly)
               Very well.  Mary Clarence, rise please.

     Christy stands up slowly, aghast.

                               CHRISTY
               A blessing?  Like, for lunch?

     ANGLE on Mary Patrick, beaming.  She and the other nuns 
     bow their heads.

                               CHRISTY
                             (trying to recall a 
                             blessing)
               For what we are about to receive...

     So far, so good.  Mother Superior has one eye open.

                               CHRISTY
               may the Lord... prepare us and... watch 
               us and... walk through the valley and be 
               our shepherd and... to the republic for 
               which it stands... God bless us every 
               one, hallowed be thy name.  Hallelujah.  
               Ave Maria. Boyardee.  Amen.

     ANGLE on the nuns, staring at Christy. Mother Superior 
     rises, very quickly.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Sisters, for the rest of the day we 
               shall declare a Vow of Silence.

                               CHRISTY
               A what?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Surely you are familiar with this 
               practice, Mary Clarence.  Only when our 
               lips are silent, can our prayers truly be 
               heard.

                               CHRISTY
               Silence?  No talking?  All day?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Until sundown.

     Page 29.

                               CHRISTY
                             (mouthing the words. 
                             without speaking aloud)
               Oh my God.

     Christy reaches for a piece of bread.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               And Mary Clarence?

     Christy looks up.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               As a new member of our order, I think 
               you might also enjoy a ritual fast.

                               CHRISTY
                             (mouthing the words)
               A what?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               A fast.  To remind us of the poor, of 
               those who must endure without enough to 
               eat.

                               CHRISTY
                             (mouthing)
               No food?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
                             (taking away Christy's 
                             plate)
               No food.  Not until sundown.

     ANGLE on Christy, clutching her fork, hungrily watching 
     the other nuns eat.

     EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

     Vince leaves the police station with his henchmen, Joey 
     and Willy, and LARRY NARREN, an attorney.  Vince is 
     steaming as they walk through the parking lot.

                               VINCE
               They grilled me for six hours in there. 
               And my hotshot lawyer -- where the hell 
               were you?

                               LARRY
               It takes time, Vince.  Slow and steady. 
               We've been through this before.

     Vince reaches his car.  As Joey opens the door for him, 
     another car drives by, and stops.  Eddie is driving; he 
     leans out the window.

                               EDDIE
               So long, Vince.  See you soon.

     Page 30.

     Vince lurches toward Eddie; Larry restrains him.  Eddie 
     drives off, chuckling.

                               VINCE
               He's so damn cocky.  This is different.

                               JOEY
               It's a bluff, Vince.

                               VINCE
               You know so much.  They've got Christy, 
               and we've got to find her.  Get her 8x10, 
               from in front of the lounge.  Fax it to 
               every contact we got.

     Larry covers his ears with both hands.

                               LARRY
               I can't hear this.  I'm an attorney, 
               Vince, and you're just an honest casino 
               owner.  Object of a witch hunt. Innocent 
               victim.

                               VINCE
               Keep the message vague, but let 'em 
               know.  The price has gone up.  Christy 
               Van Cartier -- a quarter of a million.  
               Dead or nearby.

     Vince looks grim and vindictive, as he gets into the car.

     EXT. CONVENT VEGETABLE GARDEN - DAY

     The vegetable patch is located behind the convent, on a 
     patch of land surrounded by high walls.  Various sections 
     have been partitioned with string and then furrowed.

     Several nuns are working in the patch, weeding and raking. 
     They wear large, ungainly straw hats over their wimples.

     Christy has been given a hoe and a straw hat.  She is 
     hacking at the dirt, with great disinterest.  She picks up 
     a carrot from the vegetable patch; she looks around to see 
     if anyone is watching.  She starts to gnaw on the carrot.  
     She becomes aware that someone is watching her.  She looks 
     up.

     Sister Mary Robert is watching Christy eat the carrot, 
     breaking her fast.  Christy drops the carrot on the ground, 
     as if it burned her.  Mary Robert resumes hoeing in the 
     next furrow over.

     Christy stares at Mary Robert, narrowing her eyes.  
     Christy looks around; all the other nuns are busy at their 
     tasks.  Christy decides that she will try and make Sister 
     Mary  Robert talk.  She picks up the carrot and tosses it 
     at Mary Robert.  Mary Robert jumps.  She waggles a finger 
     at Christy, scolding her.  Mary Robert resumes hoeing.

     Page 31.

     Christy is now determined.  She takes her hoe, and tiptoes 
     nearer to Mary Robert.  Very gently, she uses the handle of 
     the floe to lift Mary Robert's skirt, and gooses her.

     Mary Robert vips, very loudly.  All the other nuns turn 
     and stare at Mary Robert, scolding her.  Christy waggles 
     her finger at Mary Robert, scolding her.

     Christy, giggling to herself, resumes hoeing.  She sees 
     Mother Superior, standing at the end of the furrow.  Mother 
     Superior looks extremely grim; she has not missed anything.

     EXT. SUNSET - THAT NIGHT

     LONG SHOT of the sun going down, ending the nuns' Vow of 
     Silence.

     We hear Christy SCREAM, O.S.

     INT. CONVENT HALLWAY - THAT NIGHT

     This hallway is marked by a series of heavy wooden doors 
     with tiny, grilled windows.  These are the cells where the 
     nuns sleep.  Nuns are entering their cells and closing 
     their doors for the night.

     Mother Superior glides down the hall, followed by a dusty, 
     bedraggled Christy.  Christy is devouring a slice of brown 
     bread.

                               CHRISTY
               Is this all the food I get?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Yes.  Until breakfast.

                               CHRISTY
               That's tomorrow!  Don't you have any 
               snacks?  Machines?

     They stop by a door.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence.

                               CHRISTY
               My what?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Your cell.  Your room.

     INT. CHRISTY'S CELL

     The door swings open, and Mother Superior and Christy 
     enter.  The room is tiny, with bare plaster walls.  There 
     is a narrow wooden bed, with a thin muslin-covered 
     mattress.  There is a small nightstand and a wooden stool.

     Page 32.

                               CHRISTY
                             (looking around)
               You were right the first time.  Is this 
               like, solitary?  The cooler?  Where's the 
               furniture?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Our lives are simple.  We have little 
               need for material possessions.

                               CHRISTY
               Right, sure thing.  But what about, 
               like, appliances?  Like a little color 
               portable?  Boom box?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Useless distractions.

                               CHRISTY
                             (sinking to the bed)
               It's like the Stone Age.  The room time 
               forgot.  What about a phone?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               And whom would you call?

                               CHRISTY
               Oh, I don't know... Satan?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
                             (not amused) 
               Your cell is more than adequate.

                               CHRISTY
               Right.  So what do we do now?  Ping-
               Pong?  Row over to the monastery?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               It is nine p.m.  Pleasant dreams.

                               CHRISTY
               Wait.  No.  You're kidding.  Lights out? 
               At nine?  My day's just starting.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
                I'm sure.  If I were you, I would use 
               this time, to think about my life.  And 
               its direction.  Or lack thereof.

                               CHRISTY
                             (indignant)
               What's wrong with my life?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               From all I've heard, just about 
               everything.  Your singing career seems 
               all but nonexistent, and your married 
               lover wants you dead.

     Page 33

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR (CONT'D)
               If you're fooling anyone, it's only 
               yourself.  God has brought you here. Take 
               the hint.

     Mother Superior leaves.

     After the door shuts, Christy stands and looks out the one 
     small window in her cell.  She leans her head against the 
     wall.  She is trying not to think about what Mother 
     Superior has said.  Still, the mess her life has become 
     overwhelms her.  She fights back tears.

     EXT. CONVENT - DAY

     The sun is just barely rising, as the convent BELL tolls.

     INT. CHRISTY'S CELL

     Christy is fast asleep.  There is a RAPPING at the door.

                               MARY ROBERT (0.S.)
               Sister Mary Clarence!

     EXT. CONVENT HALLWAY

     All the nuns are proceeding, in their simple robes and 
     nightshirts, down the hallway.

     Christy's door opens; she is still in her nightshirt, and 
     her hair is a mess.

                               CHRISTY
               What?

     Mary Robert, in her nightshirt, stands outside.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Come on, we're late.

                               CHRISTY
               What?  What time is it?

                               MARY ROBERT
               It's after five.  We have to bathe.

                               CHRISTY
                             (groaning)
               Five a.m.?

     INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE BATHING ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER

     Christy is standing on line in the hall, along with 
     several other nuns; they are waiting to take showers.  They 
     carry soap and towels.

     Page 34.

                               MARY PATRICK
                             (sincerely)
               Isn't it a glorious morning?  Good 
               morning, Mary Clarence.  sleep well?

                               CHRISTY
               Right.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Is this like your old convent?

                               MARY PATRICK
               Which convent was that, Sister?

                               CHRISTY
               Which convent?  It was, um, the Little 
               Sisters... of the Moonlight.  In Vegas. 
               Everybody used to come to Mass.  Frank. 
               Dean.  Sammy.  Right at ringside. 

                               MARY LAZARUS
               Enough jabber.

     MARY LAZARUS is a much older nun; she is very no-nonsense, 
     a hard-liner.

                               CHRISTY
               What?

                               MARY LAZARUS
               Progressive convents.  Vanity.  It 
               sounds awful.  It sounds just like this 
               place.

                               CHRISTY
               Like this place?

                               MARY LAZARUS
               I like my old convent, in Vancouver. Out 
               in the woods.  It wasn't all modern, like 
               here.  No electricity.  Cold water. Bare 
               feet.  Those were nuns.  It was Hell on 
               earth, but I loved it.  This place is a 
               Hilton.

     INT. BATHING ROOM

     A stone room that is very medieval-looking.  One wall is 
     divided into stalls by wooden partitions.  In each stall is 
     a nun, standing beneath a crude shower head that releases a 
     thin stream of lukewarm water.  We see only the nuns' heads 
     and shoulders.

     Still sleepy, Christy leans against the wall of her stall, 
     her eyes closed.  Lost in thought, she begins singing 
     softly to herself.

     Page 35.

                               CHRISTY
               MY BOYFRIEND'S BACK
               AND YOU'RE GONNA BE IN TROUBLE

                               A FEW OTHER NUNS
                             (very softly)
               HEY-LA, HEY-LA

     Christy looks up from her reverie; she looks around.  The 
     other nuns are bathing, their eyes down.  There is no sign 
     of singing.  Christy decides to try a test.

                               CHRISTY
               MY BOYFRIEND'S BACK
               HE'S GONNA SAVE MY REPUTATION

                               A FEW OF THE NUNS
                             (still very softly)
               HEY-LA, HEY-LA

                               CHRISTY
               IF I WERE YOU,
               I'D TAKE A PERMANENT VACATION

                               A FEW OF THE NUNS
               HEY-LA, HEY-LA
               MY BOYFRIEND'S BACK

     The nuns giggle.

                               CHRISTY
               Where did that come from?

                               MARY PATRICK
               I haven't heard that song in ages.  The 
               Ronettes?

                               MARY LAZARUS
                             (very grouchy)
               Shirelles.

                               CHRISTY
               You know that song?

                               MARY PATRICK
               1961?  '62?  Mary Clarence, that's when 
               many of us took final vows.  It's the 
               last secular music we recall.

                               CHRISTY
               No.
               HEY -- HE KNOWS THAT YOU BEEN CREATING
               NOW YOU'RE GONNA GET A BEATING

                               ALL THE NUNS
               HEY-LA, HEY LA

     Page 36.

                               MARY LAZARUS
                             (cutting off the song)
               That's enough.  We've got to get to 
               chapel.

     Mary Lazarus leaves the bathing room, and the other nuns 
     resume scrubbing themselves.  Christy looks around.

                               CHRISTY
               Anybody got conditioner?

     INT. CHAPEL - A FEW MINUTES LATER

     Bishop O'Hara is leading the Sunday mass.  He stands in 
     the pulpit.  The choir nuns stand in a fenced-in area to 
     his left.  The remaining nuns, including Christy and Mother 
     Superior, sit in the first few pews.

                               O'HARA
               We are a small congregation this 
               morning.  Too many mornings.  Something 
               has gone terribly wrong.   Where is 
               faith?  Where is celebration?  Where is 
               everyone?  Still, rather than regret the 
               absence of our neighbors, let us rejoice 
               in the fellowship of those present.  Our 
               choirmistress, Sister Mary Lazarus, has 
               informed me that our choir, while always 
               superior, has been toiling especially 
               hard on this week's selection.  Sister?

     Mary Lazarus raises her hand, and the choir begins 
     singing. They sing a traditional hymn, "Let Thy Thoughts Be 
     Guided." As always, their singing is dreadful; they have no 
     tempo or pitch, and the hymn becomes an off-key drone.

     As the hymn continues, the CAMERA PANS OVER the chapel. 
     Aside from the nuns, it is almost empty; only a few elderly 
     people are in attendance.

     ANGLE ON CHRISTY

     sitting with the other nuns.  She is clearly about to fall 
     asleep.  Then the choir hits a particularly horrendous 
     note, and Christy jerks awake.  She immediately tries to 
     assume a pious expression, tilting her head and folding her 
     hands in prayer; she looks like a somewhat demented Sunday 
     School calendar.

     EXT. LAS VEGAS POLICE DEPARTMENT

     Detective Clarkson gets out of his car and hurries into 
     the police station.

     INT. POLICE STATION

     Clarkson crosses the busy room to Eddie's glass-walled 
     office.  Along the way, he signals Detective Tate to follow 
     him.

     Page 37.

     INT. MULCAHY'S OFFICE

     Eddie looks up from his desk as the two detectives enter.

                               CLARKSON
               There was a raid on a pawnshop in L.A. 
               this morning.  The place was fencing 
               stolen property.  They found this.

     Clarkson gives Eddie a fax sheet, showing a publicity 
     photograph of Christy.

                               EDDIE
               Jesus.  Data-base hoods.  It's a 
               wonderful world.
                             (reading the fax 
                             sheet) 
               Beloved daughter missing.  Reward of two 
               hundred and fifty thousand dollars. 
               Please find our adored angel, we miss her 
               so.  Dead or alive.

                               TATE
               Vince is getting desperate.  Where is 
               she, Eddie?  Where'd you stash her?

                               EDDIE
               Where's who?

                               TATE
               You won't even tell us?

                               EDDIE
               I wouldn't even tell the Pope.

     INT. CONVENT SCHOOLROOM - AN HOUR LATER

     A plain whitewashed classroom, with battered student-style 
     desks.  A group of about eight local TEENAGE GIRLS has 
     gathered.  The girls wear extremes of hair, makeup and 
     clothing; they are bored and scruffy, clearly the local bad 
     Girls.  Sister Mary Patrick is leading the class, in her 
     usual perky manner.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Good afternoon, young ladies.  And 
               welcome to our Christian Youth Group.

     The Girls make grunting noises.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Hi.  I hope we'll have some fun, and 
               maybe learn a little something, too. Now, 
               today's topic is something very up-to-
               date -- "Teenage Promiscuity."  My. Now, 
               can anyone tell me -- just what is 
               promiscuity?

     ANGLE on the Girls, exchanging glances and rolling their 
     eyes.

     Page 38

                               MARY PATRICK
               Anyone?  Yes?

     Mary Patrick points to a Girl in bicycle pants. a bustier 
     and a leather baseball cap.  Her name is Lawanda.

                               LAWANDA
               Uh, it's like, you know, doin' it.  A 
               whole lot.  Till your head falls off.

                               MARY PATRICK
                             (blushing)
               Well, yes.  That is one way to put it.

     Mother Superior enters the classroom accompanied by 
     Christy

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Sister Mary Patrick?

                               MARY PATRICK
               Yes?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               I need to see you, at once.  Girls, 
               please excuse Sister Mary Patrick for a 
               few moments.  Mary Clarence?

                               CHRISTY
               Yeah?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Girls, this is Sister Mary Clarence. 
               She'll be minding you until Sister Mary 
               Patrick's return.  Mary Clarence, please 
               assign a biblical passage.  Do not 
               attempt discussion.  Am I understood?

                               CHRISTY
               I got it.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
                             (to Mary Patrick)
               Come, Sister.

     Mother Superior and Mary Patrick leave the classroom. 
     Christy now stands at the front of the room.  She is 
     visibly uncomfortable.

                               CHRISTY
               So, hi there.  I'm... Sister Mary 
               Clarence.  And you're... young 
               Christians.  I guess I should assign you 
               this passage.  What's good?  What were 
               you talking about?

                               LAWANDA
               We were talking about the wild thing. 
               Teen promiscuity.

                             (after a beat)
               Really.

                               CHARLENE
               Yeah.  Sister Mary Pat was discussing 
               it.  You know she thinks it's a sin.

                               CHRISTY
                             (trying to behave)
               Well... yes.  Yes it is.

                               LAWANDA
                             (goading Christy)
               How come?  Sister?

                               CHRISTY
                             (still trying to 
                             behave)
               Well... because it's in the Bible. "Thou 
               shalt not..."  Thou shalt not.

     The Girls all laugh and make jeering noises.

                               CHRISTY
               Excuse me -- just what are you all doing 
               here?  At Sunday School?

                               LAWANDA
               'Cause we love it so damn much.  And 
               cause we gotta come here.  Probation.

                               CHRISTY
               Probation?

                               CHARLENE
               Yeah.  We all got caught.  Shoplifting. 
               Cuttin' school.  Cuttin' up some bitch 
               with a blade.  So we gotta come here.  So 
               we'll be good, in the future.  So we'll 
               learn valuable lessons.  And I learned 
               mine.  I will be incredibly good, I will 
               never rip out nobody's nose-ring by 
               accident ever again.  Can I go now?

                               CHRISTY
                             (getting fed up)
               Yeah, you learned a whole lot, I can 
               tell.

                               LAWANDA
               Well, what would you know about it, 
               anyway?  What do any of you nunheads know 
               about anything?  About doin' the nasty, 
               or gettin' high?

                               CONCHITA
               Leave her alone, Lawanda, she's just 
               some ol' nun!  Don't pick on no nun, it's 
               bad luck!

     Page 40.

                               CHRISTY
                             (fed up)
               Shut up!

     All the Girls look up, stunned by Christy's language.

                               CHRISTY
               Okay, so maybe I'm a nun -- so, you want 
               to ask me something?  You want to listen, 
               for once in your little lives? You want 
               to pay some attention?

                               CHARLENE
               What about crack?  You a user?

                               CHRISTY
               I said I was a nun, not an asshole.

     All the girls jeer at Charlene.

                               KESHIA
               Got you, Charlene!

                               CONCHITA
               Dunked by the nun!

                               LAWANDA
                             (more sincerely)
               Well, what about the sex stuff?  What if 
               some dude is after you, and he's always 
               saying stuff, commin' on sweet and 
               mellow.  Like, oh, baby, you know you'll 
               love it.  Oh, baby, if you loved me, 
               you'd stay.

                               CHRISTY
               And you listen to that?

                               LAWANDA
               No, but... I don't know... sometimes.

                               CHRISTY
               Hey, I know, it's hard.  But do what I 
               do.

                               LAWANDA
                             (puzzled)
               What you do?

                               CHRISTY
               Just tell him, I do love you, but I 
               can't -- I'm a nun.

     The girls all laugh; they are really beginning to like 
     Christy.

     Page 41.

                               CHARLENE
               But, like what if you are doin' it? What 
               about protection?  Who's responsible?

                               CONCHITA
               What about them things, you know, for 
               the guy?  Aren't they like, a mess to put 
               on?  Don't they kinda mess up the mood?

                               CHRISTY
               Deal with it, sweet thing.  It's 
               important, nowadays.  You just practice 
               at home, with a balloon and a banana.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR (0.S.)
               Mary Clarence!

     Mother Superior has returned, with Mary Patrick.  Everyone 
     has been so wrapped up in the discussion, that no one has 
     noticed their entrance.

                               CHRISTY
                             (thinking on her feet)
               Because a banana is part of a balanced 
               breakfast.  And don't forget fiber.

     INT. MOTHER SUPERIOR'S OFFICE - LATER THAT DAY

     Mother Superior is seated behind her desk; she is very 
     angry.  Christy sits across from her.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               A balloon and a banana!  Tell me, Mary 
               Clarence, what were you thinking?

                               CHRISTY
               Those girls were asking questions.  
               They've got it rough.  I wish somebody 
               had talked to me about that stuff when 
               was their age.  I wish somebody would 
               talk to me about it now.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               This is a convent, not a clinic.  We 
               offer moral guidance, not hardware.

                               CHRISTY
               Have you been out in those streets?  Do 
               you know what those kids are up against?  
               You should help them!

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               We are nuns.  We seek solutions through 
               prayer.

     Page 42.

                               CHRISTY
               Sometimes it's not enough!

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               You are correct.  Sometimes prayer alone 
               cannot help a situation.  Such as your 
               own, for example.  How do you feel about 
               physical labor?

                               CHRISTY
               It never solves anything.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, 
               in Ecciesiastes 1:27?  He spoke unto a 
               wastrel youth.  He said, "Take up thy 
               task, and know ye the path of 
               contentment."

                               CHRISTY
               In English?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               How to put it... ah, Of course, Mary 
               Clarence.  "No pain, no gain."

     Mother Superior smiles in a rather evil manner.

     INT. VINCE'S OFFICE - DAY

     Vince is on the telephone in his office at the Moonlight 
     Hotel and Casino.  He clearly has a new mistress or two.

                               VINCE
                             (very seductive)
               Baby, you know I do... of course... I 
               feel it too... I'm blushing... can you 
               hold?

     A second telephone RINGS, and Willy answers it.  Vince 
     meanwhile has pushed a button on his phone and is involved 
     in a second romantic call.

                               VINCE
               Soon, you gorgeous thing... tell me... 
               how lonely?

                               WILLY
               It's that call you were expecting, 
               Vince.

                               VINCE
               Can you hold?  Can you try?

     Willy passes the phone to Vince. t

     Page 43

                               VINCE
               Have you found out where Christy is yet?  
               Hey, bozo, you re on my payroll! You want 
               to try making it on a cop's salary?  Find 
               her, and find her now!

     Vince passes the phone back to Willy.

                               VINCE
               Raise the ante to three hundred grand.

     Willy heads for the fax machine.  Vince regains his 
     composure, and picks up his own phone; he pushes a button.

                               VINCE
               Sorry, baby... you are?  Totally?  Not a 
               stitch?... Yeah, I'm naked too... 
               inside...

     INT. CONVENT CRAFTS ROOM

     This is a large, open room where the nuns create various 
     gift items which the convent sells to support itself.  
     Several nuns sit at a table, diligently hand-painting 
     Christmas cards and making Christmas tree ornaments.

     On the other side of the room is a large, free-standing 
     loom, which resembles a grand piano.  The loom is wooden; a 
     tapestry is half-completed.  Mary Patrick is seated at the 
     loom, which is a complicated mechanism.  Christy stands 
     beside her.

                               MARY PATRICK
               The minute I saw you. I said to myself, 
               she's a weaver.  Have you ever used a 
               loom?

                               CHRISTY
               Not in years.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Well, it all comes back, in just a 
               jiffy.  I'm working on a wall-hanging, of 
               the convent.

                               CHRISTY
               Why?

                               MARY PATRICK
               To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, 
               but we're in terrible trouble here at St. 
               Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the 
               furnace is going, and there's no money.

                               CHRISTY
               But don't you get money?  From the 
               Vatican?

     Page 44.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Mary Clarence.  Goose.  We're completely 
               self-supporting.  Like all convents. Like 
               yours.

                               CHRISTY
               Oh, right.  At my old place, we used 
               to... wash cars.  Groom dogs.  So... nice 
               loom.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Isn't it lovely?  Now I'll demonstrate, 
               and then you can hop right in.
                             (as she deftly works 
                             the loom)
               You just draw your beater in, keep it 
               pressed against the pick, and open the 
               shed.  Then pass your shuttle, beat, and 
               open the next shed.  Shuttle. beat, beat, 
               shuttle, beat, shed.  Keep tension on the 
               warp.  Is that clear?

                               CHRISTY
                             (pretending to be 
                             fascinated)
               Just about.  Show me again.

                               MARY PATRICK
               You betcha.

     CRAFTS ROOM - AN HOUR LATER

     ANGLE on the wall hanging, which has progressed 
     considerably.

     ANGLE on Christy, leaning against the wall, thumbing 
     through a magazine.

     ANGLE on Mary Patrick, hard at work at the loom.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Shuttle, beat, shed.  And watch your 
               heddles.

                               CHRISTY
               I love my heddles.  Show me again.

     Mother Superior appears.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Mary Clarence -- how is your weaving 
               progressing?

                               MARY PATRICK
               Oh, she's doing just fine, Reverend 
               Mother -

     Page 45.

                               CHRISTY
               Really catching on.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Good.  Mary Patrick, I need you in the 
               office.  Mary Clarence, carry on.

     Mother Superior gestures to the loom.  Christy sits at the 
     loom, and waves as Mother Superior and Mary Patrick exit.

     Christy stares at the loom; a look of horror crosses her 
     face.  She has not been paying attention to Mary Patrick's 
     instructions.  She cracks her knuckles, as if she were 
     about to play the piano.  She grabs two parts of the loom, 
     at random.  She moves these parts.

     ANGLE on the loom.  As a result of Christy's movements, 
     the loom collapses, piece by piece.  The tapestry unravels, 
     the many skeins of wool snap, and the mechanical apparatus 
     disintegrates, until finally the entire loom shudders and 
     falls to the floor, as Christy watches, aghast.

     INT. CORRIDOR

     Mother Superior is striding down the hall; she is livid. 
     Christy trails behind her, trying to keep up.

                               CHRISTY
               I'm sorry, I'm not a weaver!

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Months of work, and the loom, absolutely 
               ruined!

                               CHRISTY
               Look, this isn't my kind of thing!  I 
               wasn't cut out to make little tapestries, 
               or knit little sweaters! I don't do that!  
               I'm a star!

     Mother Superior stops dead in her tracks; she turns and 
     stares at Christy.  Then she smiles, in a rather 
     frightening manner.

     MONTAGE - CHRISTY

     A)on her hands and knees. scrubbing the stone floor of a 
     convent hallway.

     B)crawling along between the pews in the chapel, oiling 
     every inch of wood with a bottle of polish and a rag.

     C)crawling along the convent roof, cleaning out gutters 
     with a trowel.  She discovers a dead rat in one of the 
     gutters.

     Page 46

     D)sewing; she is repairing a hole in a habit.  The CAMERA 
     PULLS BACK.  Christy is sitting in a small stone room, 
     surrounded by piles of torn habits, linen and other 
     mending.

     INT. MOTHER SUPERIOR'S OFFICE

     Christy is on the phone in the darkened office.  She keeps 
     checking the door, to make sure no one is listening.

                               CHRISTY
                             (into phone)
               Let me talk to Detective Eddie Mulcahy.  
               It's an emergency.  Real bad.

                               EDDIE'S VOICE
               Mulcahy.

     Christy cups her hand around the phone and speaks quietly 
     and frantically.  INTERCUT between Christy and Eddie.

                               CHRISTY
               Eddie, you've got to get me out of here.

                               EDDIE
               Not again.  You can't keep calling. 
               Somebody's going to catch on to where you 
               are.

                               CHRISTY
               But I'm going insane!  All these people 
               do is pray and work, work and pray!  I 
               don't get it -- when's the weekend? They 
               have gruel, Eddie, that's what they call 
               food!  Gruel -- it's like Alpo for nuns!  
               I sleep in a cell, on a board, and I pray 
               five times a days  Do you know what I 
               pray for, Eddie, do you have any idea?  
               Check your crotch, Eddie --anything fall 
               off yet?  Get me outta her!

                               EDDIE
               Calm down.  Look, I didn't want to tell 
               you this, but we've had some problems 
               with our protection program lately.

                               CHRISTY
               Like what?

                               EDDIE
               Keeping our witnesses alive.  We hide 
               them, but there's a leak in the 
               department, and they end up dead.

                               CHRISTY
               You son-of-a-bitch!

     Page 47

                               EDDIE
               I just need a few more weeks,

                               CHRISTY
               But it's a nightmare!  Mother Superior 
               is out to get me!  She hates my guts! She 
               keeps thinking up new kinds of torture!

     In the distance, Christy hears the CHOIR practicing; they 
     sound even worse than usual.

                               CHRISTY
                             (holding the phone 
                             out)
               Do you hear that?  That choir?  Eddie, 
               in here, that's what they call music!

                               EDDIE
               Don't call again.  It's not safe.  I'll 
               be in touch.

     As the line goes dead, Mother Superior enters.  Christy 
     takes her dust rag and pretends to polish the receiver. She 
     sings as she works.

                               CHRISTY
               THE HILLS ARE ALIVE WITH THE SOUND OF 
               MUSIC...

     Still singing, Christy breezes out of the room.  Mother 
     Superior looks mystified.

     INT. CHRISTY'S CELL - MIDNIGHT

     Christy is lying flat out on her bed, in her habit, 
     utterly exhausted by the week's hard labor.  There is a 
     meek SCRATCHING at her door.

                               CHRISTY
                             (without moving)
               Yeah?

     Sister Mary Robert enters, very shyly.  She barely looks 
     up.

                               CHRISTY
               What?  What does she want now?  I did 
               the dishes.  I oiled the pews.  I dusted 
               the hymnals.  Two hundred hymnals.  Why 
               can't people share?

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (not speaking above a 
                             whisper)
               I... I...

     Page 48.

                               CHRISTY
               What?

                               MARY ROBERT
               I... I brought you something.

                               CHRISTY
               A cigarette?

                               MARY ROBERT
               An extra heel of bread.  Please take it, 
               you need your strength.  You've been 
               working so hard.

     Mary Robert holds out a rather rugged crust of brown 
     bread.  Christy takes it..

                               CHRISTY
               Thanks.  So which one are you? Sister 
               Bruce?  Sister Doug?

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (until almost 
                             whispering)
               Mary Robert.  I'm... Mary Robert.

                               CHRISTY
               Right.  Okay.  Bob.  Nice to know you.

     Mary Robert nods, and resumes looking at her hands.  She 
     doesn't 1eave, but she's still tongue-tied. Christy is at a 
     loss.

                               CHRISTY
               So, Bob, how long have you been in? St. 
               K's?

                               MARY ROBERT
               Three years.  Sister.

                               CHRISTY
               Three years.  A rookie.

                               MARY ROBERT
               A novice.

                               CHRISTY
               Yeah, like a learner's permit, right? 
               When do you hit the big time?  You know, 
               when do you take the final vows?

     Mary Robert bursts into tears.

                               CHRISTY
               Whoa!  Bob!  What's going on here? 
               What'd I say?

     Page 49.

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (still sobbing)
               You have to help me

                               CHRISTY
               Right, sure, but what's the problem? Are 
               they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they 
               drug you?  Did Reverend Mother like, 
               kidnap your parents?  We can call the 
               Enquirer.

                               MARY ROBERT
               No, you don't understand -- I don't want 
               to get out!  I want to get in?

                               CHRISTY
               Excuse me?

                               MARY ROBERT
               Oh. Mary Clarence, I'm so unworthy.  I 
               want to take my final vows, I would do it 
               tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let 
               me!

                               CHRISTY
               She won't?  Why not?

                               MARY ROBERT
               She says I should wait.  She says that 
               no one should become a nun as an escape 
               from life.  She says that I'm not 
               experienced enough to make the decision 
               yet.  In a mature manner.

                               CHRISTY
               She said that?  Reverend Mother?

     Mary Robert nods, solemnly.  Suddenly, from the streets 
     outside the convent, we hear a BLAST OF hot dance MUSIC, 
     and the SOUND of laughter and carefree conversation.

                               CHRISTY
               Well, then there's only one thing to do.

                               MARY ROBERT
               What?

                               CHRISTY
               Reverend Mother says you need 
               experience, right, in life.  In order to 
               make a responsible decision.  This is 
               going to be very painful for me.  You 
               know how much I love this little room. 
               This whole convent.  Wait.

     Christy stands, and goes to the crucifix hanging on the 
     wall.  She speaks to the crucifix, and listens, as if Jesus 
     is advising her.

     Page 50.

                               CHRISTY
                             (to Jesus)
               Must I do this thing, 0 Lord?  Please 
               help me.,. yes, I know... I must put my 
               selfish cares aside... I must think of 
               others... yes, she's here...
                             (she gestures to Mary 
                             Robert)
               He says hi... yes, I understand... let 
               thy will be done.  Amen.  You too.

     Christy turns to Mary Robert, having received a holy 
     message.

                               CHRISTY
               We must do this sacred thing, Mary 
               Robert.

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (desperate)
               Of course!  We must do it!  It's the 
               will of God!  What is it?

                               CHRISTY
                             (shutting her eyes, 
                             for the full spiritual 
                             effect)
               We must... get you some experience.  We 
               must... leave this place.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Are you sure?

     Another BLAST OF MUSIC from the street.  Christy turns to 
     the crucifix.  She gets confirmation.

                               CHRISTY
                             (to Jesus)
               We hear you.

     EXT. STREET

     The outer wall of the convent.  A door swings open, and 
     Christy sticks her head out.  She looks both ways, and 
     steps outside.  She beckons to Mary Robert, who appears 
     from behind her.  Mary Robert looks very wary.  Christy 
     pulls her along.

     EXT. A STREET NEARBY

     Christy and Mary Robert walk along a street a few blocks 
     from the convent.

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (looking around 
                             cautiously)
               Are you sure this is what Reverend 
               Mother had in mind?

     Page 51.

                               CHRISTY
               I know it is.  It's life.  Experience.  
               Take a deep breath.

     Christy breathes deep, and then lets out a whoop.  She 
     spins, letting her habit billow around her.

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (shocked)
               Mary Clarence!

                               CHRISTY
               Now you.

     Mary Robert's eyes widen.  She points to herself -- "Me?" 
     Christy nods.  Mary Robert lets out a tiny little whoop, 
     and does a little, timid hop.

                               CHRISTY
               It's a start.

     EXT. SOCIAL CLUB

     A neighborhood hang-out, the windows bright with neon beer 
     signs.  The exterior is colorfully painted; the club all 
     but explodes with good times.  A group of teenagers lounge 
     on the steps, sipping beers and smoking.  Among the 
     teenagers are the girls from Christy's Christian Youth 
     group.  Christy and Mary Robert approach, and the group 
     falls silent.

                               CHRISTY
               How are you doing.

                               LAWANDA
                             (puzzled)
               Hey, Sisters.  Are you going in there?

                               CHRISTY
               You know it.

                               MARY ROBERT
               We need experience.

                               CHRISTY
                             (remembering she's a 
                             nun)
               It's part of St. Katherine's new 
               community outreach program.  How old are 
               you?  You shouldn't be smoking.  Have you 
               ever seen a diseased lung?  Hand 'em 
               over.

     Lawanda reluctantly hands over her cigarettes.  Christy 
     turns to a TEENAGE BOY who's drinking beer.

     Page 52.

                               CHRISTY
               And you, with the devil's brew passing 
               through your lips.
                             (holding out her hand)
               A mind is a terrible thing to waste.

     The boy hands over the beer.  Christy and Mary Robert 
     enter the club.

     INT. SOCIAL CLUB

     Christy enters the club and grins.  She takes a drag on 
     the cigarette.  Mary Robert grabs the beer from Christy's 
     hand, and takes a swig.

                               CHRISTY
                             (shocked)
               Bobs

                               MARY ROBERT
               Experience!  Right?

                               CHRISTY
               Right.

     The club is alive with activity; the bar is crowded, 
     couples are making out at small tables, and the dance floor 
     is packed.  The atmosphere is a combination of hazy 
     darkness and colored lights; the club should have the 
     feeling of a hot neighborhood party, with people of all 
     ages and races.  The MUSIC percolates, and Christy starts 
     to move to it.  She and Mary Robert find a table in the 
     corner, and signal a nearby waitress.

                               CHRISTY
               A couple of bowls of chili.
                             (holding up the beer)
               And another round of these.

     The waitress looks at the two women strangely; the club 
     has never hosted nuns before.

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (to the waitress, 
                             confidentially)
               I have to do this.  So I can become a 
               nun.

                               CHRISTY
                             (to the waitress)
               Initiation.  You understand.  Later on, 
               we make her wear her underwear on her 
               head.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Really?

     Page 53

                               CHRISTY
                             (to the waitress)
               And she wants to be a nun.

     The waitress leaves, shaking her head.  Christy and Mary 
     Robert watch the action at the club.

     Across the room, MIKE the bartender stares at the nuns, 
     especially Christy; he tries to place her.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Who are all these people?

                               CHRISTY
               This is your neighborhood.  Your turf. 
               You should get to know 'em.

     From across the room, Mike the bartender continues to 
     study Christy's face.  He takes out a copy of Vince's fax 
     photo and stares at it.  He covers Christy's hair in the 
     photo with his hands, creating a wimple.  There is no 
     question in his mind; the two are the same.  Mike has a 
     dangerous look in his eyes as he takes a gun from the 
     drawer and slips it into his pocket beneath his apron.

     There is a LIVE BAND on a small stage at one end of the 
     club.  They start playing a hot dance number, and the club 
     really begins to cook, as the dance floor fills.  Christy 
     and Mary Robert, both still seated, start to move with the 
     music.

     A very good-looking LOCAL DUDE comes over to the nuns 
     table.  He is clearly amused at their presence.

                               DUDE
               Hey, Sisters -- how you doin'?

                               CHRISTY
                             (flirting)
               Better now.

                               DUDE
               How come they let you out?  Out of that 
               convent place?

                               CHRISTY
               Time off.  For bad behavior.

                               DUDE
               Oww!  A nun havin' fun!  I don't believe 
               it!  It's good to have you ladies in this 
               fine establishment.  So... anybody on the 
               move?

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (standing up)
               I am.

     Page 54.

                               CHRISTY
               Bob!  What're you doing?

     Mary Robert leads the Dude out onto the dance floor.

                               MARY ROBERT
               I'm getting experience.

                               CHRISTY
                             (to the Dude)
               You watch yourself!

     Christy decides she'd better keep an eye on Mary Robert; 
     she grabs another DUDE, and heads for the dance floor.

     As the music percolates, Christy and Mary Robert dance;  
     Christy is very hot, and Mary Robert picks up on her moves.  
     The CLUB PATRONS are delighted, and cheer as the nuns start 
     to get down.

                               CLUB PATRON #1
               Do it, Sisters!

                               CLUB PATRON #2
               Sway and pray!

     As the song, and the nuns' exuberant dancing, peak, the 
     Club Patrons cheer, shouting "Hallelujah!" and "Amen!"

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     Christy and Mary Robert are walking back to the convent. 
     They are both in very good spirits.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Those people are wonderful!  Why don't 
               we ever see them in church?

                               CHRISTY
               Good point.  Especially that dude you 
               were with.  I'd like to see him down 
               front.

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (giggling)
               Mary Clarence!  You're so... different 
               from the other sisters.  Sometimes, 
               well... sometimes you sound more like a 
               layperson.

                               CHRISTY
               Honey.

     As the two women laugh together, they don't notice the car 
     that begins to follow them, creeping slowly forward with 
     its headlights out.

     Page 55.

                               MARY ROBERT
               I can't wait to tell Reverend Mother 
               about all my experiences.  I've learned 
               so much.

                               CHRISTY
               Well, you know, you don't have to tell 
               her everything.  I mean, nothing really 
               happened.  We just... took a walk.

     The car's bright lights suddenly switch on, and the nuns 
     turn, startled.  The car hurtles toward them.  They scream, 
     and Christy grabs Mary Robert and throws her out of the 
     car's path; the two women land on a pile of garbage bags.

     Struggling to her feet, Christy sees the car go into 
     reverse, and then pull forward again.  She sees a glint of 
     light reflect off a gun as the car's driver (Mike the 
     bartender) leans out the window.

                               CHRISTY
                             (to Mary Robert)
               Run!

     Christy shoves Mary Robert towards an alley.  As she does 
     so, the gun GOES OFF with a red flash.  The shot misses the 
     two women and SHATTERS a plate glass window of the store 
     behind them.

     EXT. ALLEY

     Running up the alley, Christy and Mary Robert hear Mike's 
     FOOTSTEPS chasing them, growing louder as he gains on them.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Mary Clarence! 

                               CHRISTY
               Keep moving!

     Christy grabs the ladder of a fire escape, and shoves Mary 
     Robert up the ladder ahead of her.

                               CHRISTY
               Climb!  Now!

     As Christy and Mary Robert climb the fire escape, another 
     GUNSHOT ECHOES in the alley, ricocheting off the fire 
     escape.

     The nuns climb higher up the building.  Mike pursues, 
     looking for a shot between the steps and the landings, but 
     not finding any openings.  He takes the steps two at a time 
     and begins to gain ground.

     At the fourth floor landing, Christy's heel gets stuck in 
     the grating.  She pulls frantically at the laces.

     Page 56.

                               CHRISTY
               Goddamn it!

                               MARY ROBERT
               Mary Clarence!

     Mike arrives at the landing just as Christy twists her 
     toot out of the shoe, and surprises him with a lunge for 
     the gun.  Mike's hand is knocked back against the metal 
     frame of the fire escape, and the gun flies loose, RATTLING 
     down the metal steps to the landing below.  Christy shoves 
     Mary Robert into the open window of an apartment, and 
     follows her in.

     INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT

     Christy and Mary Robert leap into the bedroom of an 
     Hispanic couple, their arms wrapped around each other in 
     bed.  At the women's entrance, the couple looks up, stunned 
     to see two nuns in their bedroom.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Oh my Lord!

                               CHRISTY
                             (pushing Mary Robert 
                             forward)
               Experience!

     The couple continues to look stunned as the nuns race out 
     of the room.

     EXT. CONVENT - NIGHT

     Christy and Mary Robert run up to the side door of the 
     convent; they catch their breath.

                               MARY ROBERT
               What was all that?  Who was that man?  
               Why would he shoot at us?

                               CHRISTY
               I don't know, some people just don't 
               like nuns.  I wish I had a ruler.

                               MARY ROBERT
               We could have been killed!  But you 
               saved me!
                             (throwing her arms 
                             around Christy)
               Thank you, Mary Clarence!

     The door to the convent swings open.  Mother Superior is 
     waiting.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Yes -- thank you so much.

     Page 57

     INT.CONVENT CORRIDOR - DAY

     Christy sits alone outside Mother Superior's office, 
     listening to the loud TICKING of the clock on the wall. She 
     seems small and vulnerable, like a child sent to the 
     principal's office.

     The door opens and Eddie emerges from the office.

                               CHRISTY
               What'd she say?

                               EDDIE
               You blew it -- big time.  She doesn't 
               want you back.

                               CHRISTY
               Does she know people are trying to kill 
               me out there?

                               EDDIE
               She's counting on it.  She's concerned 
               for your safety, but she wants me to try 
               and find another convent that will take 
               you. Or a carnival.

                               CHRISTY
               So what am I supposed to do in the 
               meantime?

                               EDDIE
               Go in and talk to her.  It can't hurt. 
                             (urging her)
               Go.

     Reluctantly, Christy rises and approaches the door.  She 
     looks at Eddie, who motions her to go in.  She finally 
     does.

     INT. MOTHER SUPERIOR'S OFFICE

     Mother Superior is working on some papers at her desk as 
     Christy enters.  Christy is trying to figure out a 
     strategy.

                               CHRISTY
               So... hi there.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
                             (not amused and not 
                             looking up)
               I don't believe we have anything to say 
               to each other.

                               CHRISTY
               Look... I know I shouldn't have, I'm 
               incredibly sorry about Mary Robert, I 
               wasn't thinking, I didn't know that would 
               happen!

     Page 58.

     Mother Superior glances up from her work.  She is 
     justifiably outraged.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Mary Robert's life was in danger! Your 
               behavior was inexcusable!

                               CHRISTY
               I know!  I'm sorry   I didn't mean for 
               it to happen!  And I was the one they 
               were shooting at!

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Mary Clarence, I have given you every 
               opportunity.  To change.  To make a 
               decent life for yourself.

                               CHRISTY
               A decent life?  Excuse me?  As what?  A 
               janitor?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Clearly, you have learned nothing. And 
               you present an ongoing threat, both to 
               this convent and to yourself.

                               CHRISTY
               But you can't kick me out!  Guys want to 
               kill me!  You're a nun!  A big nun! 
               Aren't you supposed to have compassion? 
               For the wayward sheep?  I mean, I'm a 
               major sinner!  All-time great!  Hall of 
               Fame!  Aren't I, like, your dream come 
               true?  Your Olympic event?

     Mother Superior stares at Christy.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Mary Clarence, perhaps you are correct.

                               CHRISTY
                             (surprised)
               I am?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               You may stay.  But I shall restrict your 
               activities to but a single task.

                               CHRISTY
                             (with great dread)
               What?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               You have, I believe, some minimal 
               background in music.  Therefore, you are 
               to join our choir.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR (CONT'D)
               You will sing, and you will sleep,' that 
               is your schedule until you depart.  As 
               almost no one attends Mass, you will be 
               unable to cause further damage.

                               CHRISTY
               No.  No.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
                             (smiling)
               You're my Olympic event.

                               CHRISTY
               Not the choir, please, anything but 
               that.  The choir -- I mean, have you 
               heard them?  I'll do anything, scrub 
               floors, toilets, you name it, but not 
               that I

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
                             (in triumph)
               The choir, Mary Clarence.  Go for the 
               gold.

     INT. CHOIR REHEARSAL ROOM - THAT DAY

     There are twelve nuns in the room, going over sheet music. 
     Mary Lazarus is the group's leader; Mary Patrick and Mary 
     Robert are also in the choir.  Christy appears at the door, 
     grimacing.

                               CHRISTY
               Is this... choir practice?

                               MARY PATRICK
               Sure is!  Come on in, and sing a spell.

     Christy spots Mary Robert.

                               CHRISTY
               Mary Robert, I am so sorry about last 
               night...

                               MARY ROBERT
               Now stop that.  You didn't shoot at me.  
               You were only trying to help, to give me 
               experience.  I tried to explain that to 
               Reverend Mother, but -- I don't know if 
               she understood.

     Mary Lazarus cuts off this chitchat, thrusting a hymnal at 
     Christy.

                               MARY LAZARUS
               Soprano or alto?

                               CHRISTY
                             (very gloomy)
               Whatever.

     Page 60.

     Mary Lazarus hands Christy a hymnal, and raps her baton. 
     The choir begins to sing; Christy doesn't even bother 
     trying.  She is horrified; the choir is the worst-sounding 
     group in history.  They seem to be singing in several 
     random keys, and they even have trouble with the words.  No 
     one looks up from their hymnals.  Sister Alma, the organist 
     with the hearing aid, is plodding along.

     INT. BLUE COLLAR BAR - DAY

     Mike the bartender is taking chairs off tables and setting 
     them on the floor as Joey and Willy enter.

                               JOEY
               We're looking for Mike.

                               MIKE
               You found him -- but we're not open yet.

     Willy grabs Mike's arms and bends them behind his back.

                               MIKE
               Hey -- the till's empty!

     Willy slams Mike's face into the wall, stunning him.  Joey 
     lifts Mike's groggy face and offers sympathy.

                               JOEY
               I'm sorry -- I don't know what gets into 
               him.

                               MIKE
               Who are you guys?

                               JOEY
               We're the guys from Vegas.  You had 
               Christy last night, but you let her get 
               away.  It's upsetting.

     Willy hammers Mike's face into the wall again.

                               MIKE
               But you didn't tell me!

                               JOEY
               We didn't tell you what?

                               MIKE
               That she's a nun!  That chick you're 
               looking for -- she's a nun!

                               WILLY
               What?  Christy?

                               JOEY
               A nun?

                               MIKE
               I'm telling you!

     Willy and Joey look at each other, and consider this.  
     Then they burst out laughing.  They refuse to believe 
     Mike's story.

                               WILLY
               Gimme a hand here.

     Willy and Joey pick Mike up, and hurl him over the bar. 
     Then they exit, still laughing.

                               JOEY
               A nun!

     INT. CHOIR REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY

     The choir continues its dreadful rendition of the hymn 
     Let Thy Thoughts He Guided.  Christy is not singing; she 
     is clearly in pain.  Mary Lazarus stops the song.  One of 
     the nuns has to nudge Sister Alma to stop her playing.

                               MARY LAZARUS
               Mary Clarence, are you with us?

                               CHRISTY
               Um, I don't really know this one...

                               MARY ROBERT
               Mary Clarence has a background in music. 
               That's what Reverend Mother said.

                               MARY PATRICK
                             (eagerly)
               Really, Mary Clarence?  Were you a 
               choirmistress?

                               CHRISTY
               Sure.  Kind of... free-lance.

                               MARY LAZARUS
                             (circling Christy)
               Free-lance?  Oh really?  You think I 
               don't see?  You think I took vows 
               yesterday?  I know what you're up to. You 
               and Reverend Mother.

                               CHRISTY
               What?

                               MARY LAZARUS
               You're a ringer.  She brought you in to 
               replace me.  Out with the old.

     Page 62.

                               CHRISTY
               Hold on.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Mary Clarence, could you?  Mary Lazarus, 
               you're terrific, but...
                             (to Christy)
               Could you help us?

                               ANOTHER NUN
               Please?

                               ANOTHER NUN
               You've heard us.

                               MARY LAZARUS
               Well.

     Everyone falls silent.  Mary Lazarus walks across the 
     room, eyeballing each member of the choir.

                               MARY LAZARUS
               There's a word for this -- mutiny.
                             (to Christy)
               So, Mary Clarence, you think you can do 
               better.  I believe I'd like to see that.
                             (she hands Christy her 
                             pitchpipe and baton)
               I'm out to pasture.  Dry dock.  The glue 
               factory.  Go ahead, Sister -- make 'em 
               sing.

     Everyone watches Christy.

                               CHRISTY
               Well...
                             (to Nary Lazarus)
               With all due respect... let's have a 
               look at this.

     Christy goes over to the piano.  She examines the sheet 
     music for "Let They Thoughts He Guided."  She sits at the 
     piano, beside Sister Alma.  Christy picks out the hymn on 
     the piano, accompanying herself.

                               CHRISTY
               LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
               LET THY SOUL BE HEALED

     Christy's singing voice is, as usual, not very good.  She 
     stops singing.  For perhaps the first time in her life, she 
     has really heard herself.

                               CHRISTY
               Man.  I sound like you guys.

     Page 63.

                               MARY LAZARUS
                             (victorious)
               Very nice.  Sisters, have we learned our 
               lesson?  I won't hold this little episode 
               against anyone.  I'll try not to.

                               CHRISTY
                             (standing)
               Mary Robert.

     Mary Robert jumps, startled by the attention. 

                               MARY ROBERT
               What?

                               CHRISTY
               Mary Robert, I've watched you.  You 
               never really sing.  You whisper. Nothing 
               comes out.

                               MARY ROBERT
               I don't want to mess anyone up...

                               CHRISTY
                             (to Sister Alma)
               Give me a C.
                             (because Sister Alma 
                             is hard of hearing)
               A C!

     Sister Alma plays the note.  Christy points the baton at 
     Mary Robert.  Mary Robert whispers the note.

                               CHRISTY
               Louder!  Like you're onstage.

     Mary Robert sings a little louder.

                               CHRISTY
               Like people are eating, and there's 
               silverware, and you want them to hear 
               you.

     Mary Robert sings louder still.

                               CHRISTY
               Think about that guy you were dancing 
               with!

     Mary Robert finally lets out her full voice, which is huge 
     and glorious.  After singing a single perfect note, she 
     stops abruptly; she has scared herself.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Oh my!

     Page 64.

                               CHRISTY
               You see?  We've got the voices.  They're 
               just allover the place. I've heard all of 
               you, in the shower --you're decent.  
               Better than me.  We just need charts -- 
               harmony -- chops.

                               MARY PATRICK
                             (puzzled)
               Chops?

                               CHRISTY
               The goods.  The sound.  The sale.  Let's 
               rearrange a few things.  Mary Patrick, 
               you re not a natural soprano, you're an 
               alto.  Get over here.  Mary Robert --with 
               the sopranos.

     The two nuns trade places.

                               CHRISTY
               Sister Alma -- a C.

     Sister Alma plays the note, and the nuns try to duplicate 
     it, but the results aren't much better than before. Christy 
     uses her pitchpipe; she circulates among the nuns, giving 
     each her note, urging them closer to pitch.

                               CHRISTY
               Middle section, hold that note, for dear 
               life.  Sopranos, an A.  Sister Alma?

     Sister Alma hits the note.  Christy shuffles a couple of 
     more nuns to other sections, then gets a third note going 
     with the altos, using her pitchpipe.

     For one moment, the nuns all realize they are singing a 
     perfect chord.  They are elated.

                               MARY PATRICK
               We did it!  We actually sang a chord!

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (thrilled and 
                             disconcerted)
               That was exciting!

                               CHRISTY
               Yeah, for one second.  That was the 
               blend -- you've got to listen to each 
               other.  Be a group.

                               MARY LAZARUS
                             (under her breath)
               I knew that.

                               CHRISTY
               Mary Lazarus, I get the feeling that you 
               like discipline.  Hard work.

     Page 65.

                               MARY LAZARUS
               Of course.  I'm a nun.  Four Popes now.  
               The Lord hates a loafer.

                               CHRISTY
               I hear you.  How many days a week do you 
               rehearse?

                               MARY PATRICK
               Two days.  An hour or so.

                               CHRISTY
               No way.  We're a choir, right? 
               Headliners.  The big room.  Two days a 
               week won't cut it.  Every day.

                               MARY LAZARUS
                             (impressed)
               She's good.

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (to Christy)
               Do you really think we could do it?  Get 
               better?

                               CHRISTY
               I don't know.  Mary Lazarus, what do you 
               think?  They're pretty raw.

                               MARY LAZARUS
               Wet behind the ears.

                               CHRISTY
               A bunch of real mama's girls.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Oh, please?  Can't we try?

     Christy and Mary Lazarus look at each other, as real 
     comrades.  Christy leans on Mary Lazarus' shoulder.

                               CHRISTY
               It'll be hell.

                               MARY LAZARUS
               Tell me about it.

     Christy and Mary Lazarus shake hands, firmly.  Christy 
     turns to the choir, very businesslike.

                               CHRISTY
               Ten-hut!

     INT. CONVENT LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY

     This is a basement utility room.     A large industrial 
     washer-dryer stands along one wall; the machine makes a 
     repetitive CHUNG-CHUNG sound

     Page 66.

     The choir nuns are busily doing laundry; some iron, others 
     fold sheets, others stack towels and garments on a long 
     table.  Christy is helping Mary Patrick fold a sheet.  
     Everyone is working rhythmically, to the drone of the 
     washer-dryer.

                               CHRISTY
               That machine.

                               MARY PATRICK
               I know.  It's ancient.

                               CHRISTY
               It's a rhythm section.  The beat.

     Christy starts clapping her hands to the sound of the 
     washer-dryer; gradually, the other nuns join her.

                               CHRISTY
               Mary Patrick -- do you remember the 
               Dixie Cups?

                               MARY PATRICK
               The Dixie Cups?  Oh my.  I was just a 
               girl.  Of course.
                             (singing)
               SPRING IS HERE
               THE SUN WILL SHINE

                               CHRISTY
                             (stopping the beat)
               Hold it.  Mary Patrick, you're a pretty 
               cheerful person, aren't you?

                               MARY PATRICK
               Am I?

     There is a murmur from all the other nuns -- "Oh, yes.

                               MARY PATRICK
                             (as a confession)
               All right, I am, I know it!  All my 
               life, I've just been... upbeat. 
               Optimistic.  Perky.  I can't help it. 
               Even when I was little, I remember my 
               mother used to say, "That child is pure 
               sunshine.  She'll either be a nun -- or a 
               stewardess."

                               CHRISTY
               So use it.  When we sing hymns, they're 
               usually about rejoicing, right? 
               Celebration.  Most music is.  So don't 
               hold back.  Let all that joy go right 
               into your voice.  Make me happy.  Let me 
               hear it.  Perk out.  Perk down.

     Page 67.

                               MARY PATRICK
                             (with real joy)
               SPRING IS HERE
               THE SUN WILL SHINE
               I'LL BE HIS
               AND HE'LL BE MINE
               WE'LL LOVE UNTIL
               THE END OF TIME
               AND WE'LL NEVER BE LONELY ANYMORE

                               CHRISTY
               Because we're

                               ALL THE NUNS
               GOING TO THE CHAPEL
               AND WE'RE GONNA GET MARRIED
               GOING TO THE CHAPEL
               AND WE'RE GONNA GET MARRIED
               GOING TO THE CHAPEL
               AND WE'RE GONNA GET MARRIED

                               MARY PATRICK
               GOING TO THE CHAPEL OF LOVE!

     The nuns have really gotten into the song, with Christy 
     encouraging them verbally.  They are sounding better and 
     better.

     SISTER MARY FREDERICK, a member of the choir, steps into 
     the laundry room and lets loose with a sudden, piercing 
     whistle.  The nuns immediately stop singing, and a moment 
     later Mother Superior enters.

     The room is quiet except for the sound of the washer-
     dryer. The nuns all get very busy at their laundry tasks.

                               NUNS
                             (in unison)
               Good morning, Reverend Mother.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Good morning, Sisters.

     Mother Superior takes one more glance around, then leaves.

     Now that the coast is clear, the singing begins again, 
     quietly, to the rhythm of the machine.

                               NUNS
               GOING TO THE CHAPEL...

     INT. CHAPEL

     Bishop O'Hara is leading the Sunday Mass.

                               BISHOP O'HARA
               Welcome this Sunday morning, 0 ye few 
               and faithful.

     Page 68.

     As usual, the chapel is almost empty, except for the nuns. 
     The choir is in place behind the pulpit.

                               BISHOP O'HARA
               The choir, I am told, has elected a new 
               director -- Sister Mary Clarence, who 
               will lead them in Hymn 127.

     Christy nods to the Bishop, and signals to Sister Alma, 
     who begins the accompaniment.

                               CHOIR
               LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
               LET THY SOUL BE HEALED

     They sound fantastic.  Their voices blend with a heavenly 
     harmony as they sing the slow, melodic hymn.  Mother 
     Superior is startled by this new sound.

     EXT. STREET

     Lawanda and her friends glance at the convent with 
     curiosity as the beautiful MUSIC drifts out to the street.  
     A few other heads turn, but with only mild reactions.

     INT. CHAPEL

     At the end of the first verse, Christy signals the choir 
     to stop.  There's a hush in the chapel as Christy glances 
     at the vacant pews.  Then she turns to Sister Alma and 
     nods. Sister Alma strikes a bold, stirring chord.

     Several of the nuns blink.  Bishop O'Hara glances at the 
     organ with surprise.  Mother Superior sits up with a 
     stiffened back and a severe expression.

     As the chord grows in force, Christy gives the choir a 
     beat.

                               CHRISTY
               One, two, three...

     The choir begins a radically new version of the same hymn. 
     Christy strides up and down in front of the choir, 
     transforming the song into a rousing gospel anthem, with a 
     passionate call-and-response format.

                               CHOIR
               LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED

                               CHRISTY
               What you say?

                               CHOIR
               LET THY SOUL BE HEALED

     Page 69.

                               CHRISTY
               But how?

                               CHOIR
               BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH

                               CHRISTY
               I think I hear it!

                               CHOIR
               LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED

                               CHRISTY
               You know, I just might!

                               CHOIR
               LET THY SOUL BE HEALED

                               CHRISTY AND CHOIR 
               LET THY SPIRIT TAKE WING AND FLY!

     Spontaneous reactions from everyone in the church.

     EXT. STREET

     The gorgeous, exciting MUSIC pours into the street.  
     Everyone turns to look.  Windows open and people glance 
     out. The street takes on a new movement.

     INT. CHAPEL

     The choir really lets loose flow.

                               CHRISTY AND CHOIR
               LET THY THOUGHTS BE STRENGTHENED
               LET THY PRAYERS BE HEARD
               LET OUR LORD REJOICE IN YOUR PRAISE
               LET HIS GOODNESS LIFT YOU TO A HIGHER 
               PLACE
               AND LET LOVE AND PEACE FILL YOUR DAYS

     Lawanda and her friends peer in at the back door of the 
     chapel.  Bishop O'Hara sees them, and beckons them to come 
     in.

                               CHRISTY
               Sister Alma!

     Sister Alma, inspired by Christy and the choir, burns up 
     the organ with a solo.  More people from the street begin 
     to enter; tentative, curious, drawn by the music.

     At the end of the solo, Christy makes a gesture to the 
     choir, and each member produces a tambourine.  The chapel 
     is full of energy, music and life.

                               CHRISTY
               Mary Robert!

     Page 70.

     Mary Robert sings, really letting the power of her voice 
     ring out.  She is astonishingly good.

                               MARY ROBERT
               LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
               LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
               BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH
               LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
               LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
               LET THY SOUL TAKE WING AND FLY!

     The new visitors to the church begin to clap in rhythm to 
     the music, and after a few beats, the nuns join in.  Mother 
     Superior is aghast.

     The choir builds to a huge gospel finish, all keeping 
     their eyes on Christy.

                               CHOIR
               LET THY SPIRIT

                               CHRISTY
               You know what we're saying!

                               CHOIR
               LET THY SPIRIT

                               CHRISTY
               I think they hear you!

                               MARY LAZARUS
               LET THY SPIRIT

                               CHRISTY AND CHOIR
               LET THY SPIRIT TAKE WING AND FLYI

     After the final note, everyone in the chapel is 
     exhilarated -- everyone except Mother Superior.  Christy 
     looks out at the congregation that has increased by a dozen 
     or more, including Lawanda and her friends.  Christy looks 
     happier than she has in years.

     INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

     The members of the choir are all gathered outside Mother 
     Superior's office, leaning close to the door and listening 
     to her harangue Christy.  They are surprised to find 
     themselves joined suddenly by Bishop O'Hara, and part to 
     let him through.  He leans down to the keyhole and listens.

     INT. OFFICE

     Mother Superior is livid.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Gospel.  A jazz solo on the organ.  What 
               next?  Jesus goes to Rio?  Good Friday-a-
               go-go?  What were you thinking?

     Page 71.

                               CHRISTY
               I was thinking Las Vegas.  Get some 
               butts in those seats.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               And what next?  Popcorn?  Curtain calls?  
               This is not a theater.  or a casino.

                               CHRISTY
                             (sincerely)
               Exactly.  People like going to theaters 
               and casinos.  But they think church is 
               for Grandma -- we could change that. Pack 
               the joint.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Through blasphemy?  You have corrupted 
               the entire choir!

                               CHRISTY
               Hold on.  That's not fair.  I worked 
               hard with them.  They gave up their free 
               time, and they loved it.  Those women are 
               happy.  And we can get even better.  We 
               can wake this place up.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Out of the question.

                               CHRISTY
               Please let me try.  I'm begging you.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               And I am refusing.  As of tomorrow, Mary 
               Lazarus will resume her leadership of
               the choir.

     Christy is crestfallen.  There is a KNOCK on the door, and 
     O'Hara enters.  The other members of the choir are in 
     behind him like sardines.

                               BISHOP O'HARA
               Reverend Mother, I just wanted to 
               congratulate you.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Oh?

                               BISHOP O'HARA
               I haven't enjoyed Mass this much in 
               years.  What a marvelous program. 
               Innovative.  Inspiring.  You are to be 
               commended.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Well... thank you.

     Page 72.

                               BISHOP O'HARA
               I can't wait until next Sunday, when the 
               choir performs again.  Did you see the
               people walk right in from the street? 
               That music, that heavenly music -- it 
               called to them.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Perhaps.

                               BISHOP O'HARA
               I must tell the Cardinal.  I.11 send him 
               a personal letter, describing your
               efforts, your bold new fight to keep 
               your little convent alive.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Really?

     Christy has just been eating this up with a spoon.

                               CHRISTY
               Excuse me, Bishop.  Reverend Mother has 
               some other ideas too.  She's too modest 
               to talk about it, but she thinks we 
               should get out of the convent and into 
               the neighborhood more.
                             (putting her hands on 
                             Mother Superior's 
                             shoulders) 
               This woman.

     Mary Patrick jumps forward.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Bless her!  There are so many problems 
               in this neighborhood that we could help 
               solve.  That's why many of us became 
               nuns.  It's marvelous, Reverend Mother.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
                             (confused by the turn 
                             things have taken)
               Really...

                               CHRISTY
                             (with regard to Mother 
                             Superior)
               You know Reverend Mother.  Hides her 
               light under a bushel.  She has plans for 
               us to move right onto the streets.  Get 
               to know people.  Work with 'em.

                               BISHOP O'HARA
                             (to Mother Superior)
               You're a pioneer.

     Page 73.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               But, Bishop, surely you realize -- this 
               is a most dangerous neighborhood.

                               O'HARA
               And you'll face that danger head-on.  As 
               if I could stop you.  And you have my 
               complete support in this matter. Anything 
               you can do to revitalize this 
               neighborhood would be a blessing.

                               CHRISTY
                             (hugging Mother 
                             Superior from behind)
               Don't you love her?

     EXT. CONVENT - DAY

     The nuns are out in force, painting the walls of the 
     convent, mostly with rainbows and flowers and bright, 
     shining suns.  The CAMERA PANS to Christy, who is adding 
     her own original touch to the mural, using cans of spray 
     paint.  Christy's section includes an image of a nun in a 
     miniskirt and spike heels, accompanied by neon letters that 
     read "St. Kate!"  People gather in the street, watching the 
     nuns' activities.  The convent begins to crackle with 
     energy and life.

     A drug deal is going on in a house up the street, but the 
     DEALERS give only a curious glance to the action at the 
     convent.

     INT. MOTHER SUPERIOR'S WINDOW

     From the window of her office, Mother Superior watches the 
     painters and feels her control slipping away.

     EXT. STREET - LATER

     Christy leads the members of the choir down the middle of 
     the street.  They get lots of attention each step of the 
     way.  As each nun raps, the other nuns make rhythmic boom-
     box noises.

                               CHRISTY
                             (rapping)
               WE'RE THE SISTERS OF THE SACRED HEART WE 
               DO OUR BIT, NOW DO YOUR PART

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (rapping)
               HONOR THY MOTHER AND THY FATHER TOO
               DON'T KILL, DON'T STEAL, IT'S BAD FOR 
               YOU

                               MARY PATRICK
                             (rapping)
               BELIEVE IN THE LORD, HIS WILL BE DONE
               COME TO CHURCH, IT'S TONS OF FUN

     Page 74.

                               MARY LAZARUS
                             (rapping)
               DIG DOWN DEEP, GIVE ALL YOU CAN
               TRUST ME, CHILDREN, THERE'S A HEAVENLY 
               PLAN!

     The parade goes on, the crowd gathers, and a general air 
     of jubilance prevails.

     INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY

     The rehearsal room is filled with high energy as the choir 
     is separated into several groups.  Christy has got the 
     whole thing running like a disciplined Broadway cast.

     Mary Patrick leads one group in the corner as they 
     practice synchronized movements with tambourines.  Colorful 
     streamers are tied to the tambourines, and they make 
     colorful patterns in the air.

     Sister Alma pounds the piano with newfound energy, as Mary 
     Robert and the sopranos reach higher and higher for notes 
     they've only dreamed of in the past.

     Christy and Mary Lazarus have corralled the rest of the 
     nuns into a practice of intricate dance steps, somewhat 
     like the Temptations in skirts.  Mary Lazarus keeps the 
     beat with a yardstick.

                               CHRISTY
               Don't look at your feet, and I don't 
               want to see anybody counting.  Make it 
               look easy.  Again!

                               MARY LAZARUS
               Right, right, cross with the left, spin 
               and turn!

                               CHRISTY 
               Hopeless I

                               MARY LAZARUS
               Amateurs 2

                               CHRISTY
               Babies

                               MARY LAZARUS
               Again!

     EXT. CRACK HOUSE - NIGHT

     One of the drug dealers stands outside the crack house as 
     a car suddenly pulls up to the curb.  He starts toward the 
     car as the DRIVER rolls down the window, but before he gets 
     there, Christy and several nuns surround the car.

     Page 75.

                               CHRISTY
               We're here to pray for you, brother.

                               DEALER
               What?  Get the hell out of here.

                               CHRISTY
               We know you don't want to sell drugs.  
               You just had an unhappy childhood, and 
               maybe a learning disability.  You just 
               need someone to pray for you.

                               MARY PATRICK
               We know you don't want to bring pain and 
               misery to your friends and neighbors. 
               We'll pray to find you some honest work.

                               CHRISTY
               And we know that, even though most 
               people would call you a leech and a 
               parasite, the lowest slug of humanity! We 
               know that deep down inside, you're 
               probably even worse.  And so you truly 
               need our prayers.

                               DRIVER
               What is this?  Outta my way!

     The nuns give him room, and the Driver zips off down the 
     street.  A small crowd has begun to gather, and it is 
     growing by the moment, murmuring encouragement for the 
     nuns.  Christy turns to the Dealer, as other cars drive 
     slowly past.

                               CHRISTY
               Yes, prayer is the answer, and prayers 
               free  We're going to give free prayers to 
               everyone who drives up to this house.

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (to the Dealer)
               We're nuns!

                               MARY PATRICK
                             (to cruising cars)
               Free prayers right over here!  Drive up 
               and get your prayers!

                               DEALER
               You're hassling my customers!  That's 
               not legal!  I know my rights.  This is 
               restriction of trade.

                               CHRISTY
               You wanna call a cop?

     Page 76.

     The Dealer's eyes turn ugly as he takes a gun from his 
     pocket.  Mary Patrick steps forward.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Are you going to shoot us all, tough 
               guy?

                               MARY LAZARUS
               Is it worth it?  A lot of witnesses 
               here.

                               CHRISTY
                             (to the crowd)
               Can I get a witness?

     The Dealer glances at the surly crowd, then gives the nuns 
     a disgusted look.  He puts the gun away.

                               DEALER
               So I'll find another neighborhood to do 
               my business.  You can' t stop me.

                               CHRISTY
               If we can stop you here, they can stop 
               you there.

     The Dealer turns and walks back to his house with anger. 
     The crowd APPLAUDS and CHEERS.

     The picture suddenly becomes GRAINY, and we hear the voice 
     of a NEWS REPORTER.

                               NEWS REPORTER (V.0.)
               It was a truly remarkable scene, as the 
               nuns from St. Katherine's literally drove 
               the crack dealers from the neighborhood, 
               led by the feisty Sister Mary Clarence.

     CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see a TV screen with an image of 
     the nuns and neighbors still celebrating.  On top of the TV 
     are several framed photographs of Vince Laflocca, his wife 
     and children.

     INT. VINCE LaROCCA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

     CONNIE LaROCCA, Vince's wife, watches the TV NEWS STORY 
     and calls to Vince in the kitchen.

                               CONNIE
               Vinnie, get in here.  You gotta see 
               this!

     Carrying a roast beef sandwich and a can of beer, Vince 
     appears from the kitchen and glances at the TV screen to 
     see a shot of the convent.  He looks at Connie and makes a 
     sour face.

     Page 77.

                               VINCE
               What?  Nuns?  You got me in here to see 
               nuns?  Isn't there a ball game on or 
               something?

     Vince turns away from the TV just as a closeup of Christy 
     appears on the screen.

                               CONNIE
               Look -- she's adorable!

     Vince leaves the room, and we see Christy again as she 
     leads the choir.

     INT. EDDIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     Eddie is cooking spaghetti in his efficiency apartment and 
     watching the NEWS on TV at the same time.  He pours himself 
     a glass of wine and stirs the spaghetti sauce.

                               NEWS REPORTER
               This tiny convent has experienced an 
               amazing turnaround.  The sisters have 
               revitalized and taken back their 
               neighborhood, all due to the energy and 
               talent of the convent choir, a group led 
               by this gifted young nun.  Tell us, Mary 
               Clarence1 what makes you so special?

                               CHRISTY
                             (trying to appear 
                             modest and nun-like)
               Oh, I'm not special, Bob.  It's just 
               hard work... and prayer.

     Eddie all but spits out his wine.  His eyes are wide as he 
     watches Christy being interviewed.  In one stride, he grabs 
     his hat and coat and is out the door on the run.

     EXT. CONVENT - DAY

     The Sunday morning bell is CHIMING as crowds of people 
     stream into the convent.  The entire neighborhood looks 
     cleaner, and the people walk with a spring in their step. 
     Three local TV stations have remote news crews on the scene 
     doing follow-ups on the story.

     INT. CHAPEL HALLWAY

     Last in line, Christy follows the other choir members down 
     a hallway toward the chapel.  Suddenly, a hand reaches out 
     and grabs her, and a second hand covers her mouth as she is 
     pulled into an empty cell.

     INT. CELL

     Shocked and terrified, Christy struggles to free herself, 
     but is suddenly relieved to see that her abductor is Eddie.

     Page 78.

     Eddie releases her, and she falls onto the bed.

                               CHRISTY
               Eddie!  You scared the hell out of me!

                               EDDIE
               What if I was Vince?  You'd be dead 
               right now.  What are you doing giving 
               interviews on TV?

                               CHRISTY
               It wasn't my fault!  They just showed 
               up.  It's helping the convent.

                               EDDIE
               You're supposed to be hiding out!

                               CHRISTY
               I really can't talk about it now.  The 
               place is packed.  SRO.  I've got a show 
               to do.

                               EDDIE
               Listen to yourself.  This isn't a career 
               opportunity.

                               CHRISTY
               I know that.  This isn't about me.  It's 
               about the choir.  You should hear them.
               They're good.  Really good.  And I 
               taught them.

                               EDDIE
               Jesus, look at you   You're glowing.

                               CHRISTY
               I am?

                               EDDIE
               Yeah.  You look... great.  I mean it..

                               CHRISTY
                             (flirting)
               Really?  Lieutenant?

                               EDDIE 
               I've been worried about you.

     Eddie sits on the bed beside Christy.

                               CHRISTY
               You mean -- worried about my testimony?

                               EDDIE
               No -- worried about you.  Personally.

     Page 79.

                               CHRISTY
               Well..  thanks.  I've been thinking 
               about you.. - sometimes.  I mean, there 
               aren't a lot of guys around here.  I 
               mean, sometimes I feel like... a nun.

                               EDDIE
               Me too.

                               CHRISTY
               You're not... seeing anybody?

                               EDDIE
               No.  Most of the time I'm thinking about 
               you.  And now... you've really changed.

                               CHRISTY
               I have?

                               EDDIE
               You re sort of... radiant.   your eyes 
               are shining.  You're rea1ly different...

     Eddie and Christy are gazing into each other's eyes; they 
     are just about to kiss.  Their lips are less than an inch 
     apart.

                               EDDIE
               You're... you're a nun.

     Eddie and Christy jump apart, their intimacy has 
     frightened them both, particularly given Christy's outfit, 
     and their location.

                               CHRISTY
               We're in a convent!

     Christy goes to the door.

                               CHRISTY
               I've got to go.

                               EDDIE
               Just remember - you're a target.  Don't 
               you think Vince has a T.V.?

                               CHRISTY
                             (trying to think 
                             straight)
               I know, I know.  I'll be careful.  I'll 
               try.

     Christy begins to leave, and then she turns, filled with a 
     performer's excitement.

                               CHRISTY
               Magic time!

     Page 80.

     Christy hurries toward the chapel, leaving Eddie to shake 
     his head and wonder.

     INT. CHAPEL

     Sister Alma plays the organ, and the choir hums quietly as 
     Christy addresses the congregation.  Cameras from several 
     TV stations are focussed on her from various places in the 
     chapel.

                               CHRISTY
               This Sunday's hymn is inspired by the 
               lesson of Mary Magdalene.  You know the 
               one.  Mary Magdalene was a young lady 
               with a past.  She was no stranger to sin.  
               She was no stranger to practically 
               everybody.  Many condemned her.  The 
               whole neighborhood.  But one man refused 
               to do so.  One man said, hey now, wait a 
               minute.  Listen to the story.

     Sister Alma starts playing a doo-wop vamp.  Mary Patrick 
     and Mary Robert step forward from the choir, standing 
     beside Christy the way the Ronelles used to do.

                               CHRISTY
               Hey, girls. 

                               MARY PATRICK AND ROBERT
               Hail, Mary.

                               CHRISTY
               Jerusalem is a real drag.  Everybody 
               hates me.

                               MARY PATRICK AND ROBERT
               Oh-huh.

                               CHRISTY
               People throw stones.  They call me 
               names.  I mean, really.

                               MARY PATRICK AND ROBERT
               Really.

                               CHRISTY
               But -- wait.

                               MARY PATRICK
               What is it, Mary?

                               CHRISTY
               That man -- who is he?

                               MARY ROBERT
               He's a carpenter.

     Page 81

                               MARY PATRICK
               He's not like other guys.

                               MARY ROBERT
               He's decent.

                               MARY PATRICK
               He's kind.

                               CHRISTY
               He's... dreamy.  He's...

                               CHOIR
               Yes, Mary?

                               CHRISTY
               HE'S SO FINE...

     The full choir sings back-up while Christy, Mary Patrick 
     and Mary Robert perform intricate girl group choreography.

                               CHOIR
               DOO- LANG, DOO-LANG, DOO- LANG.

                               CHRISTY/MARY ROBERT/ MARY PATRICK
               WISH HE WAS MINE
               THAT HANDSOME GUY OVER THERE
               THE ONE WITH THE WAVY HAIR

     Sister Alma is surrounded by several STREET KIDS who play 
     guitar, bass and drums to accompany the organ and choir.

     Lawanda and her friends sit in a pew, moving joyously to 
     the music.

     Eddie stands in the back of the chapel, watching a Christy 
     he has never seen before.  Christy is now glowing with 
     happiness and confidence.

     As the song continues, we see the chapel is packed to the 
     rafters.  A tin bucket is passed around as a collection 
     plate, and it overflows with money.

     EXT. CONVENT

     Church services are over, and happy people stream out of 
     the convent, but they don't hurry home.  Standing in 
     groups, they talk pleasantly and make plans for the day. 
     There is a real sense of neighborhood up and down the 
     block.

     Eddie comes down the steps, glances back at the convent, 
     smiles to himself, then crosses the street to his car.

     Page 82.

     INT. CHAPEL

     Christy and the choir stare at the collection plate that 
     is filled with money.

                               CHRISTY
               Jackpot!  Two buckets

                               MARY PATRICK
               This is so exhilarating!  All week long, 
               I can't wait till Sunday, when we sing.

                               MARY ROBERT
               I'd rather sing than do anything!

                               MARY PATRICK
               It's better than ice cream.

                               MARY ROBERT
               It's better than springtime.

                               CHRISTY
               It's better than sex!

     Everyone looks at Christy with astonishment.

                               CHRISTY
                             (catching herself)
               I imagine.

     Everyone's attention suddenly turns to Bishop O'Hara as he 
     approaches.

                               O'HARA
               Better and better, Sisters, you are 
               truly an inspiration.  And I bear 
               gladsome tidings.

     The choir gathers around O'Hara with curiosity.

                               O'HARA
               I've kept the Cardinal informed of your 
               progress in the neighborhood.  He has 
               been most impressed.  And he has invited 
               you to attend a special evening Mass at 
               St. Matthew's Cathedral on Sunday night1 
               to sing for the Council of Cardinals.

     The choir reacts with an excited buzz:  "The Council of 
     Cardinals!", "What shall we sing?", etc.

     Mother Superior appears, from the center aisle.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               That is indeed glorious news, Bishop. We 
               will be honored to appear.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR (CONT'D)
               And on such an occasion, I feel a 
               completely traditional program will be 
               best.

                               CHRISTY
               What do you mean?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               The council of Cardinals is perhaps the 
               most esteemed body in the entire Catholic 
               church.  They command the utmost respect.  
               Your more... secular entertainment would 
               be wholly out of place.

                               MARY PATRICK
               But, Reverend Mother -- everyone loves 
               our new style.

                               MARY ROBERT
               It's brought people back to the church.

                               CHRISTY
               Isn't that why we were asked to sing for 
               those Cardinals?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               I believe this can be settled by a 
               simple vote.

                               CHRISTY
               A vote?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Of course.  Mary Clarence, a convent is 
               not a totalitarian state.  Most major 
               decisions are made by the membership as a 
               whole.  A membership that, I am certain, 
               will vote in a rational and pious manner.  
               All those in favor of allowing Mary 
               Clarence to select a program?

     All the nuns look at one another.  Then, slowly, one by 
     one, they all raise their hands.

     Mother Superior is pure steel at this moment; her 
     expression betrays no emotion.  Christy, on the other hand, 
     is quite confused.

                               CHRISTY
               But... wait a minute...

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               The majority has spoken.

     Page 84.

                               BISHOP O'HARA
               Reverend Mother, as always, you are a 
               true leader.  Gracious and understanding.

                               MARY ROBERT
               It will be wonderful, Reverend Mother. 
               You'll see.

                               MARY LAZARUS
                             (gesturing to Christy)
               She's a pro.

                               CHRISTY
               What?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               I am certain the presentation will be a 
               great success.  Congratulations, Mary 
               Clarence.  And congratulations to you 
               all.

     The nuns cheer, and cluster around Christy, chattering 
     about the upcoming concert, as Mother Superior strides off.

     INT. MOTHER SUPERIOR'S OFFICE - DAY

     Seated at her desk, Mother Superior glances up as Christy 
     enters.

                               CHRISTY
               You sent for me?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               You have a phone call.

     Mother Superior continues with her paperwork as Christy 
     picks up the phone.

                               CHRISTY
               Hello?

                               EDDIE'S VOICE
               Good news, kid.  I pulled a few strings 
               the judge has agreed to move the trial
               up.  We'll be in court in a couple of 
               days.

     With mixed emotions, Christy speaks softly.

                               CHRISTY
               That soon?

     Mother Superior is a very interested eavesdropper.

                               EDDIE'S VOICE
               Forty-eight hours -- and you'll be a 
               free woman.

     Page 85.

                               CHRISTY
               Great.  That's good to hear.

                               EDDIE'S VOICE
               Hey, don't thank me or anything.

                               CHRISTY
               Right, right -- thanks.

     Christy hangs up the phone.  She looks at Mother Superior.

                               CHRISTY
               Hey -- your prayers have been answered.  
               I'm leaving.  In just a couple of days.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Really.  Well, that makes two of us.

                               CHRISTY
               What?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               I have submitted my resignation to 
               Bishop O'Hara.  Privately.  I have asked 
               to be relocated as soon as possible.

                               CHRISTY
               But -- why?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               I must go where I can be of use.

                               CHRISTY
               But -- there's so much more to do right 
               here.  And look, if it's about me, I 
               mean, I'm gone.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Indeed.  After how long?  A few weeks?  
               I have been here thirty years.  And yet, 
               it would seem, I know nothing.

                               CHRISTY
               But everything that's happening is good!  
               You can be a part of it!

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               A part of what?  Mary Clarence, it is 
               one thing to rabble rouse, to sweep into 
               town and declare a holiday.  You have 
               raised the Sisters' expectations, you 
               have excited and confused them.  They 
               imagine this neighborhood to be some sort 
               of delightful ongoing block party.

                             (MORE)

     Page 86.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR (CONT'D)
               You and I know that life is not so 
               simple.  There will be disappointments.  
               Rude shocks.  And you will have vanished.  
               How... fortunate.

                               CHRISTY
               Okay, so I just got things started.  But 
               you could build on that.  You could keep 
               it going.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               I am sorry, Mary Clarence.  I seem to 
               have misplaced my tambourine.  Good day, 
               Mary Clarence.

                               CHRISTY
               But...

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Good day.

     Christy, frustrated, leaves the room.  Mother Superior 
     looks up, she is truly torn, a proud woman unsure of her 
     choices.

     EXT. CONVENT - NIGHT

     The moon casts shafts of silver light down to the 
     courtyard of the convent.  Most of the lights in the 
     neighborhood are out at this late hour.

                               CHRISTY'S VOICE
                             (whispering)
               Come on... I've got a surprise...

     INT. CONVENT KITCHEN - NIGHT

     The kitchen is dark, lit only by a flickering candle 
     carried by Christy.  Three more candles appear, carried by 
     Mary Robert, Mary Patrick and Mary Lazarus.  The door to 
     the freezer opens, and light spills out.  Christy removes 
     several pints of ice cream and distributes them to the 
     nuns.

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (delighted)
               Ice cream!

                               MARY PATRICK
               Mary Clarence -- you shouldn't have. 
               Where did you get this?

                               MARY LAZARUS
               It's a sin.  It's a wicked indulgence. 
               Is this butter almond?

     Page 87.

     Christy and the nuns sit on stools, enjoying their ice 
     cream by candlelight.

                               CHRISTY
               It's contraband.  Don't ask.  But I 
               wanted to give you a treat.  A sort of... 
               thank-you gift.

                               MARY ROBERT
               A thank-you?  For what?  You're the one 
               we should be thanking.

                               MARY LAZARUS
               Is there any syrup?

                               CHRISTY
               Well... see, at my old convent, I wasn't 
               always... real popular.  I was sort of 
               selfish and... not real helpful.  Okay, 
               I'll say it -- I wasn't much of a nun. 
               But now, thanks to all of you... maybe 
               I'm shaping up.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Mary Clarence, don't be silly.  You're 
               an example to us all.  You've taught us 
               so much.  We're singing for the 
               Cardinals, and then -- who knows?  Maybe 
               the choir can travel -- to schools, and 
               nursing homes.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Maybe we can get some of the local kids 
               to sing with us.

                               MARY LAZARUS
               We could cut a demo.  Look for a label.

                               CHRISTY
                             (knowing she has to 
                             leave)
               That's true, wouldn't that be great.  Of 
               course, we never know when things are 
               going to change.  Any one of us could be 
               transferred to another convent, tomorrow.

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (worried)
               Are you leaving us?

                               CHRISTY
                             (sincerely)
               Oh no.  We'll always be together.

                               MARY LAZARUS
               That's what Diana Ross said.

     Page 88.

     Christy and the nuns qiggle, and continue eating their ice 
     cream, in a spirit of true friendship.

     Mother Superior watches this scene, hidden in the shadows 
     by the door to the kitchen.  She has begun to see Christy 
     in a new light.  She looks thoughtful, and walks off.

     INT. LAS VEGAS POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY

     Tate sits at his desk in the detective room, reading the 
     sports section.  HENRY PARKER, the accountant for the 
     police department, looks stressful as he enters the room 
     and heads for Eddie's glassed-in office.  Tate glances up 
     as Parker passes his desk.

                               TATE
               You're too late.  Mulcahy just left.

                               PARKER
               I need his signature on some things. 
               They can't be processed without it.

                               TATE
               Leave 'em.  He'll sign 'em later.

     Parker looks annoyed -- he doesn't like deviations from 
     procedure -- but after a moment of indecision, he sets the 
     file folder on Tate's desk and walks away.

     Tate finishes the newspaper and shoves it aside.  Bored, 
     looks at his watch, then flips the file folder open and 
     glances at its contents;  routine money vouchers for 
     equipment, supplies, etc.  Tate is about to close the 
     folder and shove it aside when something catches his eye.

                               TATE
               What the hell is this...?

     He examines a money voucher for a generous donation to St. 
     Katherine's Convent in San Francisco.  It only takes a 
     moment to put two and two together, and Tate scrambles for 
     his phone and dials a number.

     INT. CORRIDOR

     Henry Parker waits for the elevator.  When it opens, he's 
     surprised to see Eddie step out.

                               PARKER
               Tate said you were gone.

                               EDDIE
               I get all the way down to my car, and, 
               of course -- where are the keys?

     Page 89.

                               PARKER
               I left the money vouchers with him.  He 
               said you'd sign them in the morning.

     Eddie nods and moves on as Parker enters the elevator. 
     After a few steps, Eddie suddenly looks disturbed.  He 
     picks up his pace.  A little panicky, he begins to jog 
     toward the squad room.

     INT. VINCE'S OFFICE

     Vince is on the telephone.  He signals Joey and Willy, and 
     they move quickly toward him.

                               VINCE
               This is it.  Get ready to move.  No 
               mistakes.  Grab her, get her to the 
               Moonlight.  We meet there, and we take 
               care of her.
                             (into phone)
               We're on it.  Give me the address.

     Vince begins to write down the address.

     INT. SQUAD ROOM

     Tate is hunched over the telephone, talking quietly with 
     his back to the rest of the room.  The voucher for St. 
     Katherine's is in his hand as Eddie moves quickly toward 
     him.

                               TATE
               St. Katherine's Convent on East Barton. 
               It's gotta be the place.

     Tate hangs up the phone and BOOM!  Eddie hits him from 
     behind like a linebacker, drilling him to the floor.  Other 
     detectives look up from their desks with confusion and 
     alarm.  Eddie pins Tate to the wall and snatches the 
     voucher from his hand.

                               EDDIE
               You're the leak, you son-of-a-bitch!

     Clarkson and another detective restrain Eddie before he 
     can hit Tate.

                               EDDIE
               Get him out of here!  Downstairs, in the 
               cell!  I want his ass locked up now!

     Nobody dares even question Eddie at this moment, and two 
     detectives drag Tate away.  Eddie grabs Tate's phone and 
     dials long distance.

                               EDDIE
               Clarkson, get on the other line.  Call 
               Frisco Central.  Tell 'em to get two 
               squad cars outside St. Katherine's 
               convent, and stop anybody with an out-of-
               state license plate from getting near the 
               place.

     Clarkson dials quickly.  Eddie listens to Tate's telephone 
     as it RINGS and RINGS and RINGS.

     INT. CONVENT - DAY

     All the nuns are in the chapel as the choir rehearses a 
     hymn, along with Gina and her girlfriends.  Those who are 
     not in the choir clap their hands in rhythm.  War in the 
     background, we can hear the telephone RINGING.

     EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

     Eddie's police car streaks past an entrance ramp with the 
     SIREN screaming.  It blazes through traffic, weaving in and 
     out at breakneck speeds.  A moment later, Joey and Willy 
     pull onto the highway at a fast rate.  The race is on, with 
     Eddie securely in the lead.

     INT. CONVENT - DAY

     In the rehearsal room, the choir members are putting on 
     their robes.  Christy and several nuns are all trying to 
     primp in front of one small mirror.

                               MARY ROBERT
               The Council of Cardinals!  I'm so 
               nervous!  What if I forget the words?

                               CHRISTY
               Right to Hell.  Just kidding. Where is 
               that bus?

                               MARY PATRICK
               It should be here any minute.

                               MARY LAZARUS
                             (with a clipboard)
               Dress rehearsal at four, performance at 
               8:30.  Sharp.

     Christy looks out the window, but sees no bus.

     EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

     Eddie's police car streaks toward L.A.

     Page 91.

     EXT. CONVENT - DAY

     The neighborhood has turned out to see the choir off.  
     Banners hang from the fire escapes of the building across 
     the street:  "ST. KATE'S - THE GREATEST!", "GOOD LUCK 
     TONIGHT!"

     A Catholic school bus pulls up to the convent and parks in 
     front.  Several nuns in choir robes come outside and hurry 
     onto the bus.  A moment later, Eddie's police car streaks 
     up to the side entrance of the convent, parking around the 
     corner from the bus.

     INT. CONVENT

     Eddie runs into the convent and finds Mother Superior at 
     the bottom of the stairs.

                               EDDIE
               Reverend Mother!  Quick!  Where's 
               Christy?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               What's wrong?

                               EDDIE
               They know she's here!   They're on their 
               way!

     Mother Superior points up the stairs.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               The rehearsal room!

     Mother Superior looks alarmed as Eddie takes the stairs 
     two at a time.

     INT. REHEARSAL ROOM

     Looking out the window, Mary Robert sees the bus.

                               MARY ROBERT
               It's here!  Let's go!

     Everyone makes a final check of their appearance, and then 
     the group leaves the room to head for the bus.  Mary Robert 
     and Mary Patrick are the last to leave, except for Christy.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Hurry, Sister!

                               CHRISTY
               Get moving.  I'm right behind you.

     Christy primps in the mirror one last time, then leaves 
     the room.  She is puzzled to suddenly see Eddie running 
     toward her from a side staircase.

     Page 92.

                               CHRISTY
               Eddie...?

     Eddie grabs her hand and pulls her toward the side 
     staircase.

                               EDDIE
               Vince knows you're here.

                               CHRISTY
                             (shocked and scared)
               How?

                               EDDIE
               Long story.  His goons will be here any 
               minute.  We've got to get you out of here 
               '- now!

     Christy and Eddie hurry down the steps to the side 
     entrance, and she almost trips on her choral robes.  Eddie 
     opens the door and starts outside, but Christy stops in her 
     tracks.

                               CHRISTY
               I can't go with you.

                               EDDIE
               What?

                               CHRISTY
               I've got a show -- at St. Matthew's 
               Cathedral.  We're singing for the 
               Cardinals.

                               EDDIE
               You're gonna be singing for St. Peter if 
               you don't get your ass out of here!

     Eddie jerks her hand, and Christy follows him reluctantly 
     to the car.

     INT. EDDIE'S CAR

     Eddie takes off at a fast clip up the street.  As the car 
     cruises through an intersection, Christy looks back at the 
     bus with confusion and sadness.  She sees the other nuns 
     rushing back into the convent to look for her.

     INT. REHEARSAL ROOM

     Several members of the choir rush into the room with panic 
     in their eyes.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Mary Clarence!  Sister!

                               MARY ROBERT
               It's no use.  She just isn't here.

     Page 93.

                               MARY PATRICK
               It doesn't make any sense.  She was 
               right behind me...

     The HORN on the school bus blows loudly down in the 
     street.

                               MARY ROBERT
               We can't sing without her!  What should 
               we do?

                               MARY PATRICK
                             (calming herself)
               We'll pray -- and she'll be there.

     The nuns are calmed by the tone of Mary Patrick's voice. 
     They leave the room to join the others on the bus.

     EXT. STREET - DAY

     Eddie's police car streaks through crowded streets.

     INT. EDDIE'S CAR

     Christy still looks unsettled.

                               CHRISTY
               Eddie -- I've got to go back.  They 
               won't sing without me.  I'm deserting 
               them.

                               EDDIE
               I think they'd understand.

                               CHRISTY
               That's not the point!  They need me!

     Eddie glances at her, impressed by the influence the 
     convent has had.

                               EDDIE
               They need you?  A bunch of nuns?  For 
               what?  Moral guidance?  Make-up tips?

                               CHRISTY
               You don't get it!  It's a big thing for 
               them, it's like... Caesar's Palace. 
               Prime-time.  They're singing for the 
               Cardinals.  It's like... "Star Search." 
               If first prize was a trip to the Vatican.  
               They've worked really hard, they deserve 
               this.

                               EDDIE
                             (goading her)
               Nuns?

     Page 94.

                               CHRISTY
               They're not nuns.  They're like.. 
               people.  With one outfit.

     EXT. CONVENT - DAY

     Joey and Willy park their car in front of the convent, get 
     out quickly and climb the steps to the front door.  They 
     ring the bell.

                               JOEY
               So that guy in the bar was right?  She's 
               like... some kind of nun?

                               WILLY
               Yeah, right -- when I see it.

     Lawanda and her friends watch Joey and Willy pounding on 
     the convent door.

                               LAWANDA
               You dudes looking for nuns?  They all 
               went to St. Matthew's.

                               JOEY
               St, Matthew's?  Thanks.

                               LAWANDA
               Praise the Lord.

     Joey and Willy run past the girls, get into their car and 
     take off.

     INT. EDDIE'S CAR - DAY

     Eddie glances at the dashboard and sees that the fuel 
     gauge is close to empty.  He wheels into a gas station and 
     pulls up to the tanks.  Christy starts to open the door, 
     but he stops her.

                               EDDIE
               What're you doing?

                               CHRISTY
               Even nuns have to pee.

     He lets her go, then gets out to pump gas.

     INT. WOMEN'S ROOM

     Christy enters the bathroom; it is deserted.  She fondles 
     her rosary beads, and sinks to her knees.  This position 
     doesn't work for her; she stands.  She looks around her; 
     she glances up, toward heaven.  She decides to do things 
     simply, and speaks in a matter-of-fact tone.

     Page 95.

                               CHRISTY
               Okay, it's me.  Mary Clarence.  Christy. 
               It's Chris Carter.  I need some help 
               here.  I can't believe I'm doing this. 
               Okay, look, I know I should just get back 
               in the car, and get the hell out of here.  
               Save my skin.  I mean, it's not wrong, 
               Vince really wants to kill me. Why do you 
               make guys like Vince?  But if I don't 
               sing at St. Matthew's... Mary Robert.  
               Mary Patrick.  It means so much to them.  
               They're counting on me -- and I like 
               that.  Maybe Reverend Mother is right, 
               maybe I am a bad influence, maybe I'm 
               just some Vegas slut, but... can we cut a 
               deal here?  I mean, I still don't believe 
               in, like, most of the Commandments, and 
               stuff in church still gives me the 
               willies, but -- if I go back and sing, if 
               I do a good deed, will you promise I 
               won't get killed?  All I want is a sign.  
               Lightning.  Thunder. Anything.

     Suddenly, Christy hears the toilet FLUSH in the next 
     bathroom.

                               CHRISTY
                             (in disbelief)
               No.  No.  Doesn't count...

     Suddenly, Christy hears "AVE MARIA" coming from a radio or 
     TV outside the bathroom.  She looks up; a ray of sunlight 
     illuminates a grimy, dime-store Christmas tree ornament 
     hanging from a room deodorizer.  The ornament is a glittery 
     angel; it sparkles in the light.

     Christy leaves the bathroom, still not quite sure.

     EXT. GAS STATION

     Christy looks through the grimy window of the gas station 
     office.  A bored Mechanic is watching a small portable TV. 
     On the TV is an episode of "THE FLYING NUN":  Sally Field, 
     in full habit, is soaring along.

     Suddenly, Christy hears the loud ROAR of a motorcycle 
     starting up over by one of the gas pumps.  The BIKER turns 
     and looks at Christy:  he has long hair, and a beard and 
     moustache, and he looks, well, a bit like Jesus.

                               CHRISTY
               Oh my God...

     Christy runs up to the Biker..

                               CHRISTY
               I'm late for church.  Can I get a lift?

     Page 96.

     Christy swings onto the back seat; the Biker puts his 
     Harley in gear and flies down the street.  Eddie is shocked 
     as he drops some money on the ground and jumps into his car 
     to follow.

     EXT. ST. MATTHEW'S CATHEDRAL - DAY

     We see a network truck parked in front of the landmark 
     cathedral.

     INT. CHAPEL

     There is a sense of chaos in the chapel as TECHNICIANS set 
     up television equipment, and Mother Superior leads the 
     choir as it rehearses.  Near the back of the chapel, Bishop 
     O'Hara looks concerned over the performance of the choir. A 
     CARDINAL walks up to Bishop O'Hara.

                               CARDINAL
               Is this the choir you've been speaking 
               so highly of, Bishop?

                               O'HARA
               They're just a bit nervous.  They'll be 
               fine.

     The choir seems very demoralized as they finish the hymn. 
     Mary Patrick is close to tears.

                               MARY PATRICK
               We sound terrible   We need Mary 
               Clarence.

                               MARY LAZARUS
               We're losing it.

                               MARY ROBERT
               I don't understand.  Where is she?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Her whereabouts are unknown, and we must 
               proceed without her.  Pull yourselves 
               together.

     Clapping his hands briskly, the FLOOR DIRECTOR suddenly 
     steps forward from behind the TV cameras and hustles the 
     choir away from the altar.

                               FLOOR DIRECTOR
               Okay, Sisters, we have to move on now. 
               That was great, just great.  Charlie, 
               throw a spot on the pulpit.  Let's get a 
               balance.

     Dispirited, the choir leaves the altar and walks toward 
     the back of the church.

     Page 97.

     EXT. LOS ANGELES STREET

     The motorcycle flies through the streets, breaking every 
     traffic law on the books.  Christy's robe flaps behind her 
     in the wind, and she has a wide smile as she rides.  As 
     passersby stare at her, she holds out two fingers and 
     blesses them.

     EXT. ST. MATTHEW'S CATHEDRAL

     Mary Robert stands alone in front of the cathedral, 
     wringing her hands with worry.  Suddenly, her face 
     brightens like the dawn as she sees Christy ride up.

                               MARY ROBERT
               You're here!  Thank goodness!

     INT. CATHEDRAL

     Christy and Mary Robert rush down a side corridor, turn a 
     corner and see two TV Technicians standing near some cables 
     with the letters of the network embroidered on the backs of 
     their jackets.  Christy rushes up to them and taps them on 
     the shoulders.

                               CHRISTY
               Excuse me -- where's the rehearsal room?

     The two Technicians turn toward her, and she is horrified 
     to see they are. Joey and Willy.  Christy gasps as Willy 
     sticks a gun in her ribs.  Joey smiles at her.

                               JOEY
               The rehearsal room is right this way.

     Joey opens a door that leads to an alley behind the 
     cathedral.  Mary Robert looks confused.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Wait, this isn't the way.  Who are you?

                               CHRISTY
               They're from my old convent.

     Christy suddenly lifts her knee into Willy's groin, and he 
     buckles over.  She scrambles for the gun, but Joey beats 
     her to it.  Christy looks frantically at Mary Robert.

                               CHRISTY
               Run!  Take off! 

                               MARY ROBERT
               Again?

     Revived Willy lunges for Mary Robert and grabs her.  The 
     two men hustle the two struggling nuns out the door to the 
     alley.

     Page 98.

     EXT. ALLEY - DAY

     Joey and Willy wrestle the two nuns to the open door of 
     their car.  They shove Christy and Mary Robert into the 
     back seat, and Willy climbs in next to them.

                               WILLY
               Go!

     Joey starts the car, and it takes off with SQUEALING 
     tires.  Willy has his gun pointed at Christy, who sits 
     beside Mary Robert.

                               MARY ROBERT
               But what do they want?  Where are we 
               going?

                               CHRISTY
                             (to Joey and Willy)
               She's got nothing to do with this.  Let 
               her go.

                               JOEY
               Yeah, right to the cops.  No way.

                               CHRISTY
               Mary Robert, don't panic.  Remember what 
               we talked about?  Experience?

                               JOEY
               What?

                               CHRISTY
                             (quickly, to Mary 
                             Robert)
               You can handle this.

     The car comes to a stop at an intersection.  Christy 
     reaches across Mary Robert and opens the car door.  She 
     shoves Mary Robert into the street.

                               CHRISTY
               Go!

     Mary Robert executes a perfect somersault onto the 
     sidewalk.  She looks to heaven, crosses herself and runs 
     back to the cathedral.

     Willy grabs Christy before she can escape.

                               JOEY
               She's gettin' away!

                               WILLY
               Forget her!  We got the one we need! 
               Step on it!

     Joey takes off again.

     Page 99.

     EXT. STREET

     Eddie's car is tied up in traffic, but he turns on his 
     blinker lights and peels over to the opposite lane.  Cars 
     stop to let him through.

     INT. ST. MATTHEW'S CATHEDRAL - DAY

     In the rehearsal room, Mary Robert has just finished 
     telling the nuns what happened to Christy.

                               MARY PATRICK
               You mean -- they kidnapped her?

                               MARY ROBERT
               Yes -- two men -- and they had guns.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               She shouldn't have come back.  She knew 
               she was in danger.

                               MARY PATRICK
               But -- why would anyone kidnap a nun?

                               MARY LAZARUS
               Were they Catholics?

     Mother Superior suddenly steps forward.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               She isn't a nun.  Her real name is 
               Christy Van Cartier, and she is a 
               professional entertainer.  She witnessed 
               a vicious crime, and has been hiding in 
               our convent.

     The nuns all react with shock and emotion.

                               MARY ROBERT
               An... entertainer?

                               MARY PATRICK
               She wasn't a nun? 

                               ANOTHER NUN
               She lied to us?

                               MARY ROBERT
               But... but... she was such a wonderful 
               nun.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Look what she did with the choir.  She 
               made us sing beautifully.

                               MARY LAZARUS
               That should have tipped us.

     Page 100.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Well, I don't care who she is.  We can't 
               sing without her!

                               MARY PATRICK
               She's our inspiration!

                               MARY LAZARUS
               She's the act!

                               MARY ROBERT
               Reverend Mother, I know that you and 
               Mary Clarence didn't always agree, but --
               we've got to help her.

                               MARY PATRICK
               We've got to save her!

                               MARY LAZARUS
               We can't leave it up to the Feds!

     The nuns all look to Mother Superior for an answer.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Calm down.  Think clearly.  Mary Robert, 
               do you have any idea who those men were?

                               MARY ROBERT
               She said they were from her old convent.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               But... she was a showgirl.  She didn't 
               have an old convent.

                               MARY PATRICK
               She told us about one.  The Little 
               Sisters of the Moonlight.  In Las Vegas.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               All right.  It's a beginning.  Las 
               Vegas, Nevada.

     All the nuns hurriedly cross themselves.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Mary Lazarus, find the Bishop and tell 
               him the situation.  Everyone else --
               follow me.

     Mother Superior leads the way out the door.

     EXT. STREET - NIGHT

     The Driver sits at the wheel of the school bus, reading a 
     sleazy novel.  He looks up as the nuns all converge on the 
     door.

     Page 101

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Emergency!  Open up!

     The Driver opens the door.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               The San Francisco airport!  Immediately!

     The nuns are all zooming past the Driver, onto the bus.

                               MARY LAZARUS
                             (to the Driver)
               Step on it!

     Mary Lazarus grabs the Driver's sleazy novel, confiscating 
     it. The Driver starts the engine.  As the bus drives off, 
     Eddie's car streaks INTO THE SCENE and parks in front of 
     the cathedral.

     INT. ST. MATTHEW'S CATHEDRAL

     Eddie rushes into the lobby and sees Bishop O'Hara.

                               EDDIE
               Where is she?

                               O'HARA
               There was a kidnapping.  We think Las 
               Vegas.

     Eddie turns and races back toward the car.

     EXT. SAN FRANCISCO AIRPORT - NIGHT

     Several small planes are parked on the tarmac.

     Mother Superior and the nuns are arguing with the MANAGER 
     of the airport, a grouchy guy in grease-stained overalls.

                               MANAGER
               Fifteen hundred for the run to Vegas. 
               Rock-bottom.

                               MARY PATRICK
               But we don't have fifteen hundred!

                               MARY ROBERT
               We're nuns!

     The Manager starts back toward his office.

                               MANAGER
               Can't help you.  No exceptions.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Young man!

     Page 102.

     The voice has a powerful ring of authority to it, and the 
     Manager looks around.

                               MANAGER
               What?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR 
               We are nuns.  We pray.

                               MANAGER
               So?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               We pray for good things.  Food for the 
               hungry.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Peace on Earth.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               However, we can also pray for other 
               things.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Measles.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Lawsuits.

                               MARY LAZARUS
               Tax audits.

     There is a pause, as the Manager stares at the nuns in 
     horror.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Come, Sisters.  Let's go to chapel.  
               Bring your beads.

     The nuns begin to leave.

                               MANAGER
               Wait!

     EXT. NIGHT SKY - LATER

     A plane sweeps through the desert sky, headed for Las 
     Vegas.  Through the windows of the plane, we see nuns 
     staring out at the glittering city in the distance.

     INT. MOONLIGHT CASINO - NIGHT

     Packed with gamblers, the room is a flurry of activity. 
     Joey works his way through the crowd, then spots Vince near 
     the money cage.

                               JOEY
               We got her.

     Page 103.

     Vince follows Joey out of the casino with a grim 
     expression.

     INT. STORAGE ROOM

     Vince and Joey enter a storage room that is cluttered with 
     boxes.  Christy is tied to a chair in the back of the room, 
     with Willy standing guard over her.

     Christy sits very calmly, despite the anger she is in.  
     She seems distinctly nun-like in her radiant serenity.

                               VINCE
                             (turning on the charm)
               Babe.

     Christy does not reply.

                               VINCE
               Babe, what happened here?  Look at you.

                               CHRISTY
               Good evening, Vincent.

                               VINCE
               What, Vincent?  This is me, doll.  I 
               know you.  What did you think you were 
               doing?  Running to the cops.  Hiding out.  
               No, no.  You're sorry now, aren't you?

                               CHRISTY
               I am sorry for all my sins.  And yours.

     Vince, Willy and Joey all look at each other, perplexed.

                               WILLY
               She's a nun, Vince.

                               VINCE
                             (kneeling by Christy)
               I love you, Chris.  I always will.  I 
               gave you so much.  My time.  My 
               affection.  A big-time career.  And how 
               do you repay me?  What's the thanks I 
               get?  Where's the loyalty, huh?  Where's 
               the love?

                               CHRISTY
               You will be judged, Vincent.  We all 
               will.

     Vince stands; the charm hasn't worked.  He's getting 
     angry.

                               VINCE
               What do you mean -- judged?  I don't get 
               judged, baby.

     Page 104.

                               VINCE (CONT'D)
               And who are you to talk?  You were 
               nothing.  You couldn't even sing.  I must 
               have been out of my mind.

                               WILLY
               She's acting weird, Vince.  Ever since 
               we picked her up.

                               JOEY
               It's spooky.  It's like she ain't even 
               afraid or nothing.

     Vince grabs the front of Christy's habit and squeezes it 
     tightly around her throat.

                               VINCE
               She's afraid.  Come on, tell the boys 
               you're afraid.

                               CHRISTY
                             (calmly)
               I feel sorry for you, Vincent.  And I 
               forgive you.

     This really throws Vince, and angers him further.  He 
     glares at Christy, and then releases her.  He turns to Joey 
     and Willy.

                               VINCE
               Who gives a damn?  Waste her.

     Joey and Willy look a little unsure as Vince storms out of 
     the room.

     INT. PLANE

     The nuns are mesmerized by the bright skyline with its 
     colorful flashes of neon.

                               MARY PATRICK
               It's so beautiful...

                               MARY ROBERT
                And what a lovely name.  Las Vegas...

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               And Gommorah.

     The plane sets down at the Vegas airport.  Mother Superior 
     and the nuns climb out.

     INT. BAR AREA

     Joey and Willy find Vince near the bar.

     Page 105.

                               VINCE
               It's done?

                               JOEY
               Not... totally.

                               VINCE
                             (disturbed)
               What's the problem?

                               WILLY
               She's... she's a nun.

                               VINCE
               Are you nuts?  She's not a nun.  It's 
               Christy.  She's a babe!

                               JOEY
               But, Vince, how do you know she didn't 
               like, join up and become a nun when she 
               was in that convent?

                               VINCE
               It didn't happen.

                               WILLY
               She was real quiet and peaceful all the 
               way back in the car.

                               JOEY
               No smart-ass remarks or nothing.

                               VINCE
               I can't believe this.  Okay, I want both 
               you guys to go back there, and both of 
               you shoot her at the same time.

                               JOEY
               Yeah...

                               WILLY
               Right.  That way we'd never know which 
               bullet got to her brain and killed her 
               first.  It could always be the other guy.

     They all look happy with this solution as Joey and Willy 
     leave.

     INT. STOREROOM

     Christy still shows no signs of fear as Joey and Willy 
     take out their guns.

                               JOEY
               Okay, we got one-two-three, and on three 
               we both shoot.  Got it?

     Page 106.

                               WILLY
               Got it.

     Joey points his gun at Christy's left temple, and Willy 
     points his gun at her right temple.

                               JOEY
               One... two...

     Christy closes her eyes.

                               JOEY
               Three!

     Neither man shoots.  They look at each other with anger. 
     Christy opens her eyes.

                               JOEY
               You didn't shoot!

                               WILLY
               Neither did you!

                               JOEY
               I figured if you were gonna, then I 
               wouldn't have to.

                               WILLY
               That's what I figured, too.

     EXT. LAS VEGAS HELIPORT

     The nuns leave the terminal and stand on the sidewalk out 
     front.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Las Vegas -- she's here somewhere.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               But where?

                               MARY PATRICK
               Look!  There she is!

     Mary Patrick is pointing to a group of billboards that 
     feature huge ads for the local hotels and casinos.  The 
     center billboard has a splashy picture of a roulette wheel, 
     the Elvis impersonator, and Christy and the Ronelles.  The 
     bottom part of the billboard shows the name of the 
     Moonlight Casino and Lounge.

                               MARY ROBERT
               The Little Sisters of the Moonlight!

                               MARY PATRICK
               But how do we get there?

     Page 107.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Stand back.
                             (she strides into the 
                             road)
               Taxi!

     INT. CASINO

     Once again, Joey and Willy find Vince.

                               VINCE
               Well?

                               JOEY
               It didn't work, Vince.

                               VINCE
               You were both supposed to put your guns 
               to her head and shoot.

                               WILLY
               We both missed.

                               VINCE
               Okay, so the problem is still the nun 
               outfit, right?

                               JOEY
               Right.

                               VINCE
               So, take it off.

                               WILLY
                             (shocked)
               Strip down a nun?  You want us to fry?

                               JOEY
               For like, twelve zillion eternities?

                               VINCE
               I'm telling you, she's not a nun!  Get 
               her out of the nun outfit, and put her in 
               some clothes.

                               JOEY
               Maybe pants.

                               WILLY
               A sweater.

                               JOEY
               And then we can ice her.  No nun, no 
               evil eye.

     Joey and Willy are very confident about this solution. 
     They strut off, pleased with themselves.

     Page 108.

     EXT. LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - NIGHT
     Eddie strides out of the airport; he took a later flight 
     than the nuns.  A squad car is waiting; Clarkson beckons 
     him.

                               CLARKSON
               Lieutenant!

     Eddie jumps in the car.  Clarkson turns on the red bubble 
     light and the SIREN, and the car zooms off.

     INT. STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT

     Joey and Willy return to the storage room, looking 
     confident of their mission this time.  Christy glances up 
     at them as they enter, and Willy begins to untie her.

                               WILLY
               We got it all worked out.

     He works the ropes free, and Christy rubs her wrists to 
     get circulation back again.

                               JOEY
               Okay, Christy -- strip.

                               CHRISTY
               What?

                               JOEY
               That... thing.  That nun thing.  Take it 
               off.

     Christy suddenly drops to her knees and begins to pray.

                               WILLY
               What's she doing?

                               JOEY
               She's praying.

                               CHRISTY
               And God bless Joey and Willy, who are 
               only trying to do their jobs.
                             (faking Latin)
               Pox fibula tibia vobiscum.  Et marcus 
               domino's pizza.  Have mercy.  Amen.
                             (she looks up at the 
                             guys)
               I'm finished now.  Help me up.

     As Joey and Willy bend down to help her up, Christy 
     suddenly grabs their neckties in each hand.  With a fierce 
     jerk, she pulls the neckties with all her might, smashing 
     Joey's head against Willy's.

     Page 109.

     Stunned, Joey and Willy stagger backward, holding their 
     heads.  Christy scrambles out the door while the two men 
     groan in pain.

     INT. CORRIDOR

     Joey and Willy burst out of the room with guns drawn.  At 
     the far end of the corridor, they spot a glimpse of black 
     clothing as Christy starts down the stairs.

                               JOEY
               There she goes!  she's taking the stairs 
               I

     They run quickly after her.

     INT. STAIRWAY

     Christy runs down the stairs as a SHOT rings out.  Christy 
     screams and runs even faster.

     INT. CASINO

     A door swings open into the casino, and Christy appears, 
     looking frantic.  A MUFFLED SHOT is heard behind her, and 
     she sprints into the casino.

     Seconds later, Joey and Willy appear.

                               JOEY
               Find Vince and tell him what happened. 
               I'll take this side of the room.

     Willy hurries away to find Vince, and Joey starts 
     searching the crowd.

     EXT. THE MOONLIGHT HOTEL AND CASINO

     Three cabs ROAR up in front of the building and nuns 
     tumble out.

     INT. CASINO ENTRANCE

     The nuns enter the casino and stop dead in their tracks. 
     Before them is a large room filled with glitter and sin, 
     the SOUND of jackpots and crap tables.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Brace yourselves, Sisters.

     In unison, the nuns all cross themselves.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Spread out and look for Mary Clarence. 
               Try to blend in.

     The nuns spread to every part of the room, looking for 
     Christy.

     Page 110.

     INT. CASINO

     A blackjack table; a game is in progress, with several 
     players.  Mary Patrick rushes up to the table.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Excuse me -- has anyone seen a nun?

                               MARY ROBERT
               A Benedictine.

     The CROUPIER and the players stare at the two nuns. 

     INT. CASINO

     Christy is making her way past a roulette table.  
     Suddenly, she sees Joey coming toward her, making his way 
     through the crowd.  Christy grabs the arm of a SALESMAN 
     playing roulette.

                               CROUPIER
               Place your bets. 

                               CHRISTY
                             (to the Salesman)
               Red 21.

                               SALESMAN
               You sure?  How do you know?

     Christy looks up to heaven.

                               SALESMAN
                             (to the Croupier)
               Red 21.

     Joey stands at the opposite side of the roulette table, 
     glaring at Christy.  The crowd around the table watches 
     Christy for a moment, then they all put their chips down on 
     Red 21.

     Joey starts working his way around the table toward 
     Christy as the Croupier spins the wheel.  The ball falls 
     into a slot.

                               CROUPIER
               Black 14.

     Everyone at the table turns toward Christy, outraged.  She 
     gives them a reprimanding look.

                               CHRISTY
               Did you learn something?

     Christy suddenly realizes that Joey is almost at her side. 
     She shoves the Salesman against him and runs away.

     Page 111.

     INT. CASINO

     We see two long rows of slot machines, with gamblers 
     working every machine.

     Willy appears at one end of the row, scanning the area for 
     Christy.  He sees a nun crossing at the far end of the row, 
     and she moves out of sight.  Willy heads in that direction. 
     Someone hits a JACKPOT behind him, and he turns toward the 
     sound.  As he does. he sees another nun crossing at the 
     opposite end of the row of machines.  Willy turns again --
     now he sees three nuns crossing at the opposite end.  He 
     looks confused, and doesn't know which way to turn.

     EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

     Eddie drives up in the squad car and parks near the back 
     door.

                               EDDIE
                             (to Clarkson)
               Close off the block, but don't move in 
               till I tell you.

     Eddie jumps out of the car and hurries inside.

     INT. BLACKJACK AREA

     As Christy moves past a blackjack game, she suddenly sees 
     Vince moving toward her.  Turning quickly, she moves away 
     from Vince, but suddenly sees Joey coming toward her from 
     the opposite direction.  Trapped for a moment, she has 
     panic in her eyes.  Suddenly she is flanked by Mother 
     Superior and Mary Patrick.

                               CHRISTY
               What are you doing here?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Saving you.  Move!

     The nuns surround Christy and head through the crowd in a 
     cluster.  Joey and Vince pursue them from different 
     directions.  Just before they catch them, Mother Superior 
     barks an order.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Break!

     The nuns split up, each taking a different direction. 
     Vince and Joey look bewildered.

                               VINCE
               Get her!

                               JOEY
               Which one!

     Page 112.

                               VINCE
               The nun!

     Vince, Joey and Willy each pick a nun and follow her.

     Vince catches up to a nun, whom we only see from the rear. 
     He grabs her shoulder.

                               VINCE
               Babe.

     The nun spins around; it is Mother Superior.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Sweetheart.

     Vince releases her and frantically searches the crowd 
     again.

     Joey catches up with his nun, only to find it is Mary 
     Patrick.  The shell game has worked; Christy has escaped 
     for the moment.

     INT. SLOT MACHINE AREA

     We FIND Eddie scanning the floor and seeing nuns spread 
     out everywhere.  He talks quietly into his walkie-talkie.

                               EDDIE
               Move in.  Seal off the exits, but don't 
               come inside till I tell you.

     INT. CASINO

     Vince, Joey and Willy run into each other in the center of 
     the casino.

                               WILLY
               There's nuns everywhere!  Hundreds of 
               'em!

     All the nuns suddenly come together, and see that the 
     exits are blocked by Vince and his hoods.  Vince spots 
     Christy in the center of the group.

                               VINCE
               There she is!

                               JOEY
               Which one?

     Christy sees Vince pointing at her.

                               CHRISTY
               Quick, there's another way out of here.  
               Follow me.

     Page 113.

     Christy runs toward a set of glass doors set off to one 
     side.  The other nuns follow her.

                               VINCE
               She's heading for the lounge!  Go!

     Vince, Joey and Willy head for the lounge.

     Across the room, Eddie sees Christy and the cluster of 
     nuns head through the glass doors.  He barks into his 
     walkie-talkie.

                               EDDIE
               Move in -- now!

     INT. LOUNGE

     The lounge is deserted between shows, and all the lights 
     are out.  The mobsters enter with guns drawn.

                               JOEY
               I can't see anything in here!

                               VINCE
               Willy -- hit the lights.

                               WILLY
               Where?

                               VINCE
               Find 'em!

     Willy moves off to find the light switch.  There is a 
     flash of black and white fabric behind some chairs.

                               JOEY
               There!

               Before he can shoot, there is another 
               flash of fabric on the opposite side of 
               the room.

                               VINCE
                             (aiming)
               No -- there!

     And a third flash of fabric near the stage.

                               JOEY
               Over there!

     Willy has found the lights, and the lounge is suddenly 
     brightly lit.  The mobsters blink for a moment, then find 
     all the nuns bunched together in a corner, trying to find 
     an exit.

                               VINCE
               Freeze!  Everybody!

     Page 114.

     The nuns turn and face the mobsters, shielding Christy.

                               VINCE
               Joey?

                               JOEY
               Where is she?

     Christy steps forward, to the front of the stage.

                               CHRISTY
               Right here.  Let the others go -- they 
               have nothing to do with this.

                               VINCE
               Joey -- do it.

                               JOEY
               But, boss -- she's still, you know, a 
               nun.

                               VINCE
               She's a broad!  Got it!  Just some 
               broad!

     Mother Superior steps forward.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
                             (with authority)
               I guarantee you, she is no broad.  She 
               is Sister Mary Clarence, of St. 
               Katherine's Convent.  She is a model of 
               generosity, virtue and love.  You have my 
               word, gentlemen.  She is a nun.

                               WILLY
               Hear that?  Now aren't you glad we 
               didn't shoot her?

     Vince has had enough.  Facing Christy, he raises the gun 
     and points it right between Christy's eyes, only inches 
     away.  The nuns all recoil with horror.

     BLAM!  The gun goes off, but Christy isn't hit.  She 
     blinks her eyes open, shocked to be alive.  Instead, it's 
     Vince who falls, crumpling to the floor, and clutching his 
     shoulder.

     Across the room, Eddie holds a smoking police revolver. 
     The nuns all swarm around Christy joyously.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Mary Clarence -- you're alive!

                               MARY PATRICK
                             (smiling)
               Christy.

     Page 115.

                               MARY LAZARUS
                             (also smiling)
               Van Cartier.

                               CHRISTY
               You know?  About me?  About everything?

     Christy breaks away from the jubilant nuns. She faces 
     Mother Superior.

                               CHRISTY
               Reverend Mother -- Thank-you.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Oh?

                               CHRISTY
               You saved my life.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               I'm a Christian.

     Police pour into the room and gather up Joey, Willy and 
     Vince.  Eddie walks over to Christy and Mother Superior.

                               EDDIE
               Don't you have a concert to go to?

                               CHRISTY
               That depends.  Sisters, you don't know 
               this, but Reverend Mother's been making 
               all sorts of noises about resigning. 
               That's bad news.  I don't know if we 
               could sing, if we thought that was true.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Not a note.

                               MARY PATRICK
               Impossible.

     Mary Lazarus coughs, and points to her throat, as if she 
     has laryngitis.  All the other nuns imitate her.

                               CHRISTY
                             (to Mother Superior)
               Then I guess you're stuck.  Life 
               sentence.  No parole.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Very well.
                             (she turns to Eddie)
               I hold you responsible for all of this, 
               For introducing a lounge act into my 
               convent.  For utterly disrupting our way 
               of life.  And for placing all of us in 
               mortal danger.
                             (sincerely, with a 
                             smile)
               Thank-you.

     Page 116.

     ANGLE on Christy, watching this.  She grins.

                               CHRISTY
               Yeah, Eddie, thanks a whole bunch. 
               Thanks for sticking me in a convent.  So 
               you think, after all this, maybe I really 
               am a nun?

                               EDDIE
               I don't know.  There's only one way to 
               be absolutely sure.

                               CHRISTY
               Yeah, like what?

     Eddie takes Christy in his arms, and they begin a kiss.  
     As they do so, Vince struggles toward Christy, as two cops 
     hold him back.  He is furious.

                               VINCE
               I was good to you! You re nothing but 
               no-talent garbage! You're a two-bit 
               Tramp!

                               CHRISTY
                             (staring at Vince, 
                             seeing him for the scum 
                             that he is)
               That used to be true, Vince.  I was with 
               you.  But something happened.  And I'm 
               different now.  Real--different.  I've 
               had, well, you might call it -- a 
               religious experience.  And I've got just 
               two words for you.  And those two words 
               are...

                               MARY ROBERT
                             (afraid Christy will 
                             curse)
               Mary Clarence!

                               CHRISTY
                             (grinning, to Vince)
               Bless you.

     EXT. ST. MATTHEW'S CATHEDRAL

     People are pouring into the cathedral.  Among them we see 
     many Cardinals in their red uniforms.

     INT. ST. MATTHEW'S CATHEDRAL

     The choir has gathered together in a small room off the 
     main chapel.  They are putting finishing touches on their 
     choral robes, and are waiting nervously to go on.

                               MARY PATRICK
                             (to Christy)
               I just realized -- this is the last time 
               we'll all be together.  We're going to 
               miss you so much.

     Page 117.

     Christy and Mary Patrick embrace.  Mary Patrick is 
     tearful.

                               CHRISTY
               Hey -- you re supposed to be the 
               cheerful one.  Why do I suddenly feel 
               like Snow White?

                               MARY LAZARUS
                             (to Christy, with 
                             humor)
               You re okay -- for a civilian.

     Christy and Mary Lazarus embrace.

                               MARY ROBERT
               Reverend Mother?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Yes?

                               MARY ROBERT
               Since Mary Clarence came to St. 
               Katherine's, I've been shot at, kidnapped 
               by Mafia hit men, and I've tasted beer.  
               Is that enough experience yet?  For final 
               vows?

                               CHRISTY
               I don't think so.  What about skydiving?  
               A crank call to Billy Graham?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               You have evidenced great maturity, Mary 
               Robert.  We shall have a serious 
               discussion.

                               CHRISTY
               What about me, Reverend Mother?  I think 
               you were right.  I'm just a bad 
               influence.  Sister show biz.

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Perhaps not.  Perhaps we can all use... 
               a little Spandex.

                               CHRISTY
               Really?  And maybe shorter habits, and 
               women priests, and sleeping late?

                               MOTHER SUPERIOR
               Don't push it.

     Christy and Mother Superior embrace.

     INT. CHAPEL

     The chapel is packed to the rafters.  The first few rows 
     of pews are occupied by Cardinals.  Television cameras 
     glide up and down the aisles, angling for shots of the 
     altar.

     Page 118.

     The Choir stands together on the altar with Christy in 
     front. Behind them stands a much larger, all-city choir. 
     Christy gives the nod to Sister Alma, and the organ vamp 
     begins.

                               MARY ROBERT
               I WAS DOWNHEARTED

                               CHRISTY
               It's true!

                               MARY ROBERT
               I WAS HELL-BOUND, 
               YES THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY
               SATAN WAS WAITING

                               CHRISTY
               Don't you know it!

                               MARY ROBERT
               BUT THE LORD CAME TO ME

                               CHRISTY
               What did He say?

                               MARY ROBERT
               HE SAID, SING THE DEVIL AWAY!

                               MARY PATRICK
               MY SOUL WAS IN DANGER
               I'D FALLEN FROM GRACE

                               CHRISTY
               It's true -- I know her.

                               MARY PATRICK
               DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE

                               CHRISTY
               What a shame!

                               MARY PATRICK
               BUT THEN CAME AN ANGEL
               WHO WHISPERED THESE WORDS

                               CHRISTY
               Pay attention...

                               MARY PATRICK
               SING AND THE DEVIL WILL FLEE!

                               CHRISTY
               Were you wicked?

                               CHOIR
               SING!

                               CHRISTY
               Were you tempted?

                               CHOIR
               SING!
               SING AND YOUR SPIRIT WILL SOAR!

     Page 119.

     In the front row, Mother Superior is trying to resist the 
     music.  She gives in, and starts bobbing her head to the 
     beat.  Beside her, Eddie looks very proud as his eyes meet 
     Christy's.

                               CHRISTY
               But I'm fearful!

                               CHOIR
               SING!

                               CHRISTY
               And I'm tearful!

                               CHOIR
               SING!

                               CHRISTY
               YES I'LL SING AND KNOW JOY EVERMORE

                               CHRISTY/CHOIR
               DO YOUR TROUBLES BIND YOU
               IF YOO'RE DEEP IN WOE
               YOU CAN BANISH GLOOM IF YOU TRY
               FIND A SONG WITHIN YOU
               LET IT FILL YOUR DAYS
               JUST SING

                               MARY ROBERT
               SING!

                               CHOIR
               JUST SING!

                               MARY PATRICK
               SING!

                               MARY LAZARUS
               JUST SING!

                               CHRISTY
               Sing!

                               CHRISTY/CHOIR
               SING AND SAY DEVIL, GOODBYE!

     The entire congregation is ecstatic, as the song concludes 
     with a glorious final flourish.

     FADE OUT:

1   INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. BATHROOM. NIGHT.                 1

    An expensive bathroom suite. Excess of marble and gold
    taps. Into the bath, a hand is scattering rupee notes.
    Hundreds and hundreds of notes, worth hundreds of
    thousands of rupees. The sound of a fist thumping on
    the bathroom door, furious shouting from the other
    side.

                               JAVED O/S
              Salim! Salim!


2   INT. STUDIO. BACKSTAGE. DAY.                              2

    Darkness. Then, glimpses of faces. In the half-light,
    shadowy figures move with purpose. An implacable voice
    announces.

                            TALKBACK V/O
              Ten to white-out, nine, eight,
              seven...

                               PREM
              Are you ready?

    Silence. A hand shakes a shoulder a little too roughly.

                            PREM (CONT'D)
              I said are you ready?

                               JAMAL
              Yes.


3   INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. BATHROOM. NIGHT.                 3

    The thumping at the door continues. The sound of
    mumbled Indian prayer. Dull gleam of a pistol. A hand
    cracks the chamber open. Loads a single bullet into the
    chamber, snaps the chamber shut.

                            TALKBACK V/O
              ...three, two, one, zero. Cue
              Prem, cue applause...

    Suddenly, the door splinters as it is smashed through.
    A burst of gun-fire and white light as suddenly...


4   INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                       4

    ...we are back in the studio, the gun-fire morphing
    into rapturous applause.


                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                                2.

                                  TALKBACK V/O
                 Go, Prem.

    A wall of light and noise as the two walk on stage.
    Cheering, music, banks of searing studio lights. On
    stage, Jamal, an eighteen year-old Indian boy-man
    stares, petrified. He would surely turn and run but for
    the iron grip on his shoulder of the smiling host, Prem
    Kumar.

                               PREM
                 Welcome to Who Wants To Be A
                 Millionaire!

    More applause.

                               PREM (CONT'D)
                 Please give a warm welcome to
                 our first contestant of the
                 night- a local from our very own
                 Mumbai!

    Under cover of the wild applause, Prem ushers Jamal
    towards the guest's chair, leaning in and hissing.

                                  PREM (CONT'D)
                 Smile, dammit.

    The lights seem to bore into him but Jamal manages a
    tentative smile. Out of nowhere, a hand slaps him
    ferociously across the face. Then again and again.
    Blood trickles from his mouth.


5   INT. POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM. NIGHT.                               5

    The studio lights have seamlessly transformed into the
    harsh bulb of an interrogation light. Jamal is strung
    from the ceiling by his arms.

                               CONSTABLE SRINIVAS
                 Your name, bhen chod.

    Constable Srinivas's hand pulls back Jamal's head by
    the hair, forcing him to stare directly into the
    lights.

                                  CONSTABLE SRINIVAS (CONT'D)
                 Your name!

                                  JAMAL
                 Jamal Malik.

    And seamlessly we are back....

                                                           3.


6   INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                         6

    ...on the set of Who Wants to be a Millionaire. Prem
    leans back in his chair, a man at home in his
    surroundings. Jamal sits opposite, frozen.

                            PREM
              So, Jamal, tell us a bit about
              yourself.

    Close on Jamal's face. Without warning, it is shoved
    under water.


7   INT. BUCKET. NIGHT.                                         7

    We look up from the bottom of the bucket at the
    screaming face of a drowning man. His head shakes
    desperately, pointlessly. Then Jamal's face is dragged
    up again, roaring for breath. Close on his eyes.

                            JAMAL V/O
              I work in a call centre. In
              Juhu.


8   INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                         8

                            PREM
              A Phone-basher! And what type of
              call centre would this be?

                            JAMAL
              XL 5. Mobile phones.

                            PREM
              Aha! So, you're the man who
              rings me up every single day of
              my life with Special Offers,
              huh?

                            JAMAL
              No, actually, I'm an assistant.

                            PREM
              An Assistant Phone-basher?

    A raised eye-brow at the audience. Amusement ruffles
    through them.

                            PREM (CONT'D)
              And what does an Assistant Phone-
              basher do, exactly?

                            JAMAL
              I- I get tea for people and-

                                PREM
                  - a chi-wallah! Why didn't you
                  say?

     Laughter in the audience.

                                PREM (CONT'D)
                  So, ladies and gentlemen, Jamal
                  Malik from Mumbai, let's play
                  Who Wants To Be A
                  Millionaire...!

10   INT. POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM. DAY.                          10

     Jamal's body dangles motionless from the ceiling. His
     head is bowed and he is moaning to himself. The ceiling
     fan thumps round slowly. In the corner, Constable
     Srinivas mops his brow and lights a cigarette. Hot
     work. The door opens and the Inspector of Police walks
     in. A rumpled man in his late forties who has seen
     pretty much everything. He eyes Jamal, surprised.

                                INSPECTOR
                  Has he confessed, yet?

                                CONSTABLE SRINIVAS
                  Apart from his name, I can't get
                  a word out of the runt.

                                INSPECTOR
                  You've been here all bloody
                  night, Srinivas. What have you
                  been doing?

     Srinivas shrugs.

                                CONSTABLE SRINIVAS
                  Tough guy.

                                INSPECTOR
                  A little electricity will loosen
                  his tongue.

     Constable Srinivas brings a box and a tangle of wires
     out of a cupboard and proceeds to put crocodile clips
     on Jamal's fingers. The Inspector stares, deep in
     thought. Sweat trickles down his face. He wipes it away
     with a handkerchief, seems to be talking to himself.

                                INSPECTOR (CONT'D)
                  Every night I get home, "why
                  can't we have a/c like Bajan
                  Chacha?

                                INSPECTOR (CONT'D)
                  Why don't you care about your
                  poor family, dying in this
                  heat." Twenty-four years a
                  policeman and I can't afford
                  bloody a/c.

     Turns on Jamal.

                                INSPECTOR (CONT'D)
                  But you. You've got ten million
                  rupees ek dum guaranteed, yaar?
                  And who knows how much further?
                  Fancy the twenty million, do
                  you?

     Jamal just stares.

                                INSPECTOR (CONT'D)
                  I think you probably do.

     The Inspector nods absently to Constable Srinivas who
     turns a handle. Jamal's body pulsates and jerks. He
     screams. His body goes limp again. The Inspector goes
     over to Jamal.

                                INSPECTOR (CONT'D)
                  So. Were you wired up? A mobile
                  or a pager, correct? Some little
                  hidden gadget? No? A coughing
                  accomplice in the audience?
                  Microchip under the skin, huh?

     Constable Srinivas hadn't thought of that. Grabs
     Jamal's arms and starts squeezing them all over until
     the Inspector has had enough.

                                INSPECTOR (CONT'D)
                  Srinivas! Look, it's hot, my
                  wife is giving me hell, I've got
                  a desk full of murderers,
                  rapists, extortionists, assorted
                  bum-bandits...and you. Why don't
                  you save us both a lot of time?
                  Hmm?

     Jamal doesn't answer. The Inspector sighs and sits
     down. Looks at his watch, nods at Constable Srinivas
     again. Jamal's body jerks with electric current. When
     the shudders and screams have subsided, the Inspector
     goes over to Jamal's collapsed form. Clicks his fingers
     in front of Jamal's face to check for a response.

                                INSPECTOR OF POLICE
                  He's unconscious, chutiya. What
                  good is that? How many times
                  have I told you-?

                                CONSTABLE SRINIVAS
                  Sorry, Sir.

     An excited Young Police Constable sticks his head
     around the door.

                             YOUNG CONSTABLE
               He's coming! Sir.

                             INSPECTOR
               Aré wa, Srinivas, we'll have
               Amnesty International in here
               next, peeing their pants about
               human rights. Get him down, tidy
               him up, for God's sake.

     Constable Srinivas goes over to Jamal and starts to
     undo the crocodile clips.

                             CONSTABLE SRINIVAS
               Maybe he did know the answers.

                              INSPECTOR
               Have you gone soft, Srinivas?
               Professors, lawyers, doctors,
               General Knowledge Wallahs never
               get beyond sixteen thousand
               rupees. And he's on ten million?
               What the hell can a slum dog
               possibly know?

     Jamal lifts his head.

                              JAMAL
               The answers.

     He lifts his head, spits blood out of his mouth and
     says again, straight into the Inspector's face.

                             JAMAL (CONT'D)
               I know the answers.

     Titles. Slum Dog Millionaire.


11   EXT. CRICKET GROUND. DAY.                                  11

     Bright sunlight filtered through the ever-present
     Mumbai dust. A group of children are playing cricket on
     a tarmac cricket ground. They are bare-foot, dressed in
     little more than rags, wiry-skinny and fast on their
     feet. Salim, a nine-year old, polishes the ball on his
     almost non-existent shorts, comes in with surprising
     speed and bowls. The batsman hooks it high in the air.
     The bowler screams at a boy in the outfield.

                             SALIM
               Jamal! Catch it! Catch it!

     The seven-year old Jamal stares up at the ball, jinks
     around trying to get into position.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                            7.
11   CONTINUED:                                                  11

     He pays no heed to the rest of the children who are
     scattering fast to the edges of the tarmac. The ball
     seems suspended in the blue sky. Shouts from the other
     children seem very far away. He doesn't notice that
     they are screaming for him to get out of the way. Jamal
     adjusts his feet for the perfect catch. Then out of
     nowhere, a light aircraft almost takes his head off as
     it comes in to land on the tarmac runway. Jamal is
     knocked to his feet by the down-draft of the plane. The
     ball bounces away. Also flattened, Salim gets to his
     feet.

                                SALIM (CONT'D)
                  How could you drop that? It was
                  a sitter.

     Then Salim's face turns to one of alarm.


12   EXT. AIRPORT PERIMETER. DAY.                                12

     At the back of a pack of children, carrying a piece of
     wood crudely fashioned into a sword, Jamal is running
     for his life, pursued by an ancient but surprisingly
     nimble Security Guard from the airport who is screaming
     abuse and wielding a long stick. The kids dash across a
     rubbish dump and disappear down dozens of tiny lanes
     that run in between the shacks of the slum.

                                SECURITY GUARD
                  Private-ka land! Private-ka
                  land! The planes won't kill you,
                  mader chod, I will!

     Jamal and Salim- also with a wooden sword- break off,
     head down a separate lane. The Guard pursues them.


13   INT. JUHU SLUM. DAY.                                        13

     The lanes in between the corrugated iron shacks are
     three feet wide, with an open drain running down the
     middle. Many of the precarious upper floors of the
     shacks have been built right over the paths, turning
     them into black tunnels. Tunnels shot through with
     slivers of light. If you didn't live here, you would be
     lost and frightened in minutes.

     But these children are natives and with the practice of
     many years, Jamal and Salim zig-zag down the warren of
     lanes.

     They dodge past people cooking in the doorways,
     sleeping, washing clothes or in the case of Vinod, a
     naked four year-old, pissing into the drain. Salim
     shouts a warning.



                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                          8.
13   CONTINUED:                                                13

                                SALIM
                  Vinod! Musketeers coming
                  through!

     Without breaking step, they both jump expertly over the
     stream of piss. Not so the Security Guard who gets it
     all over his trousers, but doesn't stop the pursuit.

     The two children charge past a shack filled to the roof
     with chickens in cages who all start squawking. They
     break out into the sunlight of the `main road' of the
     slum lined with shops. It is packed: with people,
     stalls, bicycles and cows. All modern India is here,
     drinking tea, shouting at each other, selling food,
     playing carom, video games. Leaving a trail of shouting
     and wreckage behind them, the pair approach a brand new
     Mercedes almost blocking the lane. Beside it stands
     Javed, an impressive man in a beautiful suit and his
     two Minders. Jamal and Salim skid to a stop, put their
     hands together in respectful greeting and edge ever so
     carefully past the immaculate paintwork of the car.

     Still in pursuit, the Security Guard also slides
     carefully past the car with deprecating bows and
     smiles. On past the chi stall where a crowd has
     gathered to watch a hindi film blaring from the tv
     rigged up overhead. The irate Security Guard gets
     tangled up in a bicycle. Jamal and Salim stop to give
     him a taunting, hip-gyrating parody of the dance on the
     tv before scooting down another tunnel. They break out
     into sunlight again.

                                WOMAN'S VOICE
                  Jamal!

     Jamal skids to a halt, bumping into Salim who is
     already frozen.

                                JAMAL
                  Shit. Mummy-ji.

                                JAMAL'S MOTHER
                  Don't you move a muscle.

     The Security Guard arrives and he too skids to a halt
     at the sight of Jamal's mother.

                                JAMAL'S MOTHER (CONT'D)
                  Thank you, Mister Gupta. I will
                  deal with these two.

     The Guard puts his hands together in grudging respect
     as Jamal's Mother lifts each skinny kid off the floor
     by their t-shirt and marches them down the road.

                                                            9.


14   INT. SCHOOL. DAY.                                           14

     The two renegades are dumped by Jamal's Mother into
     their desks as Mister Nandha hands out ancient school
     books.

                             MISTER NANDHA
               So, the musketeers return. We
               are honoured. Salim. Or Porthos,
               isn't it?

     He crashes the heavy book down on his head. Salim opens
     the book. Jamal glances over and turns the book the
     right way round for Salim.

                             SALIM
               I know!

     Mister Nandha hovers over Jamal's head. He winces in
     anticipation.

                             MISTER NANDHA
               And Athos.

     The book comes down like thunder. Jamal blinks from the
     impact and suddenly we are back....


15   INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICE. DAY.                               15

     ... in the Inspector's office. Jamal watches Srinivas
     fiddling with the video recorder, trying to get a
     picture. Through the pebbled glass, Jamal sees shapes
     moving along the corridor.


16   INT. CORRIDOR. POLICE STATION. DAY.                         16

     The Commissioner of Police is fawning along beside Prem
     as they walk. The Young Constable hurries behind.

                             COMMISSIONER OF POLICE
               It is so kind of you to visit
               our station, Sir. A great
               honour.

                             PREM
               Not at all, not at all. I hope
               you will visit us, Commissioner.

     Out of his jacket pocket comes a couple of tickets.

                             PREM (CONT'D)
               Bring the family. It's a lot of
               fun.

                             COMMISSIONER OF POLICE
               Oh! A thousand thanks, Sir.
               Missus Janda will be overcome.
                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                             10.
16   CONTINUED:                                                    16

     He turns to the Young Constable.

                                COMMISSIONER OF POLICE
                                (CONT'D)
                  chi, you lazy chutiyé, chi!

     The Inspector joins them in the corridor.

                                COMMISSIONER OF POLICE
                                (CONT'D)
                  Ah, Inspector! Cracked it?

     The Inspector moves his head. Maybe yes, maybe no.

                                  INSPECTOR
                  Nearly, Sir.

     The Commissioner is just able to contain his apoplexy.

                                COMMISSIONER OF POLICE
                  Nearly? Nearly? When Prem Kumar
                  himself has-

     Prem holds up a tolerant hand to the Commissioner who
     falls silent. Turns his laser-like charm onto the
     Inspector.

                                PREM
                  Inspector. How good to meet you.
                  Clearly the kid cheated.

                                  INSPECTOR
                  Clearly, Sir.

                                PREM
                  So, it is just a question of
                  how, no?

                                INSPECTOR
                  Indeed, Sir. The proof. That is
                  all we need.

                                PREM
                  We are lucky to have a man of
                  your obvious experience on the
                  case. This kid might run rings
                  around us filmi types, but he
                  won't make fools out of the
                  Mumbai Police Force, I can see
                  that.

     Forced laughter from the Commissioner.

                                PREM (CONT'D)
                  In front of sixty million
                  people.

     More laughter. And fear.

                                                         (CONTINUED)

                                                           11.
16   CONTINUED: (2)                                              16

                             PREM (CONT'D)
               Which is what will happen if we
               don't get a result, Gentlemen.
               He goes back on the show to rob
               us all with the whole of India
               watching. But. I can rely on
               you.

     Prem walks away down the corridor. Stops and turns,
     apparently casual.

                             PREM (CONT'D)
               Has he- has he made any
               allegations?

                                INSPECTOR
               Allegations?

                             PREM
               He's a cunning one. A convincing
               liar. Don't be taken in,
               Inspector, don't be taken in.

     Walks off. The Inspector stares after him. Goes back
     into his office.


17   INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICE.                                    17

     Srinivas has finally got the recorder to work. We get
     snatches of filmi dancing- heroines singing on
     mountainsides surrounded by implausible numbers of
     flags- cricket and finally after some shouting by the
     Inspector, Who Wants to Be A Millionaire?.

                             INSPECTOR
               So, Mister Malik, the man who
               knows the answers. Talk.

     We close in on the tv screen where Prem is smiling his
     crocodile smile and find ourselves....


18   INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                         18

     ...as Prem asks the first question.

                             PREM
               So, are you ready for your first
               question for one thousand
               rupees?

                                JAMAL
               Yes.

     Laughter from the audience. Jamal looks confused. Prem
     waves it away, switches on his serious face.

19   INT. SHACK. NIGHT.                                          19

     A tiny shack. A garland of dirty plastic flowers
     surrounds a torn flyer for one of Amitabh Bacchan's
     films.


20   EXT. JUHU SLUM. RUBBISH DUMP. NIGHT.                        20

     Salim is sitting on a chair at the end of a rickety
     wooden pier, though it is not water, but a sea of
     rubbish and sewage that lies below them. There are
     dozens of these piers protruding from the slum onto
     airport land, each with a toilet shack perched right at
     the end. Another man hurries up the pier and hands
     Salim a coin.

                                SALIM
                  Immediately, sir.

     Turns to the toilet door.

                                SALIM (CONT'D)
                  Bhai, get out of there. Prakash
                  wants a shit.

                                  JAMAL O.S.
                  Not finished.

                                PRAKASH
                  Stop your time-pass. This is
                  urgent.

                                JAMAL O.S.
                  It's a shy one. Since when was
                  there a time limit on a crap?

                                SALIM
                  Since there was a customer
                  waiting, that's when.

     He flashes another placatory smile at Prakash.

                                JAMAL O.S.
                       (singing/ grunting)
                  Come on out, you beauty, unveil
                  yourself, my darling-warling....

                                PRAKASH
                  Look, kid, I got a bad stomach.
                  It's borderline....

     A disturbing combination of heaving and snake-charmer
     noises come from the toilet shack. Finally Prakash can
     stand it no longer.

                                PRAKASH (CONT'D)
                  I'm off to Devi's bog. Give me
                  that.

     He snatches the coin back from Salim and hurries off.
     Salim bangs on the toilet door.

                                SALIM
                  You just lost me good money, you
                  stupid idiot-

     Salim stops. In the distance, there is the faint sound
     of shouting, a crowd coming closer. Then the crowd
     bursts through the outer shacks of the slum, pour onto
     the rubbish dump and make for the airfield.

                                MAN
                  It's Amitabh! That's his
                  helicopter!

                                JAMAL O.S.
                  Amitabh? Amitabh Bacchan?


21   INT/EXT. TOILET. NIGHT.                                    21

     Jamal peers through one of the many cracks in the
     shack. He sees crowds surging around the pier, charging
     towards a landing helicopter. Salim shoves the chair
     under the door handle- effectively locking it- and runs
     down the pier to join the chase. Jamal pulls up his
     shorts.

                                JAMAL
                  No! Wait! Salim, sala! Salim!

                                                      (CONTINUED)

     Rattles the locked door. Pulls a torn flyer from his
     pocket advertising an Amitabh movie.

                                JAMAL (CONT'D)
                  Wait! Amitabh....

     He looks down the toilet hole at the sewage beneath
     him, the landing helicopter, the disappearing crowd. A
     final rattle of the door. There is only one way out. He
     jumps down the hole, sprawling headlong into a year's
     worth of human waste, managing to keep the flyer out
     the mire. He runs for the helicopter.

                                JAMAL (CONT'D)
                  Amitabh-ji! Amitabh-ji!

     Salim is at the back of the crowd, trying to force a
     way through, but the adults shove him back. Not so for
     Jamal. The down-draft from the helicopter flicks bits
     of sewage from his clothes. Disgusted fans curse him
     and get out of his way. Suddenly, the red sea parts and
     there is nobody between Jamal and Amitabh Bacchan
     getting out of the helicopter.

                                JAMAL (CONT'D)
                  Please. Amitabh-ji.

     Jamal holds out his flyer. Used to signing autographs,
     the movie star barely looks at Jamal. He takes the
     flyer and scribbles his autograph on it.

                                JAMAL (CONT'D)
                  A thousand thanks, Amitabh-ji.

     He hands the flyer back to Jamal as his bodyguards
     surround him and hustle him into a car. Jamal chases
     the flyer across the tarmac, grabs it. Kisses it.


22   EXT. JUHU SLUM. NIGHT.                                      22

     From high up, the rickety tin roof-tops of the slum
     seem to stretch to the horizon. There is a distant
     shout, a figure waving an arm.

                                 MAN
                  It's coming!

     Then another shout and another, a chain of voices
     coming closer. People come out of their doorways with
     pails and buckets. The shouts come closer until we see
     a naked figure entirely encased in bubbles dancing and
     singing in the lane. Jamal is the happiest boy in the
     slum.

                                JAMAL
                       (singing)

                  Here it comes!

     Water comes bubbling through a hose and Jamal's mother
     hoses down her ecstatic son.


23   EXT. JUHU SLUM. NIGHT.                                    23

     Not far away, Salim wanders to Mister Chi's stall. He
     glances around to make sure everybody is glued to the
     hindi film on Mister Chi's tv and surreptitiously slips
     Mister Chi the signed flyer. Mister Chi takes a look
     and gives Salim a small wad of rupees. He sticks the
     money in his pocket, slinks away.


24   EXT. JUHU SLUM. NIGHT.                                    24

     A tear-stained Jamal is furiously trying to batter
     Salim, but Salim's extra strength and height means that
     he can keep Jamal at bay with one hand, Jamal's
     flailing fists punching thin air.

                                   JAMAL
                  Sala! Sala!

     Salim's laughter only makes Jamal cry harder.


25   INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICE. NIGHT.                           25

     Close on the tv screen in the Inspector's office. Prem
     ponders Jamal's choice. Presses a button on his
     computer.

                                PREM V/O
                  You chose A- Amitabh Bacchan.
                  Guess what? You just won one

     Applause on screen. The Inspector looks at Jamal. Jamal
     shrugs.

                                JAMAL
                  You don't have to be a genius.

                  I knew it was Amitabh.

                                   JAMAL
                  Like I said.

     Constable Srinivas twists Jamal's arm behind his back,
     evincing a squeal of pain from Jamal.

     The Inspector stares at Jamal, turns back to the tv
     where Prem is asking the next question.

                                PREM O/S
                  For four thousand rupees....the
                  national emblem of India is a

                  written underneath? Is it...

     Prem shoots a mock puzzled look out to the audience
     eliciting giggles from them.

                                PREM (CONT'D)
                  What do we think, Jamal? The
                  most famous phrase in our
                  country's history. Maybe you
                  want to phone a friend?

     Laughter from the audience. The studio lights bear down
     on Jamal. a drop of sweat trickles down his forehead.
     Prem is loving his discomfort.

                                PREM (CONT'D)
                  Or Ask the Audience? I have a
                  hunch they might just know the
                  answer. What do we think?

     He gestures expansively at his audience. Oh, they love
     him.

27   INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICE. DAY.                             27

     The Inspector presses pause. Sighs.

                                INSPECTOR
                  So, Jamal. My five-year-old
                  daughter knows the answer to
                  that, but you don't. Strange for
                  a millionaire genius. What
                  happened? Your accomplice nip
                  out for a piss, did he? Or did
                  he just not cough loud enough?

     Silence. Constable Srinivas kicks Jamal's chair.

                                CONSTABLE SRINIVAS
                  The Inspector asked you a
                  question.

                                JAMAL
                  How much is bhelpuri at Jeevan's
                  stall on Chowpatty Beach?

                                INSPECTOR
                  What?

                                JAMAL
                  One bhelpuri. How much?

                                CONSTABLE SRINIVAS
                       (can't help
                        himself)
                  Ten rupees.

                                JAMAL
                  Wrong. Fifteen since Divali. Who
                  stole Constable Varma's bicycle
                  outside Dadar Station last
                  Thursday?

                                INSPECTOR
                       (amused)
                  You know who that was?

                  Everyone in Juhu knows that.
                  Even five year-olds.

     Despite himself, the Inspector laughs. Then leans in.

                  The audience has chosen. And,
                  whaddya know? Ninety-nine
                  percent of them think the answer
                  is A). The truth alone triumphs.
                  What do we think, Jamal? A
                  hundred percent would have made
                  me a little more reassured,
                  maybe....

     Prem shrugs, makes a show of examining his computer.
     Suddenly fixes him with his eyes.

                                PREM (CONT'D)
                  Are you married, Jamal?

                                  JAMAL
                  No.

                                PREM
                  Well, don't despair, there's
                  someone out there who thinks our
                  national motto is "Fashion alone
                  triumphs". You two could be very
                  well matched.

     Audience laughter.

                  One more question before the

                  Call Centre Assistant do next?

     The lights dim. Prem presses his computer.

                                PREM (CONT'D)
                  Religion! Interesting. For
                  sixteen thousand rupees,
                  in depictions of the God Ram, he
                  is famously holding what in his
                  right hand? Is it A) a flower.
                  B) a scimitar. C) a child or D)
                  a bow and arrow?


31   EXT. DHOBI. JUHU SLUM. DAY.                                 31

     Right next to the railway lines is a pond of dirty
     water surrounded by shacks in which dozens of women are
     washing clothes. Trains flash past only feet away from
     them. Down the other end of the pond, nine-year old
     Jamal and Salim are splashing noisily with some other
     children. Jamal's mother pauses in her scrubbing, wipes
     sweat from her forehead and gazes up at the leaden sky.

                                JAMAL AND SALIM'S MOTHER
                  It's going to come. Today. I can
                  feel it.

     The woman next to her nods.

                                WOMAN
                  Hope so. My head is exploding.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                          20.
31   CONTINUED:                                                 31

                                MOTHER
                  Yes. We need rain.

     Jamal is trying to intercept the ball that Salim and
     Krishna are throwing to each other. He's not having
     much success. The ball flies overhead again from Salim
     to Krishna. Jamal dives for it, misses and goes
     underwater. When he comes up for air, he shakes his
     head, clearing his ears of water. Then he stops,
     listens. Shakes his head again. Definitely something
     strange. Thunder? Salim and Krishna are trading
     catches, unaware that anything has changed. But Jamal's
     mother has heard it too. The faintest sound of
     shouting, roaring. The wave of noise is still faint but
     getting louder. A frozen moment broken by:

                                MOTHER (CONT'D)
                  Run! Jamal, Salim, run!

     Everybody stares at her. A train speeds through as she
     continues to shout, her words lost beneath the
     thundering train.

                                MOTHER (CONT'D)
                  Go! Run!

     The train goes through, the last carriage flying past
     suddenly opening up the sight of a wall of rioting men
     wielding clubs, scythes, metal bars. They come
     screaming across the railway tracks.

                                SALIM
                  Krishna, quick!

     Salim holds out his hand to Krishna who is wading with
     difficulty through the water.

                                KRISHNA
                  No way! You're a bloody Muslim.
                  Get away from me!

     The rioters leap the tracks and are upon them.

                                KRISHNA (CONT'D)
                  They're Muslims! Him and him!

                                MOTHER
                  Go!

     Salim and Jamal scramble out and retreat into the
     lanes. Salim turns to see his Mother felled by a
     rioter. She is surrounded by screaming, chanting men
     who rain blows down on her. Jamal runs back and drags
     Salim down an alley. As they head down the alley, they
     get glimpses of burning houses, fleeing women, a three-
     year old boy in a doorway, painted entirely in garish
     blue. He stares at them. In his hand, he is carrying a
     bow and arrow. An eleven-year old girl dressed only in
     a pair of pants runs after them.
                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                         21.

     She has two bleeding red gashes on her back. They turn
     a corner and head towards some vans full of police.
     Jamal sees Mister Nandha, the school teacher, stops.

                                JAMAL
               Salim!

     Then Mister Nandha starts walking towards him. An oasis
     of calm in the chaos. Jamal looks at him with relief.

                                JAMAL (CONT'D)
               Mister Nandha.

     Mister Nandha smiles, walks towards them.

                             MISTER NANDHA
               Ram nam satya hai, Babri Masjid
               dhvasth hai.

                                JAMAL
               Mister Nandha?

                             MISTER NANDHA
               We have destroyed your mosque.
               Now, the followers of Ram will
               drive you dogs out of our city.

     From behind his back he produces a knife and runs
     towards Jamal, screaming.

                             MISTER NANDHA (CONT'D)
               Ram has returned to his temple!
               Ram has returned!

     They flee, but Jamal turns, sees the girl, frozen. He
     chases back a few steps, hauls her arm. The spell
     broken, and they are off.


32   INT. STREET. EVENING.                                     32

     They reach the safety of the police vans. But inside
     the vans, the police are smoking, laughing, playing
     cards. Down the street, a man comes whirling out of a
     doorway, his hair on fire. He falls into the middle of
     the street and is engulfed by rioters. Unperturbed, the
     police continue to chat. Salim and Jamal look on,
     horrified. Then one of the police men turns, looks at
     them. Is interested. Motions to a colleague. Puts out
     his cigarette with purpose.

                             JAMAL
               Let's go, bhai.

     Salim and Jamal run. The girl follows.

                                                        22.


33   EXT. MUMBAI. EVENING.                                     33

     Salim and Jamal stand on a hill overlooking the city.
     Black smoke billows from a large area that is clearly
     the Juhu slum. Standing a little way off is the girl.

                              JAMAL
                We should go back.

     Silence.

                              JAMAL (CONT'D)
                See if Ama-

     Salim shakes his head fiercely, silencing Jamal for a
     moment. But only a moment.

                              JAMAL (CONT'D)
                What about Jeevan Chacha?

     Salim shakes his head.

                              JAMAL (CONT'D)
                Maybe he-

     Salim shakes his head again.

                              SALIM
                - I saw him. He was with them.

                              JAMAL
                But he wouldn't hurt-

                              SALIM
                - he was with them!

                              JAMAL
                But-

                              SALIM
                - shut up, Jamal, can't you?
                Just shut up!

     Salim turns away and sees the girl. Picks up a rock and
     hurls it at her. She dodges, takes a couple of steps
     back but makes no real attempt to get away. He finds
     another rock and hurls this in her direction too.

                              SALIM (CONT'D)
                Ja!

     Then a flash of lightning and thunder rumbles across
     the city. Rain begins to come down.

                              JAMAL
                What shall we do?



                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                           23.
33   CONTINUED:                                                  33

     No answer. Jamal sits down. Salim sits down. At a
     distance, the girl sits down. Rain pours down their
     faces.


34   INT. BUILDER'S YARD. NIGHT.                                 34

     Rain as you've never seen. A pile of huge water pipes
     in a sprawling builder's yard. Jamal is in one pipe,
     Salim above him in another. They are both soaked,
     shivering, but have found some plastic sheet to wrap
     themselves in. Outside, thirty feet away, stands the
     girl. Staring. Salim hisses angrily at the girl.

                                SALIM
                  Go away. Ja, ja!

     The girl might not even have heard.

                                SALIM (CONT'D)
                  She'll have the Security Guard
                  onto us, standing there.

                                JAMAL
                  Not if we let her in.

                                SALIM
                  No.

                                JAMAL
                  She could be the third
                  musketeer.

                                SALIM
                  I am the head of this family,
                  now. And I say no. Piss off,
                  you.

     Salim huddles down in the pipe. After a while, Jamal
     follows suit.

                                SALIM (CONT'D)
                  We don't even know what the
                  third musketeer's called.


35   EXT. JUHU SLUM. DAY                                         35

     A flash of Jamal's mother being clubbed to the ground.
     Her scream.


36   INT. BUILDER'S YARD. LATER.                                 36

     Jamal wakes with a jolt and a scream half-swallowed in
     his mouth. He shuts his eyes tight, trying to force the
     image out. His breathing slows and he sees the girl
     staring at him. Salim, too, is staring into nothing.
     The rain is still falling.
                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                           24.
36   CONTINUED:                                                  36

     The girl goes back to drawing shapes in the mud with
     her finger. Jamal climbs out of the pipe. Looks at
     Salim for permission or refusal, but he just continues
     to stare. So, Jamal walks across to her. She looks up,
     wary.

                                JAMAL
                  Where's your Mother?

     Silence.

                                  JAMAL (CONT'D)
                  Father?

     The girl shakes her head slightly. Jamal takes the
     plastic sheet from around his shoulders. Gives it to
     her.

                                JAMAL (CONT'D)
                  I'm Jamal. He's Salim.

                                  LATIKA
                  Latika.

     Jamal goes back to his water pipe, climbs in. Watches
     her huddled under the sheet. Sighs, motions for her to
     join him. She darts across, jumps into the water pipe
     and huddles up next to Jamal.


37   INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICE. DAY.                               37

     Jamal looks at the Inspector.

                                JAMAL
                  I wake up every morning wishing
                  I didn't know the answer to that
                  question? If it wasn't for Ram
                  and Allah, I would still have a
                  Mother.

     Prem stares at him for dramatic effect. Presses his
     computer.

                  You've just won sixteen thousand
                  rupees! Well done, my friend.
                  Time for a commercial break-
                  don't go away, now.

     Music, applause. Prem switches off his professional
     smile. Gets up.

                                PREM (CONT'D)
                  Got lucky, huh? I'd take the
                  money. You'll never get the next
                  one.

                                JAMAL
                  You're from the Juhu slum,
                  aren't you?

                                PREM
                  Hmm? Sure. Know where I live
                  now, kid? Pali Hill. Twelve
                  bedrooms, a/c in every room, two
                  kitchens, a gym and a screening
                  room. Steel balls is what it
                  takes, my friend, steel balls.

     The Floor Manager comes over and gives his head-phones
     set to Prem. Prem listens.

                                DIRECTOR V/O
                  Prem? Tone it down, for goodness
                  sake. You're making him a
                  laughing stock.

     Prem glances up at the gallery with contempt.

                                PREM
                  We're having fun here. They love
                  it...Where the hell do you get
                  them from?

     He makes no attempt to hide the conversation from
     Jamal.

                                DIRECTOR V/O
                  It's supposed to be a quiz show,
                  not a blood sport.

               Stop wetting your pants. I'll be
               a good little boy with the next
               one. Promise.

     He chucks the head-phones back at the Floor Manager.
     Glances in the wings. Sees Nita, the make-up woman.
     Gets up and goes over.


39   INT. STUDIO. BACKSTAGE. NIGHT.                             39

     In the half-light, backstage, Nita dabs his face with
     powder.

                             PREM
               Meet me after the show. Please.

                             NITA
               No.

                             PREM
               Nita, I can explain.

                             NITA
               No need. I read it in bloody
               Stardust. Didn't even have the
               balls to tell me. "Prem's
               happiness with another baby on
               the way". After everything you
               said...

                             PREM
               Baby, it all happened before I
               met you. I swear to you.

                             NITA
               She's got the gestation period
               of an elephant, then.

     Prem is about to object. But instead, he laughs.

                             PREM
               You see? Amidst all this misery,
               only you can make me laugh.

     Scornful but hints of melting.

                             NITA
               All this misery...

                             PREM
               Her and I- nothing. You have to
               believe me, baby...

     Nita turns away. The Floor Manager comes over.

     Prem slings himself in a chair.

                                PREM
                  No. I'm not going on.

                                 NITA
                  Prem...

                                PREM
                  I can't. Without you, it's all
                  pointless.

     Clicks his fingers at the Floor Manager.

                               PREM (CONT'D)
                  You. Tell the Director.

     Nita shakes her head at the Floor Manager who by now is
     looking very worried.

                                FLOOR MANAGER
                  Thirty seconds.

     Prem shrugs and folds his arms. Sees her weaken.

                       (furious)
                  Alright.

     He grins, jumps up, blows her a kiss, and stalks back
     on stage.

     Turns to Jamal.

                  Okay, Juhu boy, you've had a
                  good run. Take your Mother to
                  Khandala and eat some chiki.

                  Well, your girlfriend then. Even
                  better.

                                JAMAL
                  I don't have a girl-friend.

                  ....three, two, one...

     Cheering and music. Prem switches on his charm.

                                PREM
                  Welcome back to Who Wants to be
                  a Millionaire! Our contestant,
                  Jamal Malik, Call Centre
                  Assistant- from Mumbai, is on
                  sixteen thousand rupees and has
                  already used one lifeline: Ask
                  the Audience. So, my friend: are
                  you ready for the next question?

                                  JAMAL
                  Yes.

                                PREM
                  Then, let's play.

     Portentous music. The lights dim.

                                PREM (CONT'D)
                  For sixty-four thousand rupees.
                  The British architect Frederick
                  Stevens designed which famous
                  building in India? Is it: A) The
                  Taj Mahal. B) Chhatrapati
                  Shivaji Terminus. C) India Gate.
                  D) Howrah Bridge. What do you
                  think, Jamal? Are you one of
                  those tea-boys with a penchant
                  for architecture?


41   INT. CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI TERMINUS. DAY.                   41

     Known to everyone as VT station, this monument to
     Victorian railway architecture is a dangerous place to
     be at rush hour.

     Even before the train has stopped, men are jumping from
     the open doors, or vaulting out of the windows or from
     the roof of the train to join the tens of thousands of
     Mumbaites streaming to and from work. A seventeen-year
     old Jamal squeezes himself out of a train and shoves
     through the crowds. He checks the time. The digital
     numerals flick to five O'clock. Looks around the tide
     of humanity.


42   INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                         42

                                PREM
                  So, what's it to be? Walk away
                  and this cheque for sixteen
                  thousand rupees is yours. Look,
                  it's even got your name on it.

     He produces a cheque and waves it at Jamal.

                                JAMAL
                  I don't have a bank account.

     Laughter from the audience. Prem is momentarily wrong-
     footed.

                                JAMAL (CONT'D)
                  But I'll take cash.

     More laughter, this time with Jamal, rather than at
     him. Prem gets up and starts rummaging theatrically
     through his jacket pockets and trousers.

                                PREM
                  Nope. Looks like the Producer's
                  stolen my wallet again-

                                 JAMAL
                  - I'll play.

     Nobody was expecting this. Least of all Prem who has to
     rearrange his features into one of surprised delight.
     He sits down.

                                 PREM
                  You'll play?

                                 JAMAL
                  Why not?

                                PREM
                  Well, well, well. We've got a
                  wild one, here.

     Prem tears up the cheque with theatrical slowness.

                  Ladies and Gentlemen, the
                  question once again....


43   INT. CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI TERMINUS. DAY.                   43

     The digital clocks show five fifteen. Shoving the
     descending river of people out of his way, the eighteen
     year-old Jamal is forging a path up steps that cross
     the platforms. He pushes to the middle of the
     footbridge and leans out on the side railings. He scans
     the sea of people, desperately. Then he sees her: the
     eighteen year-old Latika, heart-stoppingly beautiful,
     over the other side of the station. A world away. She
     is scanning the crowd, as wired as he is.

                                JAMAL
                  Latika! Latika!

     But though he is screaming her name, his voice is
     swallowed by the noise around him. Then he sees two
     thuggish-looking men also fighting a way towards her.

                                JAMAL (CONT'D)
                  Latika!

     Frightened now, he fights his way down the steps, one
     figure against an army of white-robed people.

                                JAMAL (CONT'D)
                  Latika!

                  Sure?

                                JAMAL V/O
                  I think so.

                                PREM V/O
                  You think so. A brave man,
                  Ladies and Gentlemen, a brave
                  man.


44   INT. CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI TERMINUS. DAY.                   44

     The commuters have mostly gone. Jamal is pacing the
     platform desperately. He stops, stares blankly at the
     statue in front of him- a proud, rather pompous figure
     in a Victorian frock coat. The plaque reads: Frederick
     Stevens.

                                                        31.


45   INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICE. NIGHT.                           45

     The Inspector, Srinivas and Jamal are staring at the
     video recorder.

                             JAMAL
               Yes. Final answer. Chhatrapati
               Shivaji Terminus.

                             PREM
               Is the right answer! Sixty-four
               thousand rupees to you, Sir!

     Applause and music. The Inspector presses pause. Stares
     at Jamal.

                             INSPECTOR
               And did she come back?

     Jamal smiles sadly.

                             JAMAL
               I wouldn't be here if she had.

                             INSPECTOR
               Pretty was she?

     Jamal stares down at his feet.

                             INSPECTOR (CONT'D)
               Guess not.

     Right in the eyes.

                             JAMAL
               The most beautiful woman in the
               world.

     Constable Srinivas snorts. Suddenly, Jamal is out of
     his chair and at Srinivas' throat. The combined force
     of the Inspector and Srinivas force him roughly back
     down. He is again handcuffed to the chair.

                             INSPECTOR OF POLICE
               Well, well. The slum dog barks.
               Money or women. The reason for
               most mistakes in life. Looks
               like you got mixed up with both.
               Srinivas, you need the exercise:
               a trip to VT Station to check on
               the statue. And lock your bloody
               bike up.

     Constable Srinivas swears under his breath but bumbles

                  Now, man to man. How did you
                  know all the answers?

                                JAMAL

                                JAMAL
                  No.

                  No?

                                JAMAL
                  I know this one.

                                PREM
                  Oh. I see. An expert on the
                  poets, huh?

     The lights dim, the music swells and Prem presses his
     computer.


49   EXT. MUMBAI STREET. NIGHT.                                49

     Jamal is studying a piece of paper and reading out
     numbers from it. There is something not quite right
     about Jamal- perhaps the fact that there are two feet
     by his ears. Salim is standing on his shoulders and
     spraying the numbers on a wall with an aerosol and a
     certain lack of confidence.



                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                JAMAL
                  Four, nine, zero, nine- the one
                  with the stick going down, Salim-
                  six- stick going up-

     Latika's head appears from around the corner.

                                 LATIKA
                        (whispered)
                  Oi!

     But they don't hear. Then she is running for her life
     past the pair of them.


                                JAMAL
                  Six, one, shit, let's go-

     Salim collapses off Jamal's shoulders and all three run
     off down an alley past a dozen of the gang's sprayed-on
     adverts all reading: "Beanbags- 989 4909661". A fat
     Security Guard with a long stick huffs round the
     corner. Chases them up an alley. Nowhere to go except
     through an imposing gate that clearly leads to a
     private house.

                                SECURITY GUARD
                  Got you now, little shits.


50   EXT. GARDEN. NIGHT.                                        50

     They charge across the lawn, down one side of the house
     where all the washing is hanging. The Guard gets caught
     up in drying sheets, towels. He fights his way through
     to see Salim, Latika and Jamal leaping over the wall to
     safety. But Jamal turns, jumps back and grabs a girl's
     dress from the line.

                                SECURITY GUARD
                  Aha! Little thief!

     The Security Guard lands a couple of blows on Jamal's
     back as he dodges around him and back across the lawn,
     dress in hand. The Security Guard gives up.

                                SECURITY GUARD (CONT'D)
                  Pervert!


51   INT. ALLEY. NIGHT.                                         51

     Jamal is examing the bruises on his legs.

                                SALIM
                  Useless bloody look-out. What
                  good is she, huh?


                                                      (CONTINUED)

                       (infuriated)
                  I tried to warn you.

                                JAMAL
                  It's okay, Salim.

     Latika slips on the dress. Spins. Both of them look up.
     Stare. She pulls her hair back, smiles, is transformed
     into a beautiful girl.


52   EXT. GORAI BEACH DUMPING GROUND. DAY.                     52

     Blazing sun. Diggers and trucks are shifting mounds of
     rubble on a rubbish dump that seems to stretch for
     ever. Oblivious to the dust kicked up by the trucks,
     Latika is picking up old plastic bags, examining each
     one and putting the less worn in a big sack. The dress
     is recognisable but dusty and torn. She stoops to dig
     another bag out of the dirt, but stops and stares.
     Shimmering in the heat, a rickety pick-up truck comes
     through the rubbish dump gates. Toots at the Guard who
     waves, pulls up in the dump. "Hope Orphanage is written
     on the side of the van. A man gets out. Looks around.


53   INT. `TENT'. DAY.                                         53

     Under sheets of plastic propped up on sticks, Jamal and
     Salim are sleeping out the hottest part of the day.
     Jamal wakes to see a figure standing over him- a
     silhouette with a halo of sun behind him. Out of his
     bag, the man produces a bottle of Thumbs Up. He uncaps
     it with an alluring hiss. It is almost an advert for
     thirst-quenching affluence. Almost instinctively, Salim
     and Jamal stir.

                                MAN
                  Hello.

     He hands the bottle to Salim, gets another from his bag
     and waves it questioningly at Jamal.

                                MAN (CONT'D)
                  Hot, huh? My name is Maman.


54   EXT. ORPHANAGE. EVENING.                                  54

     The hills on the edge of Bombay. Greenery and space,
     for the first time in the film. The pick-up truck pulls
     up outside a building with Jamal, Salim and Latika
     sitting on a bench in the back. Maman gets out. Drops
     the gate on the back of the pick-up.

                                MAMAN
                  Anyone hungry? Come on in.

                                                          35.


55   INT. ORPHANAGE COURTYARD. EVENING.                         55

     Twenty children are eating at long benches in a
     ramshackle courtyard. Maman, ushers Jamal, Salim and
     Latika in and sits them down at one of the benches. He
     waves a hand and a giant man, Punnoose, comes over with
     a big bowl of food. The three tear into it. Cleaning
     every last morsel of rice from his plate, Jamal looks
     up and notices a table peopled entirely with blind or
     crippled children. Some of the legless are eating on
     the floor next to the table. Jamal leans over to Salim.

                             JAMAL
               He must be a very good man to
               look after these people.

                             SALIM
                    (glancing at them)
               A saint.

     Arvind, a boy smaller than either Jamal or Salim
     overhears.

                             ARVIND
               We're not allowed to talk to
               them.

                                LATIKA
               Why not?

     Arvind shrugs. Latika licks her plate, glances at Maman
     who is looking right at them.

                             LATIKA (CONT'D)
               Well, if there are seconds,
               Maman is definitely a Saint.

     As if telepathic, Maman signals to Punnoose and he
     brings a large bowl of rice and dhal over to them.
     Latika looks at Jamal and Salim. They burst out
     laughing.

                             LATIKA (CONT'D)
               I tell you, Lord Siva is with
               us.


56   INT. ORPHANAGE. EVENING.                                   56

     Salim, Latika, Jamal and a group of children are
     standing in a line singing a doha- ancient lyrics set
     to music. Maman is leading the singing, walking up and
     down the line listening to each one individually. He
     stops at one small boy, Arvind, and listens. Nods his
     head, pleased, and continues down the line until he
     stops in front of Jamal. Holds up his hand.

                             MAMAN
               Stop! You. Again.
                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                          36.
56   CONTINUED:                                                 56

     Jamal starts singing again. He has the sweetest of
     voices. Untrained but pure. Maman smiles, ruffles
     Jamal's hair, impressed.

                                  MAMAN (CONT'D)
                  Everyone.

     They all join in. Maman continues down the line. He
     stops at Salim whose octave-slipping singing is lusty
     and appallingly out of tune. Maman winces and moves on.
     Standing next to Salim, Latika giggles. Immediately,
     Salim is on her. Before a fight breaks out, Punnoose
     pulls Salim off Latika and hurls him across the room.
     Salim gets up and charges at Punnoose. For a second,
     Punnoose is back-footed, but then pins Salim's arms to
     his side. Maman laughs. Approaches Salim.

                                MAMAN (CONT'D)
                  You sing like one, and you fight
                  like one. I think you've found
                  your dog, Punnoose.


57   EXT. CENTRAL MUMBAI TRAFFIC. DAY.                          57

     A group of children are sitting in the jumble of
     concrete under a motorway flyover. Cars surround them,
     bumper to bumper. Latika and Jamal are playing an
     improvised hopscotch on concrete slabs. They are
     giggling, bumping into each other, tickling, laughing.
     Salim and Punnoose are sitting together, smoking. Salim
     is staring hard at Jamal and Latika until Punnoose
     grunts, a sign for Salim to clap his hands.

                                SALIM
                  Okay, let's go, let's go! It's
                  not a bloody holiday!

     The children get to their feet. Latika sighs, puts a
     patch over her eye and grabs a pair of crutches.
     Suddenly, the lame beggar. Salim goes over to one of
     the girls, who is carrying a sleeping baby. Puts out
     his hand.

                                  SALIM (CONT'D)
                  Give me that.

     The girl shakes her head. Salim grabs her by the hair
     in one hand and takes the baby with the other. He
     shoves her to the ground. The other children stare.

                                  JAMAL
                  Hey, Salim!

     He challenges Jamal.

                                SALIM
                  What, choté bhai? You got a
                  problem?
                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                        37.
57   CONTINUED:                                                57

     He laughs and walks over to Latika.

                                   SALIM (CONT'D)
                  Here. For you.

                                LATIKA
                  I don't want it.

                                SALIM
                  You'll earn double. I'm doing
                  you a favour, Latika.

                                JAMAL
                  She doesn't want it.

                                   SALIM
                  Chup, Jamal.

     Latika turns away and begins to walk towards the cars.

                                   SALIM (CONT'D)
                  I'll drop it.

     He holds the baby up. Latika grabs the baby with a cry
     just as Salim releases it from his hands. Salim pinches
     the baby.

                                SALIM (CONT'D)
                  Triple if it's crying.

     Latika snatches it away. Salim laughs, goes back to
     sitting with Punnoose. The children scatter to the cars
     trapped at the lights, tapping plaintively on the
     windows and making the universal begging gesture.


58   INT. ORPHANAGE. KITCHEN. NIGHT.                           58

     Surrounded by beer bottles, Punnoose is slumped asleep
     by the kitchen door. Latika edges past, avoids the cook
     sleeping under the table and goes to a shelf laden with
     vegetables. She pulls down a bunch of chillies still on
     the vine, strips a few off and tip-toes out with them.


59   INT. ORPHANAGE. DORMITORY. NIGHT.                         59

     Sleeping children, three or four to a mattress on the
     floor. Latika tip-toes around the mattresses. She
     pauses over one in particular where we see Salim,
     asleep. She carefully pulls up the sheet, delves
     underneath. Pleasant dreams cross Salim's sleeping face
     for a second. Then suddenly, he is bolt upright and
     screaming. He charges around the room clutching his
     genitals in agony.

                                SALIM
                  Madher chod...!

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                           38.
59   CONTINUED:                                                  59

     He sprints out of the room, wailing.


60   INT. ORPHANAGE. SHOWERS. NIGHT.                             60

     The lights are on and two dozen children are screaming
     with laughter as Salim stands under the make-shift
     shower directing the water down his pants to his
     burning genitals, his face a picture of agony. Latika
     wipes crushed chillies from her hands.

                                SALIM
                  You're dead, sala.

     She smiles and walks past Jamal with a shrug. Then
     Punnoose comes stalking in and the children scatter
     away.

                                PUNNOOSE
                  Get back to bed, dogs! What the
                  hell...

                                JAMAL V/O
                  They taught me every song in the
                  history of Indian music.

                                INSPECTOR V/O
                  And why would they do that, I
                  wonder?


61   INT. SHACK. NIGHT.                                          61

     In a shack, Arvind is singing one of Surdas' bhajans in
     front of Maman and an old man who by his ragged
     appearance must be a villager. Punnoose and Salim sit
     behind Arvind.

                                MAMAN
                  Very good, very good. I am
                  pleased, Arvind. He is ready.

                                ARVIND
                  Ready?

     Maman nods to Punnoose. Before Arvind can turn round,
     Punnoose has covered his mouth with a cloth and after
     the briefest of struggles, Arvind's body goes limp. The
     villager puts an old tin box on the table. Taking the
     lid from the tin, he brings out a cloth and unwraps it.
     Inside is a spoon. He checks the edge with his thumb.
     Sharp. Douses it with a clear liquid from a bottle and
     passes it over a candle flame. The spoon whooshes with
     a high flame for a moment. The villager wipes it with
     the cloth nods to Punnoose.

                                PUNNOOSE
                  Salim!

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                           39.
61   CONTINUED:                                                  61

     Utterly bemused, Salim nevertheless helps Punnoose lay
     Arvind on the table. The villager takes hold of
     Arvind's eyelid and pulls it open. He brings the spoon
     close. Suddenly, Salim is being sick in the corner of
     the shack. By the time he has turned back, the villager
     is wiping the spoon on a blood-soaked rag.

                                MAMAN
                  Okay. Take him out the back.

     Punnoose picks up Arvind and carries him out.

                                MAMAN (CONT'D)
                  Now the other one. Salim, go get
                  Jamal.

     A frozen moment.

                                SALIM
                  What?

                                MAMAN
                  Gunfighter Number One, isn't
                  that right, Salim? The money,
                  the women, the cars...you want
                  them bad, huh? And why not?

     Maman gets out of his chair. Approaches Salim.

                                MAMAN (CONT'D)
                  The time has come to choose,
                  yaar. The life of a slum dog or
                  the life of a man. A real man. A
                  gunfighter, Salim.

     Maman holds Salim's head in his hands.

                                MAMAN (CONT'D)
                  Your destiny is in your hands,
                  bhai. You can be me. Or nobody.
                  Understand?

                                SALIM
                  Yes, Maman.

     Maman nods.

                                MAMAN
                  So, brother, go get Jamal.

     Salim is frozen for another few seconds, then turns and
     walks out of the door. Punnoose appears at the door.
     Maman nods to him and he slips off after Salim.


62   INT. DORMITORY, ORPHANAGE. NIGHT.                           62

     All the children are asleep apart from Jamal who is
     crouched underneath a couple of wash-basins.
                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                          40.

     He is talking through a plate-sized hole in the
     crumbling masonry. Latika's eyes can be seen.

                                JAMAL
                  ...weddings, government things,
                  big parties. If Maman says my
                  voice is ready. Big money.

                                LATIKA
                  Enough for a room?

                                JAMAL
                  Easily. Maybe an apartment.

                                  LATIKA
                  Really?

                                JAMAL
                  That's what Arvind said. On
                  Harbour Road. You, me and Salim.
                  The three musketeers.

                                LATIKA
                  Harbour Road! We can have ice
                  cream from Babanji's.

                                JAMAL
                  Every day if we want.

     Salim appears at the door. Nods his head at Jamal.

                                  JAMAL (CONT'D)
                  It's my turn.

                                LATIKA
                  Good luck, Jamal.

     Latika's hand comes through the gap. Jamal takes it for
     a moment. Salim hisses at Jamal. He lets go of the hand
     and heads out.


63   EXT. PATH. NIGHT.                                          63

     Salim and Jamal walk along the path, Jamal humming
     happily. Salim checks behind him, sees Punnoose
     following.

                                JAMAL
                  So, this is it, hey, bhai? The
                  good life, here we come....

                                SALIM
                       (conversationally)
                  Athos.

     Jamal is suddenly alert. Slows


                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                        41.

                  Porthos?

     Salim nods. Big smile. Puts a hand on Jamal's shoulder.

                                  SALIM
                  When I say.


64   INT. SHACK. NIGHT.                                        64

     Salim guides Jamal into the shack where Maman and the
     Villager are waiting. Maman smiles. Punnoose slips in
     behind Salim.

                                MAMAN
                  Jamal, hello. You have done
                  well. It's time for you to- turn
                  professional.

                                  JAMAL
                  Really?

                                MAMAN
                  Sing me a song, yaar. How about
                  Chalo Ri Murali, huh? My
                  favourite.

     Jamal opens his mouth, then closes it again. Holds out
     his hand.

                                  JAMAL
                  Fifty rupees.

                                  MAMAN
                  What?

                                JAMAL
                       (shrugs)
                  I've turned professional. What
                  can I do?

     Maman laughs.

                                  MAMAN
                  Sala...!

     He throws some notes at him.


65   EXT. SHACK. NIGHT.                                        65

     Outside, a giggle. Latika is peering through a gap in
     the wall.

                                                          42.


66    INT. SHACK. NIGHT.                                        66

      Jamal begins to sing. Maman waits a while, then nods to
      Punnoose. Behind Jamal, Punnoose hands Salim the bottle
      of chloroform and the rag. Salim approaches the back of
      Jamal. Salim waits until he has finished the song.
      Raises his hand with the rag in it. Maman smiles, nods.
      Salim flings the contents of the bottle in Punnoose's
      face. Punnoose screams and stumbles back clutching his
      eyes, knocking over the table.

                                SALIM
                Go!

      Salim and Jamal scramble for the door. The knocked-over
      candle catches the spilled chloroform and a curtain
      which whooshes up in flame.

                                LATIKA
                Jamal!

                                JAMAL
                Run!


66A   EXT. SHACK. NIGHT.                                        66A

      They charge past the prone Arvind- a flash of bloodied
      bandages covering his eyes.


67    EXT. HILLSIDE. NIGHT.                                     67

      Heavy, desperate breathing. Feet stumble on roots. Fall
      into holes. The three children are running. Branches
      smack into their faces. But they are so scared, nothing
      will stop them. Behind them, torches scour the
      undergrowth. Men shouting. They break out of the woods
      and are confronted with a train goods yard.


68    EXT. GOODS YARD. NIGHT.                                   68

      They run over the tracks, between the trains, but the
      shouts are getting louder, the torches closer. A diesel
      engine is moving out of the station. Jamal, Latika and
      Salim sprint for the Guard's Van at the very back of
      the moving train. Punnoose is closest to them. Salim is
      fastest and first to jump the train. He holds out his
      hand. Jamal grabs it and is hauled in. Jamal holds his
      hand out to Latika.

                              JAMAL
                Come on! Faster!

      She reaches out to him. Their hands almost touch.

                                                             43.
68   CONTINUED:                                                    68

                                JAMAL (CONT'D)
                  Take it! Take it! I can't
                  reach...

     Salim barges Jamal out of the way. Jamal      stumbles back
     as Salim reaches his hand out to Latika,      so he doesn't
     see Latika's hand grasp Salim's, nor see      their eyes
     lock onto each other, nor see Salim very      deliberately
     let go of her hand. Latika stumbles.

                                LATIKA
                  Jamal!

     Jamal scrambles to the rail. The train gains more
     speed. Jamal climbs on to the top rung, makes to jump,
     but Salim flings him backward. Jamal tries to scramble
     to his feet again, but Salim restrains him.

                                JAMAL
                  Got to go back. We've got to go
                  back.

                                SALIM
                  He'll kill us if we go back.
                  Jamal! He was going to take your
                  eyes out- with a bloody spoon!

     The train is speeding along. Jamal breaks free and
     stares back at Latika.

                                SALIM (CONT'D)
                  She'll be alright. She always
                  is.

     Latika stumbles again and stops running. They watch as
     Punnoose catches up with her and stops running. He
     smashes Latika to the ground.

70   INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICE. DAY.                             70

     The Inspector is eying Jamal, weighing it all up.

                                JAMAL
                       (shrugging)
                  Blind singers earn double. You
                  know that.

                                INSPECTOR
                  And what happened to the girl?
                  They blinded her too?

                                JAMAL
                       (shakes his head)
                  They had other plans. Though it
                  took me a long, long time to
                  find out.


71   EXT. TRAIN. MORNING.                                      71

     Salim and Jamal are sitting on top of the train. Jamal
     is staring blankly down the track.

                                  SALIM
                  Aré, Jamal...

     Salim puts an arm around Jamal's shoulder. Jamal wipes
     the tears from his eyes, shakes his head furiously.


     Salim gets up. Holds out his hand.

                                  SALIM (CONT'D)
                  Come.

                                JAMAL
                  Where you going?

                                SALIM
                  First class, bhai. Where else?

                                                        45.


72   INT/ EXT. FIRST CLASS CARRIAGE. MORNING.                  72

     The ancient train is huffing slowly up an incline. A
     middle class Indian couple with their three children
     are sitting at a table, their breakfast spread before
     them. Into this domestic scene, unseen by them comes
     Jamal. Upside down and still outside the train, he is
     clearly being dangled by his ankles from the train
     roof. He gives a few, silent directional signs to Salim
     who manoeuvres him across, dips his hand into the open
     window, snatches a chapatti and signals franticly to be
     hoisted up. The family continue to eat, unperturbed.

     Then Jamal appears again. This time one of the children
     spots him. Despite Jamal giving her a friendly wave,
     she yelps. The father of the group grabs Jamal's hand
     which has just snatched a samosa. There is a tussle,
     Salim holding onto Jamal's legs, the father holding
     onto Jamal's arms and Jamal in the middle, shouting.
     Salim is losing the battle and his footing. He stumbles
     and the pair of them fall from the train, rolling and
     tumbling down an embankment in slow-motion.
     Interspersed with the seemingly endless tumble are
     images of Jamal and Salim on top of different trains-

     - huddled together against the freezing rain...

     - surfing the wind at the front of the train...

     - admiring the distant Himalaya....

                             JAMAL V/O
               We criss-crossed the country
               from Rajasthan to Calcutta.
               Every time we were thrown off we
               got back on again. This was our
               home for years. A home with
               wheels and a whistle.

     The final tumble as they crash onto flat ground.


73   EXT. RAILWAY EMBANKMENT. DAY.                             73

     Groggily, Jamal sits up and groans. Somehow in the
     tumble, he has been transformed into a twelve year-old.
     And Salim a strong fourteen year-old. Through the haze
     of pain and dust, Jamal sees something glinting in the
     distance- something impossibly beautiful.

                             JAMAL
               Salim? Is this heaven?

                             SALIM
               You're not dead, Jamal.

     Jamal clears his head. Sees Salim picking himself up
     from the ground. But the apparition is still there.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                         46.

                                JAMAL
                  So what's that?

                                SALIM
                  Wow.

     They stare at the apparition. The unmistakable outline
     of the Taj Mahal rises from the horizon, pink in the
     morning sun. Nothing could be more beautiful.

                                JAMAL
                  Some hotel, huh?


74   EXT. TAJ MAHAL. DAY.                                      74

     Jamal and Salim wander under the great dome of the Taj
     Mahal. Two tiny slum kids dwarfed by this massive
     monument to love. It is a moment of genuine wonderment
     for them. Then a tour guide bustles nearby, tourists
     flowing behind him.

                                GUIDE
                  ...there are five main elements
                  to the Taj. The Darwaza, the
                  main gateway, the Bageecha or
                  garden, the Masjid or mosque,
                  the Naqqar Khana, the rest house
                  and the Rauza or mausoleum. If
                  you would like to follow me, I
                  will show you the ninety-nine
                  names of Allah on Mumtaz's tomb.
                  As before, please remove your
                  shoes.

     Jamal follows the Guide and his entourage into the
     mausoleum. Salim meanwhile is studying the line of
     shoes. Tries a smart pair of women's court shoes,
     before slipping a foot into a nice, white sneaker. A
     smile crosses his face. His other foot quickly follows
     and he saunters away, all mock-innocence.


75   EXT. TAJ MAHAL. DAY                                       75

     Jamal comes out of the mausoleum into the bright
     sunlight and looks around for Salim. No sign of him.
     Suddenly, a German couple approach.

                                ADA
                  Please, what time is the next
                  tour?

     Jamal notices that he is standing next to a sign
     advertising guided tours of the Taj.

                                JAMAL
                  No, I-

                                ADA
                  - we're on a very tight
                  schedule, you see, young man.
                  Have to see the Red Fort this
                  afternoon. Would it be possible
                  to show us around now? Obviously
                  we understand it would cost more
                  for just the two of us...

     Peter waves a couple of thousand rupee notes at Jamal.
     His eyes widen.

                                JAMAL
                  But of course, Madam. Please
                  follow me.

     Jamal stalks off. The Germans follow. Jamal stops
     before the monument. Points a confident arm at it.

                                JAMAL (CONT'D)
                  This is....the Taj Mahal.

     A terrible pause as Peter and Ada stare at him. Clearly
     more is expected. He moves off at a pace.

                                 JAMAL (CONT'D)
                  The Taj Mahal was built by the
                  Emperor Khurram for his wife
                  Mumtaz who was maximum beautiful
                  woman in the whole world. When
                  she died, the Emperor decided to
                  build this five star hotel for
                  everyone who wanted to visit her
                  tomb...but he died in- in
                  fifteen eighty-seven, before any
                  of the rooms were built. Or the
                  lifts. The swimming pool,
                  however, as you can see was
                  completed on schedule in top
                  class fashion.

     He waves confidently in the direction of the fountains.

                                ADA
                  It says nothing of this in the
                  guide book.

                                JAMAL
                  With respect, Madam, the guide
                  book is written by a bunch of
                  lazy, good-for-nothing, Indian
                  beggars.

               I thought she died in child-
               birth.

                             JAMAL
                    (nodding sagely)
               Exactly, Sir. She was on the way
               to the hospital when it
               happened.

     Jamal moves on. Ada and Peter exchange a glance.

                              ADA
                    (shrugging)

     Montage of Jamal authoritatively showing tourists
     around the Taj Mahal.

                             JAMAL V/O
               It was the best-paid job I've

               This is the Princess Diana seat,
               Madam. Allow me.

     Jamal shows the tourist a battered postcard of Princess
     Diana, staring doe-eyed into the distance with the Taj
     behind. The tourist sits. Jamal adjusts her legs so
     that they match the postcard. Takes the photo....

     for safety as two Police Officers race towards him.

     Jamal stands a Tourist on a wall and positions his
     hands to create the optical illusion that he is
     dangling the Taj from his fingers. Takes a photo for
     the Tourist. Behind the Tourist, Salim and a boy called
     Shankar pick up the Tourist's shoes and saunter
     casually across the grass.

     By the side of a busy market street Salim stands next
     to a row of stolen shoes. Sneakers, court shoes,
     sandals, high heels...he is busy bartering with a man
     over a pair whilst Jamal tries to shout up business.

                                JAMAL
                  Top-class fashion, bottom-class

79   EXT. BOYS CAMP, YAMUNA RIVER. DAY.                         79

     Hectares of drying clothes by the side of the river.
     Spectacular squares of red, saffron, white. Not far
     away from the dhobi ghat, there is a makeshift slum-
     camp where Salim and a gang of children are sitting,
     smoking. Jamal joins them, hands over a wad of rupees
     to Salim. Salim counts the cash, hands half to Shankar
     and slaps Jamal so hard on the back that he nearly
     falls over.

                                JAMAL V/O
                  And life was good.


80   EXT. SLUM. DAY.                                            80

     Jamal gets out of a new Mercedes driven by an Indian
     Man. A middle-aged American couple also get out. Jamal
     points them down a lane which opens out on India's
     largest dhobi where hundreds of women are beating
     clothes on stone slabs.

                                JAMAL
                  This is the biggest dhobi ghat

                  Let's get a look at this, Adele.

     He gets out his video camera and wanders towards the
     dhobi ghat. Behind them a motor rickshaw pulls up.
     Salim, Shankar and a couple of the street kids from the
     Taj leap out. Within seconds, the Mercedes is up on
     bricks and the wheels are being removed. Salim takes a
     hacksaw to the Mercedes badge on the bonnet, whilst
     urging the others on.

                                SALIM

                  One! Pit-stop ka speed,

     The crowds in the lane barely notice as the car is
     stripped of all its parts.

                                SALIM (CONT'D)
                  Go, go!

     A shout from the top of the lane and the boys scatter,
     bouncing the four wheels at speed down the lane. Jamal,
     the Indian driver and the two Americans return. They
     stop in front of the denuded car.

                                CLARK
                  Woah. What happened here?

     Suddenly the Indian driver is slapping Jamal
     ferociously around the head with one of his shoes.

                                DRIVER
                  I give you two tight slaps,

                  did I...? Nothing to do with
                  me...get off!

     But the beating continues, the driver kicking Jamal
     down onto the floor. The two Americans stare, uncertain
     what to do.

81   EXT. YAMUNA RIVER. NIGHT.                                     81

     A battered Jamal limps along the river bank towards the
     Taj. He stops, bathes his swollen face in the river.
     Then looks up. Strange lights appear to emanate from
     the base of the monument. And then strange sounds.


82   EXT. TAJ MAHAL. NIGHT.                                        82

     Jamal climbs   a crumbling   wall and is confronted with an
     opera taking   place right   under the dome. Gluck's Orfeo
     ed Euridice.   Hundreds of   India's smartest professionals
     are watching   from banked   seating on a scaffolding
     frame.


83   EXT. STANDS. NIGHT.                                           83

     Jamal and a couple of street kids slip under the
     scaffolding supporting the banked seats. The street
     kids are trying to reach the hand-bags of the women
     above them.

                             BOY
                    (hissing)
               Oi, Jamal! There's a woman with
               no panties on over here.

     Jamal reaches up and easily lifts a wallet from a man's
     trouser pocket. On stage, the actors start singing.
     Jamal seems to have forgotten the wallet and stares,
     mesmerised, at the stage.

                             WOMAN
               Why don't you put it back and
               listen to the music?

     Jamal starts, makes to run, but the woman who spoke
     holds out a cigarette. A Canadian back-packer is
     sitting, staring at the singers.

                                WOMAN (CONT'D)
                  It's called Orfeo. Orpheus and
                  Eurydice. Orpheus- that one
                  there- is looking for his lover,
                  Eurydice. She died, but he can't
                  live without her.

     She hands him a cigarette. He puts the wallet back. She
     smiles at him and they both turn to the stage.

                                WOMAN (CONT'D)
                  The pain is so bad that he goes
                  to the underworld- the place we
                  go when we die- to try to get
                  her back.

                                JAMAL
                  You can't do that. Can you?

                                WOMAN
                       (shrugging)
                  You can in opera.

                                JAMAL
                  Does he find her?

                                   WOMAN
                  Watch and see.

     Jamal watches as Orpheus sings one of the most
     beautiful pieces of music a human is likely to hear.
     Tears are running down Jamal's cheeks.


84   EXT. YAMUNA RIVER. NIGHT.                                   84

     Salim, Shankar, Jamal and the Taj Gang are gathered
     around a campfire. All of them wear extraordinary foot-
     wear of one form or another, from elaborate high heels
     to walking boots five sizes too large. A home-made
     hooka pipe is being passed around the fire. The eyes of
     the children have long since stopped focussing. Salim
     is sporting a Mercedes Benz badge on a chain around his
     neck. Behind him, Jamal appears, his face swollen. He
     takes off his fake Guide's Badge and throws it in the
     fire.

                                SALIM
                  Woah! What are you- Jamal?

                                JAMAL
                  We have to go, Salim.

                                   SALIM
                  Go? Go where?

                  Bombay.

                                SALIM
                  Don't be stupid. We're making
                  good money here.

                                JAMAL
                  We should have gone a long time
                  ago.

     Salim turns to Shankar with sudden understanding.

                                SALIM
                  Oh, God. Baby brother's in love.
                  With a flat-chested hijra.

                                JAMAL
                  Latika was one of us. A
                  musketeer.

                                SALIM
                  A musketeer...Grow up, Jamal.
                  Look, how was I to know they'd
                  beat you up. Here, you can have
                  some of the cash. Come on...

                                   JAMAL
                  I've got cash.

     He rips out a wad of dollar bills from his pocket.

                                   JAMAL (CONT'D)
                  Dollars.

                                   SALIM
                  How much?

                                JAMAL
                  Enough. I'm getting my stuff.

     He walks off.

                                SALIM
                  Wait! Jamal! Ah, shit!

     He gets up, kicks the fire in rage and stomps after
     Jamal.

     Prem leans back in his chair.

                  So, my friend: ready for another

                  Yes.

     Prem presses his computer. The lights dim again, the
     music comes up.

                                PREM
                  For a straight one million
                  rupees, Ladies and

                  Roosevelt, C) Benjamin Franklin,
                  D) Abraham Lincoln?

     Silence from Jamal.

                                PREM (CONT'D)
                  Pay or play, Jamal? All you have
                  to do is stop now and you walk
                  away with a cool quarter of a
                  million rupees. Decide to play,
                  get the answer wrong and you

                  nothing. But, get the answer

     A long pause.

                  Now I know why my cell phone

                                JAMAL
                  It's C. Benjamin Franklin.

     A gasp from the audience. Prem is caught off-guard.

                                PREM
                  Woah! We haven't locked the

                  I've never heard of Roosevelt
                  Franklin.

                                PREM
                  There's a million rupees at
                  stake and he's never heard of
                  Roosevelt Franklin...I can't
                  bear to look.

     He gives this one to the audience who titter on cue.
     Jamal looks confused.

                                PREM (CONT'D)
                  No, no. Don't you worry, Jamal.
                  You were asked which statesman
                  is depicted on a hundred dollar
                  bill. You said C. Benjamin
                  Franklin. Ladies and
                  Gentlemen...

     He presses the computer, pretends to ruminate for a
     while with his finger pressed to his lips.

                  Jamal Malik- you chose to play
                  not pay. I'm afraid you no
                  longer have two hundred and
                  fifty thousand rupees....

     Prem leans over and tears up the cheque. There is a
     sigh of disappointment from the audience, a look of
     confusion on Jamal's face.

                             PREM (CONT'D)
               ...you in fact have one million
               rupees!

     Wild applause from the audience. Jamal allows himself a
     genuine smile.


88   INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICE. DAY.                               88

     The Inspector pulls out a note from his wallet. Glances

               I don't know.

     He waves the note at him.

               It's Gandhi!

                             JAMAL
               I've heard of him.

     The Inspector kicks his chair.

               Don't get clever or I'll get the
               electricity out again.

               They didn't ask me that
               question. I don't know why. Ask
               them.

     The Inspector stares hard at Jamal.

               Funny, you don't seem that
               interested in money.

89   EXT. BOMBAY. DAY.                                           89

     From a thousand feet in the sky, looking down on the
     limitless megatropolis of Mumbai. Half-built sky-
     scrapers, slums, factories, roads, trains.

                                JAMAL V/O
                  Bombay had turned into Mumbai.

     We descend, down until the lines of ants become people.

                                JAMAL V/O (CONT'D)
                  The orphanage had gone, the slum
                  had gone, the people.... all
                  gone. And everywhere was
                  building, building, building.

     Descending even further, we pick out a construction
     site and then Jamal....


90   EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE. DAY.                                90

     ..who is staring through a wire fence at the
     construction site.

                                JAMAL V/O
                  But I knew she was here.
                  Somewhere she was here.

     He turns away, then something catches his eye.
     Underneath all the scraps of flyers and posters on a
     broken wall is a corner of something that Jamal
     recognises. He tears back a poster. Underneath, faded
     but recognisable is one of their beanbag graffiti
     advertisements.


91   EXT. SLUM. NIGHT.                                           91

     Jamal asks a group of stall-holders on the slum main
     street. They shrug, aren't interested. The camera pulls
     up and up until Jamal is nothing but a dot wandering
     the maze of lanes, railways and highways, one among
     endless millions of people.

                                JAMAL V/O
                  Evenings, I searched. Days, I
                  worked.

                                                           58.


92   EXT. HOTEL. DAY.                                            92

     Jamal wanders up to the rickshaw drivers parked outside
     the hotel. He stops and asks a question. The drivers
     shake their heads. Jamal continues up the steps towards
     a door, exhausted face and grubby clothes walking
     straight towards camera. He goes through the door and
     immediately....


93   INT. HOTEL. FOYER. DAY.                                     93

     ....is, without breaking step in a slightly grubby
     white uniform. He walks across the echoing, marble
     floor of a struggling four-star hotel, goes through
     double doors....


94   INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. DAY.                                   94

     ...into a corridor that is devoid of carpet, paint-
     anything except a phone on the bare wall and a stool.
     The phone is ringing. Jamal sits on the stool and
     answers the phone.

                             JAMAL
               Room service, good afternoon?...
               Yes, sir. Two chicken burgers,
               two fries, one cocoa-cola and
               one mango lassi and a large
               bottle of mineral
               water...Bisleri or Himalayan
               Spring, Sir?...Certainly, Sir.
               That will be with you in fifteen
               minutes, Sir. Thank you. Have a
               nice day.

     He hangs up and goes through another set of doors...


95   INT. HOTEL KITCHENS. DAY.                                   95

     ...to a cramped kitchen with definite hygiene problems.
     The cooks are playing carom on the table while under it
     Salim is dozing.

                             JAMAL
               Two chicken burgers, coke, mango
               lassi and a bottle of Bisleri.

     Dozily, Salim gets up and takes a look behind one of
     the fridges. He chases out a chicken with a desultory
     kick and sorts through some empty mineral water bottles
     until he finds a Bisleri bottle. Salim fills the bottle
     of mineral water from the tap and begins delicately re-
     sealing the tamper-proof lid with super-glue. Jamal
     collects cutlery and starts laying out a tray.

                                JAMAL (CONT'D)
                  I'm going to Chowpatti again,
                  okay? Want to come?

                                SALIM
                  For God's sake. You got some
                  disease? You force me back to
                  this shit-hole, we leave our
                  friends, a good life, loads of
                  money- for this. Isn't that
                  enough?

                                JAMAL
                  We came back to find her.

                                SALIM
                  No, you did, Jamal, not me. Me,
                  I don't give a shit about her.
                  Plenty of pussy in Bombay for
                  Salim. Oh, yes, sir! You should
                  come down the Cages on Saturday
                  night instead of searching for
                  your lost love.

                                JAMAL
                  I'm going to Chowpatti.

                                 SALIM
                       (impersonating Ram)
                  "I'm going to Chowpatti". There
                  are nineteen million people in
                  this city, Jamal. Forget her.
                  She's history.

                                JAMAL V/O
                  But she wasn't.


96   EXT. BANDRA BANDSTAND. DAY.                               96

     Jamal is dodging the traffic at a busy junction. He
     moves around the beggars who are working the cars. Then
     he hears singing. He looks around, suddenly panicked.
     It is a siren song drawing him across the road, not
     even noticing that he is narrowly run down by a couple
     of cars, to a traffic island underneath a flyover. He
     turns a corner and there is the singer, leaning up
     against one of the struts of the flyover. Arvind. Older
     now, just like Jamal, a fourteen year-old boy. But eye-
     less. Jamal freezes. He approaches Arvind and waits
     until he has finished singing. Despite his eyeless
     sockets, Arvind appears to know somebody is there. He
     turns and bows low, putting his hands together.

                                ARVIND
                  Namaste, Sahib. Any kindness you
                  give will be repaid in heaven
                  many times.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                           60.

     Jamal gets a couple of notes out of his pocket and puts
     them into Arvind's outstretched hand. He feels the
     notes with his fingers.

                                ARVIND (CONT'D)
                  A fifty. And a hundred!
                  Blessings upon you, Sahib.

                                JAMAL
                  How do you know?

                                ARVIND
                  There are many ways of seeing.

     Arvind puts his hands together and bows deep again.
     Then, Jamal takes his shoe off and gets out a hundred
     dollar bill.

                                 JAMAL
                  Here.

     Jamal crouches down and puts the bill into Arvind's
     hand. His fingers feel it. He sniffs it.

                                ARVIND
                  Dollars. But how many?

                                 JAMAL
                  One hundred.

                                ARVIND
                  Now you are playing with me,
                  Sahib.

                                 JAMAL
                  No. I swear.

                                ARVIND
                  What is on it? The pictures.
                  Tell me.

                                JAMAL
                  A building. With a clock on it.
                  Trees behind it.

                                ARVIND
                  The other side. Turn it over.

                                JAMAL
                  A man- it doesn't say his name.
                  He is sort of bald, but has long
                  hair on the sides.

                                ARVIND
                       (smiling)
                  Benjamin Franklin. My God, my
                  God. Thank you, Sahib. You were
                  generous the first time. But
                  this...
                                                     (CONTINUED)

     He stops. Suspects.

                             ARVIND (CONT'D)
               And without even a song?

     A long pause. Arvind keeps hold of Jamal's arm.

                             ARVIND (CONT'D)
               So you are rich, now, are you,
               Jamal? I am happy for you.

                             JAMAL
               I am so sorry, Arvind.

                             ARVIND
               You got away. I didn't. That is
               all. No, no tears. Tears mock me
               all the more.

                             JAMAL
               Arvind, I am looking for-

                             ARVIND
               - how's your voice, Jamal?

                             JAMAL
               I don't know. I haven't sung
               since- since then. Arvind, I-

                             ARVIND
               - and your eyes?

                             JAMAL
                    (surprised)
               My eyes? My eyes are fine.

                             ARVIND
               Then stay away, chutiyé, and
               count your blessings every
               morning you open them and see
               the sun rising. You owe Maman.
               He doesn't forget.

                               JAMAL
               I owe Latika.

     Arvind shakes his head angrily.

                             JAMAL (CONT'D)
               Please. Is she alive? Arvind, is
               she alive?

                             ARVIND
               Alive? Oh, she's alive alright.
               It's your life, Jamal. Pila

               now.

               Thank you.

     Jamal heads off through the traffic. Arvind shouts
     after him.

                             ARVIND
               I will sing at your funeral,
               yaar.


97   EXT. PILA STREET. NIGHT.                                    97

     Dark, crowded streets. Gangs of women stand outside the
     doorways or lean out of upstairs windows. They are
     garishly-dressed prostitutes varying in age from 13 to
     60. Men wander past, eying the possibilities,
     exchanging lewd comments with them. Among the hordes on
     the pavement are Jamal and Salim. They pass doorway
     after doorway of narrow rooms where prostitutes wait
     for customers. Jamal and Salim stop at each group of
     women, Salim taking the lead, clearly asking them
     something, as the women either shrug or offer them
     something lewd- judging by the laughter that follows.
     But one woman in a narrow doorway points down the
     street. Jamal has to drag a reluctant Salim away from
     the group.


98   INT. BROTHEL. NIGHT.                                        98

     They go into one of the tiny houses. Loud Filmi music
     comes from upstairs. They are confronted by a woman in
     her fifties watching tv. She is less than interested.

                             SALIM
               I'm looking for Cherry.

                             WOMAN
               No, kid. Not available. Plenty
               of others. Take a look.

     She indicates curtained cubicles behind him.

                             SALIM
               I'm Latika's brother.

     The Woman looks at him properly for the first time.

                             WOMAN
               She's still not on the menu.
               Choose someone else or piss off.

     Then, Jamal pulls out some rupee notes.

                             JAMAL
               Just two minutes to talk to her.

     She takes the money, counts it.
                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                              63.

                                  WOMAN
                   Two minutes.

      She nods upwards. Salim and Jamal head up the dark,
      tiny staircase. The Woman picks up the phone on her
      desk.


99    INT. LANDING. NIGHT.                                          99

      On the tiny landing, Salim and Jamal pull back a
      curtain to reveal a humping couple. They move on, past
      more women lying on their beds or blankly having sex,
      not in the least perturbed to be interrupted. They
      reach the end of the landing. From the other side of
      the door comes the filmi music. Jamal puts his eye to
      one of the gaps in the slatted door. Through it he can
      see glimpses of a girl dancing to the music. Latika;
      though not the rag-picker of before. Now fifteen, she
      is a beautiful young woman and dressed in a revealing,
      turquoise, silk sari.

                                 SALIM
                   Is it her or not?

      He shoves Jamal out of the way and watches.

                                 SALIM (CONT'D)
                   Shit, she's sexy, man....

      Then the music stops, an effeminate man steps into the
      limited frame Salim can see and snaps a stick down hard
      on Latika's hand.

                                 DANCE TEACHER
                   Smile! Flow, flow! You entice
                   with the hands not make
                   chapattis, you gawaar. Again.

      The man starts the music again and Latika's hands flow
      elegantly around her head.

                                 DANCE TEACHER (CONT'D)
                   Lift your feet, you lump. Stop,
                   stop!

      The stick is raised to hit her but Jamal opens the
      door.


100   INT. BROTHEL. NIGHT.                                          100

      She can barely believe her eyes.

                                  LATIKA
                   Jamal?

      The Dance Teacher turns.

                                 DANCE TEACHER
                   What the hell do you want?

      He switches off the music.

                                   JAMAL
                   Come. Quick.

      But Latika remains fixed.

                                 DANCE TEACHER
                   You silly little boys. Get out
                   now while you can.

                                   JAMAL
                   Come with us.

      Latika runs to Jamal. But she freezes as she looks at
      the doorway. Maman, Punnoose and the Woman from
      downstairs stand there. The skin around Punnoose's eye
      bears the blisters from the chloroform burn years ago.

                                 MAMAN
                   Look who we have here, Punnoose.
                   Hello again, Jamal. Salim. Never
                   forget a face. Especially one
                   that I own.

                                 PUNNOOSE
                   Shall I take them to the
                   marshes?

                                 MAMAN
                   Whatever you like. Have fun.
                   Just make sure that you dispose
                   of them properly afterwards. No
                   traces, thank you.

      He turns to Jamal.

                                 MAMAN (CONT'D)
                   You really thought you could
                   just walk in and take my prize
                   away? Have you any idea how much
                   this little virgin is worth,
                   bhen chod?

      He fingers Latika's hair.

                                 MAMAN (CONT'D)
                   Get them out of here.

      Punnoose and the Muscle walk towards Jamal. Maman turns
      to the Dance Teacher as they grab his arms.

                                 MAMAN (CONT'D)
                   Please continue, Master-ji.

      The Dance Teacher puts the music back on.

                No.

      Suddenly, Salim is holding a pistol.

                              SALIM (CONT'D)
                Leave him. Get over there.

      Punnoose and the Muscle slowly release Jamal and join
      Maman.

                              MAMAN
                Let's not be foolish, Salim.
                Heavy, aren't they?

      Salim straightens up his gun arm.

                                SALIM
                Money.

                              MAMAN
                You can have money. Here.

      Maman gets out his wallet and throws all the money in
      it on the floor.

                              MAMAN (CONT'D)
                Take it. Go. Disappear with your
                friend and we'll forget all
                about this. Okay?

      Salim collects up the money.

                              SALIM
                Maman never forgets. Isn't that
                right?

                              MAMAN
                Oh, Maman can make an exception.

      Salim walks over to the music, turns it up. Picks up a
      cushion from the bed and walks right up to Maman.

                              SALIM
                Can't take that risk, Maman.
                Sorry.

      He wraps the cushion around the gun and pulls the
      trigger. Or tries to. Nothing happens. There is a
      frozen moment as they watch him fail to shoot.
      Everybody watches with surreal interest as Salim
      fumbles with the pistol. Eventually he looks up,
      giggles stupidly.

                                SALIM (CONT'D)
                Safety catch.

      Shrugs apologetically and shoots. Nobody is more
      surprised than Maman who crumples onto the floor.

      Latika starts desperately gathering up the notes on the
      floor, grabs Maman's wallet. Jamal just stands.

                               SALIM (CONT'D)
                 Come on.

      They run out of the room and down the stairs as Maman
      dies on the floor in front of his frozen colleagues.


101   EXT. CHOWPATTY BEACH. DUSK.                             101

      Children are splashing in the sea, flying kites,
      digging sand, laughing. Salim, Latika and Jamal are
      crouched on the shore watching the sun sink into the
      sea. Latika is going through Maman's wallet, Salim is
      fingering the pistol, admiringly. Jamal is staring out
      to sea. Each in their own world, yet sharing swigs from
      a bottle of Johnny Walker.

                               LATIKA
                 Shit, there's thousands here.

                               SALIM
                 We should be celebrating.

                               JAMAL
                 You just killed somebody.

                               SALIM
                 He was going to kill us.

                               JAMAL
                 Where did you get the gun?

                               SALIM
                 Bought it. Now, I'm going to
                 have to throw this beauty in the
                 sea.

                               LATIKA
                 You didn't need to kill him.

                                SALIM
                 What? Typical. I save your life
                 and you're on at me. All you
                 ever do is mess us up. Whenever
                 you're around-

                               JAMAL
                 - shut up, can't you? Just shut
                 up.

      Silence.

                               SALIM
                 Why can't you just be happy,
                 huh?

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                          67.

                                    JAMAL
                    Happy?

                                  SALIM
                    You got what you wanted, didn't
                    you? So, let's celebrate.

                                  LATIKA
                    Yeah. Let's celebrate.

       She takes a long swig from the bottle.

                                    LATIKA (CONT'D)
                    While we can.

       She nudges Jamal and holds the bottle out to him.
       Smiles at him. He smiles back, shakes the black dog
       from his head and takes a long, long drink. Latika and
       Salim cheer.


101A   EXT. TULIP STAR. NIGHT.                              101A

       Latika, Salim and Jamal bend back a bit of the wire
       mesh fence that protects the deserted hotel. Crawl in.


102    INT. TULIP STAR. LOBBY. NIGHT.                           102

       A very wobbly Latika, Salim and Jamal walk up the
       frozen escalators of the empty hotel, lit only by
       security lights. Kick through the odd pile of rubbish
       and stacked-up chairs. Go to the dusty reception desk.

                                    JAMAL
                    Service!

                                    SALIM
                    Reception!

                                  JAMAL
                    We want a room, boy. Executive
                    Class with smoking. Third floor
                    with balcony.

                                  LATIKA
                    Sea-facing, yaar.

                                  SALIM
                    Have the bags brought up.

       And they scoot off, giggling into the dark.


102A   INT. TULIP STAR. KITCHENS. NIGHT.                    102A

       Jamal and Latika wander the vast, empty kitchens. Jamal
       searches the empty chillers and cabinets. Then,
       realises that he is alone.

                    Latika? Salim?

       Where are they? Suddenly,

                                     LATIKA
                    Room service!

       She comes shooting out of the darkness across the
       kitchen floor riding a trolley with Salim pushing her
       at top speed. Jamal has to skid out of the way. He
       grabs another trolley and glides off in pursuit.


102B   INT. TULIP STAR. CORRIDOR. NIGHT.                       102B

       The three stand by a mirror and play with their
       reflections.


102C   INT. TULIP STAR. HOTEL LOBBY. LATER.                    102C

       On top of the metal preparation counters, Salim and
       Jamal are fencing: Jamal with a fish slice and Salim
       with a large spoon.


103    INT. HOTEL ROOM. NIGHT.                                  103

       An empty, dusty hotel suite. Jamal is on the phone.

                                  JAMAL
                    307 here. I want a bottle of
                    Johnny Walker Red Label, beer,
                    wine-

                                     LATIKA
                    - chicken.

                                  JAMAL
                    Ah! Chicken....

       Jamal closes his eyes at the wonderful thought.

                                  JAMAL (CONT'D)
                    What kind of chicken?

                                  LATIKA
                         (also dreaming)

                    - aloo gobi, rice-

       She stops. Change of mind.

                   Hold the line, chutiye.
                   Pop Tarts?

                                 LATIKA
                   On the tv. The commercial.
                   Everybody's happy when they have
                   Pop Tarts.

                                 JAMAL
                   Exactly! A bucket of Pop Tarts,
                   chutiye.

      Jamal slams down the phone.


104   INT. HOTEL ROOM. LATER.                                  104

      Latika is clearly in the shower. Jamal wanders in
      carrying an old pair of lunghi. Shouts through the
      door.

                                 JAMAL
                   Found some lunghi!

                                 LATIKA V/O
                   Stay there. Look away.

      The shower stops.

                                    JAMAL
                   Atcha, atcha.

                                 LATIKA V/O
                   I'll know if you're looking....

                                    JAMAL
                   I'm not!

      With a towel around her, Latika comes to the doorway
      where Jamal is holding out a the lunghi with his eyes
      tight shut.

                                    JAMAL (CONT'D)
                   Where's Salim?

                                    LATIKA
                   Dunno.

      She watches this innocent a second with true fondness.

                                 LATIKA (CONT'D)
                   You're a sweet boy, Jamal.

      She takes the lunghi from his outstretched hand and
      disappears into the bathroom, slamming the door with a
      giggle.


105   EXT. MUMBAI SLUM STREET. NIGHT.                          105

      Salim wanders the crowded streets of a slum. He stops
      uncertainly at a doorway where a group of men are
      lolling, smoking. Plucks up his courage.

                                 SALIM
                   I'm looking for Javed-bhai.

                                 MAN
                   Ja, mada chod. He's not looking
                   for you. Ja!

                                 SALIM
                   I need to see him.

      The group of men stir, irritated now. Salim begins to
      back away, then stops. Pulls the gun from behind his
      back.

                                 SALIM (CONT'D)
                   I killed Maman. I'll kill you
                   too. Easy.

      The group are frozen.

                                 JAVED
                   You killed him?

      Javed is standing in the doorway.

                                 JAVED (CONT'D)
                   My enemy's enemy is my friend,
                   no? So, come in, friend.


106   INT. HOTEL ROOM. LATER.                                  106

      Jamal and Latika lie on the bed, drunk, though still
      coherent. Latika is dressed in the Bell-Boy's jacket
      and the old lunghi.

                                 LATIKA
                   Maman's gang will hunt us. You
                   know that?

                                   JAMAL
                   I don't care.

                                   LATIKA
                   Me neither.

      They burst into stupid laughter. The laughter subsides.

                   That dance you were doing. In
                   Pila Street. Show me.

      Latika rolls over and switches off the light. Rolls
      back. In the half light, her hands begin to move for
      Jamal, the elegant, alluring hand movements of the bar-
      girl dancers. Jamal stares, mesmerised.

                                 LATIKA
                   You came back for me.

                                   JAMAL
                   Of course.

                                 LATIKA
                   I thought you'd forgotten.

                                 AMIR
                   I never forgot. Not for one day.
                   I knew I'd find you in the end.
                   It's our destiny.

                                   LATIKA
                   Destiny. Yes.

      Latika stops her hands. They stare at each other, their
      faces inches away from each other. Latika strokes
      Jamal's face.

                                   LATIKA (CONT'D)
                   Thank you.

      And face to face, they slowly fall asleep.


107   INT. HOTEL ROOM. LATER.                                 107

                                   SALIM
                   Hey.

      Jamal opens his eyes. Salim is standing over them,
      swaying with alcohol.

                                   JAMAL
                   Salim?

      He puts his hand out to Latika.

                                   SALIM
                   Come.

                                 JAMAL
                   No. Salim....Bhai, you've had a
                   lot to drink...

      Jamal tries to get up, but Salim's hand is round his
      throat and pushes him down on the bed.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

107   CONTINUED:                                             107

                                 SALIM
                   I am the elder. And I am the
                   boss. For once, you do as I say.

                                    JAMAL
                   No.

      Salim pulls Latika to her feet.

                                 SALIM
                   I saved your bloody life, didn't
                   I?

                                    LATIKA
                   Salim, please-

                                    SALIM
                   - chup, sali.

      As he turns, pulling a protesting Latika, Jamal leaps
      on him. The two brothers go down fighting, but of
      course it is Salim who comes up on top. Latika launches
      herself at Salim, but he smashes her away, almost
      delighted that she has joined in. He drags Jamal to the
      door, laughing.


108   INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. NIGHT.                            108

      Salim throws him out into the corridor, slams the door.

                                 SALIM
                   I am Number One now!

                                 JAMAL
                   Salim, no, no....!

                                 SALIM
                   Get yourself a room, bhai.

      Salim slams the door. Jamal gets up, bangs on the door,
      keeps on banging until the door opens and Salim stands
      there with the pistol pointing straight at Jamal's
      head.

                                 SALIM (CONT'D)
                   The man with the Colt 45 says
                   chup.

      He shoves Jamal hard down the corridor, the gun pointed
      at him all the while.

                                    JAMAL
                   Salim...

      Salim nods towards the fire escape door.

                                 SALIM
                   Now go. Or Gunmaster G-9 will
                   shoot you right between the
                   eyes. Boom. Don't think he
                   won't. You have five seconds.
                   One, two, three, four-

      Salim cocks the pistol. Jamal screws up his eyes for
      the inevitable. But Salim shoves him out with a roar
      and slams the door. Jamal bangs on the door.

                                 JAMAL O/S
                   Salim...

      Salim walks slowly back down the corridor as Jamal
      bangs and bangs on the door. Down the hall, Salim's
      door shuts.


109   INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICE. DAY.                            109

      The Inspector is staring hard at Jamal. Srinivas is
      desperately trying to get his attention.

                                 CONSTABLE SRINIVAS
                   Sir, sir!

                                 INSPECTOR
                        (eventually)
                   Enlighten us Constable.

                                 CONSTABLE SRINIVAS
                   Accessory to murder, Sir.

      The Inspector puts his hands in the air, palms up.
      Simple.

                                 INSPECTOR
                   Only the finest minds in the
                   Mumbai Police Force.

      Untroubled by irony, Srinivas looks extremely pleased.

                                 INSPECTOR (CONT'D)
                   Go check the files, Constable.

      Srinivas goes out.

                                 INSPECTOR (CONT'D)
                   You puzzle me, Slumdog.
                   Admitting murder to avoid a
                   charge of fraud is not exactly
                   clever thinking. Now, why would
                   you do that?

      Jamal shrugs.

                   When somebody asks me a
                   question, I tell them the
                   answer.


110   EXT. TULIP STAR. MORNING.                                110

      At the gate, a Security Guard is sitting in his chair.

                                 JAMAL
                   Where are they?

      The Guard grunts.

                                 JAMAL (CONT'D)
                   Where did they go?

      A more impatient grunt from the Guard. He stands up,
      walks towards Jamal.

                                 JAMAL (CONT'D)
                   Please, Sir. Which way?

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                   I don't know and I don't care.

      The Guard raises his stick and gives him a roar. Jamal
      backs away onto the street. The Guard slams the gate
      shut. Jamal looks despairingly up and down the street
      at the teeming traffic, the crowds.

                                 PREM V/O
                   Ready for another question.

                                 JAMAL V/O
                   Yes. I'm ready.

112   INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                      112

      We are back in the Studio.

                                 PREM
                   For two and a half million

      Jamal smiles.

                                 PREM (CONT'D)
                   He's smiling. Why does that
                   worry me?

                                                         75.


113   EXT. MUMBAI. DAY.                                        113

      Leaden skies. Torrential rain is hammering on the tin
      roofs of the slum.


114   INT. SHACK. DAY.                                         114

      Eighteen year-old Jamal's eyes open. Now with the
      beginnings of a beard and moustache, Jamal wakes in a
      tiny shack just big enough for a mattress on the floor.
      He pulls on a shirt, lifts the mattress and takes out
      his trousers which have been pressing there all night,
      puts them over his shoulder, picks up his shoes and
      goes down a ladder.


115   INT. SHACK. DAY.                                         115

      He descends into a room and two feet of water that is
      eddying around the ground floor of the shack. Wades out
      of the door into the narrow lane of the slum.


116   EXT. SLUM. DAY.                                          116

      Jamal nods hello to a number of neighbours, also bare-
      legged, also with their shoes in hand. Together, they
      wade to higher ground, put on their trousers and shoes
      and trudge up to the main road.


117   INT. CALL CENTRE. NIGHT.                                 117

      Ultra-modern, glass-windowed office. The words Cultural
      Studies are written on the white board. Jamal walks in
      with a tray of glasses of chi. He puts a glass down on
      the young, hip, Teacher's desk and heads out again.

                              TEACHER
                Okay, guys, it's been a big week
                in UK. Kat is back.

      He holds up a copy of Radio Times showing Kat from East
      Enders smiling at them. A collective groan from the
      Trainees.

                              BARDI
                She's already back.

                                 TEACHER
                Bardi...Jamal?

                              JAMAL
                Oh. Well. She did come back,
                then she went away when Alfie
                split up with her and now she's
                back again.

                                 JAMAL (CONT'D)
                   But it looks as if Alfie still
                   fancies Mo after all, so-

                                 TEACHER
                   - thank you, Jamal. Keep up,
                   Bardi. The chi-wallah knows more
                   than you.

      Bardi glares at Jamal. Jamal shrugs apologetically and
      goes out.

                                 TEACHER (CONT'D)
                   Okay, it's been super-duper hot
                   for UK this week, so there'll be
                   a lot of chat about that- they
                   love their weather- and there's
                   the festival in Edinburgh-
                   Edinburgh?

      He points at a young woman Trainee.

                                 NASREEN
                   Scotland. Kilts, castles, err,
                   haggis? Porridge, the Highlands,
                   mountains. Ben- Ben Nevis?

      The Teacher points at another Trainee.

                                 TRAINEE 2
                   Detective Taggart. Whisky, Sean
                   Connery!

                                 TEACHER
                   And lochs. Their word for lakes.
                   Good. It's also double bonus
                   time for an upgrade to the
                   `friends and family' package
                   this week, so remember to push
                   for an upgrade...

                                    EVERYONE
                   ...Every Call!

      Jamal walks out, turns a corner.


118   INT. CALL CENTRE. UK FLOOR. NIGHT.                       118

      We are confronted with a room you could swing a Boeing
      in. Rows and rows of Operators in tiny booths stretch
      into the distance. On the walls are pictures of London,
      Tony Blair, red telephone boxes, the Yorkshire Dales,
      the Highlands- a snapshot of tourist Britain. Huge
      posters of soap stars and celebrities adorn the rest of
      the walls. Slogans hang from the ceiling. "When the sun
      comes up, you'd better be running", "you snooze, you
      lose", "Upgrade for a better, faster life." "Every call
      is a new opportunity".

      Each section of the room has a banner with a British
      city's name on it and various mock sign-posts for the
      different aisles. A Manager under the banner
      "Bradford", is standing over an Operator, listening in
      on a call. The Manager leans over and presses a key.

                                 MANAGER
                   If they want an upgrade, a new
                   tariff or we're stealing them
                   from the other networks, you
                   take the call. Anything else-

      He mimes cutting his throat.

                                 MANAGER (CONT'D)
                   No time-wasters on Team
                   Bradford, kid. Leave that to the
                   homosexuals on Tunbridge Wells.

      Jamal stops by him. The Manager takes a glass of tea
      from Jamal.

                                 MANAGER (CONT'D)
                   Where've you been? Dave on
                   Cornmarket's virtually lost his
                   voice, there's two on Ilkley
                   Moor who've had their hands up
                   for hours. Come on, move it!

      Jamal hurries down the aisle signposted "Cornmarket",
      gets to a male trainee and hands him a tea. Dave
      glances around to check nobody's looking and slips off
      his head-set.

                                 DAVE
                   Two minutes, Jamal. I'm on
                   "Millionaire" duty.

                   Rajneesh...

                                 DAVE
                   It's my turn, Jamal. I've had my
                   pee breaks. Please. If he comes
                   just keep your head down and
                   pretend you're doing an upgrade
                   on the-

                                 JAMAL
                   - `friends and family'. I know.

      Jamal still looks unwilling.

                   Two minutes.

      Dave heads off towards a Rest and Recreation room,
      where a big plasma screen on the wall is showing "Who
      Wants To Be A Millionaire."Jamal grabs the jacket from
      the back of Dave's chair, puts the head-set on and
      hunches over the booth, just another Operative at work.
      We become aware that every operator down the Cornmarket
      aisle- and quite a few other aisles besides- is staring
      in the direction of the Rest and Recreation Room.


119   INT. REST AND RECREATION ROOM. NIGHT.                 119

      Dave dives for the doorway and waves.


120   INT. CALL CENTRE. UK FLOOR. NIGHT.                    120

      Suddenly all the operators are dialling. Almost
      simultaneously, twenty or so voices say.

                              OPERATORS
                I'd like to be a contestant on
                Who Wants to be a Millionaire.

      Most of the Operators- including the man next to Jamal-
      suddenly lose their tension.

                              OPERATOR
                Bloody bastard. I never get it.

                              JAMAL
                You have to dial when Prem says
                "if". "If you want the chance to
                be a contestant on Who Wants To
                Be A Millionaire..." That's when
                they open the lines.

      The Operator looks at him. Jamal shrugs.

                              JAMAL (CONT'D)
                That's what Anjum in Technical
                says. He put the system in.

                              OPERATOR
                So why don't you?

                              WOMAN V/O
                Hello? Hello? Have I been
                transferred again, for God's
                sake?

      Jamal freezes with fear. The head-set speaks again with
      its broad Scottish accent.

                                 WOMAN V/O (CONT'D)
                   Hello? Jesus, God, will somebody
                   talk to me?

                                   JAMAL
                   Hello, Mrs...

      He stares at the computer.

                                 JAMAL (CONT'D)
                   ...Mackintosh from King Gussie.

                        (weary)
                   It's Kingussie, love. Pronounced
                   Kinoosie.

                                   JAMAL
                   Kinoosie?

                                 WOMAN V/O
                   So where are you from? Abroad, I
                   bet. China or somewhere. What
                   good is-

                                 JAMAL
                   - just down the road from your
                   house, Mrs Mackintosh. Next to
                   the loch.

                                 WOMAN V/O
                        (suspicious)
                   Oh aye? Which loch?

      Jamal searches desperately around, spots a picture of
      Big Ben.

                                 JAMAL
                   Loch Big- Loch Ben. Next door to
                   Detective Taggart's flat.

                                 WOMAN V/O
                   Loch Ben? Och, no, hen, that's
                   one of the wee ones up in the
                   Highlands. You're all the way up
                   there? But I bet it rains, eh,
                   hen?

                                 JAMAL
                   Indeed yes, Mrs Mackintosh. I
                   have to wade through a metre of
                   water every morning.

                                   WOMAN V/O
                   No!

                              JAMAL
                Yes, yes, Mrs Mackintosh. In my
                kilt.

                                WOMAN V/O
                Och, no, hen.

      Jamal puts his feet on the desk.

                              JAMAL
                It's alright once I've had my
                porridge, my haggis and a few
                Scotch whiskies- and the
                monsoon's nearly over, so-

                              WOMAN V/O
                - and what monsoon would that
                be? I'd like to speak to your
                supervisor, son.

                              JAMAL
                I don't think that's a good
                idea. He is a very important
                man, Mrs Mackintosh-

                              WOMAN V/O
                - get me the supervisor on this
                line now-

                              JAMAL
                - and he doesn't like bloody
                time wasters.

      Jamal panics, presses the button he saw the Manager
      press earlier. The screen goes blank, then reboots
      itself. Jamal looks around. Where the hell is Dave? On
      the screen, Jamal is faced with the question: "what
      name do you require?" He looks around again, and then
      with one finger types in the word "Latika". He presses
      enter. Hundred upon hundred of Latikas with their
      surnames and phone numbers scroll down the page. He
      erases her name and enters the name Salim K. Malik.
      Presses enter. Fifteen numbers come up. He stares at
      the numbers for a long time, then types it into his
      computer and presses dial.

                                MAN V/O
                Yeah?

                Who wants to know? Do you know
                what bloody time it is?

      Clearly not Jamal's brother. Jamal cuts the line. Dials
      the next number.

                 Huh. Hello?

      Clearly not his Salim. He cuts the line. Dials again.

                 Hello? Hello? Who is this?

      But Jamal can't speak.

                               SALIM V/O (CONT'D)
                 Hey. Is someone screwing with
                 me?

      Silence.

                 I am calling from XL 5
                 Communications Sir. As a valued
                 customer, we are offering you a

                 Jamal? Is that you? Brother?
                 Where are you, man?...I thought
                 you were dead or something...we
                 had to go, Jamal. Maman's guys.
                 They were searching the
                 hotel...Jamal, say something.
                 Please.

      There is another long silence.

                                 JAMAL
                 Hello, Salim.

      A flash of a sign post reading `Oxford Circus',
      pointing down one of the aisles. The banner above that
      section of the warehouse reads `London'.

      Jamal hurrying down another `Kings Parade' carrying
      glasses of tea. He glances up to see a large banner

      Jamal comes back up an aisle named `Broad Street'. An
      Operator on the adjacent `The High' clicks his fingers
      for another cup. Jamal hurries under the sign marked
      `Oxford'.

                                                      CUT TO:

      The signposts of the aisles come faster and faster
      `Pembroke Street', `Trafalgar Square', `East India
      Dock' and finally `Cambridge Circus'.

                   I can't remember.

                   I don't think it's Oxford.

                                 PREM

                   Well, Oxford has Broad Street,
                   Saint Aldates, Turl Street,
                   Queen Street, The High and
                   Magdalene Bridge- which is

                   Oh, I haven't. And it's not
                   Leeds, because that's Elland
                   Road, Kirkgate Market,
                   Commercial Street, St Peter's-

                        (icy)

                   Well, I don't think it's
                   Cambridge.

                                 PREM
                   Cambridge Circus is not in
                   Cambridge? Dare I ask why?

                                 JAMAL
                   Too obvious. There's definitely
                   an Oxford Circus in London, and
                   there's a rowing race between
                   Oxford and Cambridge so there's
                   probably a Cambridge Circus too.
                   I'll go for D) London.

                                 PREM
                   That's the logic that's got him
                   this far, Ladies and Gentlemen.

                B) Bruce Browning, C Dan Wesson
                or D) James Revolver?

      Dramatic pause.


124   INT. HOTEL. NIGHT.                                       124

      A flash of Salim shooting Maman. Another flash of Salim
      in the doorway, holding the pistol up to Jamal's head.

       Jamal nods.

                    Final answer?

                                    JAMAL
                    Final answer.

       The music swells again. Prem presses his computer.

                                  PREM
                    You had two and a half million
                    rupees. If I may-?

       He holds out his hand. Jamal hands him back the cheque.
       He tears the cheque in two.

                                  PREM (CONT'D)
                    Ladies and Gentlemen, the chi-

                    right! Incredible!

       Cheers and applause from the audience.

                                   INSPECTOR
                    Not that incredible. You'd just
                    murdered somebody with a Colt
                    45, after all.

                                  JAMAL
                    It was self-defence.

                                  INSPECTOR
                    Let's call it manslaughter,

                    Are you nervous?

       The audience laugh. Prem is momentarily flustered.

                                  PREM
                    What? Am I nervous? You're the
                    one who's in the hot seat, my
                    friend.

128   INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                      128

      Music, lights. Prem presses his computer.

                                 PREM
                   What sports do you play?

                                 JAMAL
                   None.

                                 PREM
                   None. Oh, dear, oh dear, oh
                   dear. Not to worry, there's only
                   ten million rupees at stake...
                   Which cricketer has scored the
                   most first class centuries in
                   history. Was it A) Sachin
                   Tendulkar, B) Ricky Ponting, C)
                   Michael Slater, D) Jack Hobbs.

      Prem allows the question to sink in.

                                 PREM (CONT'D)
                   You've got a cheque for five
                   million rupees in your hands.
                   You've still got two life-lines,
                   Phone A Friend and 50/50. For
                   ten million rupees: pay, play,
                   or bail out. It's still an
                   option. Remember, if you get the
                   answer wrong, you will lose
                   everything like that.

      He clicks his fingers.

                                 PREM (CONT'D)
                   Are you sure you want to do
                   this?


129   EXT. CRICKET GROUND. DAY.                                129

      An Indian batsman hits a nicely-timed stroke, heads
      down the wicket for a single. Turns. The other batsman
      is taking a second run.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

129   CONTINUED:                                            129

      The Indian tries to halt the other batsman with a
      shout, then succumbs to the inevitable and charges down
      the wicket. A fielder hurls the ball at the stumps. The
      bails fly off.


130   INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                     130

                   I'll play.

      Tense laughter from the audience. Prem holds up the
      cheque. Jamal nods. Prem tears it up slowly. Allows the
      pieces to fall to the floor.

                                 PREM
                   The dreams of so many. On the
                   floor.


131   EXT. TOWER BLOCK. DAY.                                  131

      Jamal is riding the construction lift to the top of a
      high building, still just a shell but buzzing with
      carpenters, bricklayers, cable-layers. The lift stops
      at the top. Jamal gets out. Looks around. He is miles
      up. Alone.

                                 SALIM
                   Jamal!

      Jamal looks around. There is Salim standing on the edge
      of the building. He saunters over to Jamal, his arms
      outstretched in theatrical greeting. He is groomed,
      expensively dressed with the best mobile money can buy
      dangling from a gold chain around his neck.

                                 SALIM (CONT'D)
                   God is good, bhai. God is good.

      He tries to embrace Jamal. With as much force as he can
      muster, Jamal punches him in the face. Salim takes it.
      Stands there. Wipes blood from his lip. Gets another
      punch. Then another and another, not even defending
      himself, until he is being beaten back by a raging
      Jamal towards the edge of the building. Finally, he
      tries to reason with Jamal

                                 SALIM (CONT'D)
                   Maman's boys were after us. Had
                   to skip.

      Jamal keeps on beating him back.

                                 JAMAL
                   Liar.

                                  SALIM
                    Left a message at reception.
                    Waited weeks for you in Nagpur.

                                  JAMAL
                    There was no message at
                    reception.

                                  SALIM
                    Bhai, I left a message.

       Salim opens his arms, defenceless. It would take one,
       small push to send him over the edge. There is a
       moment, when Jamal might. He even has his hands on his
       chest.

                                  JAMAL
                    I will never forgive you.

                                  SALIM
                    I know.

       The fury in Jamal subsides minutely. Finally, he turns
       away with a roar of frustration. Salim hangs his head.


131A   EXT. TOWER BLOCK. LATER.                              131A

       Jamal and Salim are sitting on the very edge of the
       building. They can see for miles across the city. Salim
       has rediscovered his attitude.

                                  SALIM
                    Can you believe it? This was our
                    slum. We lived just there, huh?
                    Now it is business, apartments,
                    call centres...Fuck USA, fuck
                    China. India is at the centre of
                    the world, now, bhai. And I am
                    at the centre of the centre,
                    Jamal. This is all Javed-bhai's.

                                  JAMAL
                    Javed Mehta? The Gangster from
                    our slum? You work for him?

                                  SALIM
                    Who else would protect us from
                    Maman's gang, huh?

                                  JAMAL
                    What do you do for him?

                                  SALIM
                    Anything he asks.

       Salim's mobile rings. Salim is immediately subservient
       on the phone. Rings off.

                    He is coming. You must go. My
                    card.

       He hands Jamal a card.

                                  JAMAL
                    What for?

                                  SALIM
                    You think I am going to let you
                    out of my sight again, little
                    brother? You stay with me now.
                    Ab phut!

                                  JAMAL
                    Salim, where's Latika?

                    Still? She's gone, Jamal. Long
                    gone. Now go. Quick.

       Jamal gets up, hurries away, hidden behind piles of
       building materials just as Javed appears in his flash
       suit and jewelry. Three of his young henchmen walk
       alongside.



132    INT. SALIM'S APARTMENT.    NIGHT.                        132

       Jamal is asleep on a mattress on the floor of a smart
       apartment. A mobile phone rings. The muffled sound of
       Salim talking quietly next door. Then, Salim creeps
       into the room, checks to see Jamal is asleep, unlocks a
       desk drawer and brings out his pistol. He puts it in a
       hold-all and goes out the front door. Jamal's eyes snap
       open. He has seen it all.

                                  JAMAL V/O
                    Slum dogs never sleep, only nap.
                    He would disappear for a couple
                    of days and come back changed.
                    Sometimes elated-


133    INT. SALIM'S APARTMENT. NIGHT.                           133

       The door bangs open and a giggling-drunk, half-naked
       Bar Girl drags the sleeping Jamal up and into the
       bathroom.

                                  BAR GIRL
                    He has flipped! I can't do
                    anything with him....

       Salim is in the bath, bathing, literally, in money.

                   Sometimes the opposite.

      Jamal creeps towards Salim's bedroom door. He pushes it
      open a fraction to see Salim crouched on the floor in
      prayer, sobbing quietly.

                                 SALIM
                        (whispering)

135   EXT. SALIM'S APARTMENT. DAY.                             135

      Salim comes out of his apartment block. Gets into his
      jeep. Drives off. Doesn't notice Jamal in the motor
      rickshaw that pulls out and follows him.


136   EXT. JAVED'S BUNGALOW. DAY.                              136

      Salim approaches a gate-house to a large bungalow. The
      Door-Keeper nods to him, rings a bell. From the
      rickshaw, Jamal watches a woman come to the door.
      Latika. Eighteen, completely beautiful and rich. She
      hands Salim a package and goes back inside. Salim gets
      in his jeep and drives away.


137   EXT. JAVED'S BUNGALOW. DAY.                              137

      Jamal approaches the Door-Keeper's gate-house.

                                 JAMAL
                   Baba, I am the new cook from the
                   agency. A thousand apologies, I
                   am late for the Memsaab.

      The Door-Keeper grunts and goes inside. After a brief
      pause, he returns.

                                 DOOR-KEEPER
                   She doesn't know anything about
                   any cook. There's supposed to be
                   a dishwasher being delivered.

                                 JAMAL
                   Baba, I am your dishwasher!

      The Door-keeper grunts at this attempt at humour.
      Latika appears at the gate.

                                 LATIKA
                   Haven't I told you, don't
                   interrupt when I'm watching-

      She looks at Jamal. Is silenced briefly.

                                 LATIKA (CONT'D)
                   - come inside. I'll show you the
                   kitchen.


138   INT. KITCHEN. DAY.                                       138

      Latika and Jamal go into the kitchen. Who Wants To Be A
      Millionaire plays on the tv in the background. She
      turns and hugs him tight. They laugh with happiness.

                                 LATIKA
                        (delighted)
                   Jamal, Jamal, look at you...!

      Their heads are close, they might kiss. Then Latika
      turns away, stares out of the window.

                                 LATIKA (CONT'D)
                   Aré wa, Jamal....

      Jamal smiles hopefully at her. But there is sadness in
      her now. She takes her sunglasses off, rubs her eyes.
      There is a bruise there.

                                 JAMAL
                   You've hurt your eye.

                                 LATIKA
                   Why are you here?

                                 JAMAL
                   To see you.

                                 LATIKA
                   Well. You see me.

      She stands there, challenging. On the tv, somebody is
      winning money.

                                 JAMAL
                   Why does everyone love this
                   programme?

                   It's the chance to escape, isn't
                   it? Walk into another life.
                   Doesn't everyone want that?

                                 JAMAL
                   You have another life. A rich
                   one.

                                 LATIKA
                   Who'd have thought it possible?
                   A slum dog, with all this.

                                    JAMAL
                   Are you happy?

                                 LATIKA
                   I have five star food, five star
                   clothes. I sleep in a bed, not
                   on the street. From where we
                   come from, Jamal, that is
                   happiness.

                                 JAMAL
                   You don't look so happy with a
                   black eye.

                                 LATIKA
                   You turn up here out of nowhere,
                   telling me I'm not happy: how
                   dare you?

      Voices at the gate-house.

                                 LATIKA (CONT'D)
                   God, Javed will kill you. Here.

                                 JAMAL
                   Javed? You are with him?

      She throws him an apron. He gets it on just in time for
      Javed to walk in. Jamal turns away.

                                  JAVED
                   First you want a dishwasher, now
                   a bloody cook-

                   - chup. The cricket's on.

      Javed changes channel and dials on his mobile.

                                 JAVED (CONT'D)
                   Why do you always watch that

      He laughs at his own joke. Turns to Jamal.

                              JAVED (CONT'D)
                Well, come on then, Cook. I'm
                hungry. Get me a sandwich.

                              JAMAL
                Immediately, Sir.

      Javed stares at Jamal a moment, trying to place a face
      he vaguely recognises. Then the Bookie comes on the
      line and he turns back to the television.

                              JAVED
                Atcha...

      Latika hurries around the kitchen getting out bread and
      condiments, whispering while Javed talks on the phone.

                              JAMAL
                Come away with me.

                              LATIKA
                Chutiyé. Away where? And live on
                what? What can you provide? What
                have you got, Jamal?

                              JAMAL
                Love.

                ..yeah. He's on eighty-five. I

                century. What are you
                giving?...Okay, make it five
                lakh.

      Javed pours himself a glass of whisky, never taking his
      eyes from the television.

                You and me. That is the real
                world. Come away with me.

      Latika snatches the sandwich from him and gives it to
      Javed. Goes back to Jamal, whispers under cover of
      putting condiments away.

                                LATIKA
                You're crazy.

                Salim will help us.

                Straight bat, straight bat,

      Then the batsman at the other end calls to take a
      second run.

                                JAVED (CONT'D)
                No! A single!

      Tendulkar seems to agree, tries to halt the other
      batsman with a shout, then succumbs to the inevitable
      and charges down the wicket. A fielder hurls the ball
      at the stumps. The bails fly off.

                              JAVED (CONT'D)
                No, no, no! stupid ben chod

      He flings his glass of whisky at the television.
      Suddenly tastes what he has been eating.

      room. His footsteps can be heard stomping into another
      room.

                              LATIKA
                Now go, before he kills us both.

      Back to Jamal.

                              LATIKA
                Then forget me.

                I'll wait at VT station. Five
                o'clock every day until you
                come.

      She shakes her head.

                              JAMAL (CONT'D)
                I love you.

                So what, Jamal? So what?
                (loudly)
                Now, get out and tell your no-
                good agency not to send anybody
                else until they've learnt to
                cook. You hear?

      She slams the door. Hurries back into the kitchen,
      throws Javed's plate into the sink. The Door-keeper
      comes in.

                              DOOR-KEEPER
                Madam, your dishwasher has
                arrived.

      Leaning over the sink, Latika weeps silently.

      Salim has his hand around Jamal's throat.

                              SALIM
                Why can't you let it alone? You
                want money, I'll give you money.
                Girls? I can get you girls.

                You're like some crazy man-
                you're obsessed.

                              JAMAL
                She is my destiny, Salim.

                              SALIM
                Know what your destiny is, crazy
                boy? A bullet between the eyes.
                And after that, he'll kill her.
                Is that what you want? Huh?

                              JAMAL
                Me, I don't care. Latika? She's
                already half dead.

      Salim takes his hand away from Jamal's neck.

                              SALIM
                Yes. About that, you are right.

                                JAMAL
                You sold her.

                     (fierce)
                I didn't sell her. Javed wanted
                her. He gets what he wants.

      He turns away bitterly.

                              SALIM (CONT'D)
                She's doing alright. Get it into
                your thick head, Jamal. She's
                not yours and she never will be.

      The Floor Manager and a Security Guard usher Jamal off-
      stage. Prem looks up at the gallery, raises his eyes at
      the Director. Some show. Then he gathers himself and
      heads off-stage.

      The clock reads five oh three. Jamal stands on the
      footbridge. Humanity washes around him. His eyes dart
      around, frightened to miss her. Checks the clock again.
      Six. The platform is almost deserted. He wanders away.


142   INT. CORRIDOR. NIGHT.                                   142

      Prem wanders down the corridor followed by a Security
      Guard. Another Security Guard is waiting at the
      entrance to the toilet. Prem goes in, leaving the two
      Guards in the corridor.


143   INT. CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI TERMINUS. DAY.                 143

      Jamal stands on the footbridge gazing down at the
      hordes of commuters. Five o'clock, five fifteen, five
      thirty. Six. Jamal rests his head against the railings.


144   INT. TOILET. NIGHT.                                     144

      Jamal is in one of the cubicles. Prem goes to the
      urinal. Unzips.

                                 PREM
                   A guy from the slums becomes a
                   millionaire overnight. You know
                   the only other person who's done
                   that? Me. I know what it's like.
                   I know what you've been through.

                                 JAMAL O/S
                   I'm not going to become a
                   milionaire. I don't know the
                   answer.

                    You've said that before, yaar.

       Prem finishes pissing. Goes over to the washbasins,
       runs the taps and washes his hands.

                                  JAMAL O/S
                    No, I really don't.

                                  PREM
                    What? You can't take the money
                    and run now. You're on the edge
                    of history, kid!

                                  JAMAL O/S
                    I don't see what else I can do.

                                  PREM
                    Maybe it is written, my friend.
                    You're going to win this. Trust
                    me, you're going to win.

       Prem leaves. Jamal flushes and comes out of the
       cubicle. Goes to the washbasins. In the mist on the
       mirror above the taps is written the letter "B". Jamal
       stares at it. Gradually it fades, leaving only the
       growing fury on his face staring back at him.


145    INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                      145

       Jamal stalks back onto the set. Sits down in his chair.
       Stares at Prem who looks unconcernedly back.

                                  TALKBACK V/O
                    Twenty seconds.


145A   INT. CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI TERMINUS. DAY.                 145A

       The digital clocks show five fifteen. Shoving the
       descending river of people out of his way, the
       seventeen year-old Jamal is forging a path up steps
       that cross the platforms. He pushes to the middle of
       the footbridge and leans out on the side railings. He
       scans the sea of people, desperately. Then he sees her:
       the eighteen year-old Latika, heart-stoppingly
       beautiful, over the other side of the station. A world
       away. She is scanning the crowd, as wired as he is.

                                  JAMAL
                    Latika! Latika!

       But though he is screaming her name, his voice is
       swallowed by the noise around him. Then he sees two
       thuggish-looking men also fighting a way towards her.


                                                      (CONTINUED)

                    Latika!

       Frightened now, he fights his way down the steps, one
       figure against an army of white-robed people. He gets
       to the bottom of the steps, is making progress against
       the tide. But so are the two men. Jamal is now on the
       same platform. Shouts her name again. She turns with a
       smile. But the two Thugs leap through a train onto her
       platform. She sees them, starts running, is lost in the
       crowd. Jamal runs off along the platform after Latika.

                                  JAMAL (CONT'D)
                    Latika! Latika!


       By the time Jamal has fought himself to where Latika
       was- she is gone. He whirls around, mad with
       frustration.

                                  JAMAL (CONT'D)
                    Latika! Latika!

147    EXT. CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI TERMINUS. DAY.                  147

       Latika is jumping the tracks, crossing in front of
       trains. But the Thugs are gaining on her. He brings her
       down and drags her across to Javed's waiting Mercedes.
       Salim is standing by the car. Jamal pushes through the
       crowds just in time to see Salim bundling her into the
       car.

                                   JAMAL
                    Salim!

       Salim spits disgustedly on the ground. Gets in. Latika
       twists her head to see Jamal as the car skids off.
       Jamal screams with hopeless fury.

                   Welcome back to Who Wants to Be
                   A Millionaire? In the chair
                   tonight is Jamal Malik- as if we
                   don't know! In an amazing run,
                   Jamal has already five million
                   rupees but, not content with
                   that, has chosen to gamble for
                   one Crore- that's ten million
                   million rupees. What a player!
                   The question one more time:
                   Which cricketer has scored the
                   most first class centuries in
                   history. Was it A) Sachin
                   Tendulkar, B) Ricky Ponting, C)
                   Michael Slater, D) Jack Hobbs.

                                 JAMAL
                   I know it isn't Sachin
                   Tendulkar.

                                 PREM
                   That's a start. So, it could be
                   Ricky Ponting, Jack Hobbs or
                   Michael Slater.

                                 JAMAL
                   I'll use a life-line. Fifty-
                   fifty.

                                  PREM
                   Okay. Computer, take away two
                   wrong answers.

      Music swells, lights dim.

                Well, you were right about
                Sachin Tendulkar. The computer
                has taken away A) Sachin
                Tendulkar and C) Michael Slater.
                That leaves you a fifty-fifty
                choice, Jamal. B) Ricky Ponting
                or D) Jack Hobbs. What do you
                think? Decision time. For half a
                million rupees. Your answer: B)
                Ricky Ponting or D) Jack Hobbs.

      A hideous, never-ending pause while Jamal stares into
      Prem's eyes.

                                 JAMAL
                D.

      A barely perceptible jump from Prem.

                              PREM
                You sure? Not B) Ricky Ponting?
                The Australian? Great cricketer.

                                 JAMAL
                D. Jack Hobbs.

                                 PREM
                Do you know?

      Jamal shakes his head.

                              PREM (CONT'D)
                So it could be B, Ricky Ponting?

                              JAMAL
                Or D. Jack Hobbs.

                                 PREM
                Final Answer?

                              JAMAL
                Final Answer. D.

      A just-perceptible narrowing of the eyes.

                Computer-ji D lock kiya-jaye.

      Prem turns to the computer. Music. Lights.

                With one hundred and ninety-
                seven first class centuries, the

      The audience go wild. Prem's smile is thin.

      The lights dim again, the portentous music increases.
      Suddenly a klaxon sounds. The audience burst into
      nervous laughter and groans. Prem laughs.

                show. Join us tomorrow night to
                see if Jamal Malik has made the
                biggest mistake of his life or
                has just won the biggest prize
                in the history of Indian

                time. You wouldn't dare miss it.
                Goodnight!

      Applause. The studio lights come up. Prem switches off
      his smile as fast as the cameras switch off. Gets up
      and pulls out his mobile.


149   EXT. JAVED'S BUNGALOW. DAY.                              149

      Waving a kitchen knife in on hand, a desperate Jamal
      slams through the gates of Javed's bungalow, the
      objecting Doorkeeper running along behind. He bangs
      open the front door.

                              JAMAL

       Stops dead. The place has been stripped of everything.
       Not a single thing remains. Jamal runs into another
       room. As empty as the first. He stops in his tracks.

                               DOOR-KEEPER
                 Told you.

                               JAMAL
                 Where? Where is she?

                               DOOR-KEEPER
                 Dunno.

       He grabs the Door-keeper by the shirt-collar, slams him
       up against the wall. Holds the knife against his
       throat.

                               JAMAL
                 Where?

                               DOOR-KEEPER
                 I don't know! Wouldn't say,
                 would they? They had to get out
                 fast. The police. Honestly.

       Jamal lets go of the Door-keeper. Goes hopelessly to
       the window. On the window sill is a phone. He picks it
       up. There is a dial tone. Jamal rummages in his trouser
       pocket. Gets out the battered card with Salim's details
       on. Dials. Salim picks up.

                               JAMAL
                 Where are you? Where is she?


150A   INT. JAVED'S SAFE HOUSE. SALIM'S ROOM. DAY.             150A

       Salim is stalking around his room in Javed's new house.
       Hold-alls of clothes and possessions lie around the
       room. A chest of drawers sits with its drawers open,
       still empty.

                               SALIM
                 Where you'll never find her. Or
                 me. You could have joined us,

                 us. You've lost everything now.
                 Everything.

       Cuts the call off and slings the phone in a drawer.
       Takes the gun from his waist, and throws that in too.
       Slams the drawer shut with as much force as he can.

                                                          104.

                                 JAMAL
                 Salim...!

       The line goes dead. Jamal slides to the floor...


151    INT. SALIM'S APARTMENT. NIGHT.                            151

       ...the camera pulls out from Jamal's face revealing
       that Jamal is sitting on the floor of Salim's
       apartment. In the background can be heard the sound of
       the television. Jamal looks at the knife in his hand,
       wonders what he might do with it. The sound of Prem's
       voice on the tv.

                               PREM O/S
                 ...if you want a chance to play
                 Who Wants to be a Millionaire,
                 call now...!

       Jamal looks up. Stares at the tv.

                                PREM
                 This way, Jamal, this way. Great
                 show, my friend. See you
                 tomorrow, huh?

       In the half-light, Prem guides him to a stage door.


153    EXT. STUDIO. BACKSTAGE. NIGHT.                            153

       Jamal steps outside the backstage door. Leans on the
       rail and takes a huge breath. Immediately, a blanket is
       thrown over his head and two police men bundle him into
       the back of a police van. The Director joins Prem at
       the back-stage door as the van pulls away, sirens
       screaming.

                               DIRECTOR
                 What's going on?

                                 PREM
                 He's a cheat.

                               DIRECTOR
                 This was you? You called them?

       Prem shrugs.

                               DIRECTOR (CONT'D)
                 How d'you know he's cheating?

                                 PREM
                   Oh, come on! Of course he is.
                   He's a bloody village boy. Even
                   when I fed him the wrong answer
                   the little shit got it right.

      Director stares at him.

                                 DIRECTOR
                   You gave him an answer?

                                 PREM
                   Well, I didn't exactly-

      The Director walks away shaking his head. In the
      doorway, Nita is standing there, watching.

                                 PREM (CONT'D)
                   Nita?

      But she too turns and walks away.

                                 INSPECTOR
                   It is all bizarrely plausible.
                   And yet...

                                 JAMAL
                   Because I am a slum dog, chi-
                   wallah, I am a liar, right?

                                 INSPECTOR
                   Most of you are.

      Srinivas comes hurrying in carrying a file, very
      pleased with himself.

                                 CONSTABLE SRINIVAS
                   Shooting at Pila Street, October
                   19th...Maman Hossani....Victim
                   pronounced dead at scene.
                   Suspects absconded: two males,
                   early teens, one female, early
                   teen.

      The Inspector takes the file. Stares at it. Shakes his
      head.

                                 INSPECTOR
                   But you: you're not a liar,
                   Mister Malik, that is for sure.
                   You are too truthful.

      He turns to Srinivas.

                    Thank you, Constable. All that
                    remains is to work out whether
                    it was manslaughter or murder.
                    Ten years, or life.

       The Young Constable sticks his head around the door.

                                  YOUNG CONSTABLE
                    The Commissioner's here, Sir.

       The Inspector sighs. Gets up. Accompanied by Srinivas,
       he leaves the room. Jamal sits there. Lets his head
       drop. The camera floats from the room, down the dingy
       corridor and out through a window...

                    eighteen year-old boy from the
                    slums of Mumbai win one Crore
                    rupees by fair means or foul?
                    And in the crowds all around me
                    there is an even bigger
                    question. Will he be back on the
                    show tonight to play for twenty
                    million rupees...

       The Commissioner is waiting in the outer office.

                                  COMMISSIONER OF POLICE
                    So? Have you charged him yet?

       The Commissioner dumps a copy of the Times of India
       down on the desk. Then the Hindustan Times, the Amar
       Ujala and the Afternoon Dispatch thump down after them.
       All have photos of Jamal on Who Wants to be a
       Millionaire on the front page.

                                  COMMISSIONER OF POLICE
                    And if that isn't enough for
                    you...

       He motions the Inspector to come over to the window.

       Lifts the blind. The Inspector hurries over. Looks
       alarmed.

                                   INSPECTOR
                    That's-?

                                  COMMISSIONER OF POLICE
                    - yes, yes! The boy's a bloody
                    hero with every beggar and thief
                    in the city. We're in danger of
                    looking very stupid, here,
                    Inspector.

                    Whilst I'm not convinced he
                    actually cheated, I have got-

       The Inspector brandishes the file.

                                  COMMISSIONER OF POLICE
                    - Prem Kumar himself- a man of
                    great standing and integrity-
                    said the kid was a liar and a
                    cheat. What more do you need?

       The Inspector pauses.

                                   INSPECTOR
                    A liar.

       Then he puts the file behind his back. Srinivas frowns.

                    Indeed, sir.

       Srinivas coughs pointedly. Gets a steely look from the
       Inspector. The Commissioner has been staring out of the
       window at the crowds. Turns back to them.

                                  COMMISIONER OF POLICE
                    He's in for fraud, so you charge
                    him for fraud. Fast. Or you'll
                    find yourself on traffic duty at

       A cheek scarred by disfiguring knife scars. Pulling
       back we see it is Latika, staring frozen at Jamal on
       the television news. A palatial living room. Dealing
       cards to Salim, is Javed Khan. A couple of Bar Girls
       giggle next to Javed and a couple of his Thugs. Pouring
       drinks at a sideboard is Latika. Javed glances up at
       the screen, clearly not recognising Jamal on a clip
       from Who Wants to be a Millionaire. Salim, too is
       staring, wide-eyed at the tv. Javed picks up the
       remote, doesn't even notice and switches over to a
       music channel. Latika hurries out.

                               JAVED
                 What about my bloody whisky,
                 woman?

       But she has already gone. He growls after her.

                               JAVED (CONT'D)
                 Hey, Salim.

       He motions Salim to get him a drink. Javed's mobile
       rings as Salim goes over to the sideboard. Shifts a
       bottle to the back.

                               SALIM
                 We're out. I'll just get- Syed.

       Salim smiles faintly at the image of Jamal and hurries
       out.

       A drawer opens. Inside is Salim's pistol. And a phone-
       the same one he threw in there months ago. Salim stares
       at both for a long time. Finally, picks up the gun and
       phone.

                               SALIM
                      (to himself)
                 Final answer?

       He finds this faintly amusing.

      Latika sits in the kitchen, staring at the tv, tears
      running down her cheeks. A reporter is talking in front
      of an enlarged photograph of Jamal. Latika wipes away
      the tears quickly as Salim comes in. He locks the door
      behind him. Stares at the tv.

                              SALIM
                That boy. He will never give up.
                Never.

      He shakes his head.

                                 SALIM (CONT'D)
                Crazy chutiyé.

      Salim approaches Latika. She flinches as he walks
      towards her. He puts some car keys in front of her.

                                 SALIM (CONT'D)
                Ja. Go.

                                 LATIKA
                But-

                              SALIM
                - just drive. There won't be
                another chance. Go.

      Latika takes the keys. Hesitates.

                              LATIKA
                He'll kill you.

      Salim smiles, shakes his head.

                              SALIM
                It is not written.

                                 JAVED O/S
                Salim!

      Salim goes to the back door. Unlocks it. Opens it for
      her.

                              LATIKA
                Salim, I....can't.

      Salim points at the television.

                              SALIM
                You have to. It'll take you two
                hours if you drive fast. Here.

      He holds out his mobile phone.

                              SALIM (CONT'D)
                For God's sake, hold on to it.

      Latika takes it. Salim takes hold of both sides of her
      head for a moment.

                                 SALIM (CONT'D)
                   For what I have done, please
                   forgive me.

      Salim releases her.

                                 SALIM (CONT'D)
                   Go. Have a good life.

      Salim puts his hands together in blessing. She leaves.
      Salim shuts the door, locks it. Smiles.

      Jamal is dozing in the chair. He wakes with a shout.
      Srinivas has just thrown a bucket of water in his face.
      He unlocks the handcuffs. Jamal looks up at him.
      Srinivas shrugs.

      Camera positions are checked by the Floor Manager.


163   INT. POLICE OFFICE. NIGHT.                               163

      Srinivas walks Jamal through the police office, past
      the Inspector sitting at his desk, his arms behind his
      head, pondering. He watches Jamal go and then asks:

                                 INSPECTOR OF POLICE
                   What happened? To the girl?
                   Latika?

      Jamal stops.

                                 JAMAL
                   Who knows?

      Jamal walks on. The Inspector watches him all the way.

                                                          111.


164   INT. POLICE JEEP. NIGHT.                                   164

      Jamal sits in the back of the police jeep. It pulls out
      of the police station car park into a sea of people all
      cheering and shouting at the jeep. Jamal looks
      terrified.


165   INT. CAR. NIGHT.                                           165

      Latika drives through the slums of Mumbai. She hoots
      her horn furiously at a cart-driver ambling across the
      road.


166   INT. POLICE JEEP. NIGHT.                                   166

      The jeep stops at the lights and a beggar wanders up,
      tapping on the windscreen. The beggar studies Jamal's
      face for a second, then starts shouting and pointing at
      him.

                              BEGGAR
                Crorepati! Crorepati!

      Other beggars- just like the one Jamal used to be- join
      him and start cheering and applauding. The jeep pulls
      away.

      the back and runs to the tv in the café.

      The Manager walks into the aircraft hanger of a
      building. Stops. Where is everyone? Then he sees
      everyone crowded around the tv in the Recreation Room.
      Stalks over.

                              MANAGER
                Oi! Get back to work.

      Then he sees Jamal's face on the tv.

      huddled in front of it.

                   Good luck.

      Prem sneers.

                   Two minutes.

      She finishes powdering Jamal.

                                 PREM
                   Hey. Sweetheart. What about me?
                   I'm sweating, here.

                                    NITA
                   You should be.

      She dumps the powder compact in his hand.

                                 PREM

                   Not if you were the only man in

      She walks off.

                                 PREM
                        (genuinely puzzled)

      The traffic is gridlocked. Latika is pumping the horn.

                                 LATIKA
                   Come on, come on!

      She glances out of the window, sees one of the roadside
      shacks with the television on. Gets out of the car and
      runs to it.

                                                           113.

       Millionaire music starts. Sits. The phone rings.

       Prem and Jamal walk on-stage. Blinding light. They take
       their seats to tumultuous applause.

                                PREM
                 Welcome back to Who Wants to be
                 a Millionaire? I can safely say
                 that tonight is the biggest
                 night of both of our lives,
                 Ladies and Gentlemen. Jamal
                 Malik, the Call Centre worker
                 from Mumbai has already won one
                 Crore rupees, a cool ten
                 million. Tonight, he can walk
                 away with that in his pocket or
                 make the biggest gamble in
                 television history and go for
                 the final question and a
                 staggering twenty million
                 rupees! Jamal, are you ready for
                 that question?

                               JAMAL
                 Yes.

       The lights dim, the music rumbles. Prem pushes the
       button on his computer. Pauses. Gets conversational.

                               PREM
                 Big reader, are you Jamal? A
                 lover of literature?

       Nervous laughter from the audience. Jamal just shrugs.

      Even more nervous laughter.

                                 PREM
                   Lucky! In Alexandre Dumas' book,
                   The Three Musketeers, two of the
                   musketeers are called Athos and
                   Porthos. What was the name of
                   the third musketeer. Was it A)
                   Aramis, B) Cardinal Richelieu,
                   C) D'Artagnan, D) Planchet.

      An involuntary laugh comes out of Jamal's mouth.

                   million rupees: and he's
                   smiling. I guess you know the
                   answer.

                                 JAMAL
                   Would you believe it? I don't.

      Jamal laughs. There's nothing else to do. The audience
      groan.

                                 PREM
                   You don't? So, you're going to
                   take the ten million and walk?

                                 JAMAL

                   You just said you don't know the
                   answer. I heard that, right? You
                   do understand that if you get
                   the answer wrong, you lose
                   everything? Ten million rupees.
                   A fortune, Jamal.

      A terrible pause.

                 hear the question one more time?
                 And let's be clear about this.
                 Twenty million rupees ride on

                 seconds. Jamal, please read out

      The audience groan.

                   Jamal. Your answer: for twenty
                   million rupees.

      Jamal shrugs.

                                   JAMAL
                   A.

                                   PREM
                   A. Because?

                                 JAMAL
                   Just...because.

                                 JAMAL
                   Yes. Final answer. A. Aramis.

      The lights dim, the music crescendoes. A buzz runs
      around the audience. Prem pushes the button on his
      computer. Stares hard at Jamal.

                                 PREM
                   Computer-ji A lock kiya-jaye.

                   you were asked who the Third
                   Musketeer was in the novel by
                   Alexandre Dumas. You used your
                   final life-line to phone a
                   friend. You answered A.
                   Aramis.....which is...I have to
                   tell you...the correct answer!

      Wild applause. Prem jumps up and pulls a bemused Jamal
      to his feet, raising his arm in the air. Jamal is
      smiling, but disorientated.

                We have all been present at the

                Latika? Latika?

      To ever-increasing roars and applause from the
      audience, Prem escorts Jamal off-stage.


191   INT. ROADSIDE SHACK. NIGHT.                              191

      The line goes dead in Latika's hand. She stares down at
      the phone. The bemused family are still eying her like
      an alien. She smiles at them and goes out. The traffic
      on the road is still grid-locked. She starts walking,
      faster and faster. Then she breaks into a run.


192   INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. BATHROOM. NIGHT.                192

      A small tv in the bathroom. Salim smiles.

                              JAVED O/S
                Salim! Teri ma ki chute! Salim!

      Javed is banging on the door. Salim gets up from where
      he has been praying. He climbs into the bath which is
      full of bank notes and lies down amongst the money. He
      reaches across for the pistol and picks it up. Smiles
      slightly as Javed smashes down the door, pulls the
      trigger and shoots Javed. He falls onto the floor,
      dead. But the Thug right behind him shoots Salim in the
      chest. He lies back in the bath, the faintest trace of
      a smile on his face as he stares at the pictures of
      Jamal on the tv.

                               SALIM
                God is good.

      Salim dies.


193   INT. STUDIO. BACKSTAGE. NIGHT.                           193

      Prem and Jamal are being posed by photographers. A
      giant-sized cheque for twenty million rupees is
      manhandled onto the floor by the Floor Manager and an
      Assistant amidst much cheering and laughter. Jamal is
      snapped next to a scowling Prem. The Inspector appears
      next to them.

                              INSPECTOR
                Just one more thing left, Sir.
                                                       (CONTINUED)

      Prem smiles.

                                   PREM
                   Finally, huh?

                                 INSPECTOR
                   If you'd like to come with me.

      He takes Jamal by the arm, leads him backstage.



194   INT/EXT. POLICE JEEP. NIGHT.                                 194

      Jamal sits silent in the back seat next to the
      Inspector as he drives through the traffic. Then:

                                 JAMAL
                   Truth alone triumphs? I should
                   have known better.

      The Inspector stops the jeep. Unlocks the handcuffs.
      Holds the back door open for Jamal.

                                 INSPECTOR
                   Thought you might need a lift,
                   Sir.

      He nods towards the outside world. Dazed, Jamal gets
      out.


195   EXT. CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI TERMINUS. NIGHT.                    195

      Jamal finds himself    gazing up     at VT station. Slowly, he
      wanders inside. The    Inspector     takes the contents of the
      file and tears them    slowly in     half. Lets the pieces
      fall on the ground.    Gets back     in the jeep and drives
      away.


196   OMITTED                                                      196


197   INT. CHHATRAPATI SHIVAJI TERMINUS. NIGHT.                    197

      VT station is awash with the evening commute. Thousands
      of people crowd the platforms, jostling the only still
      figure who is sitting at the base of the statue of
      Frederick Stevens. Jamal. Then there is a gap in the
      wall of bodies that swirls around him. Jamal gets to
      his feet.

                                   JAMAL
                   Latika?

      Then she is gone in the melee again. Only to reappear.


                                                           (CONTINUED)

197   CONTINUED:                                            197

                                 LATIKA
                   Jamal?

      Jamal forces himself through the people. Nothing will
      stop him. Latika too is shoving them aside until they
      are face-to-face. They stop, look at each other, hold
      each other's hands tight. The whole station seems
      frozen, the only movement from a thousand bodies being
      Jamal and Latika.

                                  LATIKA (CONT'D)
                   I thought we would meet again
                   only in death.

      He shakes his head.

                                 JAMAL
                   I knew you'd be watching.

      Jamal puts his hand on Latika's chin, turns her head
      gently so that she is facing him. He sees the knife
      scars on her cheek for the first time. She tries to
      turn her head, but he won't let her. Runs his hand
      slowly down the scar. Rests his hand there.

                                 JAMAL (CONT'D)
                   This is our destiny.

      He gently kisses the scarred cheek.

                                 JAMAL (CONT'D)
                   This is our destiny.

      The camera pulls back and back, rising above the
      station. The music starts and the frozen station comes
      alive, two thousand kurta-clad men and saree-clad women
      dancing in and out and on top of the trains, an unbound
      celebration of hope and humanity that has at its
      centre, Jamal and Latika.

          INT. VAN -- NIGHT
          
          Wall-to-wall surveillance set-up. Two FBI AGENTS: DONALD
          CARRUTHERS 30's and RICHARD MESSNER 30's, man the post,
          staring at video monitors. Both hold telephoto images; shaky,
          long lens shots of a mansion some distance away. Messner
          tacks photographs to a corkboard on the van wall. One is
          labeled "Subject SIDNEY K. SERNA: UNDERBOSS/Sparazza Family."
          
          The other is labeled "Subject VICTOR "BABY BUZZ" PADICHE
          LIEUTENANT/Sparazza Family." Voices begin emitting over the
          van's speakers.
          
                                   SERNA (V.O.)
                       Buzzy...Buzz...?

                       --Okay...hang on, I gotta move--
          
          Messner rides a digital console, tweaks frequency.

          ON THE MONITORS: The image pans, follows a figure moving
          behind the mansion's windows, entering a back bedroom.
          
                                   SERNA (V.O.)
                       Alright, now Buzzy-- this is, this
                       is it, here, okay, so listen to me
                       careful and wait till I'm finished
                       'cuz we got no room for slop.
          
                                     PADICHE (V.O.)
                       I'm here.
          
          Messner adjusts the record level, V-U meters spike, modulate.
          The figure on the monitors paces the room. WE SEE it's Serna.
          
                                                   2.
          
                      SERNA (V.O.)
          Okay, he's gonna clip Israel, I just
          gotta outta there--
          
                      PADICHE (V.O.)
          --he's doing it then, huh--
          
                      SERNA (V.O.)
          --yeah, now lemme finish, I was
          eavesdroppin', so give me sec, lay
          this thing out, since the information
          might be a little loose--
          
                      PADICHE (V.O.)
          --okay, g'head--
          
                      SERNA
          So what I heard downstairs there is
          that they got a guy, some Swede,
          real badass, supposedly a "specialist"
          and they're bringing him over. Now
          he ain't coming cheap-- so, I'm
          thinkin' we jump, do this in the
          next day or so, get to Israel before
          the Swede can, we got chits, y'see?
          We're in a power position. Grab
          him, ransom him back, pick up that
          nut, we're that much closer to having
          our own thing.
          
                      PADICH (V.O.)
          --I see that, yeah, s'smart move,
          for us anyway.
          
                      SERNA (V.O.)
          Trust me, we keep our mouths shut,
          go about our thing, play the part,
          nobody suspects us.
              (feedback distorts)
          The old man's on the fade Buzzy,
          fuck him, y'know? And that hurts, I
          don't like saying that, but hey, our
          livelihood, our lifeboat, y'get?
          
                      PADICHE
          No question, no, you're right. We
          gotta do what's good for us now.
          
                      SERNA (V.O.)
          Fuckin' A, first survive, yes?
          
                      PADICHE (V.O.)
          Y'gotta, y'gotta. But d'ya think
          they'll kick ransom for that little
          prick, assuming we get to'm.
          
                                                                     3.
          
                                SERNA (V.O.)
                    Yeah, y'ain't heard the punchline,
                    yet and before I get to it, one more
                    thing I heard, little curious, should
                    probably bring it up...Primo wants
                    Israel's heart. The actual thing,
                    the organ.
          
          Pause. Feedback. The agents trade looks. Carruthers grabs
          a cellphone, dials, patches a feed for the party on the other
          end to hear.

          THE TREMOR BROTHERS pilot a Dodge Barracuda right through
          the front window with wrecking ball bravado. Bodies scatter
          as the Tremors deploy from the car in full body kevlar, doing
          doomsday on the club. One of them fires up a chainsaw,
          chewing into the panicked crowd. Bodyguards blast back, but
          bullets play like spitballs against the Tremor's body armor.

          McGarey, the union guy, hairpiece hanging by a thread,
          crawling toward his car. The piggyback Tremor brother reaches

          Torture-tools; curved cutting implements, serrated bone saws,

          FADE UP ON:
          
          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- MORNING
          
          Daybreak. Sunlight streams in, soft suffusion, the color of
          good scotch. PRIMO SPARAZZA, 86, lies on a hospital bed, an
          O2 mask shrouding deep-set, sunken eyes, cataract-grey, gazing
          out at a four-walled world. Someone enters the room, awaiting
          approval to approach...Sparazza, turning, seeing the man,
          summoning him over with a feeble finger wag. The man reaches
          him, kneeling down, ring-kissing reverent, whispering:
          
                                MAN
                    ...he's here now...
          
          Sparazza nods. The man exits. After a moment, the door opens
          again...and another MAN enters, walking slowly toward
          Sparazza's bedside. He sets down his luggage, a black leather
          valise. The travel tags originate in Stockholm:
          
          The Swede has arrived.
          
          FADE TO BLACK
          
          FADE UP ON:
          
          Soaring across the pristine deep blue waters of Lake Tahoe.
          Rising, revealing the gaudy, mirrored glass tower of the
          NOMAD HOTEL & CASINO. We slowly DISSOLVE TO:
          
                                                                     20.
          
          INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE -- NOMAD HOTEL & CASINO -- MORNING
          
          BUDDY ISRAEL, bathrobe, boxers, bags under his eyes. He
          absently shuffles cards, pulling aces as if by touch,
          telepathy. He gazes out at the snow-packed peaks. Behind
          him; post-bacchanalia...the ugly morning after. Prostitutes,
          passed out cold in a tangle of crotchless panties and stiletto
          heels, lying amongst smashed vodka bottles and ashtrays,
          coke-covered tabletops and tipped room service trays. -
          
          Israel, sober now...contemptuous of it all. He starts walking
          around them the way you would casualties on a battlefield.
          His bathrobe brushes over, terrycloth catching one of the
          hooker's wigs, tugging it free. Israel looks down, zooming
          in on her scalp, sees dandruff and scars, gags disgust and
          disdain. He steps, the wigs pulls. He stops and slips the
          bathrobe off, letting it fall rather than pull her wig the
          rest of the way off and ruin what illusion remains.
          
          He shuffles, begins dropping Aces on their bodies like dead
          enemy soldiers. One of his bodyguards enters; a bulging,
          slow-witted, ex-bodybuilder by the name of HUGO CROOP.
          
                                ISRAEL
                    D'you talk to'm?
          
                                HUGO
                        (fetching Mylanta
                         from the fridge)
                    I got his machine.
          
          A beat. Israel fidgets, twitches, rubs coke residue from his
          nose and over his gumline
          
                                ISRAEL
                    What'd you say?
          
                                HUGO
                        (gulping Mylanta)
                    I said I got his machine.
          
                                ISRAEL
                    No, what did you say on the machine?
          
                                HUGO
                    I left him a message.
          
                                 ISRAEL
                    I know you left him a message. What
                    did you say!
          
          Hugo looks up, seems confused. Moments pass. Israel, the
          patience of a gorilla, crammed into a canary cage.
          
                                  ISRAEL (CONT'D)
                    Jesus Hugo!

                                ISRAEL (CONT'D)
                    How is it that you can turn a simple
                    conversation into a fucking hedge
                    maze!? This is zero degree of
                    difficulty man!
          
                                  HUGO
                    Okay.
          
                                ISRAEL
                    Then why are you still looking at me
                    like I'm asking for the square root
                    of something! What did you say!?
          
          Hugo, still unsure, speaks in spite of it.
          
                                HUGO
                    I said that we were returning his
                    call and you were real concerned,
                    because he sounded real concerned.
          
                                ISRAEL
                    Look at that, we didn't have to fill
                    up the whole blackboard after all.
                    Now, do you know anything about that?
          
          Israel wrist-flicks a playing card, it embeds a sofa cushion
          like a ninja throwing star, right next to a beige coat.
          
                                  HUGO
                    About what?
          
                                ISRAEL
                    Look at the collar on that coat...
          
          Hugo, wary, walking over, inspecting the coat from a distance.
          
                                ISRAEL (CONT'D)
                    What's that look like, that stain?
          
          Hugo edges closer, looks down at the coat, squints.
          
                                HUGO
                    I dunno...Cinnamon roll?
          
                                 ISRAEL
                    Cinnamon roll? No, good guess though.
                    No, Hugo that looks like jizz...
                        (reshuffles, stares)
                    And I'm no forensic expert mind you,
                    but that looks like some fuckhead
                    shot their load on a twelve-thousand
                    dollar calf's skin jacket. The twist?
                    It's My twelve thousand dollar, calf's
                    skin jacket.
                        (beat, then)
                    So y'got semen, human ejaculate--

                                ISRAEL (CONT'D)
                        (checks watch)
                    --that's been allowed to soak in for
                    what, six, seven hours now? Work
                    it's way into the fabric-fuck'n
                    fibers-- and while you may never see
                    it in a Tide commercial, I think it
                    still safely qualifies as a "tough,
                    deep down stain."
          
          Hugo takes another pull off the Mylanta bottle, moving slowly,
          like most morons do, avoiding eye contact at all cost.
          
                                HUGO
                    I could have it sent out...
          
                                ISRAEL
                    ...to what? Incinerate? 'Cuz I'm
                    almost dead certain there's not a
                    fucking laundry detergent or dry
                    cleaning process known to man that
                    can ever return that jacket to its
                    former glory! Some shit, suffice it
                    to say, just don't wash out.
                        (beat, cooling down)
                    Now, the money question...To whom
                    does that stain belong?
          
          Hugo, gameface falling apart...Israel prods him.
          
                                ISRAEL (CONT'D)
                    C'mon, somebody was banging one of
                    these skanks, sans rubber--
                        (beat, assesses girls)
                    -which is terrifying in its own right-
                    pulled out, let 'er rip and ruined
                    the last gift my mother gave me before
                    she died.
                        (snatching up coat)
                    The way I see it, it's the same as
                    if she was dug up, three months dead
                    and it was shot right on her rotting
                    corpse, 'cuz that's how it defiled
                    this feels!
          
          Hugo. Long pause.   Big dumb blush.
          
                                HUGO
                    Do you want me to say I did it?
          
                                ISRAEL
                    I was kinda hoping, yeah.
          
                                HUGO
                    Do you want me to say I'm sorry?
          
                                ISRAEL
                    Only if you really, truly mean it.
          
                                                                      23.
          
          Hugo, swallowing, pressures on. The phone begins to ring.
          
                                HUGO
                    ...I'm sorry...
          
                                ISRAEL
                    Are you a fucking colossal idiot?
          
                                    HUGO
                    I am.   Yeah.
          
                                ISRAEL

                                HUGO
                    I-- uh, yeah, I guess, yeah.
          
          Cards dance, Israel's hands moves at lightspeed, he reaches
          into Hugo's shirt front and pulls a playing card out...Joker.
          
                                ISRAEL
                        (showing him the card)
                    No. Be sure. Be resolute.    You stand
                    alone on that summit.
          
          The phone rings. Hugo, wobbly, what-to-do...? Buddy fires
          all fifty-two cards into his face. The beast barely blinks.
          
                                ISRAEL (CONT'D)
                    Get the phone, it might be Gill,
                    then get out of my sight.
          
          Hugo, furtive look to the floor, all those scattered cards,
          then, back to the boss, "should I?"
          
                                ISRAEL (CONT'D)
                    No. The cards can stay there. Get
                    The Goddamn Phone.
          
                                                                CUT TO:
          
          INT. CAR -- DAY
          
          A cellphone being lifted, revealing Special Agent Carruthers.

                    Yes Sir. Go ahead.

                    We're three miles from The Nomad
                    now. We'll be awaiting word.
          
          He clicks off. Messner occupies the passenger seat, reviewing
          surveillance tape, portable headphones on, mini-DAT player
          in his lap. He listens to the following excerpt:
          
                                                                       24.
          
                                SERNA (ON TAPE)
                    --so, I'm thinkin' we jump, do this
                    in the next day or so, get to Israel
                    before the Swede can--
          
          Messner pulls the headphones off.
          
                                MESSNER
                    Anything on the Swede?
          
                                CARRUTHERS
                    Only the mention made in that phone
                    call. There's no Swedish hitman of
                    any renown, much less one with a
                    million dollar day rate.
          
                                MESSNER
                    Maybe he's that good. Never been
                    caught, no criminal record.
          
                                CARRUTHERS
                    Maybe.
          
          Messner, sets the gear on the floorboard, stretches. He
          turns over photographs of Victor Padiche and Sidney Serna.
          (the same ones that were tacked to the corkboard of the
          surveillance van in the opening)

                    I tell you, engineering this kind of
                    play against Sparazza, going to the

          CAMERA MOVES PAST, TRACKING THROUGH:
          
          INT. CHOW SHACK BUFFET -- MORNING
          
          Tahoe's "First and Finest" all seasons Buffet. THE CAMERA
          FINDS: A slicker older cat in a Guyabera shirt, mid-fifties,
          spotted skin, sun damaged, pocked with pre-cancerous black.
          We recognize him from the mugshots and surveillance video:
          It's VICTOR PADICHE. Sykes and Watters enter FRAME. Padiche
          stands, greeting them, smiling-cigarette-stained-dentures...
          
                                                                      25.
          
                                PADICHE
                    Girls, wonderful, here, sit.
          
          Watters scoots in right next to Sykes, gets comfy. Sykes
          seems a put off by the proximity, ignores it for the moment.
          
                                PADICHE (CONTD) (CONT'D)
                    Okay, so...you're here, really nice
                    isn't it? Brisk weather, but nice.
                        (as WAITRESS approaches)
                    Coffee? Anything? I didn't want to
                    order for you.
          
                                WATTERS
                    No, we're cool.
          
                                PADICHE
                    Fabulous.
                        (to Waitress)
                    I'm fine sweetheart, thanks.
                        (beat, back to girls)
                    Okay, so...welcome to the south shore!
                        (big smile, then)
                    So, just jumpin' right in, just in
                    terms of this thing, our thing. I
                    spoke to Lorenzo this morning, he
                    says y'got somethin' more or less
                    put together, plan'a attack and me
                    and my associate Mr. Serna, who I
                    can put on the phone hear, we'd
                    love t'hear it.
          
          Watters and Sykes, non-responsive, staring...
          
                                PADICHE (CONT'D)
                    We ain't askin' ya t'take us through,
                    soup t'nuts or 'nuthin' like that, I
                    jus' like t'hear the broad strokes,
                    y'know, so we can get an idea--
          
          Sykes and Watters look at one another, wordless exchange,
          then;
          
                                WATTERS
                    Pussy.
          
          Awkward beat, Padiche, head cocked, did I hear that right...?
          
                                PADICHE
                    Wha'?
          
                                SYKES
                    Pussy.
          
                                PADICHE
                        (leaning closer)
                    "Pushy?"
          
                                                                      26.
          
          Watters, shaking her head, correcting him.
          
                                   WATTERS
                    Pussy.
          
          The old man blanches, doesn't quite understand the--
          
                                   PADICHE
                    --Uh...
          
          Another beat. The girls let him dangle. Watters, lewd sneer,
          looks almost lustfully at Sykes as she says the following;
          
                                WATTERS
                    Israel likes pussy...
          
          Padiche, recovering, nodding, nervous.
          
                                PADICHE
                    ...Oh...uh-huh, yeah--
          
          Sykes squirms under Watters lascivious gaze, but manages:
          
                                SYKES
                    And we like that he likes...
          
          Yet another beat.    Padiche, wanting desperately to contribute.
          
                                   PADICHE
                    ...Pussy?
          
                                   SYKES
                    Correct.
          
          Padiche, big nod going from one girl to the other, he-get's-
          it-but-not-really.
          
                                   PADICHE
                    ...Fabulous.
          
          He extends his hand.   WE TRACK IT ACROSS IN C.U. as it meets
          with a male hand.
          
          PULL BACK TO REVEAL
          
          INT. HOTEL ROOM -- BLACKJACK INN -- MORNING
          
          Dupree and Deeks shaking hands with RUPERT "RIP" REED, mid-
          forties, showbiz-slash-mob attorney, low man on the totem at
          the Las Vegas based legal firm of "Culpepper Brody & Reed"
          
                                REED
                    Yeah, Jack, alright...hey--
                        (shakes Deeks' hand)
                    Nice t'meet you. Rip Reed.
          
                                   DEEKS
                    Pete.
          
                                                                       27.
          
                                REED
                    Okay, good, good, c'mon, c'min.
          
          Reed and Dupree shake.   Reed glances out in the hall before
          closing the door.
          
                                REED (CONTD) (CONT'D)
                        (to Dupree)
                    Where's your third? This was a
                    troika, no?
          
          Dupree, finding a seat, almost under his breath.
          
                                DUPREE
                    He's...fuckin'...he's comin'...
          
          As Elmore appears, Reed almost closes the door on him--
          
                                REED
                        (extending hand)
                    Hey, hey how r'ya, Rip Reed.
          
                                 ELMORE
                    Hollis.   Elmore.
          
          They shake. Dupree shoots a look at Elmore, not pleased.
          Elmore, pissy, leans against the wall, arms crossed.
          
          Reed, wound out, worn thin, half drunk-- his bedspread is
          papered with writs, summons, notaries, etc: Everything to
          make Buddy Israel's return to custody legally binding. He
          sits on the edge of the bed, reaching for a pack of smokes
          on the nightstand, finding a half empty glass of scotch.
          
                                REED
                        (to Deeks)
                    So Jack tells me you're both ex-cops?
          
                                DEEKS
                    Yeah, that's right.
          
                                 DUPREE
                    They worked as swingmen for the Vegas
                    Vice squad--
                        (to Deeks)
                    What? Five, six years?
          
          Reed, digging a cigarette out of his pocket.
          
                                REED
                    Man the stories you guys must tell.
                    I grew up soft myself, private
                    schools, little blazers, you "Talked
                    it out" nobody threw punches, t'this
                    day, never been hit with a fist,
                    Imagine that, huh?
                                (MORE)
          
                                                                    28.
          
                                REED (CONT'D)
                    Pretty much a panty-waste, trembling
                    little faggot-fairy when I smell
                    trouble-- and I don't say this to be
                    self-deprecating, I just don't have
                    much of an opinion about myself, I
                    mean, shit, I wish I was a lot more
                    like you guys, barfighters, big
                    swinging dicks, gettin' it done.
                    Sadly.
                        (lifts his shirt,
                         exposes torso flab)
                    This is it. It's...disgusting.
                        (with a look skyward)
                    Thanks God, dogpile a piss-poor
                    physique with an small cock and
                    hereditary alcoholism! 'preciate it!
                        (beat, to Dupree)
                    Okay, I'm babbling, I do this when I
                    drink, forgive the rants, let's get
                    at it here. This wanted felon fucking
                    prick bastard Buddy Israel and the
                    nearly one million dollar bail bond.
          
          Dupree smiles, pats Reed on the shoulder, don't-sweat-this...
          
                                DUPREE
                    Rip, my right hand to God, we're
                    gonna go in and recover this asshole
                    and everybody's gonna leave the
                    theater grinning. Trust me.
          
                                REED
                    That confidence translates bro,
                    seriously, it does! Out-STANDING!
          
          Reed, white-boy high-five, excruciatingly un-hip. Deeks and
          Elmore literally have to look away. Dupree can barely bear
          it.
          
                                REED (CONT'D)
                    I'm a lawyer, y'know, I need to hear
                    these things, little boosts, helps
                    allay my fears, I pass that piece of
                    mind along to my partners.
                        (beat, then)
                    Alright, so, couple primers for you
                    guys, maybe things we might've looked
                    past that you should know about...His
                    hangers-on, these idiots Israel
                    runs with, they're all "packing heat"
                    "strapped" whatever the phrase is.
                    Point two, Israel likes hookers, so
                    you might run into a harem up there.
                    Point three: He binges between a six-
                    to-seven thousand dollar a day cocaine
                    habit that nobody knows about, so he
                                (MORE)
          
                                                                       29.
          
                                REED (CONT'D)
                    and those hookers, will most likely
                    be high. He also drinks, self-
                    medicates, the whole cliche, y'know?
                    The strung out hasbeen jerkoff snitch
                    drunk. The seven-layer loser.
                        (beat, exhales)
                    I'm praying he puts up a fight,
                    please, please, please, rape him if
                    possible, I'll-pay-the-extra-whatever--
          
          Nobody knows what to make of Reed, as he giggles, nods,
          smokes, nods, drinks-- he looks at all of them, a sudden
          unexpected wave of enthusiasm seizing him.
          
                                REED (CONT'D)
                    Yeah-yeah-yeah. Fucking hell, this
                    feels GREAT! YEAH!? DOESN'T IT!
          
          Reed begins laughing like a complete fucking loon, like he's
          just lost it completely. It's paralyzingly uncomfortable.
          Then, just like that, he stops, grabs an envelope.
          
                                REED (CONT'D)
                        (hands envelope over)
                    Okay, we had a retainer, for services
                    to be rendered...Fifty thousand
                    dollars.
          
          Reed hands the envelope to a smiling Dupree.
          
                                ISRAEL (V.O.)
                    FIFTY-FUCKING GRAND!
          
                                                                   CUT TO:
          
          INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE -- DAY
          
          Israel, furious, screaming at an immense black man standing
          in front of him: SIR IVY, his steadfast second-in-command:
          The presence of a Pimp, the mien of a Mack.
          
                                 SIR IVY
                    Calm down.
          
          Israel gets up in Ivy's grill. A phone begins to ring.

          Hug hands the phone to Israel, pulling his own cell, dialing.
          Ivy looks around at the collapsed hookers, strewn about the
          place, his face registering the appropriate disgust. Then:

          Some of the girls start at the sound of Ivy's big Barry White
          baritone. They rise, groggy, burping up last night's
          debauchery. Mascara-smeared, hangover-hindered the girls
          rise as BERNARD "BEANIE" ALFONSE, protector #2, pops in; A

                    Alright ya'll, that's the call, we
                    had our fun, pack it in, pro-ceed to

          Beanie starts herding hookers, Ivy positions himself at the

          bringing up the rear, stumbles in her stripper heels, shaky,
          tries to take another step, slips, trips, falls-- smacks
          face first into a glass coffee table, shattering it.

          The other Hookers; gape jawed, mild shock, mild amusement.
          Beanie plucks the fallen woman up, shakes her off, straightens
          her out, pulls off the offending heels.

                    you lied to me, knowing that I'd

                    counteract some of the damage you've

                    much.
          
          Messner flips to another part of the file.
          
                                MESSNER (CONT'D)
                    Unreal, this guys jacket too. Wall-
                    to-wall major felony offenses, murder,
                    extortion, arson, grand larceny--
                        (beat, points)
                    --A paternity suit...I just feel
                    like we're playing catch-up with all
                    this and we shouldn't be.
          
                                CARRUTHERS
                    Welcome to the new Bureau. Nobody
                    shares information anymore, it's
                    become synonymous with job security.
          
                                MESSNER
                    Based on what we had, I thought
                    Sparazza was a mid-level player at
                    best and it turns out he's this mob
                    relic, running the show out west.
          
          Carruthers nods, sips his coffee.
          
                                CARRUTHERS
                    He's stayed below the radar. You
                    don't kill a hundred and thirty people
                    without knowing how to tip-toe.
          
          Messner flips the file, finds a page paper-clipped with a
          photograph of murder/martyred Federal Agent Freeman Heller.
          
                                MESSNER
                    But the Bureau knew Sparazza killed
                    Heller. Why not go after him, guns
                    blazing' for that one?
          
                                CARRUTHERS
                    Heller was buried in agency lore,
                    anytime an operative failed or was
                    perceived to have failed, Hoover
                    blackballed their memory. Look at
                    Ness.
          
                                MESSNER
                    Yeah, but the Untouchables took down
                    Capone. Heller got shot and killed.
                    The bad guys beat him. Worse, Sparazza
                    walked.
          
          Messner sits back, kills the remainder of his coffee, gazing
          out the window, watching sightseers stream by. Carruthers
          glances at his watch.
          
                                                                      36.
          
                                CARRUTHERS
                    It's almost five a.m. in D.C. now.
                    Locke said the lawyers from Justice
                    had been in there since three o'clock
                    yesterday afternoon. Israel's manager
                    is acting as his attorney and that's
                    what's holding things up.
          
          The waitress arrives with breakfast, sets it down.
          
                                MESSNER
                    So he has no idea what's about to
                    happen?
          
                                CARRUTHERS
                    No. And I want to be in that room a
                    half second after Mecklen calls to
                    say the deal's done. We've got a
                    sheriff's task force on stand-by.
          
                                MESSNER
                    What about the hotel staff obstructing
                    us. Israel's obviously paid off the
                    management.
          
                                CARRUTHERS
                    Tampering with a witness extraction
                    of this magnitude makes everyone
                    indictable at the federal level.
                        (beat, grins)
                    Trust me, we won't any problems with
                    the hotel staff. You show 'em your
                    ID with the letters "F.B.I." in all
                    caps and it's instant compliance.
                    I've seen in happen a hundred times.
          
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          F.B.I. BADGE AND IDENTIFICATION
          
          It fills the the frame. An O.S. voice explains:
          
                                VOICE (O.S.)

          INT. NOMAD HOTEL AND CASINO -- LOBBY/RECEPTION -- DAY
          
          PULL BACK TO REVEAL: Gerald Diego...aka Pasquale Acosta, aka
          "El Estrago" the most notorious torture-murder specialist in
          the biz in convincing disguise. His suit, mannerisms and
          speech. Pitch Perfect...he's got the fake-Fed bit down cold.
          
                                ACOSTA

                                ACOSTA (CONT'D)
                    Commission. I'd like to speak with
                    your head of security.
          
          A pimply CASINO EMPLOYEE nods, dashing off to find the boss.
          Acosta glances around, takes in the eight-dollar-an-hour
          security, the array of quasi-armed guards...and smiles.
          
                                DEEKS (V.O.)
                    Where'd you get these?
          
                                                                CUT TO:
          
          Guard uniforms, exactly like those we've just seen, worn by
          the Nomad's security staff. Maroon with burnished gold
          buttons and brown piping down the slacks. Three separate
          vestments laid out across the trunk of a rental car.
          
          CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL:
          
          EXT. PARKING LOT -- OFF THE LAKE -- DAY
          
          Dupree and Deeks in an empty parking lot, bundled up in
          windbreakers, battling the frozen spindrift swirling in off
          the lake.
          
                                DUPREE
                    Same place that rents the guard's
                    uniforms. There's a shift change at
                    9am. Graveyard goes home and we can
                    blend in with the day shift coming
                    on.
          
                                DEEKS
                    What about access cards? Pass keys?
          
                                DUPREE
                    We'll have to get our hands on them.
                    There's two separate units; Casino
                    Floor/Count Room Security and General
                    Hotel Security--
                        (annoyed, nods to car)
                    Does he want to hear this or what?
          
          Deeks bangs on the hood of the car.
          
                                DEEKS
                    Hollis!
          
          Elmore steps out, moving slowly to the rear of the car.
          
                                DUPREE
                    Nobody put a gun to your head.
          
          Elmore leans against the bumper, bored.
          
                                ELMORE
                    Yeah, we've been through that.
          
                                                                    38.
          
                                DUPREE
                    Then quit acting like somebody shit
                    in your cereal bowl. Reed just gave
                    us fifty grand.
          
                                ELMORE
                    --Jack, what am I doing? I'm standing
                    here, aren't I?
                        (beat, to both men)
                    Shouldn't that be enough? That I
                    made the trip?
          
                                DUPREE
                    Your attitude sucks.
          
                                ELMORE
                    I been accused of worse.
                        (glancing at uniforms)
                    What do we got...?
          
          Dupree, dubious, does he continue...?   Fine. Fuck it.
          
                                DUPREE
                    Two security levels, the one we're
                    going in under the guise of, hotel
                    security, has restricted access.
                    They're mostly there to monitor the
                    lobby, handle disturbances on the
                    different floors and toss out drunks.
                        (beat)
                    There's a thirty-five member employee
                    rotation going from graveyard to day
                    shift. If we split up, we can blend
                    in and enter unnoticed. Once we're
                    inside the hotel, we'll regroup.
          
                                  ELMORE
                    Then what--
          
          --A Plymouth Barracuda passes by, brakes hard, reverses.
          The trio stop talking, look over...and then their lives end.
          Bad intentions blaze from the driver's side, machine-gun
          bursts-- Dupree is hit flush, dead on his feet, his dying
          thought, cut comically short; "I had that car in high scho--
          
          Deeks, shredded where he stands, his body absorbing a
          fusillade of rounds traveling at twice the speed of sound.
          One creases Elmore's skull, another blows out Deeks' back,
          fragmenting, claiming three fingers from Elmore's left hand.
          The three of them fall in weird, waterlogged flops, no dying
          breaths, no death rattles, just lights out...just like that.
          
          Several seconds pass. Then the car door opens and The Tremor
          Brothers, like circus clowns, clamber out in a cloud of gun
          and reefer smoke. LESTER TREMOR, the dandruff-caked,
          pockmarked middle brother is the first out. He shakes off
          the cold, yawning, stretching, revealing all manner of tattoo.
          
                                                                    39.
          
          The Tremors' youngest brother, the Baby-Huey sized JEEVES
          TREMOR bumbles out, pulling at his crotch. He unzips & rips,
          baptizing the Cuda's tire with a truly prodigious piss.
          DARWIN TREMOR climbs from the car, the eldest brother, straw
          boss, brains of the outfit. He looks down at the dead men,
          seems saddened by their state. Some remorse maybe? Maybe so.
          
                                JEEVES TREMOR
                        (still pissing)
                    Luvin' that, rat-tat-tat-tat, clean
                    as a nun's snatch on Kristal Nacht!
          
                                LESTER TREMOR
                        (stops singing)
                    Shut up fuckass, them spirits ain't
                    vacated yet, s'keep quiet.
          
                                JEEVES TREMOR
                    Them spirts can kiss my Chinese ass.
          
                                LESTER TREMOR
                    ...YOU AIN'T NO CHINESE!
          
          This exchange prompts Jeeves to turn and urinate on Lester.
          Lester squeals war cry, launching a wild windmill barrage on
          his behemoth little brother. Jeeves ignores the hydrant-
          like urine stream soaking them both and starts swinging back.
          
          Darwin kneels down over the dead Jack Dupree, taking Jack's
          face in his hand and squeezing back and forth, adding his
          own words in what amounts to a freakish ventriloquist act.
          
                                DUPREE (DEAD)
                    ...I forgive you Darwin.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    Shoot, I appreciate that man.
          
                                 DUPREE
                    If I needed your I.D. and your car
                    and me and my brothers were wanted
                    by the law, I woulda killed you to
                    get 'em too.
          
                                  DARWIN TREMOR
                    You woulda?
          
                                DUPREE
                    Oh hell yeah. We's just in the wrong
                    place at the wrong time. So don't
                    feel so bad dude.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    Damn...alright then.
          
                                DUPREE
                    I don't mind now anyway.
                                (MORE)
          
                                                                      40.
          
                                DUPREE (CONT'D)
                    You know, up here in Heaven, it's
                    beautiful. Way better than fuckin'
                    Hawaii or any place like that.
          
          Darwin's eyes begin to well, the tears coming slowly. In the
          background, Lester and Jeeves beat e ach other ruthlessly.
          
                                   DARWIN TREMOR
                    Really?
          
                                DUPREE
                    I'm glad I'm here. I love it. I'm
                    gonna get laid by some fine ass angels
                    and then go hang out with Jesus and
                    them.
          
          Darwin wipes his eyes.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    Man, that's great.
          
                                 DUPREE
                    I got it made in the shade Amigo.
                    Hey, I'll see you up here some day,
                    don't worry.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    You think so?
          
          Darwin uses his thumb and forefinger to make it appear as
          though Dupree we're smiling up at him.
          
                                   DUPREE
                    I know so.
          
          Darwin smiles back down   at the corpse, wiping his nose on
          his sleeve. He reaches    down and pulls out Dupree's wallet.
          He spots the bondsman's   license, eyeballs the bail papers:
          He sees the name ROBERT   ISRAEL in bold type. Puts it together.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    Damn Jack...you was after the same
                    sacka shit as us...Small world.
          
          Darwin continues the pat down, pauses, pulls the envelope
          with fifty grand inside, fingers fresh bills. With his free
          hand he manipulates Dupree's dead mouth one last time.
          
                                DUPREE
                    Don't tell your asshole brothers you
                    know about it, that money is for you
                    old boy.
          
          Darwin, a nod of acknowledgement for the dead Dupree.
          
                                                                      41.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    I appreciate that pard...I wish I
                    coulda been a better friend.
          
          Darwin stands, His eyes move to the guard's uniforms, still
          laid out across the trunk...he looks over at his two brothers,
          Jeeves now with a Lenny-like hammerlock on Lester's head.

                    Alright enough grabassin' goddamit!
                    We need t'get over t'that hotel.
          
                                WATTERS (V.O.)
                    We're already here baby.
          
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          INT. NOMAD HOTEL AND CASINO -- LOBBY -- MORNING
          
          Watters is once again on her cellphone to Lorenzo.
          
                                WYMAN (O.S.)
                        (on the phone)
                    So everything's cool then?
          
                                WATTERS
                    We sat down with Padiche, he tried
                    to get some details which we wasn't
                    gonna give up, but it's all good.
                    We goin' check Sis in first, 'fore I
                    check in across the street.
          
          Sykes arrives at the reception counter when the elevators
          open-- and Israel's Hookers, post-brawl bruised, bloodied
          and barefoot, come staggering out.
          
          They slur insults at the security team, broken heels slung
          over their shoulders, wigs misaligned, miniskirts mangled.
          Sykes trades looks with Watters as if assessing something,
          nodding almost imperceptibly to one another. Watters then
          winks, something sexual there...it gives Sykes the shivers.
          
          The Hookers are surrounded by a horde of hotel staff and
          summarily whisked away. Watters joins Sykes. The WOMAN
          behind the counter checking Sykes in, looks up to see Watters.
          
                                 WOMAN
                    Will you be needing a room with two
                    double beds?
          
                                SYKES
                        (quickly)
                    No, we're not together.
          
          Watters, a grin.
          
                                WATTERS
                    C'mon baby, don't be shy.
                                (MORE)
          
                                                                       42.
          
                                WATTERS (CONT'D)
                        (to woman)
                    Just one bed please.
                        (beat, to Sykes smiling)
                    Although if we sweat that one up, we
                    goin' need some clean sheets.
                        (As Sykes pulls away)
                    C'mon Girl, you know I'm playing!
          
          Sykes looks uneasily at the counter woman, who keeps her
          eyes locked on the computer in front of her.
          
                                WATTERS (CONT'D)
                        (over her shoulder to
                         the departing hookers)
                    ..If ya'll let hoochie like that
                    stay up in here, ya'll must be burning
                    sheets by the ton.
          
          The woman just smiles that monstrously insincere "I'm here
          to help!" smile, offering nothing in response.
          
                                WATTERS (CONT'D)
                    You just goin' grin? Y'ain't goin
                    comment on that, at all? Trampy ass
                    skeezers, doin' damage they ain't
                    even smart enough to see. That don't
                    gall you at all?
                        (beat, closer)
                    Bitches like those are the same ones
                    runnin' feminism right to the brink
                    girl. Bitches like that the reason
                    mafuckas don't take our species
                    seriously. We jus' meat for male
                    consumption, we jus' pieces a'ass
                    and pussy, somethin' pretty in
                    lipstick and eye liner can suck cock.
          
          Sykes, embarrassed, nudging Watters, knock-it-off...
          
                                WATTERS (CONTD) (CONT'D)
                    Bitches like that make me weep for
                    what could be-- if we could all,
                    sisters everywhere, black, white,
                    yellow and brown, put our shit down
                    one time, unified front, the force
                    of the female race, mobilized, moving
                    as one...
          
          The woman, smile severely strained, the pro-feminist diatribe
          falling on decidedly deaf ears. An awkward beat, then;
          
                                SYKES
                    I'm gonna need a mini-bar key too.
          
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
                                                                       43.
          
          A mini-bar being opened. A hand reaching in, extracting two
          small bottles of Jack Daniels whiskey and a bottle of seltzer.
          
          INT. NOMAD HOTEL ROOM -- LOWER FLOOR
          
          The figure crosses the room, pouring the seltzer onto a towel.
          He kneels down, dabbing a spot on the carpet, fresh spill,
          deep red, indelible.. The seltzer doesn't bring it up. The
          stain remains, smeared now but unmistakable...blood.
          
          The figure stands. In the bathroom behind him, we see a body,
          male, late-50's, trussed up, hung by his feet over the tub
          and bled out. The figure walks in, takes a Polaroid, turns
          it upside down near the man's face and fires off a photo.
          
          He crosses back into the bedroom. The resulting photo is
          tucked into the corner of a dresser mirror as it develops.
          As the figure sits, WE PAN OVER TO REVEAL:
          
          LAZLO SOOT: world class assassin slash master of disguise.
          The slowly developing polaroid depicts the same face that we
          now see in the mirror. Soot touches up the putty and plastic
          appliances on his face, smoothing, sealing...
          
          He takes up a small micro-cassette recorder, rewinds, pushes
          play. A butler's uniform, steamed and pressed, hangs on the
          door. He takes it down and begins changing into it.
          
                                   LAZLO SOOT (ON RECORDER)
                    --Keep calm.
          
          He glances over at the bed. The dead man's voice crackles
          back over the recorder.
          
                                DEAD MAN (ON RECORDER)
                    I am an employee, I-- I don't know
                    wh-- they don't let me speak to h--
          
                                LAZLO SOOT (ON RECORDER)
                    --Say your name. Then say "How can I
                    be of assistance."
          
          Soot, back to the mirror, buttoning his collar, straightening
          his cuffs, smoothing out the creases.
          
                                DEAD MAN (ON RECORDER)
                    I don't understand.
          
                                 LAZLO SOOT (ON RECORDER)
                    I didn't ask for your understanding.
                    I asked you to say your name, followed
                    by the phrase "How can I be of
                    assistance."
          
          Beat. Soot looks down at the Silencer-fitted 9mm pistol lying
          on the vanity.
          
                                                                         44.
          
                                   LAZLO SOOT (ON RECORDER)   (CONT'D)
                    Last chance.
          
          A pause, then:
          
                                DEAD MAN (ON RECORDER)
                    My name is Vitoli. How can I be of
                    assistance.
          
                                   LAZLO SOOT (ON RECORDER)
                    Thank you.
          
          A muffled gunshot sounds. The recorder abruptly shuts off.
          Soot, gazing at his reflection now, rewinds the recorder,
          replays, listens, gauging the man's vocal patterns-- rough
          Baltic accent, throaty warble, excessive smoke & booze
          exposure, tracheal damage. Tough to match. He rehearses one.
          
                                SOOT
                    My name is Vitoli. How can I be of
                    assistance.
          
          He grimaces, grabs cigarettes off the bureau, lights, wails
          smokestack, puffing three at once, bellows-like lungfuls--
          He grabs an aerosol can from the same bureau, strafes the
          back of his throat, pops the tops on the bottles of Jack,
          kills them both, gags, sputters, recovers, adjusts himself.
          Suddenly, the phone begins to ring. Soot stops, stares.
          
          After another ring, he lifts the receiver,
          
                                SOOT (CONT'D)
                        (into phone, cautious)
                    This is Vitoli. How can I be of
                    assistance.
          
          Hugo Croop's voice booms from the earpiece.
          
                                HUGO
                    Answer your fucking pages! I've

          INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE -- NOMAD HOTEL & CASINO -- MORNING
          
          Israel, sequestered to his bedroom, lying on a baby-grand
          piano, its legs inexplicably sawed off during the previous
          night's hedonism. In his hands, the de riguer deck of cards,
          restlessly shuffled and reshuffled...Cocaine has been lovingly
          cut and arranged in neat, snortable rows atop the piano.
          
          In the b.g. we see HUGO on the phone to Vitoli/Soot.
          
                                                                    45.

                    I dunno what to say to you sweetheart,
                    it is what it is.
          
                                ISRAEL
                    Bullshit it is. I said, about as
                    loud as I could say it, "no jail
                    time for my guys."
          
                                                                CUT TO:
          
          INT. FOUR SEASONS HOTEL -- WASHINGTON D.C. -- DAY
          
          Morris Mecklen, sleepless, sweat rings blossoming armpit to
          waist. He picks at the plate of room service food in front
          of him. A group of Feds and Fed lawyers linger in the b.g.
          
                                MECKLEN
                    And they're not going give there
                    pally. They're bricking us on that
                    particular issue.
          
          Mecklen glances back over his shoulder, lowering his voice.
          
                                MECKLEN (CONTD) (CONT'D)
                    Baby, I've been co-habitating with
                    these people for the past thirty odd
                    hours and in so doing, have stared
                    into the face of hell. These are the
                    premier prick cocksuckers of all

          Buddy's rubs his chest-- grimacing-- he lays back on the
          piano, hoists a vial of blow, presses a nostril, does a bump.

          of the air with his right. He turns it over, looks...Joker.

          INT. NOMAD HOTEL AND CASINO -- SECURITY ROOM -- DAY
          
          S.A. Gerald Diego, alias Pasquale Acosta, speaking   with "Bill"
          SECURITY SUPERVISOR for the Nomad. Banks of video    monitors
          surround them, displaying the various gaming areas   and VIP
          floors...two of the screens are completely blacked   out.
          
                                ACOSTA
                        (to Bill)
                    Can I speak to you privately?
          
          The Supervisor nods, dismisses his staff, calls after one.
          
                                SECURITY SUPERVISOR
                    Gary, let's get our personnel up in
                    the catwalk over twelve, that stickman
                    has been acting odd and I don't like
                    the rolls that table has been getting.
          
                                  EMPLOYEE
                    Got it.
          
          Acosta waits for the door to close, leaving only himself and
          the supervisor in the room.
          
                                                                    48.
          
                                ACOSTA
                    It's gotta be tough keeping an eye
                    on everything.
          
                                SECURITY SUPERVISOR
                    And everybody, all the time. Yeah,
                    it's a chore.
          
          Acosta laughs, keeps it loose.
          
                                ACOSTA
                    So, Bill, if I understand this right,
                    you currently have your penthouse
                    floor under construction?
          
                                SECURITY SUPERVISOR
                    That's correct.
          
                                ACOSTA
                        (points to monitors)
                    But with these down, doesn't that
                    pose a major security concern if, as
                    you say, you have to keep an eye on
                    everything at all times?
          
                                SECURITY SUPERVISOR
                    Well, we were worried about dust and
                    debris from the work being done
                    ruining the cameras, so--
          
                                ACOSTA
                    --so you shut them off?
          
          The Supervisor, quick to amend.
          
                                SECURITY SUPERVISOR
                    Yes, but no-- we have personnel
                    stationed at both ends of that hall,
                    twenty-four hours a day.
          
                                ACOSTA
                    What kind of personnel?

                                SECURITY SUPERVISOR (V.O.)
                    Right now? A six man security force,
                    plus a member of our Butler staff.

                    You have a butler working that floor?

          Vitoli, aka Lazlo Soot, stepping onto a lower-floor elevator,
          pushing a service cart tucking the 9mm into his waistband.
          
          CUT BACK TO SCENE:
          
          The Supervisor sputters-- stammers, realizes he just slipped.
          
                                SECURITY SUPERVISOR
                    Uh-- well, yes, uh just in terms of
                    the men up there now, my team, he's
                    serving lunch and dinner and just
                    doing general upkeep so--
          
                                ACOSTA
                    So there are no guests staying on
                    that floor?
          
          The Supervisor makes a big show of the headshake "no...."
          
                                SECURITY SUPERVISOR
                    No. None at present.
          
          Acosta grins, takes a step closer.
          
                                ACOSTA
                    C'mon Bill...you've got some Sultan
                    up there, one of your whales, big-
                    spender, likes a lot of space, you
                    cook up this "construction" thing...?
          
                                SECURITY SUPERVISOR
                    No, no, no. We've been looking to
                    renovate that area of our hotel for
                    some time now. The security team is
                    only present to preserve floor
                    integrity, due to the roof access.
          
                                ACOSTA
                    Is your security team armed?
          
                                 SECURITY SUPERVISOR
                    Of course.   Yes.
          
                                ACOSTA
                    And who has access to that floor?
          
          The Supervisor...something like suspicion in his eyes. The
          secure "hotline" begins to ring. The Supervisor looks over
          at the phone, then back at Acosta...the unflappable pro.
          
                                                                       50.
          
                                ACOSTA (CONTD) (CONT'D)
                    Bill, listen, I can ask you now and
                    you can answer me, or I can drag you
                    up to San Francisco and depose you
                    in front of a federal judge. Because
                    that's where we're headed here.
          
          Bullshit, but it sounds good.   The Supervisor starts for the
          ringing hotline.
          
                                SECURITY SUPERVISOR
                    I'm sorry, but I'm going to need to
                    see your identification again. We're
                    covering some sensitive material
                    here and I need to safeguard myself,
                    I'm sure you can understand.
          
          Acosta, reaching into his coat.
          
                                ACOSTA
                    Of course, but if you could just
                    tell me who has access to that floor--
          
          The Supervisor touches a pass key that he wears on a chain
          around his neck as he moves to answer the phone.
          
                                SECURITY SUPERVISOR
                    --I hold the sole pass key and
                    personally relieve the shifts myself.
                    Now if I could get your ID we can--
          
          --Acosta, coming out of his coat, fake ID in hand, the
          supervisor reaching for it and the ringing phone
          simultaneously-- suddenly a six-inch, spring-loaded stiletto
          blade explodes from Acosta's sleeve, piercing the ID-- pinning
          it to the Supervisor's chest.
          
          A surprised grunt from the man as blood begins to pour from
          his punctured sternum. The blade retracts. The phone sits
          trembling in the Supervisor's hand, --a voice-- Carruther's,
          tinny and barely audible, warbles from the other end-
          
                                VOICE
                        (over phone)
                    Hello? This is Special Agent Donald
                    Carruthers of the FBI, I need an--
          
          Acosta takes the phone from the stunned Supervisor, replacing
          it on the console. The Supervisor, still confused by the
          exchange, wanting to speak, but unsure of what to say...He
          gazes down to the red blossom fanning across his shirt front.
          
                                SECURITY SUPERVISOR
                    Is...that...blood?
          
          Acosta pockets his ID as he yanks the pass key off the
          Supervisor's neck. His natural accent returns.
          
                                                                     51.
          
                                ACOSTA
                    Yes it is and right now it's filling
                    your lungs. In less than a minute,
                    you'll asphyxiate and pass out. You
                    shouldn't be feeling any pain now.
          
          The Supervisor's knees begin to buckle, nervous system slowly
          shutting down. Acosta steadies him, easing him to the floor.
          
                                  ACOSTA (CONT'D)
                    Close your   eyes. Think of something
                    wonderful.    Don't make this face the
                    last thing   you ever see.
                        (beat,   in Spanish)
                    Heaven may   hold it against you.
          
          The Supervisor, unblinking, an almost childlike clarity there.
          
                                SECURITY SUPERVISOR
                    ...Am I really dying...?
          
          Acosta, deadpan.
          
                                ACOSTA
                    Bill--

                        (pause)
                    We're all dying...
          
          Bill the supervisor almost smiles as he breathes his last
          breath...Acosta checks for a pulse, then drags his body toward
          a service closet. As he passes one of the video monitors...
          
          ...WE SEE ON-SCREEN: The Employee entrance, grave and swing
          shifts on their way out, day shift on it's way in. Mixed in
          with this personnel rotation, each doing his inconspicuous
          best...The Brothers Tremor.
          
                                                                CUT TO:
          
          INT. EMPLOYEE ENTRANCE -- DAY
          
          Darwin, Lester and Jeeves, clad in full security attire,
          standing apart so as not to appear together, heads down,
          hands shoved into their pockets.
          
          Darwin bird-dogs both his brothers, monitoring their movement,
          using hand signals and some bizarre inbred semaphore to
          communicate with them. They pass through and punch in,
          signing time sheets. The surrounding security staff oblivious
          to the new faces. The brothers enter the lower floors, moving
          through the hotel's fitness center and indoor pool.
          
          A kid does a cannonball as they pass as we...

          A clouded bog-- coming to-- consciousness, then, retching,
          gagged gasps, throat ablaze with bile, liquid clearing
          convulsed lungs, breath in burning spasms-- not enough air.
          
          EXT. LAKE --DAY
          
          Elmore sits up in the sub-zero shallows of Lake Tahoe with a
          start, stripped naked, shaking uncontrollably, his skin a
          deep bruised blue. Dull pain quickly defines-- pinpoints,
          bores in, bone deep...Death can't hurt this much.
          
          He gets his breathing under control, the onset of hypothermia
          turning his fingertips black-- his left hand, lighter three
          digits-- he looks, comprehension sparks but can't catch-- he
          stares impassively at the ragged space, for the moment, he
          doesn't seem to mind their absence. He gropes the side of
          his head, bullet-graze, blood congealed by the cold, the
          concussion he suffered has left a massive migraine behind.
          
          He crawls from the water, muscles cramping, knotting up. He
          reaches the sand, unable to pull himself up any further. He
          turns back, sees the bodies of Deeks and Dupree, face down,
          the lazy lake tide gently lifting and lowering them...
          
                                MESSNER (V.O.)
                    Double homicide, gunshot vics, both
                    of 'em dumped in the lake. That's
                    where the Sheriff's task force is.
          
                                                                CUT TO:
          
          INT. CAR -- DAY
          
          Carruthers and Messner, hectic, speeding through the south
          shore of Lake Tahoe, cellphones pinned to their ears.
          
                                MESSNER
                        (back into his phone)
                    Deputy, have you made any ID's?
          
                                CARRUTHERS
                        (cups phone, to Messner)
                    Get a coroner's estimate too.
                        (back into his cell)
                    --Miss, I've been transferred and I
                    was disconnected. No one is answering
                    and I need someone from security to
                    pick up that line. It's urgent.
          
          Messner, nodding as he listens.
          
                                MESSNER
                    Dep-- Deputy, I'm going to put you
                    on speaker, I have Agent Carruthers
                    in the car with me.
                        (beat to Carruthers)
                    You need to hear this.
          
                                                                    53.
          
          Messner clicks over, the deputies voice fills the car.
          
                                SHERIFF DEPUTY
                    --nd have a pending ID on a Jack
                    Dupree, appears to be a bondsman out
                    of Las Vegas. He was just rolled
                    and printed by our medical examiner.
          
          Messner and Carruthers trade looks.
          
                                CARRUTHERS
                    Was there anything recovered?
          
                                SHERIFF DEPUTY (O.S.)
                    We found a handwritten receipt in
                    his pocket for what looks like uniform
                    rentals. The name and phone number
                    of the rental house wasn't listed,
          
                                MESSNER
                    What kind of uniforms?
          
                                SHERIFF DEPUTY (O.S.)
                    Receipt wasn't specific, the uniforms
                    were just listed as maroon in color.
          
          Carruthers mashes the floorboard, brakes smoke, power swerve,
          slicing the rented Taurus across four lanes of traffic.
          
                                MESSNER
                    Alright, deputy, we'll be there as
                    soon as possible, until we arrive, I
                    need you to limit physical access
                    and restrict movement to and from
                    the crime scene. Clear?
          
          Messner clicks off.
          
                                CARRUTHERS
                    Maroon uniforms?
          
                                MESSNER
                    Yeah. Have you been able to get
                    through to the Nomad's security?
          
                                CARRUTHERS
                    No.
                        (beat, decision)
                    I'm going over there. You take the
                    car from there, get out to the lake.
          
          Carruthers pushes 110mph, barreling toward the Nomad, blowing
          through traffic-- Both men pull out IFB/earpiece apparatus,
          plugging in, checking their signals.
          
                                MESSNER
                    You going up to the Penthouse alone?
          
                                                                    54.
          
          Carruthers pulls a .45 from his holster, driving with his
          knees now, he jacks the slide, checks for a chambered round.
          
                                 CARRUTHERS
                    Yeah.
          
          The slide releases--
          
                                SYKES (V.O.)
                    That's a bad move.
          
                                                                CUT TO:
          
          INT. NOMAD HOTEL SUITE -- DAY
          
          Sykes, stowing a Glock 9mm, tweaking the earpiece/mic combo
          she's wearing-- getting primped, leather mini-skirt, lace
          garters, thigh-high platform boots; hooker de coutage.
          
                                 WATTERS (O.S.)
                    Why?
          
                                SYKES
                    'Cuz we don't need to draw any more
                    shit down on our heads. We hit

                    don't want to dead the whole floor
                    and I don't want to be killing women

                    Wait, I'm getting some fucked up
                    feedback off that earpiece--
          
          Sykes pulls her earpiece, adjusts something, re-inserts it.
          
                                 SYKES
                    Better?

          The Hotel just across the street from the Nomad. Watters on
          a headset, talking to Sykes, looking out the window.
          
                                 WATTERS
                    Much.
          
          On a room service tray near Watters; scanners monitor calls
          and in-house transmissions within The Nomad.
          
                                SYKES
                    What are you hearin' right now?
          
          Watters adjusts one of the scanners, searching for a signal.
          
                                                                       55.

                    Nuthin', we cool. There was somethin'
                    about a fed being in the building.

                                WATTERS
                    It's just a little casino inspection,
                    don't trip, he's alone.
                        (beat, then)
                    Alright, let's set this spinnin'...
          
          Sykes checks her reflection, makes sure her holsters aren't
          peeking out, weapons adequately conformed to her curves.
          
                                SYKES
                    When them tricks hit the lobby, holla
                    at me and I'm gonna meet them on the
                    way up, blend in. Once I get inside,
                    I'mma put m'Nina to Israel's head
                    and back out hot. Anybody's fucks

          A .50 Caliber sniper-rifle on a tri-pod, jutting just past

                    Damn, this kevlar ridin' up on me, I
                    wish they made this more sheer.
          
          Watters puts her eye to the scope, scans, finds SYKES in
          the crosshairs across the way, adjusting her outfit. Watters
          settles on her, watches...something vaguely creepy about
          this bit of voyeurism. She nuzzles the Barrett close.
          
                                WATTERS
                    Mmmm. I tell you, I snuggle up with
                    big girl here and my pussy start
                    t'drip.
          
          Sykes grimaces.    Watters sees it, smiles to herself.
          
                                WATTERS (CONT'D)
                    ...So you heard from Keith? He still
                    fuckin' with that 'lil light-skinned
                    girl?

                                SYKES
                    You know I burned all his shit. All
                    that vinyl. Chalamar, Funkadelic,
                    I burned his turntables too. They
                    was like three-thousand brand new.
          
                                WATTERS

                    s'all the love we're ever goin' need.
          
          Sykes says nothing for a moment, Watters just watches her
          through the crosshairs, her finger idly flicking the trigger
          in a strangely perverse gesture. Finally:
          
                                SYKES
                    Girl, lemme ask you somethin' and I

                    Fuck you.
          
          Watters spots something outside, grabs a pair of binoculars,
          looks down...BINOCULARS P.O.V.: Four obvious CALL GIRLS
          disembarking a taxi, mylar-colored micro-minis, fuck-me heels,
          cheap shoulder bags. They smoke, laugh, chit-chat.

                    Alright girl, the ho train has
                    arrived. Four of 'em.
          
          Sykes, grabbing her bag, dropping spare clips inside and
          starting for the door.
          
                                SYKES
                    ...I'm on my way out, I'm just gonna
                    hang in the hallway until they start
                    up in the elevators.
          
          Watters loads a red-tipped round into the breach of the Fifty.
          
                                WATTERS
                    Just get in there and do your thing

          SNAP ZOOM ON BULLET as she slams the action forward, loading
          the round WE SMASH CUT TO BLACK.

          FADE UP ON:
          
          A reel-to-reel machine activates, begins to record-- A sticker

          Vitoli, aka Lazlo Soot: arriving at the Penthouse level,
          exchanging nods with the security team, pushing his service
          cart out of the elevator and down the hall, through a metal
          detector, which goes off. Vitoli/Soot shrugs, gestures to
          his stainless steel cart. The security team wave him through.
          
                                SERNA (V.O.)
                    So how we lookin'?

          Pasquale Acosta: Now wearing the nametag of "Bill" the
          recently deceased Security Supervisor. He buttons his red
          blazer, hanging the penthouse pass key around his neck as he
          moves through the lobby, carrying a small briefcase.
          
                                SERNA (V.O.)
                    That's what we're countin' on. What'd
                    they say when you went for specifics?
          
          The Tremor Brothers: Duffel bags straining with the horrible,
          shit inside. They move toward a service elevator, swapping
          pill bottles, downing overdose amounts, repeating "Mein Kampf"
          recitations as they push the elevator's call button.

          Hollis Elmore: Frantically ringing the alley delivery doorbell
          of a local Souvenir Shop-- naked, frozen, delirious, near-
          death, he has dragged himself there.
          
                                SERNA (V.O.)

          Agent Messner: Watching as the bodies of Dupree and Deeks
          are hauled from the lake by Sheriff's personnel. He walks
          the shoreline, searching for clues, on his cellphone, trying
          to reach Security at the Nomad.

          Agent Carruthers: Plugging in his headset as he reaches the
          front of the Nomad, leaping out, rushing inside, holstering
          his gun for the moment.
          
                                PADICHE (V.O.)

          Georgia Sykes; Pulling a small revolver from her garter-
          holster, annoyed, rubbing the chaffed area, reaching the
          elevator, leaning back against the wall, waiting.
          
                                SERNA (V.O.)
                    Basically-- it'd really be the best

          Sharice Watters; Her eye going to the rifle-scope...she makes
          subtle adjustments to the targeting-ring-- P.O.V. -- Israel's

          beyond the glass...a shimmering shape, moving within.

                    Why you standing there fool? You
                    make your money watching the hall.
                    Get y'eyes back where they belong!
          
          Mustache nods. Beanie slams the door on him. Soot, inside
          now, scanning, making split- second evaluations-- what's-
          where, who's-where, he picks up voices from the master bedroom--
          
                                                                CUT TO:
          
          INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE -- MASTER BEDROOM -- DAY
          
          Clothing everywhere. Israel's top dollar wardrobe, designer
          suits, wadded up into balls and stuffed into a garment bag.
          He's doing more cocaine, talking to himself, babbling the
          classic addict's "don't-worry-it'll-to-be-alright" monologue.
          
                                ISRAEL
                        (calling)
                    IVY! Why isn't Hugo at the airport!?
                    It's a fifteen minute trip!
          
          Ivy, his menace gone malignant, quietly stepping out of the
          shadows...Israel has no idea that he's been there all along.
          
                                ISRAEL (CONT'D)
                        (turning back to Ivy)
                    Well what the fuck!? I got the Doc
                    in town, I need him here! Call Hugo,
                    find out where the car is!
          
          Ivy doesn't budge, just stands there, staring hard.
          
                                IVY
                    So what'd Mecklen have to say?
          
          Israel stiffens, board-straight, the guilt goosing him. Ivy
          turns the burners slow.
          
                                ISRAEL
                    They're getting close. It's down to
                    a handful of deal points now.
          
                                IVY
                    But it's all good right?
          
          Israel almost chokes on his own smile, nodding.
          
                                SIR IVY
                    So we're all traveling together,
                    getting sworn, giving our statements--
          
          Israel starts zipping up some of his bags.
          
                                                                       63.
          
                                ISRAEL
                    --I dunno the way it's gonna play
                    out, but-- yeah, it'll probably go
                    something like that.
          
          Ivy unbuttons his coat. A .50 Cal rides in his shoulder-rig.
          Israel averts his eyes. Ivy lets the moment load up...then;
          
                                SIR IVY
                    You believe in loyalty, don'tcha?
                        (pause, then)
                    'Specially the kind of loyalty where
                    an otherwise sensible motherfucker
                    puts his own best interests aside to
                    selflessly serve another. 'Cuz outside
                    a goddamn dog, that kinda loyalty,
                    my kinda shit, don't get any more
                    dedicated, or deep, or devout...
          
          Israel, unnerved now-- spots a small handgun sticking out of
          his bag. He covers it with the bedspread, looking up at Ivy.
          
                                ISRAEL
                    ...what are you tryin' to say?

          INT. NOMAD HOTEL AND CASINO -- LOBBY -- SAME
          
          Carruthers, bracing the same Casino Employee Acosta braced
          earlier. College kid, patch-acne, panic-stricken, stammering,
          struggling, a phone stuck to his hand--
          
                                CASINO EMPLOYEE
                    --I don't-- it's just-- I can't reach

                    --I know that. Which floor are they
                    on?
          
          The kid's skittish gaze shifts, locking on a figure moving
          through the lobby.
          
                                CASINO EMPLOYEE

          Carruthers breaks off, moving for the man in the maroon jacket
          heading toward the elevator. He reaches him, puts a hand on
          his shoulder.
          
                                                                    64.
          
                                CARRUTHERS
                    Excuse me, sir.
          
          The man turns...His nametag reads "Bill."
          
                                   BILL/ACOSTA
                    Yes.
          
          Carruthers badges him.

                    here in your hotel.
          
          Acosta has fully assumed the identity of the murdered security
          supervisor. The pimply kid at counter eyeballs him, confused.
          Acosta steps behind Carruthers, blocking himself from view.
          
                                BILL/ACOSTA
                    How can I help you?
          
          Carruthers leads him toward an awaiting elevator.
          
                                CARRUTHERS
                    I need to get to your penthouse level
                    immediately, I also need every other
                    elevator with access to that floor
                    evacuated and locked down.
          
          They step into the lift.
          
                                BILL/ACOSTA
                    Is this an emergency?
          
                                CARRUTHERS
                    Let's hope not.
          
          The elevator doors close behind them as we...
          
                                                                CUT TO:
          
          Elevator doors open to reveal: The Tremor Brothers, vibrating
          at varying speeds, pharmaceutical stares, simultaneously
          sharp and dull. Georgia Sykes stares back, bad vibes trickle
          up her back. She holds a moment. Doesn't board.
          
                                SYKES
                    I'm going down.
          
          Darwin looks her over, lecherous grin.

          He mimics a blowjob, treating her like the hooker he thinks
          she is. Sykes wants to shoot him in the face. Lester and
          Jeeves oogle her as the doors begin to close.
          
                                                                       65.
          
          Darwin smiles wide and lewd. Sykes kisses her middle finger.
          
                                SYKES
                    ...Faggot-ass redneck...
          
          Darwin's smile turns scowl as the elevator doors slide shut.
          
                                WATTERS
                    What'd you say?
          
                                SYKES
                    Not you. Some assholes on the
                    elevator...are these bitches on a
                    permanent smoke break or what? Why
                    the fuck they call'm "working girls."
          
          Watters grabs her binoculars; sees the four prostitutes snub
          cigarette butts and start to head inside.
          
                                WATTERS
                    Alright, the ho train is exiting the
                    station. They're coming to you...
          
          Sykes waits a beat, then reaches for the call button to signal
          another car. WE FOLLOW HER FINGER to the "up" button and--
          
                                                                CUT TO:
          
          A blackened fingertip, trembling, barely enough force behind
          it to hold a delivery bell button down.

          The parking lot teems with local news trucks. Passerby's
          crowd the police line. Messner is on his cellphone, incensed,
          confused. A Sheriff's DEPUTY flanks him.
          
                                                                   66.

                    No, no clarify. What is "an emergency

                    going to have anywhere from forty to
                    fifty odd field agents arriving,
                    without the slightest inkling as to
                    why they're here. Is that correct?
                    Am I misinterpreting that or--

                    No, I'm not blaming any one person,
                    this is Bureau directive. But Agent
                    Carruthers is the SAC and he's out
                    of cell range at the moment, so I
                    can't contact him to--
                        (listens, frustrated)
                    Very well. I need to get Deputy

          One of the Crime Scene Recovery TEAM MEMBERS approaches,
          hands Messner a printout. A faxed, blown up rendering of a
          Nevada Driver's license...We recognize the face.

                                CS TEAM MEMBER
                    Hollis Elmore, resident of Las Vegas,
                    formerly with the P.D. there. He's a
                    known associate of Dupree's.
          
          The CS Team Member holds an evidence bag aloft.

                    We found these washed up on shore.
          
          Messner takes the bag, gawks, can't quite make out the
          contents.

                                CS TEAM MEMBER
                    Elmore's fingers. Whorls are in bad
                    shape from the frostbite, but we got
                    a good pull for latents, positive

                        (beat, nod to bag)
                    Those were shot off.

                    Dupree's rental. A Dodge Stratus--
                    Picked up yesterday at a commuter
                    airport in Reno, Nevada.

                        (suddenly panicked)
                    --Where's it at now?
          
                                TASK FORCE CHIEF
                    In the parking structure of the Nomad.

          INT. PARKING STRUCTURE -- NOMAD HOTEL -- SAME
          
          A crime scene unit already has the area cordoned off. Police
          photographers circle the rental car snapping pictures as
          uniformed units scribble license plate and VIN numbers.
          
          CAMERA PANS OVER TO REVEAL:
          
          A limo arrives, the Swede disembarks, black valise in tow.
          A group of Sparazza henchmen surround him, spiriting him
          toward a nearby stairwell, anxious to avoid the police.
          
          CAM CONTINUES PAN TO REVEAL:
          
          Doc Gill and Hugo, sitting in their car, a little leery at
          the heavy police presence. Hugo takes up his cellphone.
          
                                HUGO
                    Doc, I'm gonna tell 'em we're on our
                    way up, make sure it's cool up there.
                    Is there anything you need?
          
          Gill shakes his head "no" as Hugo dials. Gill retrieves his
          own phone as he climbs out, dialing, moving to the trunk.
          
                                DR. GILL
                        (into his phone, quiet)
                    I'm going up now, give me ten minutes,
                    that should be enough time to prep...
          
          He clicks off, Hugo is completely unaware of the call he
          just made. Gill pops the trunk, removing his medical bag
          
                                                                    68.

                        (still on his phone)
                    C'mon, somebody answer...
          
          INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE -- SAME
          
          The phone rings, Beanie moves to answer it, tossing his balled
          up Versace shirt to Soot/Vitoli.
          
                                BEANIE
                        (looking back)
                    That's a silk blend B, six-hundred
                    and change an s'got vomit and bile
                    and stomach contents all over it-- I
                    ain't gonna tell'ya how t'get the
                    mafucka clean, jus' put it right.
          
          Soot nods, unfurls a laundry tote, sticks the shirt inside,
          hand moving within the bag--
          
                                BEANIE (CONT'D)
                        (pointing to Israel's
                         soiled jacket)
                    Check the man's calf-skin coat too,
                    he look like he got some cinnamon
                    roll an' shit all over it--
          
          --Beanie, turning, reaching down for the ringing phone when--
          THWAP-- something plunks him hard from behind-- he's knocked
          forward by the force of the impact-- startled-- instinctively
          slapping at that area-- thinking something stung him.
          
                                BEANIE (CONT'D)
                    What the fuck!?
          
          He looks around, alarmed, head on a swivel, hand probing the
          pain, not aware of the blood coursing from that spot,
          streaming down his back...The phone continues to ring.
          
          Then Beanie hears the small metallic warble of something
          rolling around on the floor behind him, gradually settling.
          A sensation overtakes him...and he grows very still with it.
          
          He looks down at his hand for the first time...sees blood
          there, reaches up with that same hand and finds the tattered
          hole right above the base of his spine-- small wisps of smoke
          drifting up out of the wound...He turns, numb...and sees
          what looks like a spent shell casing, just ejected, coming
          to rest on the tile...The phone continues to ring.
          
          His eyes track upward to Vitoli the Butler, holding a silenced
          9mm-- aim still held...And that's when it dawns on Beanie...
          ...He's just been shot in the head.
          
                                BEANIE (CONT'D)
                        (almost to himself)
                    Aw hell no you ain't just do that...
          
                                                                    69.
          
          Three more soundless shots from the 9mm put a humane end to
          these proceedings-- blowing Beanie's body over a sofa chair.
          His three-hundred plus pound frame slides to an unceremonious
          halt in the remnants of the shattered coffee table.
          
          Israel's calf-skin coat lies near Beanies dead body, a pool
          of blood surrounding it, soaking through and all the while...
          The phone continues to ring.

          Ivy and Israel, oblivious to what's gone on, fifty feet away.
          
                                SIR IVY
                    What did you say to Mecklen?
          
          Israel looks from the ringing phone-- to the gun in his bag--
          no good-- Ivy will kill him before he clears the bedspread.
          
                                ISRAEL
                    That's probably him now...

                    ...See, this is one'a them rare
                    moments when y'ass get a chance to
                    be completely honest...and if I'm
                    asking you what you said to Mecklen,
                    assume the shit is rhetorical...so
                    assume I already know.
          
          Ivy lets that .50 caliber hang like intimidation itself.
          Israel looks over at the ringing phone, then back at Ivy.
          He slowly withdraws the deck of cards from his robe pocket,
          begins shuffling at lightspeed, firing them across his body,
          left to right, right to left.

                    close my eyes.
          
          He does, snatching a card cold from the deck, turning it to
          Ivy.

                                LOCKE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    When he was caught by the SAS in

          belt-- his walkie-talkie was working all along. Jig's up.
          
          Acosta spins back-- spring-loaded blade firing from his sleeve--
          Carruthers clears his holster-- Acosta closes the gap-- blade
          flashing, passing through Carruthers' hand, slashing tendons,
          shearing bone, hot butter.--
          
          Carruthers screams-- grip gone, gun tumbling-- instinct kicks--
          his good left hand hauls the .45 out of mid-air, clutches,
          squeezes-- BLAM! Acosta's abdomen eats the blast, burps
          blood-- Carruthers, a severed hand tucked under his chin,
          held in place-- he extends, pulls, fires again-- Ricochets
          clip overhead fluorescents, fixtures catch strays-- shatter--
          glass filament explodes-- razor slivers rain down.
          
          Acosta, struck, slumping-- a silver automatic appearing from
          his other sleeve, trigger finding finger just as the last of

          breathing and fluid hitting the floor-- Everything goes stiff--
          
          --the two take silent aim in the pitch black and fire
          simultaneously, blazing away-- emptying their weapons into

          Georgia Sykes, concerned, finger to her ear, picking up
          something off her IFB earpiece: Muted gunshots, static-
          scrambled ...it's the sound of Carruthers and Acosta, ending
          one another's lives in the lift below...

                                WATTERS
                    Are you anywhere near the penthouse?

                                SYKES
                    No, but that definitely sounds like
                    shots and I don't where it's comin'
                    from--

                    --It's your IFB, somebody else has
                    got an earpiece, you're picking up
                    their signal--
          
                                SYKES
                    --I thought we had secure frequency.
                    Aww girl, tell me this mafucka ain't
                    goin' off right now.
          
          Watters hears something crackle over one of the scanners...
          a transmission to Nomad security staff...
          
                                WATTERS

          Sykes looks up to see the elevator has reached her floor.
          
                                SYKES
                    What's wrong?
          
                                WATTERS
                    Security's locking down the elevators.

          INT. ELEVATOR CAR -- SAME
          
          The Tremor Brothers, waiting arrival on the penthouse, armed
          to the teeth, each one tethered with an array of pistols,
          rifles, knives, hatchets, hacksaws; the tools of their trade;
          to be implemented in the most godless manner imaginable.
          
          Muzak drifts in over the speakers, when suddenly the car
          lurches, cables catch, brake boxes shriek and the elevator
          car comes to abrupt stop. The Brothers exchange looks as
          power is cut and they are plunged into darkness...An emergency
          recording sounds from the elevator's ceiling speaker.
          
                                WOMAN'S VOICE
                    Please remain calm...Elevator service
                    has been temporarily suspended and
                    will resume momentarily...
          
          The recording defaults into a maddening loop...then, the
          sounds of someone unzipping a bag in the dark, hands moving
          objects around, metal clanks off metal as the bag is rummaged.
          A brilliant flash, hot white to iridescent red as a road
          flare is struck, showering Darwin Tremor with a deluge of
          sparks as he holds it aloft.
          
                                                                    74.

                    Les' get at it then.
          
          Lester and Jeeves, effortless aplomb; the speed and dexterity
          of a seasoned pit-crew. Lester pulls a torque wrench from
          the bag, pops the panel bolts on the elevator's power box
          and strips the electrical wiring in seconds--
          
          Jeeves removes a gas-powered generator from their Mary Poppins-
          like carry-all carpet bag. He primes the pump, yanks it to
          a sputtering start and feeds the AC lead to his brother.
          Lester takes it, locates the service override conduit and
          ties in. Darwin admires this deft display of skill from his
          idiot brethren. As the elevator's power cycles back on we...

          Light switch flipped on, revealing the shrunken, shriveled,
          fetal-like form that is Hollis Elmore being carried by MARGIE
          TURLOCK, 63, part-time RN, full-time souvenir shop owner. A
          substantial, tank of a woman, Margie manhandles Elmore,
          dropping him into a lukewarm bath, brimming with grey water.
          
                                 MARGIE
                    Okay sweetie, now I'm a registered
                    nurse and this was my bath not a
                    half hour ago, so it ain't as hot as
                    it could be, but we're gonna get you
                    all toasty warm in no time--
                        (beat, to boy)
                    Warren, Warren-- go on an' get grandma
                    her hot blanket and her heating bag,
                    the one in there under the sink in
                    my bathroom.
          
          Warren sniffs, licks lovingly on an ice cream sandwich, but
          never bites it.
          
                                   WARREN
                    Slower Nana.     Talk slooooooeerrrrr.

                    in--

          smeared with chocolate, bracketed by chrome-colored braces.
          
                                MARGIE (CONTD) (CONT'D)

                    Now Boogie, Grandma needs her big
                    helper boy now, go on an' get those

                    My karate feet? My crazy Karate
                    kick feet!!
          
          Warren puts the ice cream sandwich in his mouth and begins
          hopping up and down, kicking, striking the wall with great,
          disturbing ferocity. Margie cackles at this.
          
                                MARGIE
                    You little angel-butt! Grandma'll
                    rub those feet forever!
          
          Elmore, struggling against imminent death, watching this
          display with increasing dread. He scans the sink basin--
          sees it lined with anti-depressants; Ritalin, Thorazine, etc
          Warren keeps throwing hard roundhouse kicks into the wall.
          
                                MARGIE (CONT'D)
                    Oh you silly-sil! Never mind,
                    Grandma'll get it!
          
          Margie marches off and Warren immediately rushes over to
          the tub, placing himself directly over the inert Elmore and
          assuming a martial arts stance. He opens his mouth to speak
          and the ice cream sandwich tumbles out, landing in the tub.
          
                                WARREN
                        (barking out)
                    Bow to your opponent!
          
          Warren bows before he squares up and begins methodically
          delivering a "Kata" of punches and kicks...violently and
          expertly snapped within millimeters of Elmore's face. Elmore,
          helpless to raise his arms or defend himself, stares in horror
          as the boy, his glasses beginning to fog and drip with
          perspiration, works himself into a furious lather.
          
                                ELMORE
                        (trying to speak)
                    Pl-- kid, st-- stop...
          
          Elmore holds up his stump   of a hand,   pinky wagging in pathetic
          plea-- no use-- Warren is   in a state   of unhinged, near-animal
          frenzy-- his eyes wild, a   small, yet   prominent erection
          beginning to poke through   his karate   gee...
          
          Margie returns to the bathroom, scolds her grandson.    He
          squares up on her, feigning a blow to her face. She     clouts
          him, hard backhand, big flabby arms restraining him,    hauling
          him out of the bathroom. He bleats like a butchered     sheep.
          
                                                                      76.
          
          Elmore, left alone, stark naked, shaking-- he turns his head,
          gazing into the other room-- a newscast plays on the
          television: A Reporter, lakeside, via live feed...standing
          in the same parking lot where Deeks and Dupree were killed.

                    All that slight a'hand you can do
                    and you still ain't never learned to
                    lie right--
          
          --Israel steps hard, slinging the Ace sidearm, sailing it
          toward Ivy, surgical strike, right eye, blood bursting at
          his browline-- Ivy goes down in a heap.
          
                                SIR IVY (CONT'D)
                        (enraged)
                    MOTHERFUCK! MOTHERFUCKER!
          
          Ivy, doubled over-- he drags the .50 cal from its holster
          and lets fly-- FIRING. Big bore rounds rip right through
          the wall, punching dinner-plate sized holes in the plaster.
          Israel goes to the ground as Ivy, bleeding, blazes away--
          
          INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE -- ANTEROOM -- SAME
          
          --Soot takes cover as bullets whistle by-- he tucks the 9mm
          away just as the doors to the suite are blitzed and the
          security team stumbles in, guns drawn, grouped tight--
          
                                SECURITY TEAM
                        (in unison)
                    DOWN! DOWN! DOWN!
          
          They assume quasi-combat stances; six idiots, crab-crawling
          their way across the room. Soot stays prone, plays scared,
          realizes that his rubber appliance nose has come loose, tries
          to adjust it-- can't, has to hide his face, burying it in
          his sleeve, wiping more make-up off in the process--
          
          Mustache is on point, pistol trained.    He spots Soot cowering.
          
                                 MUSTACHE
                        (to Soot)
                    Are you hit?
          
          Soot shakes his head a vigorous "no" as Mustache and his men
          turn their attention to the bedroom.
          
                                 MUSTACHE (CONT'D)
                        (calling out)
                    Mr. Israel!?
          
                                ISRAEL
                    IN HERE!
          
                                                                       79.
          
                                MUSTACHE
                    Are you hurt sir!?
          
                                ISRAEL
                    Ivy's trying to kill me!
          
                                SIR IVY
                    FUCK YOU!
          
                                ISRAEL
                    GET IN HERE GODDAMMIT!
          
          Mustache and his men round the corner into the master bedroom.
          
          INT. MASTER BEDROOM -- SAME
          
          Ivy, down on one knee, depth perception shot, trying to
          reload, bullets slipping through blood-slicked fingers--
          Israel lies on the floor behind the bed, breathless, chest
          heaving, frantically trying to pull the small automatic pistol
          out of his overnight bag.
          
                                MUSTACHE
                        (advancing on Ivy)
                    Drop-that-gun-right-now!
          
          One of the bodyguards spots the body of Beanie, lying dead
          in the remnants of the coffee table.
          
                                SECURITY MEMBER #1
                    Jesus, he got Beanie...
                        (back to Mustache)
                    He shot Beanie!
          
                                ISRAEL
                    What?
          
          Ivy hears this, let's the gun slide from his hand, standing,
          eye swollen to a bleeding slit.
          
                                MUSTACHE
                    GET ON THE GROUND!
          
          Ivy, looking past them, seeing Beanie's lifeless body, laying
          there. Israel peers out, sees the same thing.
          
                                ISRAEL
                    Jesus Christ...
          
          Two of the bodyguards rush to Beanie, bending over his body,
          checking for vitals. Ivy, suspended in the doorway, stunned.
          One of the security team looks back; no good...he's gone.
          Just then, the phone stops ringing.
          
                                ISRAEL (CONT'D)
                        (looking up at Ivy)
                    ...you just murdered Beanie...
          
                                                                    80.
          
          Ivy, shocked, dismayed. Israel, starting to see his sweetheart
          deal with the Feds go up in smoke. He immediately mobilizes.
          
                                      ISRAEL (CONT'D)
                              (to Mustache)
                       Hey!
                           (pointing to Ivy)
                       Get him out-- muscle him if you have
                       to. Take him down the quietly, use
                       the service exit. Then get back up
                       here and we'll handle the rest of
                       this.
                           (off Mustache's look)
                       What? Is there somebody else in
                       there?
          
          Soot, from the other room, careful to keep his face concealed.
          
                                      VITOLI
                       Eees Vitoli.
          
          Israel, a grimace...two too many people involved. Israel
          nods, thinking, does a bump of coke, right out in the open.
          
                                   ISRAEL
                           (to security)
                       Avert your eyes gents, y'didn't see
                       that.
                           (beat, rolls neck)
                       Okay Vitoli, listen these last few
                       minutes make you a material witness,
                       do you understand what that means?
          
                                   VITOLI
                       ...How can I be of assistance...
          
                                   ISRAEL
                       You do know what that means!
                       Tremendous, that's the attitude.
                           (beat, clutching chest)
                       Alright, Vitoli, hang tight for half
                       a tic, we've got a special sort of
                       "clean-up" we gotta do here, alright?
          
          Soot nods.
          
                                   ISRAEL (CONT'D)
                           (to Mustache)
                       What's he doing, is he getting this?
          
          Mustache, glancing over at Soot, seeing him nod.
          
                                   MUSTACHE
                       Yeah, he's nodding.
          
                                   ISRAEL
                       Good. Now Move.
          
                                                                       81.
          
          Mustache and his men brace Ivy, taking advantage of his
          disorientation and dismay and swiftly escorting him out.
          
          EXT. PENTHOUSE HALLWAY -- SAME
          
          They amass around the elevator, taking care to double handcuff
          Ivy now. Mustache pushes the call button. It fails to light.
          
                                                                  CUT TO:
          
          INT. ELEVATOR CAR -- SAME
          
          Choked with generator and road flare smoke, lit like hell
          itself. The Tremors stand at arms, shrouded in a miasmic
          mung of horribly toxic fumes, filling their lungs with it.
          
          CUT BACK TO:
          
          INT. HALLWAY -- SAME
          
          Mustache hits the call button again, still nothing.   Yet
          one of the lifts appears to be ascending
          
                                SECURITY TEAM
                    Wait...one of 'em looks like it's on
                    its way up...
          
                                MUSTACHE
                    What about the other four?   Are they
                    out?
          
          He keeps hitting the call button, but it won't light.
          
                                MUSTACHE (CONTD) (CONT'D)
                    The hell is going on...

          Sykes, trying to pry the elevator doors open.
          
                                SYKES
                    It ain't dead! Quit saying that

          Watters pours herself a glass of Chablis from the mini-bar.

                                WATTERS
                    Girl, I just saw muzzle flashes comin'
                    out that suite. S'probably where
                    you heard that shootin' earlier,
                    somebody jus' downed Israel. He
                    dead, our play is dead.
          
          Sykes, getting some separation on the elevator doors, pulling
          her 9mm, using it like a crowbar.
          
                                SYKES
                    I'm not givin' it up jus' yet...
          
                                WATTERS
                    C'mon, I say we bounce now, kick it
                    for a lil' bit, play some craps.
                        (beat, probing)
                    ...Maybe spend the night?
          
          Sykes, struggling, when the doors suddenly retract on their
          own...She's staggered by what she sees in the elevator,
          tripping back, heels catching, dumping her on her ass--
          
                                SYKES
                        (just above whisper)
                    ...oh...damn...
          
          She sits up, stupefied...cordite and pistol smoke drift out
          of the open elevator doors like a funeral dirge. The sound
          of a bone-saw emanates from within.
          
          INT. ELEVATOR CAR
          
          Carruthers and Acosta...wartorn, shot to hell, post-battle
          standoff, just staring, weapons emptied, bodies bullet-
          punctured, leaking life...both are breathing, but just barely.
          
                                WATTERS (OVER HEADSET)
                    What is it...?
          
          Filament and glass dust cover everything. Blood streams in
          steaming fissures, floating spent shell casings and
          fluorescent shards cover the floor of the car.
          
          Acosta, clinging to life itself, clutching the whirring bone
          saw, trying in vain to reach Carruthers. Sykes wades forward,
          wary, Glock vise-gripped.
          
                                SYKES

                    They musta been beefin' big time
                    with one another, cuz this shit, got

                    ...What are they doin' right now...?
          
          Sykes, glancing from Carruthers to Acosta. A beat.
          
                                 SYKES
                    Right now?

          Elmore, seated, wrapped in quilts and heated blankets,
          shivering horribly, lips blackened, flexing brittle fingers
          on his good hand, trying to restore feeling, teeth clattering
          like ten thousand tea cups. Margie Turlock enters, arms
          loaded down, grandson Warren hot on her heels, a set of
          Nunchukas under his arm...
          
          ...Elmore, palpable hatred, pure bile for the boy.
          
          Margie sets the assortment of goods down on the table in
          front of Elmore; tourist-themed hats & sweatsuits from the
          shop, a pair of thermals, a collection of pill bottles and
          what appears to be an old Vietnam-era ammo box.
          
                                MARGIE
                    So them fellas were your friends
                    then? The ones that was shot and
                    tossed into the lake? Were they police
                    officers too?
          
          Elmore nods, rifling the pile in front of him, going for the
          pills. Margie pulls a pot of coffee off the stove, pours a
          mug. Sets it down in front of him.
          
                                MARGIE (CONT'D)

                    hysterectomy, so they're a few years
                    old, might be outta date.
          
          Elmore eyes the labels; Vicodin, Vioxx...morphine-based.
          Nice...Just numb it all.
          
                                MARGIE (CONT'D)
                    You sure you don't want me to call
                    an ambulance honey?

                                MARGIE (CONT'D)
                    I think it's crazy you not going
                    in...y'got what looks like hypothermia
                    and real bad frostbite. They could
                    wind up amputatin' if y'don't get it
                    treated.
          
          Warren sits in the chair next to Elmore and begins mimicking
          him, shaking epileptically, doing his doofus bit, tucking
          three fingers away, waving a stump, belly-laughing...
          
                                MARGIE (CONT'D)
                    Warren! Now you go and practice
                    your nunchucks now, leave us be for
                    a bit Shug.
          
          Warren scowls, getting up, in super-slow motion, making sounds
          with his mouth as he stands, robotic whirs, buzzes, clicks--
          Margie chuckles at her grandson, she can't help it--
          
          Then, in a blur, Warren snaps, abruptly slamming the nunchakas
          on the table, the rebounding portion of the weapon almost
          hitting Elmore in the face. He bolts the room before Grandma
          can scold him, his titters echoing off like taunts...
          
                                MARGIE (CONT'D)
                    ...M'sorry about that boy, his momma
                    abandoned him going on a year now,
                    his daddy, my boy Dale-- Gulf War
                    vet, s'over in the Reno-Washoe
                    Correctional facility-- got some
                    "clarity" issues. He did some home
                    invasion sodomy-torture type stuff,
                    wrote a buncha bad checks, got hisself
                    consecutive life terms-- shipped off
                    to Soledad there in California.
                        (beat, scribbles
                         something down)
                    --reminds me, I got that care package
                    I need to send off--
                        (beat, continues lament)
                    Anyhoo, m'husband Bill took the
                    coward's route, n'committed suicide
                    by hangin' 'bout nine months back.
                    Ever since then, little Boogie there's
                    been the man'a the house!
                        (beat, gnarled grin)
                    And we make a darn cute couple I
                    think!
          
          Margie, cackling again-- the facade of sanity showing serious
          signs of strain...Elmore pulls the ammo box across the table.
          Stenciled on the side: "177th Airborne Division -- Charlie
          Company - Reckon" He cracks the lid.
          
                                MARGIE (CONT'D)
                    I don't think that's been opened
                    since my husband died.
          
                                                                    85.
          
          Inside, army memorabilia and bric-a-brac; patches, service-
          tags, dog-earred b&w polaroids, ancient titty mags, (which
          make Margie horribly uncomfortable) Saigon bottled beer and
          most importantly, a .357 Colt Python.
          
          Elmore lifts it, looks it over, feels the heft, drops the
          chamber-- it's loaded. He sifts some more, palms loose bullets
          at the bottom of the box. He cracks a blackened grin, rolling
          the pistol's chamber and snapping it shut as we...
          
                                                                CUT TO:
          
          A padlock being locked and secured.
          
          CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL:
          
          INT. NOMAD HOTEL -- LOBBY
          
          Elevators and access doors locked down indefinitely. Casino
          and hotel patrons file out in less than orderly fashion.
          Craps players, pissed that their "hot streaks" have been cut
          short, harangue police and sheriff's personnel in passing.
          Barflys and blackjack habituates, accustomed to staying in
          one spot for months on end, have to be manually removed.
          
          The four call girls, trying to argue their way past security
          and onto one of the elevators, realizing they're not getting
          anywhere near the Penthouse level. Messner coordinates the
          Nomad's exodus, continually adjusting his earpiece, trying
          to contact Carruthers, two agents flank him.
          
                                 MESSNER
                         (to agent)
                    I want you to locate Agent Carruthers
                    now.
                         (beat, to another
                          agent)
                    The guests that aren't able to leave
                    need to be confined to their suites.
                    And under no circumstances are they
                    to venture out, for any reason. Have
                    the staff make calls to that effect.
          
          The pimply Casino Employee is at the center of an intensive
          on-spot interrogation being conducted by a group of agents.
          Messner arrives, stares at the kid.
          
                                MESSNER (CONT'D)
                    This him?
          
                                FBI AGENT
                        (nodding, then to kid)
                    Alright Ricky, I want you to explain
                    to Agent Messner exactly what
                    happened and do it slowly please.
          
          The kid, head bobbing, gnawing fingernails, cuticles mangled.
          
                                                                      86.
          
                                CASINO EMPLOYEE
                    Yeah, ye-- I-- uh, there were,
                    earlier, there was that guy Carrut--
          
                                MESSNER
                    --Agent Carruthers. Do you know where
                    is he now?
          
                                CASINO EMPLOYEE
                    He uh-- he asked about-- I'm-- he
                    wanted to know whic-- what floor
                    security was on, then I saw him get
                    on the elevator with the other agent.
          
                                MESSNER
                        (quick, thrown)
                    Wait a minute, what other agent?
                        (beat, to others)
                    What other agent?
          
                                FBI AGENT
                    I have no idea. It wasn't anybody
                    from our office.
          
                                CASINO EMPLOYEE
                    He said he was from San Francisco.
          
                                MESSNER
                    Did he give you his name?
          
                                CASINO EMPLOYEE
                    Yeah, uh-- it was Spanish-somethin'
                    Garcia, or Diego, uh--
          
                                MESSNER
                        (to other agents)
                    --run both those names through the
                    D.C. database. Call San Francisco,

                    field doing collateral inquiries for--
          
                                CASINO EMPLOYEE
                    --he was wearing one of our jackets.
          
          Messner stops cold.
          
                                MESSNER
                    Who?
          
                                CASINO EMPLOYEE
                    The other agent. He said he was here
                    to do an inspection and later, when
                    he got on the elevator with the other
                    guy, Carruthers, I saw him wearing
                    one of our security jackets...
          
          Messner turns, bores in on the kid, no more bullshit now.
          
                                                                     87.
          
                                MESSNER
                    This man wearing the jacket identified
                    himself as an Federal agent?
          
                                   CASINO EMPLOYEE
                    Uh, yeah.
          
                                   MESSNER
                    You're sure?
          
                                CASINO EMPLOYEE
                    Yeah, he had the badge and everything.
                    It said "FBI" on it.
          
                                MESSNER
                    And when you saw him later, he was
                    wearing one of your security jackets--
          
                                   CASINO EMPLOYEE
                    Yeah.
          
                                MESSNER
                    And that didn't seem odd to you?
          
          The kid glances around, oops-- my mistake-- tries to amend.
          
                                CASINO EMPLOYEE
                    I-- I mean, I thought they gave it
                    to him so he cou--
          
          Messner turns on his heels, the other agents tag along.

                        (addressing others)
                    We may have a man posing as one of
                    us. Get a tactical team assembled.
                    We need to get to the penthouse level
                    immediately.
          
                                FBI AGENT
                    We'll have to power the elevators
                    back up.
          
                                   MESSNER
                    Do it.
          
          As they move past the group of call girls, still arguing
          with security as we...

          Israel, sickly, face bloodless, sitting down on a couch,
          setting the small handgun down on the table next to him. He
          digs at his chest now, in considerable pain, rotating his
          arm around, trying to rouse it.
          
                                                                       88.

                    Fucking things falling asleep...
          
          Israel gazes at Beanie's body, trying to figure out an
          appropriate course of action.
          
                                ISRAEL (CONT'D)

                    I gotta make a phone call, figure
                    this out...
          
          He takes out his cellphone, dialing Morris Mecklen. Soot
          appears behind him, easing the 9mm out of his waistband and
          resuming his stalk...ever...so...slowly.
          
                                                                   CUT TO:

          Israel's security crew, surrounding a still-stunned Sir Ivy,
          waiting on the lift. One of the elevators approaches. The
          rest appear to be down.
          
                                BODYGUARD #1
                    One of 'em on it's way up. This

                    with the rest of 'em?
          
          Suddenly, the stairwell doors are flung open, revealing Hugo
          and Gill. All guns whip simultaneously to that spot.
          
                                HUGO

                    Ivy tried to kill Mr. Israel and
                    shot Mr. Alphonse in the process.
                    He's dead.
          
          Hugo, thunderstruck.

          blood drenched, barely conscious, eyes flittering like black
          flies...she kicks the bone saw from his hand. It spins to a
          gradual stop. She leans over him...the stiletto blade he
          used to dispatch "Bill" and hack Carruthers digits off has
          retracted back into his sleeve.
          
          Sykes begins patting him down, moving dangerously close to
          that sleeve, her neck hovering right above that spot--

          tablecloth covering his service tray, takes an igloo cooler
          off ice inside, pulls surgical tools from it-- scalpel,
          forceps rib-spreader, etc., He arranges them pre-op style.
          He removes a phone from his jacket, hits "Send" waits, says:

          He reaches Israel, leveling the 9mm to his skull. Israel is
          completely unaware as he clutches his chest, breath coming
          in great laborious gulps. He's on the phone to Mecklen.

          at gun right in his face. Israel's breathing suddenly cinches
          up tight, his pulse triple-timing. He turns back to Gill.

          Back out of the earpiece, down through the scope, over the
          barrel of the rifle...BOOM...A .50 caliber bullet is birthed.
          
          CAMERA TRAVELS BACK TO:
          
          The fourteenth floor window of the Nomad detonates with
          concussive ferocity-- creating a hailstorm of shattered glass
          that sweeps the length of the hallway, engulfing cops and
          feds whole.
          
                                                                CUT TO:
          
          Another round tears in after it, exploding a gilded ceiling
          stanchion, sparking off the rebar, tripping the sprinkler
          system, dousing the corridor-- everybody runs for cover.
          
          One of the AGENTS, wounded, summons another elevator.
          Messner, undeterred, advances on the elevator containing
          Sykes and Carruthers.
          
          CAMERA TRAVELING BACK
          
          Sykes, Glock ready to rock, about to move. Acosta, pulling
          a pistol from his ankle-rig, preparing to backshoot Sykes.
          
          CAMERA ASCENDS BACK UP THROUGH SHAFT
          
          Chaos. Carnage. Full blown bloodbath. Heavily-armed men on
          an overkill override. Mustache and Co., waging close quarters
          warfare with the Brothers Tremor. Bullets blaze, bodies
          drop, everything burns--
          
          CAMERA CONTINUES PAST SCENE TO:
          
          Soot, shooting Hugo several times-- Hugo falling back,
          confused by the abrupt pain, baffled by the appearance of
          blood. Gill, overtop of Israel, trying to force feed him
          nitro-glycerin tablets. Buddy goes into full cardiac arrest.
          
          Disparate sounds collide now, swell to a great tumult-- an
          incomprehensible crescendo of explosions and chainsaws and
          gunshots and screams as we--
          
          CUT TO BLACK
          
          ...nothing...complete and utter silence...
          
          SLOW FADE UP ON:
          
          Primo Sparazza...sitting in that hospital bed...waiting.
          
                                                              FADE OUT:

          The Swede...sitting on a sofa in his suite with Sparazza's
          men...waiting.

          HARD CUT UP ON:
          
          All of it happening at lightspeed. Watters, reloading,
          watching as leaden contrails of gunsmoke pour from the
          pulverized fourteenth floor. She resumes her assault.
          
                                                                CUT TO:
          
          Messner, a few feet from the car containing Sykes. More
          sniper fire rakes the hallway. Another elevator arrives,
          opens...call girls inside. They snuck up somehow, past
          security... The gunplay gets them spooked, scared-- they
          scramble from the car-- cops and feds try to stuff them back
          inside the elevator as rounds continue to rain down.
          
          One of the girls catches a hard ricochet, wig leaping off
          her head as a bounced bullet punches through her skull-- she
          crumbles, instant casualty. Messner hardly notices, moving
          instead toward the other elevator car.
          
                                MESSNER
                    THIS IS THE FBI! THROW YOUR WEAPON
                    OUT! SHOW ME YOUR HANDS!
          
                                SYKES
                        (whispering into IFB)
                    Are these feds fake or for real girl!
          
          Carruthers, pawing feebly at her, moaning-- trying to warn
          her-- she shrugs him off.
          
                                WATTERS
                        (yelling)
                    I DON'T KNOW!

                    Jus' keep doin' y'damage girl, keep
                    these mafuckas off my as--
          
          BANG-- Sykes squeals, spins back, feels numbness spread over
          her legs and lower trunk, knows she's been shot.
          
                                                                       97.
          
                                   SYKES (CONT'D)
                           (panic, into her IFB)
                       We're out girl! I'm shot! I'M SHOT!--
          
          ACOSTA fires again, bullet ripping through her studded
          bustier, gouging kevlar, nicking ribcage-- embedding into
          the IFB receiver on her hip, ruining it. Sykes falters--
          tries to raise her gun--
          
          Acosta raises his aim to her head, about to deliver the coup
          de grace-- Messner appears now, sees Acosta, sights him when--
          
          BLAM!BLAM!    BLAM!!
          
          Acosta's chest explodes, he slumps, the gun sliding away--
          Messner swings wide on the car to reveal:
          
          Carruthers, smoking gun, trembling aim, exposed ankle
          holster...empty. Sykes, kevlar burning, smashed round still
          hot, she tries to pull her vest off, finds her newly paralyzed
          arm uncooperative. Messner, advancing now, keeping an eye
          on his partner as he moves toward the car.
          
                                   MESSNER
                       LADY, SHOW ME YOUR HANDS RIGHT NOW!
          
                                   SYKES
                       I NEED MY HANDS MOTHERFUCKER! I'M
                       HIT! KILL ME OR LET ME BE!
          
          Messner enters the elevator, rushes to the doomed Carruthers.
          
                                   MESSNER
                       How bad?
          
                                   CARRUTHERS
                       Mortal.
          
                                   MESSNER
                       No.
          
                                   CARRUTHERS
                       Yeah.
          
          Messner takes his partner under the arms, lugging him into
          the open hallway, stripping off his shirt. Carruthers severed
          hand nearly falls away from the rest of his arm.
          
          Acosta spits blood from the lungs-- his breathing now a bog
          of pinched snorts and gurgles.
          
                                   MESSNER
                           (re: Acosta, yelling
                            to the others)
                       SECURE THIS SUSPECT!
          
          TWO FEDS enter to remove Acosta from the car-- he lets out a
          guttural yelp as they hoist him-- real pain or playing possum,
          
                                                                       98.
          
          impossible to tell...As his legs clear the elevator doors,
          they slowly close on the wounded Sykes.
          
          Messner, tries to prevent them from closing, can't-- gazes
          up at the digital counter as the elevator continues its ascent
          to the Penthouse level...
          
                                                                CUT TO:

          Sykes, riding up, wounded, vulnerable, trying to reach the
          control panel to stop the car. She keys her now useless IFB.
          
                                SYKES
                        (into IFB)
                    Girl, I'm inside, I'm on my way up--
                    this elevator is going to the
                    Penthouse-- can you hear me--? Baby,
                    can you hear me--
          
                                                                CUT TO:
          
          INT. HORIZON HOTEL -- TOP FLOOR -- SAME
          
          --Watters, panicked, pulling the Barrett up off its tri-pod,
          hitting the hallway, double-timing to the stairwell...She
          has no idea that she's lost radio contact with Watters.
          
                                WATTERS
                    Sit tight if you can hear me Girl!
                    I can't do shit for you from here.
                    I'm moving down for a sightline!
          
                                                                CUT TO:
          
          INT. PENTHOUSE HALLWAY -- SAME
          
          Plaster and debris everywhere, sprinklers tripped, most of
          Mustache's team shot, shredded or burnt to a crisp. Pieces
          of building and bodies either waterlogged or fully ablaze.
          Mustache and Darwin play duck and cover, exchanging fire.
          Jeeves, out of grenades, sledgehammer swinging, crushing
          wall studs, scattering remaining security team members.
          
          Ivy, sheltered, having survived the opening salvos, gets
          ahold of a gun from a chainsaw-shorn former security member;
          Lester sees Ivy arming himself, blitzes him-- chainsaw
          snarling, revved out, sending fantails of gristle and chipped
          bone everywhere. Less than fifteen feet separate them.
          
          Ivy fires, shots deflected off the blade's teeth, seconds
          from getting gutted-- he adjusts his aim high, emptying the
          gun into Lester's chest, bullets blazing haywire, blowing
          out between Lester's shoulders, stopping a hard charge cold.
          
                                                                       99.
          
          Lester, lopsided, bullet-dazed, drools blood...then dies.
          Ivy dumps his clip, searches for another-- the chainsaw falls,
          stalls.
          
          Jeeves, hefting the sledgehammer like a hayseed John Henry,
          looks over as his older brother's life come to an end. He
          reacts badly.
          
                                JEEVES TREMOR
                    LESTERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!
          
          Jeeves buries the sledge in a wall, takes up the chainsaw,
          rips the pullcord, resumes the charge--
          
          Ivy, finds a clip, slams it in the stock, points, pulls--
          trigger-stick, hammer-jam. He falls to his back, scurrying
          away, trouble finding traction, soles slipping-- he keeps
          pulling the trigger. Jeeves straddles him from above, raises
          the saw like a great wooden stake, about to bring it down--
          
          --BAM!
          
          Ivy's automatic discharges. The round splits the saw's gas
          tank, spritzing fuel, dousing Jeeves-- A beat before the
          tank suddenly arcs, exploding, lighting Jeeves up like a
          four-hundred pound bonfire, bouncing him off the walls; a
          human Hindenberg, fully engulfed. He flails, burns, howls,
          falls...molten fat melts off his body like lard butter...
          
          Darwin, dismayed, both brothers down...He moves on Mustache,
          dispatches him with detached efficiency, snapping his neck
          clean. He then starts toward Ivy, who's trying desperately
          to crawl out of there.

          Hugo, crawling across the floor, knees dragging over his own
          blood trail, trying to reach: Israel, on the ground, dying.
          Soot's gun has jammed. He clears it efficiently, patiently
          reloading the weapon as Doc Gill, in panic mode, performs
          full chest compressions on Buddy as we--

          Messner, doing the same to Carruthers, trying to restart his
          heart. Acosta, lays there silently, slowly bleeding out,
          being tended to by a team of agents. In the b.g. Cops and
          Feds gather near the window, searching for the assailant,
          binoculars and rifle scopes strafing the Horizon hotel across
          the way, concentrating at the open window near the top floor.

          WATTERS, running up the hallway, past alarmed maid service
          and hotel staff. She reaches the lower floor window and
          raises the scope to her eye, searching for Sykes--
          
                                WATTERS
                    Girl, where are you-- talk to me...how
                    bad are you hit...
          
          WATTERS POV
          
          She sees the Feds and Cops in the Nomad window across the
          way. Smoke clears, her field of vision through the scope
          expands, sharpens.
          
                                WATTERS (CONT'D)
                    Georgia goddamn baby, please talk to
                    me, please say somethin' so--
          
          --And that's when she spots the call girl, face obscured,
          lying dead from a headshot in the hallway...her heart
          sinks...and she assumes the worst: Sykes is dead.

                    MOTHERFUCKERS!!
          
          She flicks to full-auto and opens fire right through the
          glass in front of her-- big gas-ejected shells pop from the
          breach like bowling pins-- the gathered throng across the
          way in the Nomad window seem to vaporize in a violent collage
          of heat, blood and building chunks-- Watters bucks big sobs,
          blasting away with the Barrett...

                                                                   CUT TO:

          Darwin, looming over Ivy, about to bring the sledge down
          squarely on his skull-- the elevator doors open in his
          periphery... He looks over, sees Sykes standing there, barely
          clothed, wet with blood, gun in her hand...and grins.
          
                                                                      101.
          
          Sykes, seeing Darwin standing over Ivy, holding a sledgehammer--
          recognizes him as the perv from earlier. She levels the Glock,
          stepping out of the elevator, steadying herself against the
          wall, steadying her aim on Darwin's head.
          
                                SYKES
                    Drop that hammer...
                        (beat, cocking gun)
                    And I drop this one.
                        (beat)
                    Know a killer motherfucker...know
                    they voice. Know they feel...and
                    know you 'bout to die by one.
          
          Then, the sound of an helicopter intrudes, rotor thrum,
          building steadily, growing louder-- the floor seems to shake
          as the chopper approaches-- nervous eyes dart-- nobody moves.
          
                                                                CUT TO:

          The chopper draws closer, growing louder-- Hugo, still trying
          to crawl toward his downed boss. Soot finishes him off with
          a flush headshot. Gill, frantic, rapid chest compressions
          on Israel, who gags, starts, coughs, heart back up and
          beating. His watery gaze moves from Gill to Soot, who know
          stands overtop of him, aiming the 9mm down at him.
          
          Israel averts his eyes...the end has come. He looks over
          and sees his lamb-skin coat, lying there, soaking in Beanie's
          blood, ruined beyond recognition. A tear escapes his eye.
          
                                ISRAEL
                    ...forgive me...
          
          Soot puts the gun flush with Buddy's skull when suddenly,
          the ceiling begins to tremble and shake...the sound of a
          helicopter filling the air.
          
                                                                CUT TO:

          Messner is losing Carruthers, can't revive him, begins to
          crack-- hammering on his chest...it's no use. He's dead.
          He sobs-- something slides from his pocket. He glances down...
          
          ...sees that the bag containing Elmore's severed fingers has
          fallen from his pocket. Doesn't remember hanging onto them.
          He replaces them in his pocket. Looks down at his dead
          friend, sees his severed hand, also missing fingers...
          
          ...the absurdity of this makes Messner want to cry laughing...
          
          ...and that's when he hears the chopper...and sees it as it
          rises up past their floor, past the contingent of Cops and
          Feds slugging it out with Watters across the street.
          
                                                                    102.

          Watters, ears ringing with gunfire reverb, reloading-- salvos
          of return fire ripping back at her-- then, all at once, the
          shooting stops-- She pauses, thinks it's a ploy-- then slowly
          peers over the window sill as the Bell-Ranger comes into
          view, over the Nomad, touching down on its narrow rooftop.
          
          INT. PENTHOUSE -- SAME
          
          The doors to the Penthouse level are bashed open and the
          windows implode as FBI tactical agents repel in, weapons
          drawn, swarming, surrounding the scene, shouting commands--
          Darwin Tremor drops the sledge, jackrabbits for the elevator,
          diving in as the doors close--
          
          Sykes, stumbling toward Ivy. He sees she's injured, scoops
          her up like a new bride-- she places something in his
          hand...Acosta's fake FBI credentials. Ivy looks, nods, gets
          it-- agents approach, combat crouches, MP-5's at arms.
          
                                AGENT #1
                    Let me see your hands!
          
          Ivy, flashing the I.D., taking care to cover the photo.
          
                                SIR IVY
                    This woman's been shot, I need to
                    get her medical attention immediately!
          
          Commotion and confusion swirl. The Agent, unsure, searching
          for some confirmation-- can't find it, dismisses them and
          rushes into the Penthouse. Sykes and Ivy slip out the exit.

          badly, seizures still hobbling his heart. Gill, being patted
          down by the Agents, prescription pills confiscated. Soot is
          held at gunpoint and flex-cuffed, the remainder of rubber
          appliance pulled off his face.
          
          The agents begin to initiate an "All Clear" over their radios.
          Moments pass before Deputy Director Locke enters the room,
          He approaches Soot, studies him, to one of the agents;
          
                                   LOCKE
                    Soot?
          
          The Agent nods confirmation. Locke reaches into Soot's coat,
          finds his cellphone...hits redial.

          He reaches the seventeenth floor, rounds the corner, nearly
          runs into Messner, has a gun thrust in his face.

          Messner, eyes moving from Ivy to Sykes. Stalemate, no sense
          pushing. He moves past them, hits the stairwell exit on

          yet more blood on himself. Satisfied, he snatches Carruthers'
          F.B.I. credentials up off the floor...and waits.

          The elevator arrives at the far end. A small asian man
          carrying a stack of clean towels steps off and starts down
          the hall-- sees Watters, sees the .45 trained on him-- does
          an abrupt about face and disappears back inside the car.
          
          Watters lowers the gun, wipes tears, the area around her is
          littered with spent .50 caliber shells. The fourteenth floor
          of the Nomad is now empty. Sirens wail in the distance.
          Down below, Watters can see a bevy of law enforcement
          personnel streaming toward the Horizon. She slowly takes
          the Barrett off the ledge, begins breaking it down, glancing

                        (pointing to Swede)
                    This is him? The hitman hired to
                    kill Israel? He's a doctor?

                    Difficult to explain everything now...

                    And much larger issues loom.
                        (beat)
                    I'm sorry about Carruthers...Damndest
                    thing to have to die for.
          
          The Swede, working on Israel, shaking his head, something's
          wrong. He stands, crosses to Locke, silently confers.
          
                                                                   107.

                    Very well.

                    Take Mr. Israel to the roof, he'll
                    be traveling with us.
          
          Suddenly, Soot breaks from his captors, sprinting for the
          shattered Penthouse windows, launching himself-- a swan dive
          out into the open air-- He hangs there for a moment, an
          aesthetically striking form; like Lazarus cast against a
          cobalt blue sky, backlit by the sun from the lake below--
          
          --till gravity grabs, pulls-- plummeting him toward earth,
          sending him headlong into the vast expanse of concrete below.
          This startlingly event is dismissed by mutual shrugs and a
          collective lack of concern.
          
          Messner is absolutely agog.
          
                                MESSNER
                        (to Locke, forceful)
                    What the hell-- What is this!? People
                    died. Agent Carruthers is dead!

          Locke says no more-- starts out of the Penthouse with the
          Swede, Dr. Gill and Buddy Israel in tow. A Bureau forensics
          team arrives to quietly tag and bag the dead...Messner stands
          there, absolutely agog.
          
                                                                CUT TO:
          
          INT. NOMAD HOTEL -- LOBBY -- DAY
          
          Hives of activity. Cordons and crime scene lockdowns like
          onion layers, multiple law enforcement agencies, confounded,
          confused-- too many cooks, too many kitchens. Nobody knows
          who the hells in charge. Local paramedics and EMT's cart
          out the wounded. Coroners and M.E.'s cart out the dead.
          
          Reporters and national news outlets crowd police barricades
          outside, competing for coverage, as--
          
          THE CAMERA PANS OVER TO REVEAL:
          
          Acosta is wheeled through the lobby, hooked up to IV and
          oxygen, looking ghastly, like something exhumed. He catches
          the eye of the pimply casino employee and manages a wink.
          
                                                                   108.
          
          He's flex-cuffed to the gurney and pushed against the wall
          for the moment as the Agents move off to deal with the recent
          appearance of Lazlo Soot-- whose body has been unceremoniously
          splattered over the parking lot.
          
          As the Agents depart, Acosta peers down at his shackles;
          simple plastic binding rods-- he smiles...a moment later the
          stiletto blade fires from his sleeve as--
          
          THE CAMERA PANS OVER TO REVEAL:
          
          Darwin Tremor staggering out of an open elevator, blood-
          sodden, head down-- FBI badge held aloft for all its worth.
          Playing it up, free pass, Agents rush in, hold him upright,
          help him toward a line of awaiting ambulances outside as--
          
          THE CAMERA PANS OVER TO REVEAL:
          
          Ivy and Sykes, being released from the stairwell, cut chains
          sliding off-- Ivy holds up pilfered FBI creds. Rampant
          confusion makes the moment possible. He's waved through,
          carrying Sykes, looking every bit the good Samaritan.
          
          Sykes, a mess of mascara, adorned in her unmentionables,
          looking every bit the prostitute she appears to be-- she
          spots the woman at the counter from earlier. The woman gazes
          back, jaw agape. Sykes can only shrug...if you can't beat
          'em-- join 'em. She and Ivy cross the lobby as--
          
          THE CAMERA PANS OVER TO REVEAL:
          
          Messner...morose, exiting another elevator with the sheet-
          draped body of Carruthers on a gurney. Gandersen, the Nomad
          owner, spots him, starts over, looks to unleash, gets close
          enough to catch Messner's expression. Sees it in his
          eyes...enough dead bodies for one day. Messner continues
          moving through the lobby, hears the chopper taking off as--
          
          CAMERA TILTS UP TO REVEAL:
          
          Through the clear glass atrium of the Nomad, the Bell-Ranger
          goes airborne against an impossibly clear winter sky, banking
          south toward Las Vegas.
          
          CAMERA TILTS DOWN TO REVEAL:
          
          The Horizon hotel across the way: The Fourteenth floor window.
          
          INT. HORIZON HOTEL -- FOURTEENTH FLOOR -- DAY
          
          Watters, gear stowed, seemingly indifferent about the level
          of law enforcement heading up her way, about to launch an
          Alamo-like last stand in honor of her fallen sista.
          
          She hears commotion erupt from outside as survivors begin
          filing from the building. She takes up the Barrett, gazing
          through the scope, looking, looking, looking...stops...holy
          shit...it's her. It's Sykes.
          
                                                                   109.
          
          And she's alive and being carried by a man, a big gorgeous
          black man that she's gazing upon with utter love and longing.
          A boulder-sized lump takes shape in Watters throat; betrayed,
          backbit-- tears come to fast to contain, too many to control.
          
          Numbed...the sensation leaving her fingers, she finds herself
          racking the bolt on the Barrett and gazing through
          crosshairs...taking aim on Ivy's head. Behind her, the
          elevator arrives, an a dozen armed cops, hoo-rah from it,
          hustling the length of the hall, descending down on her--
          
                                WATTERS
                        (whispering)
                    ...I loved you baby...
          
          BOOM!
          
          EXT. PARKING STRUCTURE -- NOMAD HOTEL -- SAME
          
          A gunshot in the distance followed by shrieks-- Darwin Tremor
          snaps his head around at the sound, moving past platoons of
          Cops and Feds now rushing that way. His I.D. is out,
          affording him easy egress. He hops the stairs up, top level,
          Barracuda parked at the rear of the lot. As he approaches...
          
                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                    Hey...
          
          Darwin glances over at...Hollis Elmore, standing there, skin
          horribly discolored, disease afflicted. He wears a hooded
          tourist sweatsuit; "Ta-Hoe, Ta-Hoe It's Off To Fun We Go!"
          stitched in cursive across the front. He's holding the Colt
          Python against his hip.
          
                                ELMORE
                        (nodding to Cuda)
                    That your car?
          
          Darwin, a beat, what-to-do...hillbilly-acumen in overdrive.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    No, I'm confiscating it.
                        (holding up badge)
                    F.B.I.
          
          Now Elmore raises the Colt with his good hand, advancing on
          Darwin, moving gingerly, his legs not quite there...
          
                                ELMORE
                    You're F.B.I.?
          
          Darwin tries to stay tight, composed.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    That's right...and I'd advise y'ta
                    lower your weapon sir.
          
          Elmore keeps coming.
          
                                                                   110.
          
                                 ELMORE
                    You investigating those murders out
                    at the lake?
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                        (blanching a bit)
                    Ww...uh...
          
                                ELMORE
                    Three men were ambushed and shot,
                    two died and had their bodies tossed
                    into the lake, the other has severe
                    hypothermia, possible dementia and
                    will probably be a multiple amputee
                    by week's end...if he even lives
                    that long.
          
          Darwin, uh-oh...
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    No, I ain't even heard abou--
          
          --Oops.
          
                                ELMORE
                        (even more menace)
                    You "ain't"--
                        (beat, teeth clenched)
                    You have any idea how close to death
                    I've been? You understand that I'm
                    dying now? That I've survived bullets
                    and frostbite and raging fever--
                        (holding up hand)
                    missing fingers and every fucking
                    imaginable horror in between?
          
          Darwin...speechless...he's done.
          
                                ELMORE (CONT'D)
                    And I'm asking you now, "Is that
                    your car" and you can't even come
                    clean and do me the decency of a
                    straight answer, with the fucking
                    state that I'm in!?
          
          Elmore, that Colt looking like a cannon this close to Darwin.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    Yeah, shit-- hell, you're right. I'm
                    sorry.
          
                                ELMORE
                    You shot me and murdered my friends.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    I did. We-- yeah, I know.
          
                                                                   111.
          
                                ELMORE
                    And threw us into the lake.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    Pretty much, yep.
          
          Elmore, still nodding.
          
                                ELMORE
                    And this is your car, isn't it?
          
                                   DARWIN TREMOR
                    Mmm-hmm.
          
                                ELMORE
                    But there were more of you?
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    Yeah, m'brothers...They didn't make
                    it.
          
                                   ELMORE
                    Two of 'em?
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                        (nods, tears flow)
                    Thass' right.
                        (beat, wiping eyes)
                    I got other brother's though, so it
                    ain't so bad.
          
                                ELMORE
                    You were here huntin' a man named
                    Israel, weren't you? Your name is
                    Tremor.
          
          Darwin gazes up at Elmore, some fraternal bond forms.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    I was. It is...That who you was here
                    for? Israel?
          
          A pause. Elmore nods.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR (CONT'D)
                    Well...we both got beat out then,
                    didn't we?
          
          Darwin, slowly lowering the Colt.
          
                                ELMORE
                    Yes we did...
                        (long pause, then)
                    Now, give me your car keys. And get
                    the fuck out of here.
          
          Darwin, sifting through his pockets, tossing Elmore the keys.
          
                                                                     112.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR
                    S'fair...lemme just grab somethin'.
          
          Elmore brings the Colt back up.   Darwin, hands up, hold on--
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR (CONT'D)
                    No, no, no, I'm done with all that.
          
          He reaches in, pulls a joint off the dashboard, forages,
          finds matches, lights up, starts off.
          
                                DARWIN TREMOR (CONT'D)
                        (to 'Cuda)
                    Probably needs to be tuned. Air

          Darwin, walking away, taking huge hits off that joint,
          traipsing down the steps, getting stoned out of his mind.
          Elmore, considering, re-considering, looking at that Colt.
          
                                ELMORE
                    ...Oh, fuck that...
          
          --As he back shoots Darwin with all six rounds from the
          Python, blowing holes through him. Darwin goes lop-sided,
          legs failing, lit-joint still smoking in his mouth as dies
          standing, only to fall like cut timber seconds later.
          
          Elmore acts quickly, sliding into the 'Cuda and starting it,
          that big block Hemi roaring to life under the hood.
          
                                                                 CUT TO:
          
          EXT. NOMAD HOTEL AND CASINO -- DAY
          
          Pedestrians and passerbys drawn to the commotion at the Nomad,
          the bottleneck bogs traffic down, making it impossible to
          move. Elmore crouches low as police and emergency personnel
          cross in front of the car... Slowly, the crosswalk begins to
          thin and then finally clear...save a single man:
          
          Messner...standing right in front of the Barracuda, staring
          at the tires, staring at Elmore. The two lock eyes as he
          moves around to the driver's side, reaching into his pocket--
          
          --Elmore lifts the Colt up off his lap, putting his heavily
          bandaged hand on the wheel. Then he sees Messner's FBI creds,
          clipped to his belt-- can't tell if this one's legit.
          
                                                                   113.
          
          He sets the Colt down on the floorboard as Messner walks up,
          pulling a plastic bag from his pocket: The one containing
          three severed fingers. He glances down at Elmore's mummified
          left hand, holding out the bag for him to take.
          
          Elmore, unsure, accepting the bag, seeing what's inside,
          embarrassed by it-- he sets it down on the seat next to him.
          
                                 MESSNER
                     Your friends were taken to Carson
                     City Memorial, they're going to be
                     autopsied and shipped back for burial.
          
                                 ELMORE
                     I'll take care of it.
          
          Messner, nodding. A beat.
          
                                 MESSNER
                     Who owned this car?
          
          Beat.
          
                                 ELMORE
                     The ones that killed 'em.
          
          Beat.   Messner nods.
          
                                 MESSNER
                     Where are they now?
          
          Elmore looks up at him-- what does it matter...
          
                                 ELMORE
                     I just want to go home man...I just
                     want to go home and forget this
                     fucking place even exists.

          INT. CEDARS SINAI -- LAS VEGAS NEVADA -- DAY
          
          Messner walks in, cleaned up, pressed suit, no tie. He badges
          himself past the front desk. An ORDERLY approaches.
          
                                                                      114.

          Messner nods.

          Messne exits the stairwell. Droves of Feds and justice
          department types crowd the third floor hallway, around the
          I.C.U. The mood is subdued. The Swede exits a per-op suite,
          dressed in scrubs and a surgical gown, talking with Dr. Gill,
          who is also dressed for surgery.
          
          Messner searches the hall for a familiar face...finds
          it...Locke, far end, talking with an aide.
          
                                LOCKE

                    Basic bullet points-- despondent
                    over the turn his career had taken,
                    troubles with the law, history of
                    substance abuse and so on--
          
          The aide sees Messner approach. Locke follows her eyes, turns.
          
                                MESSNER
                    Where's Israel?

                    --no, we need to handle it now.
          
          Locke, angered, handing his clipboard to the aide, taking
          Messner by the arm, leading him away.
          
                                LOCKE

          A gun is in Locke's side now-- against his ribs-- he looks
          down, stunned...Now it's Messner who's leading him away.
          
                                   MESSNER
                       You're going to tell me why no call
                       was made to inform us that the Israel
                       situation had been "altered." Why I--
                       and my friend and partner, whose

          Locke, pale, shook up.

                           (jams gun into ribs)
                       The Swede isn't a hitman, is he?
                       He's a surgeon. Sparazza didn't
                       want Israel's heart for a trophy, he
                       wanted it for a transplant...why?

          Locke and Messner enter. In an oxygen tent erected on one
          side of the room, sits the shrunken figure of Primo Sparazza.
          On the other, a barely conscious Buddy Israel. Both men are
          hooked up to multiple I-V's and heart monitors.

                    thirty-six major medical procedures
                    performed on him since 1953? Elective

          coated man stalks the vehicle's sole survivor, FREEMAN HELLER,
          shooting him in the back. He rolls over and is shot point

                    Primo Sparazza was Heller's alias.
                    He went deep cover in 1940 and stayed
                    under for over ten years, amassing
                    materials against the mafia and other
                    criminal syndicates. He may have
                    ripped the organization wide open,
                    pre-Appalachia, but his superiors
                    were convinced that he had gone rogue,
                    swapped allegiances...So they gave
                    the order to terminate his cover.

                    He survived the shooting but the
                    injuries he sustained triggered a

                    required constant surgery, forever
                    altering his features...so he assumed

      We open on a GUARD sitting in front of a sentry post. He is
      wearing a heavy fur hat that covers his ears and a military-
      jacket. Behind him is a list of instructions (in Russian).
      He 'sucks in a cigarette as though he's a drowning man lookin
      for oxygen. A CAR comes to a stop by the sentry post, the,
      guard looks, asks a couple of questions and is given an
     -envelope which he quickly examines, he then attempts to stick
      his head in the car. A gun barrel is promptly stuck in his
      face and a couple of angry words emanate from the back, the
      guard jumps back and quickly raises the barrier.

     down and a gun barrel is stuck through. The RUSSIAN DRIVER
     looks dramatically calm.

     Franky hesitates for a second.

               Franky you know you have no choice.
               So please can we get on with it?
      Franky knows discussion is futile. He flips the case open
      and pulls out a transparent plastic bag full of American
      dollars. The package is pulled out of the window, the driver
      doesn't move, we dissolve for a passage of time, the anxiety
      is more than obvious, but Four Fingers can do nothing. All
      of a sudden a package comes through the window and the car
      speeds off without waiting for an inspection of the delivery.

7   EX.T. BACK ALLEY MAKESHIFT BOXING RING -- DAY

    BRICK TOP (aka MR MCLEAN) is a heavy looking fella. He is
    observing a giant of a man, BOMBER HARRIS, boxing a sparring
    partner.

                          BRICK TOP

              Two hundred and sixty pounds, that's
              fucking pedigree pal.
    He's talking to LIAM and GARY, a couple of employees.

                          BRICK TOP (CONT'D)

              He doesn't look bad does he?

                          GARY

              Oh no Mr Mclean, he looks great.

                             LIAM

              Yeah great.

                          GARY

              He'll kill him, he'll do you proud
              governor.

                          BRICK TOP

              Do you reckon that's what people
              should do for me, do you Gary, do me
              proud?

                          GARY

              That's what you deserve Mr Mclean.

             Pull your tongue out of my arsehoie
             Gary. Dogs do that, and you're not
             a dog, are you Gary?
    Taken aback by the change in tone.




                         GARY

             Err no, I am not.

                         BRICK TOP

             However, you do have all of the
             characteristics of a dog Gary, all
             except loyalty.
    There is a definite change in temperature.

                           BRICK TOP (CONT'D)

             And people like dogs Gary, for the
             principal reason that they're loyal.
             So I don't quite know where that
             leaves you my old son, other than
             refuckinpugnant. . .
    There is a problem

                         BRICK TOP (CONT'D)

             Which one was it that kept the four
             grand from the Clapham job?
    Pause

                         BRICK TOP (CONT'D)

             Don't let me ask again. I would
             like answers, but I am not in the
             mood for asking questions, get busy
             lads, or it's feeding time, oink,
             oink, know what I mean?
    Liam takes a step to the side and moves his eyes in a sideways
    action implying the guilt lies with Gary. Gary catches this
    and opens his mouth to protest. One of Brick Tops's henchmen,
    ERROL, sticks a belt in there as quick as it opens and smashes
    a bar across Gary's legs, he buckles. The henchman man pulls
    out a plastic bag and a roll of tape.

                            BRICK TOP (CONT'D')

                 You know what to do with that don't
                 you Liam?

    CUT TO FIGHTERS. SMALLER FIGHTER IS DISTRACTED.

    POV of Smaller Fighter, we witness Liam putting the bag over
    Gary's head and tying tape round his neck. Gary tries to
    resist but it's futile and we vaguely witness the demise of
    poor Gary.




    CUT TO BRICK TOP


                             BRICK TOP

                 You're a ruthless cunt Liam, I' l l
                 give you that.
    Brick Top turns away at this point to admire his fighter.

                             BRICK TOP (CONT'D)

                 But I got no time for grasses.



    We cut to see Liam's panic filled eyes. The bar comes down
    again. Brick Top finds more interest in his fighter.

                             BRICK TOP (CONT'D)

                 Feed em to the pigs Errol.
    With a short beat.

                             BRICK TOP (CONT'D)

                 He's looking good, Bomber, is he
                 not? How's their man getting on?
    We whip pan off Brick Top's boxing ring...

8   EXT. ANOTHER BACK ALLEY MAKESHIFT BOXING RING - - DAY

    ...And the whip pan shot takes us into this boxing ring.
    Meet TURKISH, he is Tommy's partner. Turkish is older and
    wiser than Tommy, they are both watching Gorgeous go through
    his paces. Gorgeous George is head butting a heavy punch
    bag. The sound that emanates is disturbing, and Tommy is
    distracted.

                             TOMMY

                 Is he allowed to do that?
    Turkish is drinking milk from a bottle

                             TURKISH

                 It's an unlicensed boxing match Tommy,
                 not a tickling competition. These
                 lads are out to hurt each other.

                             GORGEOUS GEORGE

                 Oi Turkish, can I have a drink?
    Turkish looks over his shoulder and then points to himself

    Turkish looks at the WATER BOY.

                          TURKISH (CONT'D)

              Oi son, look lively.



    He turns .back to Tommy.

                              TURKISH (CONT'D)

              Look at it.



    He turns to see the remnants of a caravan where they keep
    the training gear and administration for the fights

                          TURKISH (CONT'D)

              How am I supposed to run this thing
              from that? We gonna need a proper
              office.
    He looks at the caravan again and sighs, it is quite pitiful

                          TURKISH (CONT'D)

              I want a new one Tommy and you 're
              going to buy it for me.

                          TOMMY

              What's wrong with this one?
    Turning back to Tommy and ascending the steps in to his "I
    have seen better days" caravan, TURKISH'S foot goes through
    one of the stairs and the.door comes off at the hinges as he
    tries to open it.

                          TURKISH

              Oh nothing Tommy, it's tip top, it's
              just I am not sure about the colour.
    He passes him a piece of paper

                          TURKISH (CONT'D)

              Here it's all arranged. You just
              gotta pick it up. Here's an address.
    Tommy looks at the address and frowns.

                                TOMMY

                 I t ' s that campsite.

                             TURKISH

                 That's right, you're buying a caravan,
                 caravans live in campsites.

             I don't know what they are, all I
             know is they have a caravan, and we
             want a Caravan.

                         TOMMY

             I hope they're not pikies.     I hate
             fucking pikies.

                          TURKISH

             Tommy? You got ten grand and I want
             to see change.
He is distracted by the bulge in Tommy's trouser front.

                         TURKISH (CONT'D)

             Fuck me, hold tight, what's that?

Pointing quite clearly at the gun.

                         TURKISH

             No Tommy, there's a gun in your
             trousers. What is a gun doing in
             your trousers?

                          TOMMY

             It's for protection.

                         TURKISH

             Protection from what, the Germans?
             The war ended fifty years ago. Err
             what's to stop it blowing your balls
             off every time you sit down? Where
             did you get it?
Looking down onto his gun.

             Boris the Blade.

              What persuasion myself or the prawns
              belongs to is not the issue, the
              issue is how a fuckin shrimp managed
              to sneak in to' my sandwich.

     He throws the half eaten sandwich out the window.

12   EXT. STREET OUTSIDE BOOKIES -- DAY




     We cut to an enormous and frightening looking dog sniffing
     the half eaten prawn sandwich, before he is yanked away by
     his master. The dog is a lively young thing. We raise the
     camera to see the man that is walking it. Meet VINNY. Vinny
     is a very large black man - the size is due to dumplings not
     dumbbells. He .stops outside a shop. We see it clearly.

                  break them with a hammer, so they
                  came up with mosinites.

     They arrive in the camp site and the car is immediately

     We open on Vinny's dog, now sitting in a car, it's breathing
     heavily and doesn't look well, and Sol doesn't see the funny
     side of the dog sitting next to him. The man driving is
     called TYRONE: he's a white guy who thinks he's black. Vin

               man?

                           SOL

               I don't know Vin. Oi Tyrone, Vin
               wants to know why you talk like a
               black man?

                           TYRONE

               Roots and ting, seen?



     Sol and Vin raise their eyebrows.

                           VINNY

               Roots and what?

                           SOL

               I don't know. You get that gun from
               Boris?

                           VINNY

               Got it. It wasn't exactly what I
               was expecting, mind. Mean looking
               bastard though, that's for sure.
     Sol unzips a bag.     Inside is a ridiculously powerful shotgun.

                           SOL

               What's that?

                              VINNY

                  It's a shotgun Sol.

                             SOL

               I t ' s a fuckin anti-aircraft gun Vin.
               What are you planning on shooting,
               the angels out of the clouds? That's
               gonna raise more than pulses.

                              VINNY

                  It will raise hell my old son.

                          SOL

              I don't think I really want to see
            · hell Vin. What's wrong with a normal
              gun?

                              VINNY

                  The are psychological advantages to
                  a gun that looks like it can perforate
                  the moon.

     Tyrone gets into the car, starts it up again and puts some

                 Can you get this fuckin dog to stop

     Vin pulls the dog back.

                 I worry about you Vin, Jesus, talk

                 a knife and fork around, and I am
                 sure they would lick the salt of
                 your scrotum.
     The car wash starts.

                 What the fuck are you doing?

                 I never do a job unless I have a
                 clean car, I like to make my wheels
                 look crisp.

                             VINNY

                 Are you serious,? You' re a getaway
                 driver, you're not here to show your
                 fuckin car off.               ··.
     The machine starts. They do the windows up and that point
     the dog lets out a fart. The water starts to hit the
     windshield so they can't undo the windows. There is more an
     atmosphere of disbelief than of concrete anger.

16   EXT. CARAVAN CAMP SITE




     Gorgeous George fastens the caravan to the back of their
     Land Rover and pulls away. They wave at Micky and he
     reciprocates.

                             MICKY

                 He's a good dog. He'll get a little
                 homesick for a while but he'11 get
                 over it.
     Tommy has a dog that looks distressed about leaving Micky
     sitting next to him.

               I don't know what all your fuss was
               about. They aren't bad fellas.
     Just then the wheels of the caravan come straight off and
     the caravan is dragged until the car comes to a sudden stop.
     The dog jumps out the window and goes bounding back to the
     campsite.

18   EXT. CARAVAN -- DAY




     They are looking at the damage.   Of course i t ' s completely
     useless now.

               I don't think it's supposed to have
               done that.

     The dog is behind Micky's legs happy to be back.

                           MICKY

               The deal was you bought it how you
               saw it.
      Tommy goes to interrupt but he doesn't get a chance

                           MICKY (CONT'D)

               Look, I have helped ya as much as I
               am gonna help ya. You still got a
               car and I suggest you use it before
               you're not welcome anymore.
     There is a silence for a while. The atmosphere has gone
     more than frosty and a few more gypsies are hanging around.

                           GORGEOUS GEORGE

               Hey...
     Interrupted

                           MICKY

               It was only a question of time before
               you got some attention. Nobody brings
               a fella the size of you unless they
               are trying to say something without
               talking.

                           TOMMY

               Just give us my money and you can
               keep your caravan.

                  that's got no fuckin wheels? I am

     Gorgeous George steps forward.

                              MICKY (CONT'D)

                  Where the fuck do you think you're
                  going? You want to settle this with
                  a fight?

                  You'll do no such thing Michael.
                  You'll...

                              MICKY

                  Alright Mum, we shan't, we'll settle
                  it some other way, now don't get
                  upset.

                              MUM

                  I won't have you fighting, Micky.
     Micky's Mum is getting upset and it's consequently upsetting
     Micky.

                              MICKY

                  Okay mum okay. You need to sit down.
     Micky calls to one of the lads standing by.

                              MICKY (CONT'D)

                  Darren look after Mum. Get her
                  sitting down.
     We see Mum being led out by Darren; Micky looks genuinely
     concerned for his mum. Pause as Micky waits for her to be
     well gone.

                                 MICKY (CONT'D)

                  I ' l l fight you for it.



     Tommy looks at Gorgeous George.        Gorgeous George raises his
     eyebrows.

20   INT. HORSE BOX, PIKEY CAMP -- DAY

     The two fighters start pacing. It looks a bit ridiculous,
     Micky is dwarfed by comparison. Gorgeous George takes a
     swipe: it was an .impressive punch, but Micky is a quick littl
     bastard and sidesteps. Micky does nothing to retaliate; his
     hands are still by his,side.







                                                   (CONTINUED)





20   CONTINUED:




     Gorgeous George lunges out and grabs Micky by the throat and
     groin, picks him up like a sack of spuds and throws him
     against the car door. All eyes are on Micky for a second or
     two, then he rises and appears little bothered by this, he
     gets up brushes himself off and starts to pace again, hardly
     even looking at the big man.

                          GORGEOUS GEORGE

              You want to stay down my friend, I
              promise you, you want to stay down.
     Micky ignores this and continues to pace, the big fella grabs
     him and puts him in a headlock and charges him into the stable
     door. There is a terrible noise.




                          GORGEOUS GEORGE (CONT'D)

              Now you fucking stay down boy or you
              won't be coming up next time.
     It appears as though this is going to get messy and any humour
     that might have been around has now evaporated. Micky raises
     his head there is still no damage to speak of. All of a
     sudden he starts jumping up and down like he's warming up,
     throwing a few shadow punches, taking off his shirt. This
     reveals a heavily tattooed and scarred torso, and underneath
     these embellishments is a physique that warrants some respect.

                          GORGEOUS GEORGE (CONT'D)

              This is sick. I am outta here.

                          MICKY -

              You're not going anywhere my friend.
              You stay until the job is done.
     Micky starts pacing, and throwing out a couple of shadow
     punches with his back to Gorgeous George, he still hasn't
     really acknowledged his opponent. Gorgeous George moves in
     for the coup de grace, Micky spins on his feet and catches
     the big man under the jaw.

     CUT TO BLACK

     FADE IN: We see Gorgeous George lying on the floor with a
     head the size of a water melon. There is blood streaming
     out of every orifice in his head - he's in.big trouble. We
     are in slow motion;- there's a lot of activity going on around
     the body on the floor, their mouths are open but we can't
     hear what they are saying, all we can hear is the voice over
     given by Tommy.




                             TOMMY (V.O.)

                  This isn't good, if George doesn't

               fuckin scared. There is something
               coldblooded and practical about what
               these people are thinking. They
               will pop me like a hot sausage if
               George doesn't wake up. Why do they
               want to go to the trouble of
               explaining why a man died in a
               campsite? These people don't exist
               in society, you can't find them,
               they live under their own laws and
               ignore everybody else's. I am scared,
               I am really fuckin scared.

                              DOUG

                  You get busy Franky. Put a couple
                  of hundred down for me.

23   INT. PIKEY ENCAMPMENT -- DAY

                              MICKY

                              TOMMY

                  Ten k.

                              MICKY

                  the bus. I ' l l do it for a caravan.

                              TURKISH

                  A what?

                              MICKY

                  things easier. I want a top caravan.

                              TOMMY

                  It was us that wanted a caravan.-
                  Anyway what's wrong with this one?

                              MICKY

                  It's not for me, it ' s for me Mum.

               Do shut up, where is he now?

                           DOUG

               I don't know Hands, I ' m not his
               mother. But I am seeing him later.

                            HANDS

               When?

                          DOUG

              He wants cash so he's coming back
              after he has been to a fight.
     There is a serious expression of alarm on Hands's face - the
     camera crashes in.

                          HANDS

              What do you mean a fight, you mean a
              boxing match? Is there gambling
              involved?

                             DOUG

               I t ' s a boxing match Hands.
     Hands isn't happy.

                          HANDS

              Did he have a case with him?

                            DOUG

              Yes.

                          HANDS

              And he's gone gambling? That's Franky
              "I have a problem with gambling"
              fuckin Four Fingers, you are talking
              about Doug.

                           DOUG

               What am I, telepathic?

                           HANDS

               Franky is good at buying stones Doug
               but he's a fuckin liability when it
               comes to gambling. That has cost
               me. So in turn rit' s cost him. He
               gets distracted and chopping off a
               digit seems to focus his attention.

25   EXT. AIRPLANE --




     We see the undercarriage of Concorde taking off.

26   INT. BRICK TOP'S PUB --




     Tommy and Turkish walk into a pub and approach the BARMAN.
     They reach the bar.    .            .

                             TURKISH

                 We are here to see Brick Top.
     The barman looks them up and down a bit.      He's not doing
     anything.

                             BARMAN

                 I am very busy at the moment.

                             TURKISH                           ·

                 I am not asking you to break sweat,
               . I am asking you to call Brick Top.

                              BARMAN

                 Who?

                              TURKISH

                 Brick Top.

                             BARMAN

                 Never heard of him.

                       . ... : TURKISH               :

                 Well make a call and see if someone
                 else has. Say it's Turkish.
     The barman looks bothered by the fact he has to move but
     wanders off. Turkish looks at the pool table.

                  You know what he's done to people on
                  that pool table?
     They both give the table an eyeball.




                              TOMMY

                  What, potted more balls than any
                  other player? What else can you do
                  to people on a pool table?

                              TURKISH

                  Quite a fuckin lot if you nail 'em
                  to it.



     TWO HEAVY LOOKING FELLAS appear out of the woodwork.

                              HEAVY FELLA

                  You Turkish?

                               TURKISH

                  Yup.   -

                               HEAVY FELLA

                  Follow me.
     The heavy fella opens up the bar and beckons Turkish and
     Tommy through. They go through another door and the corridor
     turns into a mass of dogs barking, snarling 'and whining in
     cages. The mood is sinister..they reach another door, they
     open up and we are introduced to a dog fight. A load of
     HEAVY GEEZERS are commenting on the performance of the dogs,
     one dog is being carried out by a single leg, it's covered
     in blood. Another dog is left in the ring, it too is covered
     in blood but it's survived.

                               TURKISH

                  They can charm the paint off walls
                  these fellas.

27   INT. BACK OF PUB - DOG FIGHT -- NIGHT

     A circle of blunt faces are exchanging money with one another
     A few faces turn round to examine Tommy and Turkish, they
     frown slightly but carry on about their business once they
     see they are accompanied by the muscle.
     The heavy walks over to Brick Top. The heavy taps him on
     the shoulder and whispers. He acknowledges, and gives his
     drink to the heavy. He walks over. There is a cage next to
     Brick Top which has a pit bull in, and Brick Top who is
     carrying a cane pokes it through the cage doors. The dog
     snarls back.

     He looks at the appalled faces of Turkish and Tommy.

                           BRICK TOP (CONT'D)

               Shits itself when you put it in the
               ring, but poke .it with a stick and
               watch his bollocks grow. You like a
               dog fight, Turkish?

                           TURKISH

               I like my dog to growl at the post
               man.

                           BRICK TOP

               Gorgeous ready for tonight?

                           TURKISH

               We don'c have a Gorgeous anymore.
     Brick Top turns round and indicates that he would like the
     noise around him to drop. It does marginally.

                           BRICK TOP

               You're going to have to repeat that.

                           TURKISH

               We have lost Gorgeous George.
     Brick Top turns round again at the already subdued crowd, he
     doesn't raise his voice but the crowd reacts.

                               BRICK TOP

                  I said keep the noise down.. . .
     A tangible silence between the men reflects Brick Top's
     authority.

                              BRICK TOP (CONT'D)

                  Well, where did you lose him? He
                  isn't a set of fuckin car keys is
                  he? And it's not as though he is
                  inconfuckinspicuous is it?

                              TURKISH

                  I am not backing out.

                              BRICK TOP

                  You can bet your bollocks to a barn
                  dance you're not backing out.

     Brick Top wasn't expecting anything out of Tommy.

                Oh fuck me your lady friend has got

                You won't know him.
     Pause: a look of you're kidding comes over his face.

                Are you taking the piss?

                            TURKISH

                No, there was an accident.

                You've still got your fight.

                            BRICK TOP

                No, I lose all bets at the bookies.
                You can't change fighters at the
                last minute, so no, I don't have my

                            TOMMY

                You could take bets at the fight.

                            BRICK TOP

                Put a lead on her Turkish,     Before
                she gets bitten.
     Pause

       Sol throws a plastic squeaky dog ball that was in the front.
       The dog grabs in and swallows it in one gulp. The brothers
       look on in shock.

       The dog looks up having completed the task. Vin who looks

       is a squeak.

               What do you mean one like it?

                           ALEX

               I got him the Volante.

                           DOUG

               What did I say? What exactly did I
               say?

                           ALEX

               You said get him the Vantage.

                           DOUG

               That's right, I clearly said get him
               the Vantage. So why did you get the
               Volante?                                      ;

                           ALEX

               Because they look the same.

                           DOUG

               The Septuagint scholars mistranslated
               the Hebrew word for "young woman" in
               to the Greek word for "virgin",
               because they thought they looked the
               same, coming up with the prophecy
               "behold a virgin shall conceive and
               bear a son". But there is a world
               of difference between a virgin and a
               young woman like there is between a
               Volante and a fuckin Vantage.
     '.Pause: she thinks about this.

               Are you saying that the fact that
               your cousin Hands is driving a Valiant
               instead of a Vantage is a profound a
               mistake as a whole religion?

     Hands and his sidekick Rosebud are coming out of the sliding
     glass doors towards Doug who's now standing by the car with
     his arms crossed. Hands is quite clearly looking for a car.

     The black guys are sitting in the car still.         The occasional
     squeak comes from the dog.

     is carrying a case.

               Well let's not stand on ceremony,
               let's start the show.
     They get out of the van and go up to the bookies, leaving
     Tyrone in the van. There's a double set of glass doors.
     Sol pushes them open, and Vinny walks in first, while Sol
     hangs back with the shotgun.

32   INT. BOOKIES -- DAY

     Inside is the MAN with the case, busy filling in a slip, and
     TWO CLERKS behind the betting counter. Vinny doesn't mince
     around and goes straight to the counter, where the HEAD CLERK
     PAULINE, comes up to help.

                              PAULINE

                  Yes sir, how can I help?

                  It. belongs to me now.
     Vinny then leans over the counter to get menacing.              Pauline
     looks more than a little concerned

                              VINNY (CONT'D)

                  If you know what's good for...
     He is cut short, as Pauline triggers a button under the
     counter and a security screen comes flying up at a very rapid
     rate of knots protecting all the counters. This has the
     unfortunate consequence of taking Vinny with it. Poor Vin
     is shot straight to the ceiling, all we can see is half a
     body and his desperately searching for ground legs. Needless
     to say this leaves Sol in a bit of a bewildered state. He's
     looking the wrong way at the critical moment and is left
     wondering what happened, not having seen Vince impaled on
     the ceiling. Sol extracts the enormous shotgun.




                           SOL

              Vi nce ? Vince??
     He spins round looking for his colleague. A muffled noise
     tells him to look up.     ,

              the fuck are you doing up there?
     A few groans emanate from the other side of the counter.
     Sol panics some more, and decides that emergency action is
     called for.                               .

                              SOL (CONT'D)

     Sol raises the gun and fires into the side .of- the wall.
     There's an enormous explosion and a clear hole is made in
     the side of the wall. The powerful kick from the gun also
     makes Sol momentarily airborne.

     We see Tyrone grimace at the sound of the shotgun.

     Sol pulls himself together and marches up to the hole in the
     wall that the shot created and pokes the gun through.

                Drop the screen now! You just seen
                what it did to this wall so think
                what it could do to you.
     Pauline knows she has lost this one and looks genuinely
     scared.

               . Do it. . . . I said do it.
     The screen comes down with a thud. This means that Vince
     comes down with just as serious a thud. He lets out another
     groan.

                            SOL

                How you doing Vince?
     A weakened voice retorts.

                            VINNY

                How do I look like I am doing you
                fucking idiot? I would be doing a
                lot better if you would stop using

     Consoled that his colleague is not dead it's back to business
     for Sol. He raises the gun and pulls his fiercest face.

     The man holds his hands up. He has got a perfect set of
     five fingers on both hands. Sol puts his head in his hands.
     Pauline and the other clerk put two bags full of coins on
     the counter. Sol picks them up and frowns, he's not happy
     with a bag full of change. He puts his gun down and starts
     to rifle through the bag. Pauline can see Vinny's pistol on
     the counter, dropped after his encounter with the screen.

     for it too, but he's beaten to it. Sol ducks, pulling Vince

                We're going Vin.
     He grabs the bag of copper coins, grabs Vince and marches
     towards the double'doors. They open the first set and then
     they try to open the second. They push the door nothing
     happens. There is no going back. Sol starts to kick the
     glass door, but it doesn't budge. With panic rising swiftly,
     Sol doesn't fuck around he takes aim with the handgun and
     fires, the bullet shatters the glass but it doesn't break
     through, and the bullet now ricochets off both glass doors
     shattering bullet-proof glass all around them. Vinny's panic
     filled eyes attempt to follow its trajectory. Sol is unaware
     of the ricochet and before Vin has time to warn him, Sol
     fires another bullet. Now he observes the problem and waits
     for the inevitable. The bullet tears through the bag of
     coins, which then empties its contents at Vin's and Sol's
     feet. Eventually the bullet hits poor Vince in the thigh.
     Sol sinks to the floor, he has given up. Amongst the yells

     whimpering.

     They throw him into the van. Just as Sol gets into the back,
     we hear kicking noises on metal from the van behind. Tyrone
     pulls out. And the rear doors of the van behind them fly
     open. Franky Four Fingers appears from the back of this ·

                  Hello, who's your man?
     Hands points out Brick Top who is being crowded by minders.

                              DOUG

                  Horrible bastard, it's his fight,
                  made all his money in.



     He touches the side of his nose and inhales.

                  Original.

                              DOUG

                  So he doesn't need to do this, but
                  he's got dark taste for fights and
                  blood, he wants to impress London's
                  criminal royalty..
     He points out JACK "THE ALL SEEING EYE" and SALT PETER:
     they are surrounded by heavies.

                               DOUG (CONT'D)

                  ..with a tip on when who hits the

                  brains knows Brick Top knows the
                  answer.
     Cut back to Jack and Salt Pete.

                               DOUG (CONT'D)

                  Those boys make Brick top look like
                  a skirt clinging thumb sucker. And
                  i f y o u p l a y wi t h f i r e . . . ·

                   the bone crunching one punch machine
                   gun -- Micky.
     A murky sound of displeasure emanates round the arena.         The
     audience don't know who he is and don't care either.

                   the solo warrior of Walthamstow,

     of forcing blood out of his ears the man is positively out

     Brick Top, Turkish and Tommy etc. All are in shock. The
     ref (who is obviously paid off as well) tries to resuscitate
     Harris/ but it's not happening, he catches a look of
     desperation from one of the villains and is eventually left
     with little choice but to hold Micky's hand up. We cut to
     the nasty looking characters that we saw before they have
     approached with their heavies, and they are obviously not
     satisfied.            .

38   EXT. STREET OUTSIDE BOOKIES -- DAY




     (NB: the first half of this scene happens about midway scene
     28 - as Tyrone parks the van )
     We cut back to Frankie Four Fingers getting out of his van.
     He takes a quick look around and enters the back of his van.
     There he raises the spare tire and picks up his gun, he
     examines it and places it in his trouser front. He then
     turns to exit. At which point there is a loud smash and
     Franky is knocked backwards (as Tyrone hits his van).

     WE CUT TO BLACK.                  '


     WE FADE UP

     (Time-wise, we're now at the end of scene 34)
     Frankie wakes up. He has a trickle of blood dripping down
     the back of his neck, he looks at his watch and panics. He
     kicks the doors a couple of times - nothing happens, but on
     the third kick the doors spring open. Franky brushes himself
     off and makes his way to the bookies.

39   EXT. STREET OUTSIDE BOOKIES --DAY




     We cut to Tyrone. Tyrone clocks the case attached to Franky'
     wrist. Gets out and slams the end of the gun across Franky
     Four Fingers' head. He falls to the ground. Tyrone tries
     to take the case off him but i t ' s handcuffed to his wrist.
     So he has little choice but to pick him up and throw him in
     to the back of the car with the other two.




40   INT. PAWN BROKERS -- DAY

     We cut to the   black guys trying to open the case. They have
     Franky's hand   up on a desk and are fiddling with the handcuff,
     whatever they   are trying to break in with snaps off. Vinny
     is frustrated   and illustrates his dissatisfaction.

                            SOL

               Where ' s the Russian?

                           VINNY

               He should be here in a minute.     Well
               get him to open it.
     Vinny turns to Franky who has tape over his eyes.

                            VINNY (CONT'D)

              Oi, you, Four Fingers, how are we
              going to get into your case?

                           FRANKY THREE FINGERS

               If you take the tape off my eyes ·
               I Ml tell you.

                          SOL

              What do you need the tape off your
              eyes for? You talk out of them?

                 ·        VINNY

              Just tell us the combination.

                          FRANKY THREE FINGERS

              I can't remember the combination I
              can only do it if I see it .
     Pause

                          VINNY

              You look at us and it's good night.
     Vinny takes it off. Franky blinks at the revelation of light.
     And gets busy opening the case .

                            SOL

               Come on.
     He opens it - and it's got about a grand inside.

                            VINNY

              And?

                           FRANKY FOUR FINGERS

               And here's the money.

                              VINNY

                  I don't believe this.      Why are you
                  carrying round a case with this little
                  in it?      .                        .



     Vin turns to Sol and Tyrone who is leaning on the big shotgun
     At which point Franky pulls out the gun from the secret
     compartment in the case.

                              FRANKY FOUR FINGERS

                  Now be a bunch of good fellas and
                  lie down on the floor.



     Tyrone goes for the big gun and Franky pulls the trigger.
     Nothing happens other than a big click, there is silence for
     a long second and the black guys open their tightly shut
     eyes.                                                      :




                              TYRONE

                  Whoops.
     Tyrone also looks into the case and sees the. open secret
     compartment: this also reveals the stone.

                              TYRONE (CONT'D)

                  Hello what have we got here?

41   EXT. PAWN BROKERS

     Boris is admiring the outside of the shop.        He walks in.

42   INT. PAWN BROKERS

     Franky is tied up on a stool, in front of him is the case
     and it's open. Boris waves the black guys to come into the
     corridor so they can talk without being heard.

                              BORIS

                  What are you doing with him?

                              SOL

                  The case was attached to his body.

                              BORIS

                  So why didn't you chop it off?
     Sol looks horrified by the thought.

                              VINNY

                  Err, because we didn't. Now Boris
                  we have or rather you have a problem.

                              BORIS

               half of this.

     Vin holds up the stone: the atmosphere changes.

               What was in the case was mine, what
               was in the bookies was yours, ok
               there wasn't much but, here's ten
               large to help the situation.

                           VINNY

               I am afraid it's too late for that
               Boris.                  -
     He holds up the diamond. Boris1 eyes follow him as he walks
     back into the room where Franky is and puts the diamond back
     into the case while he's talking and changes the combination.

                           VINNY (CONT'D)

               We want half and that's because we
               are being generous. We could by
               rights keep the whole fuckin stone.
     Boris grimaces and pulls out a gun from god knows where, and
     within a second shoots poor Franky in the face. Franky's
     body disappears off the stool that he was sitting on. The
     black guys are stunned into silence.

                           BORIS

               You fuckin idiots. He couldn't know
               who I am. Now open the case and
               give me.the stone.
     The black guys are left with their mouths open, everything
     just changed gear and they weren't expecting that.

                              BORIS (CONT'D)

               Who's next? You have the ten grand
               now give me the stone.
     The pause continues. Boris lets a shot off that tears
     worryingly close to Sol's head.

                  The only man that knows the
                  combination you just shot.
     Boris appears little bothered by this and whips out a four
     foot machete that he was concealing about his person. He
     pulls the case towards him and brings the machete down with
     full force. We can tell by the expression on Tyrone's face
     that it must have been some part of Franky's anatomy.
     Pointing to the ground:

                              BORIS

                  He's your problem now. You can keep
                  the" ten grand along with the body,
                  but if I see you again...well look
                  at him.
     He points to Franky. While he is saying this he bends down
     and picks up the case from the floor and wraps the severed
     arm in newspaper. He then walks out of the shop casual as
     you like.

43   EXT. AMUSEMENT ARCADE LONDON -- MORNING




     Turkish pulls up outside his arcade and has a look around:
     all seems to be clear.

                  them. Keep your eyes peeled.
     Turkish has another look around the back

                              TURKISH (CONT'D)

     He walks into his office, has a quick look around and makes
     his way to the safe under the floor. He decides to put the
     kettle on, does so, and his attention is caught by something,
     he looks at the cups on the side and sees that one is waiting
     to be made. He stands back and looks at the cupboards he
     sees that they are all open. Then he sees that the kettle
     is already boiled.

              we want are we Errol?
     Errol shakes his head slowly.       Turkish's phone rings.   They
     let it ring for a while.

                              ERROL

                  Well aren't you going to answer it?
     Turkish does.

     Turkish puts down the phone

              What's happening with the tea?

47   EXT. PORTACABIN




     The film stock is 1970s, and things seem more dated. This
     is confirmed by the dress of our man TONY. Tony is standing
     outside a scrap metal yard and he is kicking the door of a
     portacabin.                                             ..

                              TONY

                  Open up Charlie.

                             CHARLIE

                  Fuck off. The only thing I'11 open
                  up is you.

                                TONY

                  I t ' s lucky you .got me Charlie, it
                  could have been one of the other
                  lads, and then think how much trouble
                  you' d be in.

                              CHARLIE

                  You come through that door and you'll
                  be going out prostrate.

                              TONY

                  It doesn't belong to you Charlie.
     He kicks open the door. CHARLIE is standing behind his desk
     holding a pistol directly at Tony. On the table is a bag of
     what we must believe is coke, it's open, and Charlie has it
     all over his nose.                     .

                              TONY (CONT'D)

                  You silly fucker, you can't go running
                  off with other people's gear. How
                  much you put up your nose?
     Charlie opens up, he fires four shots straight into Tony who
     buckles and falls to the floor. Tony seems only shaken and
     he holds his hands out to inspect them, he's bleeding.

                              TONY (CONT'D)

                  Oh you silly cunt.
     Tony stands and walks towards Charlie. Charlie is
     understandably shocked and fires another. It goes straight
     through Tony and we see the blood hit the wall behind.

                              CHARLIE

                  Go down-boy, go down.




                                                (CONTINUED)





47   CONTINUED:

     Tony keeps going for him. Charlie raises the gun and points
     it at Tony's face and fires the last shot. The bullet goes
     straight into his mouth but it went in at an angle and it
     exits his cheek. Tony is standing there with six. bullet
     holes in him and bleeding all over the carpet. As he talks
     blood courses its way down his front and a strong lisp is
     frustrating the words.

                              TONY

                  Ohh you'f in twouble nowf.



     Tony slowly extracts a short sword from behind him. Fear
     has set into Charlie's face and has rendered him useless.

     Errol is curb crawling down a particularly seedy street in a

     big ears and a moody haircut, who smokes fat cheap cigars
     and wears his top shirt button fastened.

52   EXT. FIELD

     Turkish and Tommy have found Micky who is in the middle of a
     field and is betting on with various dodgy characters.

                               TURKISH

                  Well do you want to do it?

                              MICKY

                  That depends.

                              TURKISH

                  On what?

                              MICKY

                  On you buying this caravan.
     He pulls out a catalogue on fancy caravans and points to the
     picture of the Rolls Royce of caravans.

                              TURKISH

                  That's not the same caravan.

                              MICKY

                  This isn't the same fight.

                  last one.

                              MICKY

                  The fight is twice the size. And my
                  mum still needs a new caravan.




                              TURKISH

                  Micky you are lucky we aren't worm
                  food after your performance, I think
                  buying a tart's mobile palace is a
                  little fuckin rich.



     There is a pause while Micky frowns.       Turkish looks a little
     sheepish.

                              TURKISH (CONT'D)

                  I didn't mean that your mum was a
                  tart. I just meant...

               Save your breath for cooling your
               porridge. I'll bet you for it.

                           TURKISH

               What like Tommy did last time? Do
               me a favour?

                             MICKY

               I ' l l do you a favour, you have first     ,
               bet. If I win I get the caravan, if
               I lose I'l l do the fight for free.
     Turkish considers this, uneasily.       He looks at the dogs they
     look keen and fit.

                              TURKISH

                  Okay, I reckon the hare gets caught.
     But he's in. Gypsy Romany Music starts. Cut to slow motion,
     CU of dogs' enthusiasm, CU of pikeys and their fingers
     skillfully dealing in money, inhaling cigarettes, etc.

     playing the game.

62   EXT. FIELD




     The dogs are moving in.

63   INT. DOG HOUSE




     A door is opened and Tyrone is thrown in. A rabid Neapolitan
     mastiff pitbull hybrid that is attached to the end of a long
     pole with a lasso at the other end is brought in, it will
     quite clearly savage anything in its way.

                  There is something very wrong with
                  this, it was us that wanted to buy a
                  caravan off him.

                              TURKISH

                  Why didn't you "bus a cap in his
                  ass" then Tommy? Mind you, you would
                  do more damage if you threw it at
                  him.

                  Oh no Tommy I wasn't saying you can't
                  shoot, I know you can't shoot. What
                  I was saying is that six pound piece
                  of shit stuck in your trousers there
                  would do more damage if you fed it
                  to em.

                  Are you saying it doesn't work?

              through a body that weighs two hundred
              pounds in about eight minutes that

               dissidents, killed more men
               than,...well he's-killed a lot of
               men. Deals in arms, that he gets
               off some of the old school.
     We cut to the security monitor that observes the shop, it
     sits on Doug's desk. The door opens and in walks Boris. As
     bold as brass he walks up to the counter.

                               DOUG

                  Hold on.   What's going on here?
     Doug picks up the phone to the downstairs shop.      Susi picks
     up the receiver at the other end.

                               SUSI

     Hands and BTT both look at Rose Bud and look relieved for
     the offer.

               He's all yours Rose Bud.

81   EXT. CARAVAN CAMP SITE

     Micky is looking at his caravan; it's in flames, real proper
     roaring flames. People are desperately trying to put the
     flames out. Micky is covered in dirt from his futile efforts.
     One of the other pikies who's involved in trying to extinguish
     the fire turns round and sees Micky standing there motionless.
     He can see he's upset.

                           PATRICK

               What's wrong with Micky?

                           DAREN

               His mam was in there Patrick.   They
               burnt his mam.
     All real sound recedes and we drift in to music. The camera
     slowly tracks in on Micky. It's hard to read how devastated
     he is. The camera reaches Micky's face, the reflections of
     the flames can be seen in his water swollen eyes, but his
     cheeks remain dry.         .

82   INT. BTT CAR

     BTT is driving, Hands in the passenger seat and Rose Bud in

     BTT looks at the blood that's already starting to pierce the

      Sol looks at the gun and frowns, "what does he know about
      replicas"? He pulls the trigger. He fires one shot. It is
      very loud, the gun goes off near Tyrone's ear, he buckles in
     . pain. The car does a massive swerve and everything nearly
      ends in disaster, all the windows shatter including the
      windshield (but the glass stays put). Tyrone regains some
      control over the car.

     Tyrone spins in his seat and answers a little too loudly.

                  back there.
     He points to behind a seat: there is a bloody great sword
     concealed. Tony skillfully passes the sword to Rose Budd,
     who attempts to pull it out of its scabbard. Tony turns
     round to Hands.

                              BTT (CONT'D)

                  It's not a fuckin rocket launcher.
                  It's a knife for gods sake, what
                  have you used for to keep your fork
                  company for all these years? It's
                  got a sharp side and a blunt side.
                  You want a lesson?
     There is a sudden bang on the windshield and BTT turns back
     to the front only to see the windshield covered in milk.
     Tony can't see where he is going and searches for the
     windshield wipers. While this is happening the car swerves
     to the side and hits a lamp post. They crash and the boot
      (trunk) has flown open and Boris the Blade tries to lift
     himself out. Rose Bud looks down at the sword he has been
     extracting he can see he very nearly cut himself in two.
     Tony pulls himself up from the steering wheel he has a trickle
     of blood running down his face. There's a crash and a car
     hits em from behind.

      lets go of it.

                            BTT

                I am talking for your benefit. Now
                dicks have drive, and clarity of
                vision.
      Tony starts to build himself a complicated looking weapon
      under the table, unseen by the black guys. He takes bits
      out of one sock and bits out of another sock.

                             BTT (CONT'D)

                But they're not clever, they smell
                pussy, and they want a piece of the
                action, and the dimmer the dick, the
                less he cares about the consequences,
                and you thought you smelt gooood ol
                pussy, and have brought your little
                mincy faggot balls along for a gooood
                ol time, but you have got your parties
                muddled up, there is no pussy here,
                just a dose to make you wish you
                were born a woman.. . .
      We cut to the shell shocked brothers, and the almost
      completely built weapon.

                             BTT (CONT'D)

                And just like a prick, you are having
                second thoughts; you're shrinking,
                and your little balls are shrinking
                with you.
      They stare on. The brothers have lost this one and they
      know it. They start to reverse. BTT lets the odd chicken
      cluck out the corner of his mouth, Vinny misses his step and
      waves his gun about in a futile effort to look mean. They
      back away into the corridor down to the back door of the
      cf. . .

 107   INT. CORRIDOR -- CONTINUOUS

       ...and just as they turn the corner they bump into Hands
       still drying his hands, they can see that he's carrying a
       case that they recognize. The brothers adapt to their new
       scenario:

                               VINNY

                 Pass it me.
       Hands hesitates.

 108   INT. CAFE.-- CONTINUOUS




       BTT can hear that the black guys and Hands have run into
       each other and pulls out the complicated looking gun which
       is now in one piece. BTT cocks the gun and aims it at the
       wall which the brothers would be behind, he follows the wall
       simulating the speed of their journey.

                 I won't ask again
       He raises his gun. A covey of bullets perforates the wall,
       one hitting Vin in the hand. The brothers take the
       opportunity to duck. Hands dives for cover too and drops
       the bag. A continuation of bullets comes flying through the
       wall. The black guys take the opportunity to pick the bag
       up and leg it.

 111   INT. BRICK TOP'S PUB




       The brothers are standing in front of Brick Top, they move
       uneasily from foot to foot. Brick Top examines the stone.
       He looks up.




                             BRICK TOP

      They turn and Errol is waiting for them.

                             ERROL

                Follow me.
      They go out of one room into another, and Errol shuts the
      door behind them. Vin looks uncomfortable. Another door is
      opened and a man brings out Lincoln. Lincoln is in bad shape
      and is relieved to see familiar faces, they are now shut in
      a room .

                             SOL

                You alright Lincoln?

                            ERROL

                It's because of stories. I am sure
                you've heard one or two of those
                stories. For example, did you hear
                about the three black fellas that
                did a very bad thing, however they
                made some effort to redeem that very
                bad thing, so the governor saw fit
                not to kill em. He thought it would
                be a more advantageous concept to
                let them kill each other and let the
                survivor live to tell the tale.
                That way everybody wins, well, all
                except the two that died of course.
      We look at the table where we see three large kitchen knives
      sitting provocatively. Tyrone rushes for one of the blades
      grabs it and runs at Vin, Vin sidesteps and Tyrone keeps
      running straight into the arms of Errol who raises his gun
      at the last moment. Tyrone slides the blade into Errol 's
      ribs and Errol fires a shot straight at Tyrone. The bullet
      passes through Tyrone and hits John in the throat . Vin,
      Lincoln and Sol are left wondering what the fuck has just
      happened .

      There is a wake in motion. We cut to Micky and Turkish. It
      is obvious that a lot of hard core drinking has been going
      on, and there is an Irish band playing. The is a coffin in
      the middle of a caravan that is closed for obvious reasons
      i t ' s surrounded by heavy looking lads. The is a man dancing
      on one of the tables.

                 Do shut up Ken.   That was a bit
                 naughty Tony.
      Tony shrugs. Brick Top puts his hands in to his pocket and
      withdraws the stone. We cut to Hand's expression.

                 Well come on, let's have a look.
      Brick Top passes the stone to Hands. All goes quiet while
      everybody focuses on the stone. Hands lifts it up to his
      eye.

117 ' INT. VAN -- NIGHT

      We fade out of black to Micky's pov. Thisis shot in slow
      motion. Micky opens his eyes, in the backof.a large van,
      there is only one faint light that moodilyilluminates his
      tired eyes.

                            TURKISH

118   INT. WAREHOUSE                                -    '

      A temporary ring has   been erected, four scaffolding posts
      with welded on hoops   make the arena, the ropes that are
      threaded through the   hoops are industrial nylon and free of
      padding. Around the    ropes it's starting to fill. Brick Top
      approaches Salt Pete   and Jack 'the all seeing eye'.

                            SALT, PETER

                I hope we gonna get a better show

119   INT. BACK OF WAREHOUSE




      Brick Top is standing in front of Micky whose eyes are still
      semi open.

                            BRICK TOP

                What's wrong with you? You stoned?
                Is he fuckin stoned?

                He's like that before a fight.
      He turns his attention to Micky.

                           BRICK TOP

               Now you know when you're going down?

                              TURKISH

               Of course he knows when he's going
               down.

                           KEN

               Hey fuck face, who's speaking to
               you? He asked him didn't he?

               to use that one next time -I want to

                           BRICK TOP

               There's a campsite full of pikies
               that might not think you're so fuckin
               funny when they 'are putting the flames
               out on their children's backs.
      Cut to a shot of Brick Top's boys lighting a cigarette in
      the car outside the pikies.




120   INT. WAREHOUSE

      Micky appears from a small door at the back of the warehouse.
      He approaches the ring accompanied with shouts of
      encouragement and counter shouts. He's wearing a pair of
      semi cut tracksuit bottoms and a t-shirt with grease marks
      down the front. Turkish walks behind him, Micky still looks
      bored. He climbs into the ring. Then from the same door as
      the one through Micky came out walks a larger character with
      a nose that appears to have seen countless rounds with a
      frying pan: HORACE 'GOOD NIGHT1 ANDERSON.

                            THE REFF

                Alright lads no eye gouging no biting.
                Do your worst. Back to your corners.



      We drift again into Micky's pov, his world is becoming more
      and more surreal. He can faintly hear Turkish whispering
      words to him, but he's not really listening. A bell comes
      from somewhere, and Micky instinctively walks to the center
      of the ring. "Good night" is already there, they pace one
      another for a second or two, Micky avoids a punch or two and
      then he takes a hard one and he knows it, we flash to white,
      Micky's in trouble: he lets one of his missiles go and BANG
      it shakes "good night" to his core, all goes quiet. We go
      to super slow motion: his knees buckle and "good night" is
      in trouble. Micky maintains a frown as he watches his
      opponent's knees threaten to betray him. The crowd tries to
      digest what is happening. After a period of silence reality
      dawns. Brick Top mouths the words in silence."Don1t go down
      you fucker". The crowd wants Micky to finish the job. But
      common sense reins back the coup de grace. "Good night"
      eventually regains control of his legs and stumbles forward,
      after a few sleepy punches he starts to provide a serious
      onslaught.




                            TURKISH

                I don't like the look of this Tommy,
                bring the van up to the back door.
      This goes on for two rounds (which is montage down to a few
      seconds). We go in the mind of poor Micky. We break the
      music just as it's starting to look dangerous... The bell
      goes and Micky walks to the wrong corner. Turkish pulls him
      back to his corner.

                            TURKISH (CONT'D)

               They are on ya. You got to hurt him
               Micky. Otherwise we are
               rumbled.... you hear me Micky? Do
               -something, it looks like it' s rigged.
      Micky goes out again his hands are low, BANG there is a flash
      of white as Micky goes down in the dirt. Dust rises from
      where he fell. He gets up quickly, his hands are still low,
      BANG he goes down again, in no time he's up.




                                              (CONTINUED)





120   CONTINUED:    -

      BANG: he hits the ground again and this time when he hits
      the deck, he penetrates the dust covered floor, like i t ' s
      made out of water. He falls through the water like he's
      sinking; his eyes are open and he can't breathe, he continues
      to fall, but he's unpanicked (he is now Micky 1). When Micky
      1 looks up he can see himself in the corner of the ring takin
      kidney punches from Good Night, he's winded and only semi-
      conscious (this is Micky 2). Micky 1 makes the effort to
      swim up and tries to penetrate the floor but he's stuck he
      can't get through. Micky 2 takes more punishment in the
      ring, as Micky 1 ' s hand continues to try to break the
      underside of the floor but it stretches like rubber and forces
      Micky 1 down again. Micky 1 looks up again and sees how
      much trouble Micky 2 ' s in the ring. Micky 1 is panicking
      now, he's running out of oxygen and Micky 2's being beaten,
      Micky 1 starts -to sink again but now flames tickle the bottom
      of his feet he looks up. and sees Micky 2 being smashed to
      hell, his body eventually collapses and Micky 2 falls through
      the floor. And as the latter falls through, Micky 1 manages
      to rise from the depths and his punch manages to perforate
      the surface. The punch continues its trajectory and has the
      power to fell a red blooded rhino.... it catches "Good Night"
      on the jaw and it's good night for "Good Night" it's unlikely
      that he'll awake in the next hour. Dear oh dear everybody
      is in trouble.



      Again we cut to the reactions of the relevant parties.

                               TURKISH (CONT'D)

                   Tommy get the van.




                               TOMMY

                   I have it, it's waiting.
      Turkish jumps into the ring and grabs Micky.

                               TURKISH

                   We are off Micky, hold tight, and
                   move quickly. ,
      Turkish pulls Micky away. It's not as hard as it might be
      trying to get out, because the crowd seems to have found its
      own disputes, chairs start to fly. Brick Top's boys are
      frustrated in the mayhem. Brick Top calmly dials into his
      mobile telephone. It rings.

                                                                     1

121   CONTINUED:

      We pull back to see four slumped heads in the car and blood
      staining the windscreen. Brick Top calmly puts the phone
      down.

                               BRICK TOP

                   Right lets get outta here.
      Brick Top is looking every which way and trying to get out
      of there, accompanied by Ken.

                               BRICK TOP (CONT.'D)

                   Where's the car Ken?




                                  KEN

                   I t ' s coming now.

                               BRICK TOP

                   We are outta here.
      They come out of a side entrance, their car pulls round the
      corner and screeches to a halt. Brick Top opens the door as
      he is about to get in, he's eyes widen to the size of saucers
      as FOUR MEN (who we recognize from the wake) are sitting in
      the place of his driver. They both have sawed-off shotguns
      and empty four barrels into the chest of Brick Top and Ken.
      The car spins away, leaving their twitching bodies on the
      dirt.

                                                                       :

                 What dp I do?

                              HANDS

                  Let me take a wild and reckless guess.
                  Stick a knife in his guts and see if
                  it's got a diamond in there? I'll
                  hold it still and'you open it up.
      Tony looks positively unsure and rocks his head from side to
      side.

                              BTT

                  Fuckin hell, alright then.

                              VINNY

                  You can't do that.

                             HANDS

                 Well do it to you as well if it makes
                 you feel any better.
      Cut to Tony having some problems trying to get hold of the
      awkward dog. The dog starts to squeak. Tony passes the
      blade to Hands.

                                BTT

                 I t ' s squeaking.

                               HANDS

                 What, you've never heard a dog squeak
                 before?... Hold him still.
      The dog isn't sure about this either.      Vin is in a panic and
      suddenly.

                            VINNY

                 Stop! I can see it.   I can see the
                 stone.
      Hands at the point of entry stops. Vinny hops over to the
      stone and picks it up. Tony lets the dog stand but keeps a
      grip oh the collar. The dog is relieved to be semi-liberated.
      Hands is still on his knees armed with an incredulous stare.

                             HANDS

                 Well let's see it.
      Vinny holds it up. There's a sense of relief. He then throws
      the stone, it cuts through the air. And the dog seeing
      .another projectile runs to intercept it. There's a pause
      while all now focus again on the dog. This is digested
      literally and mentally. The dog recognizes all the attention
      it's receiving. And goes through the motions of swallowing
      it. Hands attempts an approach. The dog understandably
      feels uncomfortable about the advancing vanguard and decides
      emergency action is needed, and seeing the open window
      launches itself out of it.

                   they? And I can't see a dog can
                   you?

                                VINNY

                   They can't be far.

125   INT. CAR

      Hands, BTT and the black guys are back on the road.

                               HANDS

                   You gonna have to come up with
                   something.
      Just then they see some caravans in the distance.

                               VINNY

                   There they are.

126   INT. NEW CARAVAN CAMP SITE

      All the caravans are fastened to the back of cars. Vinny,
      Sol, BTT and Hands are standing in front of Micky.

                             MICKY

                 Well he's didn't come back to us.

                               VINNY

                   But he always came back.

                             MICKY

                 Well you might have noticed that we
                 have moved, you should have fed him
                 more, a dog will never leave you if
                 you feed it properly. It was a good
                 dog, he had a little flatulence
                 problem but was a good dog.

                               HANDS

                   Are you sure he's not here?

                               MICKY

                   I think I would have noticed if a
                   fuckin dog was sitting in my caravan
                   don't you? Tommy, Turkish, have you
                   seen a dog sitting in me caravan?

                               TURKISH

                   I can't say I have Micky.

                               MICKY

                   See there you have it.

                               MICKY

                   What the fuck's got into you lot?
                   It's only a dog. I'l l give you
                   another one, if it means that much
                   to you.

127   EXT. CARAVAN CAMP SITE

      Vinny, Sol, BTT and Hands descend the steps, they look like
      children with their toys taken away.

                             HANDS

                 You better find me that dog, skinny
                 Vinny.



      One of Micky's kids is on the bottom of the caravan steps as
      the brothers walk by.

                              . KID 1

                   I looked after your car for ya.

                               HANDS

                 So?

                             KID 1

                 So aren't you gonna pay me?

                             BTT

                 Yeah bollocks.

                             KID 1

                             VINNY

                 Watch your mouth you cheeky shite.

                             KID 1

                 Yeah fuck ya.
      The kid turns away and goes back to squeezing a toy.   All
      four of the chaps stop in their tracks.
      Cut to shot of squeaky toy. We have seen this toy before.
      Cut to freeze frame of Sol, Vin, BTT and Hands stopped dead
      in their .tracks. They haven't turned to look over their
      shoulders yet, but their eyes are turning to look.

FADE IN:

INT.  MIKE'S HOUSE - QUEENS - EARLY EVENING

Winter.  A celebration.  Close friends, cop friends,
family all here to celebrate patrolman MIKE KEEGAN'S
promotion to detective, NYPD.

The party spills through the house -- front room, dining
room, kitchen, with a small fenced backyard visible beyond
that.  A community of cops on their off-hours, their
wives, kids.  A mix of generations, all the way from
MIKE'S kid, TOMMY, and his FRIENDS, playing among the
adults, to an elderly woman observing quietly from her
chair at the side.  The mood's warm, spirited; there's a
lot of friendship here.

ANGLE:  MIKE, in the dining room, posing for a photo with
his ten-year-old son, TOMMY, proudly displaying his new
gold detective's SHIELD pinned to his jersey.

                         MIKE
                  (calling to his
                   wife, for a family
                   portrait)
          Ellie!  C'mon!  Over here!

ANGLE:  ELLIE, MIKE'S wife of fifteen years, a local
product, bright and lively, and clearly proud as hell of
her man.  She frees herself from the crush of friends,
hurrying to join him.

ANGLE:  MIKE, ELLIE giving him a full-mouthed smack on the
lips as he hooks her into his arms.

The picture's snapped, to a chorus of hoots and hollers.
Behind, a banner and poster blowup of Mike in gun and
uniform read:  "FINALLY THEY'VE RECOGNIZED YOU, DETECTIVE
KEEGAN."

SCOTTY, a patrolman with the 117th and one of MIKE'S best
pals, puts his hand vigorously, in congratulations, on
MIKE'S SHOULDER.

                         SCOTTY
                  (to Mike)
          No joke?  You're being transferred
          to the 19th as your first
          assignment?  Who the hell loves your
          ass downtown?

                         ROOKIE
                  (naively)
          What's the 21st?

BROOKLYN, a cop about Mike's age, joins in.

                         SCOTTY
          What d'you care?  You'll never know.

                         BROOKLYN
          Manhattan.  The Upper East Side,
          East 59th to 96th.

The ROOKIE stares, impressed.

                         SCOTTY
                  (to the others)
          Remember Curran from the Sixteenth?
          He posted a coupla months there on a
          floater outside the French embassy.
          He met Jackie Kennedy.

                         BROOKLYN
          Curran, that fuckin' noodlehead.  He
          probably wrote her up for letting
          her dog dump on Rockefeller's
          doorstep.

ANGLE ON MIKE, trying to swallow a mouthful of potato
salad as a plump and pretty middle-aged woman (HELEN
GREENING) pulls him into a bear hug, planting a kiss on
him.

                         HELEN
          Mmmmmm-glimmmeee-kisss!  I'm so
          proud of you!  What the hell took
          you so long?

                         MIKE
          Hey, don't ask me.  Ask the man who
          put in the good word.

ANGLE ON T.J. GREENING, Helen's husband, Mike's best
friend.  He's forty, stocky, looks up, horsing around with
some of the kids in the next room.

                         MIKE
          If T.J. didn't push for me, I never
          would've made it.

                         BROOKLYN
          Bet your ass... I give you six weeks
          before you're back on the beat,
          Keegan, they got no room for hero
          cops...

                         MIKE
          Appreciate, that vote of confidence,
          Brook.

                         BROOKLYN
          Hey, am I supportive, or what?

ANGLE ON TOMMY:  in the hallway, trying to show SCOTTY'S
date -- a "real" BIMBO, who's spilling out of her woolly
sweater and tight jeans -- how to stand on his SKATEBOARD.
She shrieks a laugh, toppling off.  HELEN, passing by with
an empty platter, catches the action.


INT.  KITCHEN - SAME

ELLIE, another WIFE at the sink, wives all; HELEN enters.

                         HELEN
          He left Elaine for that?

                         WIFE #1
          And what about little Scotty?

ELLIE continues washing the dishes as HELEN and the WIFE
dry.  MIKE enters to get more beers.

                         HELEN
                  (still staring)
          I'd like to tie her tits together.

                         ELLIE
          That wouldn't be too difficult.

                         MIKE
                  (overhearing)
          I bet you think she doesn't have a
          brain in her head.  I bet you think
          the only thing he sees in her is one
          incredible, dynamite body...

He GRINS at their blank stares... ELLIE'S EYES wryly
following... as he moves on out with his beers.

                         HELEN
          I love your husband, Ellie, but he's
          a real dork.

                         ELLIE
          Yeah, but he's my dork.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

INT.  MIKE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Night has descended, PEOPLE talking and laughing quietly,
MELLOW music is playing -- CAMERA FINDING MIKE AND ELLIE,
dancing close, moving sensually.  It's impressive.  HELEN
convinces T.J. to DANCE.  SCOTTY and BIMBO join in too.
T.J., whipped, extricates himself and Helen; tousling
Mike's hair in affection.

                         T.J.
          We're goin'.  Get some sleep,
          Detective Keegan.  You got a new job
          tomorrow.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT

MIKE is holding TOMMY asleep on his shoulder.

ELLIE appears, completing the family portrait.

                         MIKE
                  (a whisper)
          Think I should put the skateboard in
          bed with him?

                         ELLIE
          Too kinky.

MIKE smiles and climbs the stairs.


INT.  MIKE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

ELLIE in the bathroom, the door open, she brushes her
hair.

MIKE in bed, thoughtful, a happy man.

                         MIKE
          Ellie, you know I think it's about
          time we got outa this place, get us
          a house of our own.  We can afford
          it now.

                         ELLIE
          Amen to that.  The supermarket's
          full of assholes.

                         MIKE
          Take my advice, don't buy any...

MIKE waits for a response.  None comes.

                         ELLIE
          Mike?

                         MIKE
                  (aware of her change
                   in tone)
          What?

                         ELLIE
          My ass if falling.

                         MIKE
          Your what...?

                         ELLIE
          My ass is falling.  It is.

                         MIKE
                  (a laugh)
          What are you talking about?

                         ELLIE
                  (appears in the door;
                   stricken)
          I just saw it in the mirror, it
          doesn't look like my ass anymore.

                         MIKE
          Get in bed.

                         ELLIE
          What am I gonna do?  I jog, I do the
          exercises on TV in the morning...
          gravity...

                         MIKE
          You got a great ass!  I love your
          ass -- now get that falling ass into
          bed before it hits the floor.

She does -- the lights snap put.  They giggle, she MOVING
into his arms.

                         ELLIE
                  (a declaration)
          Tomorrow, I start looking for our
          house... You love me?

                         MIKE
                  (deeply)
          You got no idea...

                         ELLIE
          Imagine... I'm sleepin' with a DT.

Another muted laugh -- and they move into an EMBRACE,
CAMERA PANNING WITH THEM, and then STILL FARTHER INTO THE
DARKNESS.

THE DARKNESS HOLDS.


EXT.  EAST RIVER - (AERIAL) - NIGHT

... Becoming a darkness pricked with light, as WE FLOAT
over the reflective river, MOVING WEST TOWARD AND OVER THE
CITY.


EXT.  MANHATTAN - (AERIAL CONTINUED) - NIGHT

The fabled city, the ultimate object of man's desire and
fulfillment, Oz, the city unfolding itself before and
beneath us, till DAZZLING SHAFTS OF LIGHT sizzling up --
KLEIG LIGHTS -- stab our eyes and bring us down into their
BLINDING BRIGHTNESS...


EXT.  CLUB - MIDTOWN - NIGHT

A nondescript piece of rundown city block that's the
hottest thing in town.  PERSONNEL regulate the CROWD and
ARRIVALS.  There is a public line, and from it the young,
hip and outrageous can look on while awaiting entrance at
the formally dressed, stylishly gowned GUESTS arriving at
the private line.

A glittering post-Metropolitan Museum of Art opening gala
is in progress tonight.  The club's private entrance looks
like what it once was, a shuttered porno bookstore, and
the joke's not lost on most of the formal GUESTS, arriving
through the X-rated doorway.


INT.  CLUB - NIGHT

The latest achievement of money, rock and art.  It's a
breathtaking multi-leveled theater of light, sound and
dance.

There is also an entrance-by-invitation-only grand salon.

ANGLE

The GUESTS arriving here for the Met gala enter almost in
enchanted procession, each of them being personally
greeted by the primary owner and manager of the club, WIN
HOCKINGS, a charming, rakish ex-preppy.  WIN stands in the
middle of the floor in the throw of a spot, greeting.
This is his element and his club, a son of old money, and
a crossover creature to the fast life.

                         WIN
          Hi... nice to see you... thank
          you... my pleasure...

                         A MET BENEFACTRESS
                  (effusively)
          Thank you so much for agreeing to
          host us tonight.  It's really
          extraordinary!

                         WIN
          Glad I could be of help.

CAMERA MOVING IN ON A NEW ANGLE, CLAIRE GREGORY and NEIL
STEINHART.  The way our CAMERA covers them makes it clear
they are major characters in our story.  NEIL steps
forward to introduce himself, but WIN, looking up, spots
CLAIRE first:  A special beauty and clearly someone very
special to him...

                         WIN
          Claire!

                         CLAIRE
          Hello, Win.

And he embraces her.

                         CLAIRE
                  (introducing her
                   companion)
          You know Neil Steinhart?

He grins broadly, taking NEIL'S hand; then right back to
CLAIRE.

                         WIN
          Of the filthy rich Steinharts?  Why
          is it Claire always connects with
          the richest men this side of Saudi?

                         NEIL
                  (to Win; meaning the
                   club)
          This gives new meaning to the word
          nightlife.

WIN acknowledges the obligatory compliment with a closed
smile, impatiently returning to CLAIRE:

                         WIN
          C'mon, let's get outa this lowbrow
          rag trade...
                  (smiles, cutting
                   Neil out)
          You don't mind, do you?

NEIL stares, polite, as WIN whisks her away; turning, as
he is addressed by someone else coming his way.


EXT.  THE CLUB - NIGHT

as a BLACK PORSCHE PULLS UP, its dark-tinted window
rolling down TO REVEAL JOEY VENZA.  The MANAGER of the
club comes over to him, with a clipboard list of only the
invitees.

                         MANAGER
                  (a dilemma)
          I'm sorry, Mr. Venza...

VENZA jams the ACCELERATOR to the FLOOR, the CAR burning
rubber like a DRAGSTER as PEOPLE SQUEAL and JUMP OUT of
the way; the CAR fish-tailing away, screeching AROUND the
CORNER.


INT.  CLUB - NIGHT

WIN and CLAIRE.  The music, noise, other conversations can
still be heard as they walk through the club.

He smiles, mid-conversation; there's a real affection
here.

                         WIN
          Skiddy and Kit?  I haven't seen them
          since that shitty pasta dinner on
          the cape.

                         CLAIRE
          They've got two monsters now.  Both
          boys.

                         WIN
          And so what's with Steinhart?  Is it
          serious?

                         CLAIRE
          You didn't like him?

                         WIN
          Looks a little constipated to me.

                         CLAIRE
                  (needling him)
          It's called "solid"... Nice to find
          someone you can count on, Win.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  BASEMENT - REAR - ENTRANCE - NIGHT

VENZA entering, a rush, NOISE and ACTIVITY from the alley
outside; the throbbing new MUSIC overhead.

JOEY VENZA

Immaculate as always, in a conservatively-cut European
pinstripe, VENZA strides tautly into the shabby corridors.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  MEZZANINE - MAIN BAR - NIGHT

WIN shows CLAIRE the main dance floor below, sound-filled
and crowded, private and paying GUESTS mixing,
indistinguishable now.  He raises his voice to be heard.

                         WIN
          The main floor stays public.  The
          side rooms we try to keep available
          for special functions like tonight.

He turns and takes her arm.

                         CLAIRE
          It's terrific Win.

                         WIN
          You still writing the occasional
          magazine article?

                         CLAIRE
          Occasionally.

                         WIN
          Then c'mon.  Follow me.  The art's in
          the basement, you're going to get a
          privileged peek.

He leads her to the freight elevator.

                         VOICE (O.S.)
          Claire!

A sociable FOURSOME descends on them.  It looks like it's
going to be a long conversation.

                         WIN
                  (to Claire, quietly)
          Just press the button all the way
          down when you're ready, okay?

He turns as she's engulfed, heading towards the elevator,
runs into NEIL, CLAIRE'S escort.  NEIL doesn't see her.

                         NEIL
          Where's she go?

                         WIN
          Probably found somebody nicer...
          Kidding.  You're great.

He smiles, entering the elevator and disappearing from
view.  NEIL looking around, with thinly-veiled impatience,
at the benefit-types streaming into the room.


INT.  BASEMENT TUNNELS - NIGHT

VENZA navigates the labyrinth that connects to the
offices.


INT.  BASEMENT - NIGHT

The elevator reaches bottom.  WIN exits into an area of
tall rows of stacked boxes still awaiting unloading.
Beyond, a bright, high-ceilinged linen whiteness gleams.

It's a soon-to-be restaurant-gallery area.

THE RESTAURANT GALLERY

The walls have already been painted white.  Tables have
been positioned.  Chairs are stacked, waiting.  So are
mounds of folded laundry and tablecloths, boxes of
accessories, glass and dish and kitchenware, etc.

Except for FRED, the elderly stock boy, the bright silence
is empty.

FRED scores open the sealed cardboard cartons with a
curved case cutter.  Several tablefuls of unloaded
servers, kitchen utensils, etc., bear witness to the size
of his job.

                         WIN
          You're in overtime, Freddy.

FRED nods, putting down his case cutter, using a side
exit.

WIN, left alone, turns to look up proudly at his
powerhouse modern art collection lining the wall.


INT.  MEZZANINE - NEAR ELEVATOR - NIGHT

CLAIRE extricating herself; to the foursome.

                         CLAIRE
          I will... I promise...

She smiles graciously and steps into the freight elevator,
pushing the down button.  The doors close.


INT.  BASEMENT TUNNELS - NIGHT

VENZA approaches an intersection.  Ahead, FRED crosses on
his way to the offices.  The elderly STOCK BOY doesn't see
VENZA, but VENZA sees him, realizing where else to look
here.


INT.  FREIGHT ELEVATOR - NIGHT

CLAIRE closes her eyes, leaning back against the metal
walls, taking advantage of the refuge for the moment.
Music and crowd noise still vibrate.  The elevator,
shuddering, continues its descent.


INT.  RESTAURANT - NIGHT

WIN turns in the silence, looking out over the bright
space edged by darkness, every reason to be pleased.

WIN doesn't even hear VENZA enter.

                         VENZA
                  (bear, icily)
          You need money, you come to me.

WIN turns.

                         VENZA
                  (approaching,
                   soundlessly)
          Who the fuck do you think you are,
          raising cash without coming to me?

                         WIN
                  (calmer)
          Your ex-partner... I'm buying you
          out, Joey.  Read the contract.
          There's ample provision.

                         VENZA
          Fuck the contract!


INT.  ELEVATOR - BASEMENT - NIGHT

The elevator arrives.  The doors open.  CLAIRE steps out
into the shadowed area of stacked rows.


INT.  RESTAURANT - WIN AND VENZA

                         VENZA
                  (stares, wildly)
          Two years ago you were begging me
          for the money.  Nobody would've
          touched you...

                         WIN
          You're making an eighty percent
          return.  Which is what you wanted.

WIN turn away from VENZA.  VENZA grabs his arm violently.

                         VENZA
          Don't turn away when I'm talking to
          you.

                         WIN
                  (beat with
                   deliberation)
          Grease and water still don't mix,
          Joey.

VENZA

slashes one of the canvases (A Rosenquist) with the case
cutter... Then another...

ANGLE - WIN

                         WIN
                  (stunned)
          Jesus Christ... are you crazy?

ANGLE

Venza slashes another.

                         WIN
          Joey!

VENZA

turns, slashing WIN.

WIN

gasps.  Blood begins to seep from his wound.

ANGLE - CLAIRE

hearing, emerges into the light, smiling, thinking WIN'S
saying something she's supposed to respond to.

VENZA

slashing WIN again, losing all control.

                         WIN
                  (staggering back)
          Jesus...!

CLAIRE ROUNDS THE CORNER

Seeing WIN, she stops.

ANGLE

VENZA continues to attack him, stabbing WIN to the floor.

CLAIRE

screams, unable to imagine or believe it.

VENZA

looks up, hearing her.

WIN sprawls, a lifeless, bloodied mass at VENZA'S feet.
VENZA stares, returning CLAIRE'S stare, trying to
concentrate, to focus and pull himself back together.  He
puts down the cutter, taking a step toward her.

CLAIRE

steps back, turning and moving back toward the elevator,
running.

VENZA

quickens his step, after her.

ANGLE ON THE ELEVATOR

as she REACHES IT and HURTLES inward, HITTING all the
BUTTONS, the doors beginning to RUMBLE CLOSED.  But VENZA
is there, THRUSTING HIS HAND INSIDE to stop them.  The
doors CLOSE on his fingers.  He cries out, pulling his
fingers free.  He slams his fist against the doors as they
close shut, POUNDS the button again.

ANGLE INSIDE - CLAIRE

But CLAIRE grabs the POWER SWITCH, pulling it -- the
elevator goes dead, the overhead lights go out -- and
somewhere, in the shaft above, an ALARM BELL begins to
RING.

Relentlessly, VENZA pounds on the other side of the door.

CLOSE ON CLAIRE

giving way in the darkened cubicle.

ANOTHER ANGLE - CLAIRE

sagging against the elevator wall, weeping, hearing
VENZA'S FRANTIC BREATHING on the other side subside, and
finally move away in the darkness.


INT.  MIKE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

The PHONE RINGING -- a hand fumbling on the telephone in
the darkness.  WE HEAR MIKE'S VOICE as he turns on the
light.

                         MIKE
          T.J...?  Is this a joke?  Are you
          kidding me?
                  (listening, not
                   liking what he
                   hears)
          Give me 20 minutes.

MIKE hanging up the phone, turns to ELLIE.

                         ELLIE
                  (mumbling from under
                   the covers)
          Switch the light off on your way
          out.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  UNMARKED CAR - NIGHT

MIKE and T.J. disheveled and tired, drinking out of
styrofoam coffee cups, arriving at the club.

                         T.J.
                  (grinning)
          Hey Mike, out of the bag into the
          bureau, huh... How do you like it so
          far?

                         MIKE
                  (giving a half smile)
          Right behind you, T.J.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  THE CLUB - NIGHT

A rare tableau; swirling disco lights reflecting off
strategically placed mirrors, illuminating a room filled
with POLICEMEN (in uniforms and polyester suits), trying
to ride herd on the BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE, in contrasting
attire.

The man in charge and coping is LIEUTENANT GARBER; in
plainclothes, fiftyish, rough-hewn.

                         GARBER
          Did you ever hear the chatter.
          They're worse than fuckin' four-
          year-olds... Miller, let's clear
          this path here, all right?

T.J. and MIKE arrive.

                         GARBER
                  (to them, on the
                   move)
          Blood bath downstairs.  The owner of
          this place is dead.  And I got a
          witness, and a suspect... Joey
          Venza.

T.J. reacts to the name.

                         T.J.
          Where's Venza?

                         GARBER
          Nice question.  I like questions
          like that.

A massive "GASP" goes up from the CROWD as a cumbersome
BODYBAG is brought up a stairwell from downstairs.  GARBER
temporarily moves away to oversee.

                         MIKE
                  (to T.J.)
          Who's Joey Venza?

                         T.J.
          Bad fuckin' news.  Even the families
          dropped him when they found they had
          a fruitcake on their hands.  But he
          knows where a lot of bodies are
          buried.  It'd cap it for Garber if
          he could bring him in.

                         GARBER
                  (returning, re: the
                   crowd)
          Okay, let's find out what we know.
          Herd'm up and check'm out.  Anybody
          know more than gossip about the
          deceased or Venza, I wanna talk to
          them myself.  Go.

T.J. moves into action with typical "T.J. style"
diplomacy.

                         T.J.
          Okay, will all the beautiful people
          shut the fuck up, before it starts
          gettin' real ugly here!

The uniformed COPS take their cue, moving in for quiet.

                         GARBER
                  (to Mike, the "new
                   boy")
          Keegan, go baby-sit the witness.
          Just sit and look impressive.  Make
          her feel protected.  And if you can
          get her boyfriend outa my hair, I'll
          promote you to fuckin' Joint
          Chiefs...

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  WIN HOCKINGS' OFFICE - CLUB - NIGHT

A uniformed COP guarding the door as MIKE approaches,
flashing his shield.

                         COP
          Quit playing with yourself, Keegan.
          I know who you are.

                         MIKE
                  (grinning)
          A Detective's supposed to identify
          himself.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  WIN HOCKINGS' OFFICE - NIGHT

The room is dim, lit only by a desk lamp, CLAIRE seated on
a couch, catatonic, NEIL kneading her hand, trying to
comfort her.  A KNOCK at the DOOR:  NEIL JUMPS UP to open
it -- MIKE ENTERING before he gets there.

                         NEIL
                  (upset)
          Are you in charge here?

                         MIKE
          No, sir...

                         NEIL
          I asked for the man in charge...

                         MIKE
          That would be Lieutenant Garber, and
          he's very busy upstairs...

                         NEIL
          Don't tell me he's "busy".  I asked
          for an ambulance for this woman
          and...

                         MIKE
          Is she injured?

                         CLAIRE
                  (softly)
          No.

MIKE gets his first view of her as she TURNS her head into
the light.  It is an almost storybook vision of beauty
that emerges from the darkness around her; her
vulnerability penetrates to the very core.

                         NEIL
                  (to Claire)
          You're not going to talk to anyone
          without a lawyer.

                         MIKE
          She's not a suspect, sir, she's a
          witness.  Could I ask you to step
          outside, please.

                         NEIL
          No, I will not step outside.

                         MIKE
          Sir, I am just trying to do my job,
          it's standard procedure to question
          the witness alone.  Help me out
          here, could you please leave.

                         NEIL
                  (icily)
          I don't really see what that has to
          do with...

                         CLAIRE
                  (deadened; to Neil)
          Neil, do what he says.

ANGLE ON MIKE AND NEIL:  at a standoff.

                         CLAIRE
                  (quietly)
          Please.

MIKE OPENS THE DOOR for NEIL.  NEIL reluctantly swallows
it.

                         NEIL
          I'll be right outside.

NEIL grudgingly leaves.  MIKE quietly closes the door.

ANGLE CHANGE:  CLAIRE and MIKE alone.  He sits down.  A
beat.

                         MIKE
          Can I get you a cup of coffee or
          something?

Her plaintive eyes turning to meet his.

                         CLAIRE
                  (lost)
          I've never seen anyone killed
          before.

                         MIKE
          It's okay... I've never been a
          detective before either...

She lifts her gaze quizzically, catching his smile.  She
returns it in spite of herself, disarmed by his frankness,
and curiously reassured.

                         MIKE
          We'll go slow.  Okay?  We'll get
          through it together.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  DOWNTOWN HEADQUARTERS - DAY

PHONES RINGING, TYPEWRITERS TYPING, BODIES moving at
cross-current -- CAMERA FINDING LIEUTENANT GARBER,
hustling through the bullpen, MIKE FOLLOWING, toward his
office.

                         GARBER
          I don't know how you did it, but
          whatever it was, keep doing it.

                         MIKE
                  (puzzled)
          I just sat and listened.

                         GARBER
          Safe and secure is how we want her.
          Until she I.D.'s Venza.

T.J. has joined them.

                         GARBER
          Venza's either going to skip or try
          to get to her and Venza likes it
          here.  I want her ass covered, 24
          hour protection, but I don't want
          her to know there is any real
          danger.

                         T.J.
          I don't like what I'm hearing...

                         MIKE
                  (to Garber)
          I don't understand.  If there's any
          danger, why not just level with
          her...

GARBER turns back to MIKE

                         GARBER
                  (with mock tolerance)
          T.J. your friend's a little dense.
          When she realizes there's a killer
          tryin' to shut her up, she'll be on
          the next plane for Tahiti... somehow
          I think my way is better.

He MOVES ON, leaving them not very happy.

                         MIKE
          Chief?

GARBER turns back.

                         MIKE
          Why not Patrol?  They'd do just as
          good a job.

                         GARBER
          When I want your advise, Keegan,
          I'll make an appointment.

GARBER MOVES ON OUT.  MIKE and T.J. left alone.

                         MIKE
                  (disappointed)
          Shit!  A Nursemaid!  My first
          detail, and I'm a fuckin' slug!
                  (turning to T.J.)
          I got a 'choice' at all.

                         T.J.
          Do it, or look for another
          profession.  That's a choice I
          guess.

                         MIKE
          You in this with me?

                         T.J.
          Yeah!  Seniority gets the day shift.


EXT.  BACK OF MIKE'S HOUSE - DAY

ELLIE IS SEEN unloading groceries from the rear of a small
hatchback...


INT.  MIKE'S HOUSE - DAY

MIKE is in the kitchen; he's making eggs in agitation,
throwing in everything he can find (tuna fish, chopped
pickles, mustard), his kid, TOMMY, in evidence in the
b.g., on a SKATEBOARD, whizzing through the kitchen, even
RIDING IT down the STAIRS.

MIKE MOVES TO A CABINET -- and his FEET GO OUT FROM UNDER
HIM.  He's slipped on a SKATEBOARD -- barely catching
himself in time.

                         MIKE
                  (yelling)
          Tommy!  Goddamnit!  Get these
          skateboards off the goddamn kitchen
          floor!

TOMMY whizzes through, expertly picking it up "on the
move," MIKE taking a futile swipe at him.

                         TOMMY
          What're we having?

                         MIKE
          My special, scrambled eggs surprise.

                         TOMMY
                  (frowns dubiously)
          Scrambled eggs surprise?

TOMMY goes whizzing on out again.  ELLIE comes in loaded
up with the groceries.  Puts them down, giving MIKE a
kiss.

                         ELLIE
          So how'd it go?

                         MIKE
          Not great.  I've got a babysitting
          job for a material witness on a
          homicide.

It explains his mood.  ELLIE starts putting away the
groceries.

                         ELLIE
          For how long?

                         MIKE
          'Til they pick up the perp.
                  (he sits)
          Seniority gets day shift... You know
          what that means.

CLOSE ON ELLIE:  she sits, realizing, upset, but taking it
in stride, now putting plates on the table.

                         ELLIE
          Well, I'll live with it, I've lived
          with it all my life.  My Dad was a
          cop, he said, "whatever you do,
          honey, never go out with a cop".
          So, what did I do?  I got a job with
          the cops.  Then I married a cop.  I
          probably gave birth to a cop.
                  (shouting)
          Tommy!  Come over here and eat, it's
          hot.

TOMMY enters.

                         MIKE
          Maybe you and Tommy should stay with
          my Mom.

ELLIE makes an expression of dislike.

                         MIKE
          Don't start... The only reason is
          that the neighborhood's shi...
                  (realizing that
                   Tommy is listening)
          ... crummy.  I just don't like the
          idea of leaving you alone here at
          night.

                         ELLIE
          I can still use a gun.

                         MIKE
          Just keep it someplace safe, but
          handy.

TOMMY joins then at the table.

                         TOMMY
                  (zooming in)
          Keep what handy?

                         ELLIE
          Nothing.

                         TOMMY
          The gun?  It's in the upstairs
          closet.

                         MIKE
          How do you know where the gun is?

                         TOMMY
          I know where everything is.

                         MIKE
          Except the goddamn skateboards,
          which are everywhere!  I'd like to
          kill the guy who invented those
          things.

                         TOMMY
          Lay back, Mack.

                         MIKE
          Lay back, Mack!!  What's this "lay
          back, Mack?"
                  (to Ellie)
          Where does he get this?

Silence; they eat... ELLIE'S eyes finding MIKE'S.

                         ELLIE
          Keep the weekends for us, huh?  Get
          a replacement for Saturday nights.
          That'll give us the weekends
          together.

TOMMY'S face screws up, tasting the lump of food in his
mouth.

                         TOMMY
          God!  Scrambled eggs surprise?!
          These are pickles...!  God!

                         MIKE
          Just "lay back, Mack"... lay back...

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  MANHATTAN - FIFTH AVENUE - EARLY EVENING

Mike emerges from the subway alongside the park.


EXT.  FIFTH AVENUE APARTMENT BUILDINGS - EARLY EVENING

Out front, the DOORMAN opens the door for the building's
children returning from music lessons.

Across the street in Central Park, handsome, elderly
tenants stroll in the company of their nurse:  a nanny
pushes a pram, taking advantage of the last light.  This
is one of New York's most exclusive co-ops.  Distilled
civilization and quiet wealth.  A world away from Queens
or anything else.  MIKE arrives on foot.


INT./ EXT.  LOBBY - EVENING

A notice behind the locked front door informs:  "ALL
VISITORS MUST BE ANNOUNCED".  MIKE displays his shield to
the DOORMAN through the glass.  The DOORMAN opens, taking
the time to inspect his credentials before returning them,
then STEPS ASIDE, allowing ENTRY.


INT.  ELEVATOR - SAME

MIKE rides up in silence, examining the ornate walls.


INT.  VESTIBULE - CLAIRE'S APARTMENT - SAME

The elevator delivers him.  MIKE finds himself in a wall-
papered trompe l'oeil foyer.  Nothing to get his bearings.

The front door clicks open, startling him.  MARY, the
cleaning lady, an older, capable woman in functional
civilian clothes, greets him matter-of-factly, taking him
in.


INT.  CLAIRE'S LIVING ROOM - SAME

Marble-floored and high-ceilinged, absolutely palatial;
MIKE'S EYES registering amazement as he's led inward.

Floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking Central Park, where
the VOICES are REVEALED belonging to GARBER, T.J., CLAIRE,
and CLAIRE'S boyfriend, NEIL -- who's trying his best to
be "in charge".

                         GARBER
                  (approaching Mike)
          You remember Detective Keegan?

                         NEIL
                  (expressionless)
          I do.

The doorbell RINGS AGAIN:  MARY goes to answer it as MIKE
mumbles his greetings to all -- noticing that CLAIRE,
reclining on a couch, seems extremely put out -- or is it
"disinterested"?

                         NEIL
          I want to make sure that everyone
          respects the privacy of Miss
          Gregory's household.  You're limited
          to the outer vestibule, so you can
          watch the elevator, the kitchen, so
          you can get something to eat, and
          the washroom.

                         T.J.
                  (under his breath to
                   Mike)
          So you can take a shit.

The THIRD DETECTIVE enters, being led by MARY.  It's
KOONTZ, a package of razz and sarcasm, somebody you
definitely don't take home to mother.

                         MIKE
                  (reacting; to T.J.)
          Not Koontz.

                         T.J.
          Be happy.  He's good at this.

                         GARBER
                  (to Neil)
          We'd like to, just once, get a look
          at the entire layout, so we can
          evaluate security.

                         CLAIRE
          This really isn't necessary.  The
          security in this building is about
          the best in the city.

                         GARBER
                  (ever the diplomat)
          I'm sure you're right, Miss Gregory,
          but I'd consider it a favor if you'd
          let us look around.

                         CLAIRE
          Be my guest.

                         GARBER
                  (to his troops)
          Guys.

ANGLE - HALLWAY

as GARBER withdraws; MIKE, T.J., KOONTZ to start their
check.

                         MIKE
                  (to Garber)
          What about when she goes out?

                         GARBER
          Discourage it.  But stay with her if
          you can't.  Call it in first so we
          can have a car on tail.  She's
          agreed to travel only with her own
          driver and limousine... okay, let's
          check it out.

They split up.

ANGLE - MIKE

following orders, continues down the hall.  He moves to a
door that he ATTEMPTS TO OPEN -- discovering it's not
real.  It's a TROMPE L'OEIL.  He turns around to find he's
not alone in the long hall.  NEIL stands just outside the
living room, watching him.

                         MIKE
                  (re: the "door")
          Pretty good.

ANGLE - NEIL

turns, returning to CLAIRE in the LIVING ROOM.

                         NEIL
          Why an I reminded of the Three
          Stooges?

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  CLAIRE'S LIBRARY - MOMENTS LATER

KOONTZ checking the windows and terrace.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  KITCHEN - SAME

MIKE, MARY the MAID in there with him.

                         MARY
                  (officiously)
          You a vegetarian?  Miss Gregory's a
          vegetarian, so I'm gonna put food
          for you people in a separate fridge.
          You know how to use a microwave?
                  (before he can
                   answer)
          Just about everything you'd want
          will heat up by turning this to
          ninety seconds.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  CLAIRE'S BEDROOM - SAME

Utterly sumptuous; T.J. uttering a low "whistle" of awe.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  CLAIRE'S POWDER ROOM

There's an enormous circular bathtub and a Jacuzzi,
endless mirrors, a writing desk, carpeted, a place one
could spend one's life in -- MIKE SEEN, in the MIRRORS,
wandering through -- idly pushing a mirrored door open, to
gaze, in awe, at the walk-in closet.

                         MIKE
                  (under his breath)
          Fuckin' A.

ANGLE:  He see T.J., or what he thinks is T.J., reflected
among the other reflections at the other end of the room.
Sees T.J. sit on edge of bed.  MIKE is standing in center
of the MIRRORS, slightly disoriented.  And T.J. sees him,
similarly astounded, MOVING OUT OF SHOT.

CLOSE ON MIKE:  Moving inward, he gawks at the racks of
clothes, gently brushing his hand through the lush
fabrics.  CLAIRE'S VOICE -- ANGRY, ALMOST TREMBLING, A
FIRM EFFORT OF WILL -- rustles the silence behind him.

                         CLAIRE
          Excuse me.

ANGLE ON CLAIRE

                         CLAIRE
          This is my dressing room, and these
          are my clothes.
                  (holding herself
                   firm)
          I understand your responsibilities...
          but I'd appreciate you staying out
          of here at all times.

MIKE:  chastened, nods.

                         MIKE
          Sorry.  Just checking.

He starts away.  MOMENTARILY baffled by the MANY-ANGLED
REFLECTIONS OF HIMSELF in the MIRRORS.

                         CLAIRE
          Straight ahead.

                         MIKE
          Hard to find doors in this place.

MIKE:  embarrassed, apologetic.

                         CLAIRE
          ... Detective Keegan, I hope you
          understand how upsetting this is?

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  CLAIRE'S OUTER VESTIBULE - NIGHT

All silent; MIKE on "watch".  Just him and a wooden desk
chair, the grade-school variety.  No books, no crossword
puzzles; he came unprepared.  He checks his watch and
looks to an ornate wall clock.  And he's bored.  He picks
up an empty coffee cup, looking for a last drop.  Settles
for sniffing it.  Replaces it on the floor beside him.
Then he looks to the closed doors of the apartment and
makes a decision.  Picking up the coffee cup, he quietly
pushes the DOORS OPEN, and ENTERS.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

As MIKE pads quietly across the marble floors in the
quiet; pausing to gaze, in awe, at the vast, empty LIVING
ROOM.  It is gigantic, his eyes roaming the ceilings, as
though to estimate their height.

Moving inward, his eyes fall on a BOOK RACK, and he
crosses to it, perusing the shelves for possible reading
material.

They're all ART BOOKS, the big, thick kind.  A Renoir,
because of a NUDE FIGURE on the cover, catches his eye.
But as he pulls it out and begins to leaf through -- he
HEARS VOICES.  CLAIRE'S and NEIL'S; her tone is agitated.

                         NEIL (O.S.)
                  (barely audible)
          ... just saying you should think
          twice about it...

                         CLAIRE (O.S.)
          ... I don't want to talk about it...

CLOSE ON MIKE:  book under his arm, quietly moving toward
the SOURCE:  the DEN.  It's door is slightly ajar; there
is a suitcase in front of it, ready for travel.


INT.  DEN - NIGHT

                         CLAIRE
          ... You know, and I know, that the
          only thing standing between a life
          sentence for Venza and his freedom
          is my testimony at his trial...

                         NEIL
          Claire...

                         CLAIRE
          ... He killed Win... he enjoyed
          it...

                         NEIL
          Win made his choices, Claire.  We
          all do --

                         CLAIRE
          And I'm making mine.

She looks at him; a beat, emotionally.  He remains steady.

                         NEIL
                  (gently)
          You're dealing with a psychopath.
          He gets out of jail in ten years, or
          five... or ninety days, and you'll
          be looking over your shoulder for
          the rest of your life...

                         CLAIRE
          What am I supposed to do?!  I saw
          one of my oldest friends get killed!
          And I saw who did it!
                  (through tears)
          I can't just -- "let it go away"!!

                         NEIL
                  (gently)
          Claire...

ANGLE - DEN.  NEIL takes her in his arms, holding her
tightly, affectionately, protectively.  Holding her from
behind, NEIL KISSES CLAIRE gently on her neck.  She calms
in his arms.

RETURN:  MIKE DODGES back quickly, through the living and
dining rooms until he's in the kitchen.


INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT

Spotting the microwave, MIKE QUICKLY TOSSES in an English
muffin -- peering at the dials, as he switches it on.

But he hasn't escaped being a trespasser to what's going
on in the far room.  He can still HEAR THEM, though HE
WHISTLES, trying not to.

The English muffin BURSTS INTO FLAMES, MIKE desperately
pulling it out, tossing it into the sink, feverishly
fanning the air.

ANOTHER ANGLE ON MIKE:  becoming aware that HE'S NOT
ALONE.  He TURNS SUDDENLY to see MARY, the housekeeper,
not ten feet from him, in the laundry room, coat on,
fluffing her collar, ready to go home.

                         MIKE
                  (chagrined)
          I like 'em toasty.

ANGLE ON MARY:  staring at him, amused.

                         MARY
          Good night, Mr. Keegan.

She moves through the kitchen and EXITS.


INT.  VESTIBULE - LATER - NIGHT

NEIL, with his briefcase, finally leaving.  He crosses
from the hallway.

The TWO EYE EACH OTHER:  MIKE attempting a cordial smile.

                         NEIL
          You're here 'til what time?

                         MIKE
          I'm relieved at 4:00 A.M.

NEIL noticing the Renoir.

                         NEIL
          When you're through with it, put it
          back, please, exactly where you
          found it, and don't use the library
          again.  I have to leave town for a
          few days.  Let's do everything we
          can to make this less of a trial for
          her, shall we?

MIKE NODS.  But when NEIL leaves, he makes a mock
"military salute"; a click of the heels.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  CLAIRE'S VESTIBULE - LATER

2:45 A.M. (the clock ON THE WALL); pindrop silence; MIKE
alone.

CLOSE ON MIKE:  thoughtful, leafing through the Renoir.
Like a man making the most of solitary confinement --
becoming aware of a NOISE.  Though hard to make out in
this windowless capsule, it is DISTANT THUNDER.  It stirs
life in him and his eyes wander reflexively upward,
studying the ceiling -- then the doors of the apartment,
left slightly ajar.

ANGLE INSIDE THE APARTMENT:  CAMERA FOLLOWING MIKE as he
wanders inward, becoming aware of light coming from a
drawing room.  HE MOVES TOWARD, STOPPING.

ANGLE FROM HIS POV:  CLAIRE, dimly illuminated by the
light of a desk lamp that throws a gentle glow around her
-- seated, still as statuary, gazing out into the rain.

CLOSE ON MIKE:  watching her.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

INT.  SUBWAY - ON THE MOVE - LATER

The uncivilized hour indicated by the TOTALLY EMPTY
SUBWAY, MIKE a lone figure, somewhat numbed, his eyes set
into distant space -- as the SUBWAY reaches its
DESTINATION, the blurry platform signs decelerating until
we can make out the word "QUEENS".


EXT.  MIKE'S HOUSE - QUEENS

The neighborhood still asleep in the predawn hour; MIKE
picks up the newspaper... glancing at it, he opens it,
sees an article and photograph of CLAIRE on the second
page.  He heads inwards...

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  MIKE'S BEDROOM - DAY

Afternoon sunlight SPILLING IN as MIKE AWAKENS to the
SOUND of a CAR MOTOR, faltering, then "chug-chugging" to
another start, gasping, then revving.  Someone's working
on MIKE'S car.  He looks at his alarm clock; it's 4:00 in
the afternoon.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  MIKE'S BACKYARD - DAY

ELLIE and TOMMY visible only as fragments as they work on
MIKE'S car.  ELLIE IS SEEN as a rear-end in blue jeans,
the rest of her inside the hood; she calls to TOMMY to
"try it again".  It looks like no one's behind the wheel;
but the very top of his head CAN BE SEEN as he strains to
reach the accelerator.

ANGLE ON MIKE:  appearing at the door, in a freshly
pressed suit, a steaming cup of coffee in hand.  He walks
across the lawn towards them.

                         MIKE
          Hey!  What the hell're you doin' to
          my car?

ELLIE emerges from underneath the hood, flushed.

                         ELLIE
          Changing the sparks.  They showed it
          on TV.  What d'you think?

                         MIKE
          I think television's a dangerous
          thing.

                         ELLIE
          It's twenty bucks in the bank.

Slamming the hood.  TOMMY revs the engine ELLIE moving
down the steps towards MIKE.

                         ELLIE
          Enough, Tommy!  C'mon.  Get out of
          there!

ELLIE moving towards MIKE, she slipping her hand into his
underpants:  Their eyes meet, lovingly.  She laughs.

                         MIKE
          Hey.  The neighbors.

                         ELLIE
          Let 'em eat their hearts out.

She retrieves her cold coffee cup from the POTTING TABLE,
checks out the picture of CLAIRE in the newspaper, he's
left there.  MIKE adjusts his tie.  It's very colorful.

                         ELLIE
          I read the article.  You didn't tell
          me she was so beautiful.

                         MIKE
                  (Mister Honest)
          Well, actually, she looks better
          than that.

ELLIE playfully makes a move, JABBING AT HIM, MIKE stops
her, ending WITH A HUG.

                         MIKE
          I've got to go.

MIKE kisses her.  ELLIE holds MIKE'S face with her gloved
hand.

                         MIKE
          See you Tommy.

ANGLE ON ELLIE:  as TOMMY comes up and leans against his
mom:  both watching MIKE primp, they share on the joke.
MIKE turns, his face with grease on it.

                         MIKE
          Okay?

                         ELLIE
          Unbelievably handsome.  You look
          fantastic in a suit.

                         TOMMY
          Nice threads Dad.

                         MIKE
          Yeah, I think so.

MIKE leaves.


INT.  CLAIRE'S KITCHEN - LATER - NIGHT

The WALL CLOCK reads 6:30.  The remains of a teeny gourmet
meal, before him on the kitchen table.

MIKE is playing an improvised hockey game, shooting peas
through a goal made up of two water glasses, using his
knife as a hockey stick.  He HEARS the CLICK of HIGH HEELS
approaching, crossing the vast marble floors.

ANGLE FROM HIS POV:  CLAIRE coming toward -- clearly
dressed for the evening, her stride signaling
determination.

                         MIKE
                  (brilliant)
          Hi.

                         CLAIRE
          I'm sorry.  I'm not sure how this
          works.  I have to go out... is that
          all right?

                         MIKE
                  (unprepared)
          Uh...

                         CLAIRE
          I have to pick something up before
          Bergdorf's closes, then stop at a
          reception just a few blocks away.

                         MIKE
                  (faltering)
          I think, maybe, that isn't such a
          great idea...

                         CLAIRE
          Lieutenant Garber said that in all
          likelihood there was no real danger,
          is that true?

                         MIKE
          Right.  That's true.

                         CLAIRE
          Can we go then?

                         MIKE
          I'm supposed to call in.

                         CLAIRE
          There's a phone in the car.

She MOVES TOWARDS THE ELEVATOR:  MIKE, stymied.


INT.  ELEVATOR - SAME - NIGHT

They descend in silence, MIKE aware of being scrutinized.
The ELEVATOR STOPS, MIKE about to get off, realizing
they're stopped at the THIRD FLOOR, another TENANT
stepping on.  He's dressed in an expensive JOGGING SUIT,
his key dangling from around his neck; he nods to CLAIRE
and pushes "DOWN".  The elevator RUMBLES downward.

                         CLAIRE
          Do you have another tie?  Something
          more conservative?

                         MIKE
                  (confused, then
                   realizing)
          Oh... Yes... I don't have it with
          me.  It's at home.


EXT.  CLAIRE'S BUILDING - SAME - NIGHT

The JOGGER first out the door, taking off with fierce
determination, followed by MIKE, who nervously checks the
street, then opens the limo door and checks inside, then,
finally, MOTIONS CLAIRE OUT.  She moves smoothly into the
limo; MIKE checks traffic behind them, then gets in,
after.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  LIMO - SAME - NIGHT

MIKE fumbles, searching the console for the car phone.
She finds it easily, picks it up.

                         CLAIRE
          What's the number?

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  DOWNTOWN HEADQUARTERS - GARBER'S OFFICE

GARBER is on the other end of the line.

                         GARBER
          Oh, Jesus, what a fucking lunatic.
          Fucking shopping.
                  (he thinks)
          I don't see that we have much
          choice.  Jesus Christ.  Tell her
          she's a fucking lunatic.

GARBER slams down the phone.


INT.  CLAIRE'S LIMO - NIGHT

MIKE sets down the phone.

                         CLAIRE
          What did he say?

                         MIKE
          He thinks you're being a little
          careless.  He made the point several
          times.

MIKE sets down the phone.  They settle back; trying to
feel "comfortable" in one another's presence.  It's plenty
awkward.

                         CLAIRE
          You live in Manhattan?

                         MIKE
          Queens... You know Queens?

                         CLAIRE
          My father founded a music school
          there.  The Milton Gregory School.

He politely tries to place it, with no idea.

                         CLAIRE
          I'm supposed to speak at their tenth
          anniversary.

                         MIKE
          Nice.  Maybe you'll stop by... have
          an aperitif...

It evokes a slight smile but nothing more.

                         MIKE
          Maybe not.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  5TH AVENUE SHOP - NIGHT

The limo pulling up, MIKE hopping expertly out before it
stops moving.

It's parked in a red zone, with tow-away signs everywhere;
a PATROLMAN notices from the curb.

                         MIKE
                  (to the driver)
          Don't move it.

He flashes his shield at the PATROLMAN, takes a firm grip
on CLAIRE'S elbow, guiding her in.

ANGLE - AT THE ENTRANCE DOORS

MIKE stiff-arms the revolving door, stopping outgoing
shoppers to clear the way for CLAIRE; hops over to the
fixed door, opening it quickly for her, hustling her
effortlessly in, zip.

ANGLE:  CLAIRE, taken by it, but not displeased.


INT.  FIFTH AVENUE SHOP - NIGHT

They cross toward the up escalator; she knows where she's
going.

                         PERFUME LADY
          Hello, Miss Gregory.

CLAIRE steps onto the ESCALATOR; MIKE on alert,
scrutinizing the crowd.  He gets on right behind.  They
ascend.

At the top LANDING, A DARK-SUITED MAN VEERS RIGHT INTO
HER.  CLAIRE flinches.  MIKE MOVES PAST HER to the front,
quickly handling the guy.  The MAN jumps back.

                         DARK-SUITED MAN
          I'm sorry... I thought this was
          down...

ANGLE ON MIKE; SHAKEN.  CLAIRE giving him a long unsteady
look, too.

                         CLAIRE
          Are you nervous?

                         MIKE
          No, Ma'am.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  SHOP - GIFT COUNTER - NIGHT

MIKE keeping close watch as CLAIRE approves her purchase:
a silver frame, containing an inscribed photo of CLAIRE
and an elegant older woman.

                         CLAIRE
          Would you wrap it for me, I'll be
          back in a moment.

CLAIRE walks past MIKE.

                         CLAIRE
          Could you come with me please.

MIKE follows her.

CLAIRE at the TIE COUNTER, points to the tie rack.

                         CLAIRE
          Would you pick one out, please?

                         MIKE
          Beg pardon?

                         CLAIRE
          Since you're going to be my escort,
          you'll need a new tie.

MIKE begins to connect, glancing down again at the tie
he's wearing.  CLAIRE selects a TIE, turning to the
SALESPERSON, for his reaction.

                         SALESPERSON
          Perfect.

CLAIRE handing it to the SALESPERSON.

                         CLAIRE
          Put it on my account, please.

                         MIKE
          I got money.

CLAIRE gives a look to the clerk to go ahead with her
order.  SALESPERSON goes off.

                         CLAIRE
          If we had more time we'd work on the
          suit too.

INT.  THE LIMO - IN MOTION - SAME - NIGHT

MIKE AND CLAIRE; CLAIRE favorably assessing him in the new
tie.

                         CLAIRE
          You look quite elegant, actually.

He looks down at it in silence; then, finally:

                         MIKE
          My wife likes this suit.

CLOSE ON CLAIRE:  his vulnerability makes her smile.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM - NIGHT

Clearly a "big deal," with Kleig lights and heavy
LIMOUSINE and TAXI traffic being directed into place by
COPS, some of whom we recognize.

ANGLE ON A PAIR OF COPS, using flashlights to guide
traffic -- spotting CLAIRE'S LIMOUSINE with the BLACK-AND-
WHITE PATROL CAR following it, and signaling it into
place.

                         TRAFFIC COP
                  (re: Claire's limo)
          Bring it in, close.

The COP OPENS THE DOOR -- stunned to see MIKE STEP OUT, in
suit and new tie -- looking like he belongs there.

                         COP
          Jesus Christ.

                         MIKE
          I'm on duty.

                         COP
          What kind of work?  Gigolo?

CLAIRE steps out, utterly elegant, taking MIKE'S arm --
the traffic COPS now joined by those from the BLACK-AND-
WHITE, as MIKE and CLAIRE head INWARD.  The COPS wolf-
whistle MIKE and razz him as they go, some beginning the
STRAINS of "Just a Gigolo"...

MIKE GIVES THEM THE FINGER behind his back.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  THE RECEPTION - SAME - NIGHT

MIKE and CLAIRE caught in a crush of people jamming the
ENTRANCE WAY -- their bodies coming into close contact, so
close that MIKE is forced into an awkward posture in order
to stay close to her; one arm up in the air, uncomfortable
about taking her arm.

                         CLAIRE
          You can touch me, I won't bite.

                         MIKE
          Not too sure about that.

He takes her arm, guiding her through the crowd.

The SOUND of a WOMAN'S (MARGE GOODWIN) VOICE attracts
their attention.

                         MARGE
                  (pushing through)
          CLAIRE!  Claire!  Darling!  Are you
          all right?

She's a SOCIETY MATRON-TYPE, grabbing CLAIRE in an ever-
so-concerned HUG.

                         MARGE
          My God!  I couldn't believe... my
          poor darling... and Win Hockings...!
          Antonia'll be so happy you're here,
          she says a "Lifetime Achievement
          Award" is like being invited to your
          own funeral while you're still
          alive...

But ANTONIA, an elegant OLDER WOMAN, has already SPOTTED
HER.

                         ANTONIA
          Claire...!

She pushes through, and fairly falls into CLAIRE'S arms.
ANTONIA almost emotionally overcome, that CLAIRE has
managed it.

                         CLAIRE
          I wouldn't have missed it, Tony.

                         ANTONIA
          You look so beautiful...

ANTONIA looks up to see MIKE.

                         CLAIRE
          This is Mike Keegan, the policeman
          assigned to protect me.  Antonia
          Bolt...

She looks up to SEE MIKE:  it directs others to do the
same.

                         MARGE
                  (change of tone)
          Hello.

                         CLAIRE
                  (introducing)
          Marge Woodwin, Antonia Bolt, this is
          Mike Keegan...

                         MIKE
                  (ultra respectful)
          Hello...
                  (a deferential nod
                   to Antonia)
          ... Ma'am.

                         ANTONIA
                  (liking him; to
                   Claire)
          He's got nice eyes.  Very gentle.
                  (re: Mike's
                   embarrassed
                   reaction)
          And he blushes.  I like that.  Take
          good care of her.


INT.  THE RECEPTION - LATER - NIGHT

CLAIRE in the thick of things -- a BAND PLAYING NOW --
occasionally glancing at MIKE -- who stands against a
wall, ever watchful...

CLOSE ON MIKE: TURNING to see a VERY PRETTY YOUNG THING
come up to him; just "oozing" seduction.

                         PRETTY YOUNG THING
          I hear you're a policeman.

MIKE nods; eyes fixed on CLAIRE.

                         MIKE
          Uh, yeah.  I'm a policeman.

                         PRETTY YOUNG THING
          Ever shot anyone?

                         MIKE
          Yes.

                         PRETTY YOUNG THING
          Does it make you... hard?

                         MIKE
          ... Hard?

                         PRETTY YOUNG THING
          Erect.  You know, a "boner?"  I'd
          heard that it gives you a boner, to
          shoot a man.

MIKE'S eyes register abject dumbfoundment.

                         MIKE
          Would you excuse me, please?

HE PUSHES TOWARD CLAIRE, catching her eye.

                         MIKE
          Would you consider leaving here
          pretty soon?

CLAIRE relaxed, clearly having a good time.

                         CLAIRE
          People think I'm stepping out on
          Neil.  We're causing quite a
          scandal.

                         MIKE
                  (confidential)
          Hey!  There are crazy people here.

                         CLAIRE
          Let's get a drink.

                         MIKE
          Ah... I shouldn't... on duty.

She plows toward the crowded bar, just inside the ballroom
entrance, MIKE following.

                         CLAIRE
          I'll have a spritzer, order
          something soft for yourself... I
          must go for a pee.

                         MIKE
          I'll come with you.

                         CLAIRE
          I think I can probably do that on my
          own.

CLOSE ON MIKE:  Not amused.  CLAIRE heads to the ladies'
room across from the bar.  MIKE watches her enter.  Turns
back to the bar, which is very busy and confused.

                         MIKE
                  (irritated)
          Gimme a spritzer, and a... vodka
          martini.

MIKE seeing the Pretty Young Thing.

                         MIKE
          Make it a double.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  LADIES' ROOM - SAME - NIGHT

as a pair of WOMEN finish their "touch-up" and head out,
making way for CLAIRE to step up to the mirror to assess
herself.  The room momentarily empties.  Putting her purse
down she moves to a stall and enters.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  BAR COUNTER - NIGHT

MIKE, waiting, glancing back at the door as the TWO WOMEN
EXIT, then turns to the BARMAN to receive the drinks.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  LADIES' ROOM - SAME

LOW ANGLE on the door -- as a pair of men's shoes pass
through frame.

CLOSE ON CLAIRE, inside a stall SHE HEARS FOOTSTEPS
QUIETLY ENTER, followed by a CLICK of a DOOR.  It's not
the click of a stall door, because the FOOTSTEPS then
proceed inward; WE HEAR A STALL DOOR CLOSE and LOCK.  It
gives her momentary pause, but she dismisses it, looking
for her purse -- realizing she left it on the sink --
opening her stall door and heading out.

She barely hears the "click" of the bolt sliding behind
her -- and looks up, into the MIRROR, SEEING VENZA appear
behind her.  She SPINS -- but doesn't have time to CRY
OUT.  He's grabbed her by the THROAT.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  BALLROOM - SAME MOMENT - NIGHT

MIKE and the PRETTY YOUNG THING:  she doesn't notice him
trying to drift away.

                         PRETTY YOUNG THING
          You know what?  I don't think you're
          a policeman at all.  I think you're
          just some schmuck who uses that
          "policeman" line as a come-on.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  LADIES' ROOM - SAME - NIGHT

CLAIRE attempting to breathe -- her FACE being brought to
within an inch of his.

                         VENZA
          Christ, you're one beautiful woman.
          I could kill you right now, but I'm
          not gonna... 'cause you're gonna
          help me.  You're gonna see me in a
          police line-up and say it wasn't me.
          And if you don't do that, someone
          will come after you.  They're gonna
          find you dead, with your face
          missing -- understood... Good...
          Because otherwise, it'd be this
          easy.

CLOSE ON CLAIRE:  her eyes wide with TERROR.  He rubs his
thumb across her mouth, smearing the lipstick.

                         VENZA
          Now walk outta here.  And if you
          ever see me again... you never saw
          me before.

To make his point, he SQUEEZES HARDER -- CLAIRE'S eyes
bulging, as TEARS run from her eyes.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  MUSEUM - UPPER TIER - SAME - NIGHT

MIKE, finally putting distance between him and the "PRETTY
YOUNG THING."

ANGLE:  MIKE, as he catches sight of a back of a man
(VENZA) moving out of the ladies' room.  Stunned, MIKE
PIVOTS, TURNING, SPRINTING IN THE DIRECTION of the ladies'
room.

OUTSIDE THE LADIES' ROOM:  Two women just go in.  MIKE
pushes his way in, slamming the door behind him.  The
OTHER WOMEN GASP, seeing MIKE invading their sanctuary.

INSIDE THE LADIES' ROOM:  MIKE

CLOSE ON MIKE:  RELIEVED BUT SHOCKED to see CLAIRE,
disheveled, lipstick smeared across her mouth, throat and
face, but otherwise uninjured.

MIKE turns, calling to the TWO WOMEN coming in.

                         MIKE
          Take care of her!

MIKE TAKES OFF AFTER VENZA --


INT.  UPPER TIER

OUT OF LADIES' ROOM, AND UP THE RAMP TO THE NEAREST (THE
UPPER) LEVEL.

ANGLE:  He sees VENZA get into the ELEVATOR.  These is
only one place for it to go -- DOWN.  MIKE CHANGES
DIRECTION and FRANTICALLY RUNS DOWN THE SPIRALING RAMP
trying to keep pace with the descent of the elevator.  At
the GROUND LEVEL HE SEES THE ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN and VENZA
EXITS AMIDST THE PARTY.

ANGLE ON VENZA:  VENZA MAKES HIS WAY TO THE FRONT ENTRANCE
AND EXITS THE BUILDING.

ANGLE ON MIKE:  MIKE HURTLES DOWN THE RAMP AND DESPERATELY
FIGHTS HIS WAY THROUGH THE CENTER of the PARTY and OUT the
FRONT ENTRANCE.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM - NIGHT

MIKE EXITS the BUILDING bewildered; lost him... RUNS
BLINDLY amidst PEDESTRIANS -- SPOTS VENZA AHEAD.

ANGLE ON VENZA reaching someone MIKE CAN'T SEE.  MIKE puts
his hand in his jacket for his gun.

                         MIKE
          Venza!

VENZA HEARS and SLOWS, but DOESN'T TURN.  ONLOOKERS turn.
VENZA is talking to someone, taking his time.

ANGLE ON VENZA:  untroubled, turning; raising his arms,
and SMILING.

ANGLE ON MIKE:  confused -- seeing that the man VENZA
stopped to talk to is a PATROLMAN, he'd stopped to give
himself up.

CLOSE ON MIKE:  breathless as he moves toward VENZA.  MIKE
frisks VENZA as he turns, SMILING at MIKE.

INT.  PRECINCT - DAY

MIKE and T.J. with GARBER, MIKE being CONGRATULATED by
COPS who pass.  But GARBER doesn't look happy.

                         MIKE
                  (protesting)
          But I got him!  He's in jail!
          Wasn't that the point...?!

                         GARBER
          You apprehended him after he gave
          himself up --

                         MIKE
          It wasn't a bad bust.  He gave
          himself up because he knew I was
          gonna nab him.

                         GARBER
          Anyone who turns himself in makes a
          good case for bail.

                         MIKE
          Even Joey Venza?!

                         GARBER
          He's got a good lawyer, and he made
          a smart move.  We've got a scared
          witness and a suspect who proved
          "good will" by turning himself in.

                         MIKE
                  (protesting)
          What about when she identifies him?!

                         GARBER
          If she identifies him.
                  (turns, unloading on
                   him)
          Where the fuck were you anyway,
          cowboy!  Venza was meat.  He walked
          right past you, and now we're the
          ones playing catch-up!  You better
          hope she identifies him.

GARBER turns on his heel, ENTERING HIS OFFICE; leaving
MIKE looking at T.J.  Dismayed.

                         T.J.
          Wasn't your fault.

                         MIKE
                  (exasperated)
          It was my fault, T.J.  Fuck!

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  TRACT HOME - BROOKLYN HEIGHTS - AFTERNOON

A tree-lined neighborhood.  The house has a FOR SALE sign
in front; MIKE is standing in front of a cab, he's dressed
for work -- he looks around.  The cab pulls out, he heads
for the front door.


INT.  TRACT HOME - AFTERNOON

MIKE enters the house.  It's nothing special.  ELLIE is in
another room.  She joins MIKE.

                         ELLIE
          The real estate lady left, she
          couldn't wait anymore.  What took
          you?

                         MIKE
                  (upset)
          Oh, some shit.

                         ELLIE
          What shit, honey?

                         MIKE
          You don't want to hear about it.

ELLIE begins to show him the place.

                         ELLIE
          ... Look at the fireplace.  You
          don't get workmanship like that
          anymore.

ANGLE ON MIKE:  preoccupied.

                         ELLIE
          Ninety-seven five.  What do you
          think?

He nods, trying hard to "be there," but ELLIE isn't
fooled; she assesses him with concern.

                         ELLIE
          Honey.  You got him.

                         MIKE
          I don't know that Ellie.  He might
          get out.  Garber's not bein'
          straight with the witness, she could
          be in deep shit if she identifies
          him, and it's my job to convince her
          she won't be.

                         ELLIE
                  (the voice of
                   sanity)
          She's got to identify him.

                         MIKE
          Why?

                         ELLIE
                  (taken aback)
          Because the the only way to stop
          crime is to identify criminals.  I
          can't believe you're talking this
          way Mister Detective -- I think
          she's got a lot of guts.

                         MIKE
          I think -- she's crazy.

                         ELLIE
          I'd identify him.

                         MIKE
          I might stop you.

A beat.

                         ELLIE
          Oh I can see you've had a bad day.
          We'll see the house another time,
          okay?

                         MIKE
                  (trying to recover)
          No!  No!  I'm sorry.  Ninety-seven
          five right?

                         ELLIE
          Where'd you get the tie?

He's wearing the tie CLAIRE bought him.

                         MIKE
                  (distracted)
          Bought it.

                         ELLIE
          It's not your taste.

                         MIKE
          What did she say the down payment
          was?

PAUSE.  DEAD SILENCE.

                         MIKE
          She didn't like the other one, so
          she picked this one.

                         ELLIE
          She took you shopping for a tie?

                         MIKE
          I had to follow her to a store.

                         ELLIE
          What's wrong with your paisley tie?

                         MIKE
          Ellie, it was a formal party...

                         ELLIE
          Excuse me!  You went to a party with
          her?

                         MIKE
          I'm her bodyguard, goddamnit...

                         ELLIE
          I know you're her bodyguard.  Did
          she buy it or did you?

                         MIKE
          She bought it.

                         ELLIE
          Why?

                         MIKE
          I don't know why she bought me a
          tie! -- She's a generous person --
          and she's a nice person -- and I
          could be settin' her up to be
          killed... you want the fuckin' tie?

His VOICE resonates through the empty house, creating a
ringing silence.  ELLIE begins to giggle.

                         ELLIE
                  (joking)
          No, I don't want the 'fuckin'" tie
          -- I'm sorry --
                  (conciliatory)
          I'm glad she bought you a tie.  You
          needed one.  You look good in that
          tie.
                  (a beat)
          Next time you two go shopping, maybe
          you could tell her we need a new
          Maytag stackable, double-decker
          washer and dryer set.

MIKE smiles, she gives him a kiss, and a flick on the
nose.

                         ELLIE
          You want to see the bedroom.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  DEN - LATER - NIGHT

The WALL CLOCK reads 9:45.  CLAIRE is working at her desk.
She gets up and moves into the hallway where she sees MIKE
through the half-opened door.  CLAIRE moves to the
doorway.

                         CLAIRE
          Hi.  Just checking to see if you're
          here.

                         MIKE
          I came on at 8:00.

An awkward silence.

                         MIKE
          You all right?

                         CLAIRE
          Yeah.

                         MIKE
          I'm sorry about what happened.

                         CLAIRE
          Listen, that was my fault.

                         MIKE
                  (disagreeing)
          I shouldn't have listened to you, I
          should've followed you right into
          the "can" the way he did.

                         CLAIRE
          If I had known I was going to have
          company, he was right next to me.  I
          think he heard me peeing!  I hate
          that, I am glad he's in jail.

She laughs, he smiles, both attempting to make light of
it.  But it's hard to make light of; the attempt quickly
fades.

                         CLAIRE
          Lieutenant Garber says when I
          identify him, they're going to lock
          him up and throw away the key.

MIKE nods; buttoning his lip.

                         CLAIRE
          I guess I'm supposed to do it in the
          morning.  Identify him.

                         MIKE
                  (uneasy)
          Sooner, the better.

                         CLAIRE
          He said he'd kill me.

                         MIKE
          Big talk... Desperate guy.

                         CLAIRE
          Right.  How could he do that if he's
          in jail and they've thrown away the
          key...?

MIKE is TORN.

                         MIKE
          It's the right thing to do.
          Identifying him.

She starts to walk away.

                         MIKE
          Claire?

                         CLAIRE
          Hmm...

                         MIKE
                  (holds up a book)
          You wouldn't happen to know what
          language they speak in India, do
          you?

                         CLAIRE
          Urdu and Hindi.

                         MIKE
                  (amazed)
          Yeah, what a woman.

He marks it in his CROSSWORDS:  she moves closer,leaning
over his shoulder to see.

                         CLAIRE
          Didn't do very well, did you?

                         MIKE
                  (a laugh)
          Nope... never finished one yet.  I
          hate these things.

                         CLAIRE
          You were reading my Renoir.

                         MIKE
          How did you know?

                         CLAIRE
          You put it back in the wrong
          place... Do you like Renoir?

                         MIKE
                  (thoughtful)
          They're kind of fuzzy.

                         CLAIRE
          You know why they're like that...?
          He was myopic... going blind.

                         MIKE
          No kidding.

In the SILENCE that follows, their eyes on each other,
appraising.

                         CLAIRE
          So, this could be your last night,
          huh?

                         MIKE
          Could be, I guess.

                         CLAIRE
                  (a thought)
          Want to go out for a drink?
                  (re: his surprised
                   expression)
          I mean, we're both sitting here, and
          Joey Venza's in jail...

                         MIKE
                  (a beat)
          Yeah, I like that!  Where you go, I
          follow.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  FIFTH AVENUE - NIGHT

CLAIRE and MIKE walking; her arm looped in his -- the
BLACK-AND-WHITE keeping pace alongside them -- their
conversation animated, clearly enjoying one another's
company.

                         CLAIRE
                  (laughing)
          You mean to tell me, a mugger would
          stay away from someone because they
          walked a certain way?

                         MIKE
          Absolutely.  Look at this.

He demonstrates a peculiar walk; arms and legs moving in
ridiculous awkwardness.

                         CLAIRE
          That's the dumbest walk I ever saw!

                         MIKE
                  (indignant)
          No, no seriously!  There's a study
          done on this, you walk this way, the
          muggers are gonna single you out.

                         CLAIRE
          And die laughing, because you're
          walking so stupid!

                         MIKE
                  (mock anger)
          Hey.  This is my business.  Do I
          tell you your business.

                         CLAIRE
          Okay.  Let's just see if a mugger
          gets me.

She takes off down the street; walking stupidly, worse
than he did -- he's LAUGHING as he WATCHES HER GO.

INT.  PATROL CAR - NIGHT

The COPS following exchange dubious glances, getting a
glimpse of the strangeness.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

INT.  PIANO BAR - NIGHT

CAMERA FINDING CLAIRE and MIKE, at a small table, in
darkness, a piano bar playing in the background.  The song
being sung is "SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME."

                         MIKE
          ... It was like... the minute I saw
          her... I knew.  She looked so damn
          adorable in a cop's uniform...
          puttin' on a big, tough act...

                         CLAIRE
          So it was "love".

                         MIKE
          Yeah.  It was.

                         CLAIRE
          And "is"...?

He hesitates; but nods.

                         MIKE
                  (confirming it)
          Yeah.

                         CLAIRE
          That's nice.  And you live in
          Queens?  With a child, and a dog...?

                         MIKE
          No dog.

                         CLAIRE
          I saw you with a dog, in my mind.

                         MIKE
          No dog.

                         CLAIRE
          But "nice".

                         MIKE
          Very nice.

Her envy is plain.

                         MIKE
          What about Neil?

                         CLAIRE
          You don't like him, do you?

                         MIKE
                  (a pause)
          What's to like?

                         CLAIRE
                  (amused)
          Tell it like it is.

                         MIKE
          You asked.

                         CLAIRE
          He's very caring, in his way.  You
          haven't seen him at his best.

                         MIKE
          You could do better.

                         CLAIRE
                  (laughs)
          I'll miss you, Mike...

ANGLE ON BOTH:  the music playing.

                         CLAIRE
          It was nice having you "watch over
          me"...

                         MIKE
          Yeah.  I liked being around you
          too... Claire.

CLOSE ON MIKE:  feeling a moment of awkwardness.

                         MIKE
          Let's go home.

EXT.  CITY STREET - NIGHT

The PATROL CAR keeping pace as the two walk home; the COPS
in the BLACK-AND-WHITE exchange a look at what they are
seeing.  MIKE is holding her arm, she's huddled up; she is
cold and he removes his topcoat and puts it around her
shoulders.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  CLAIRE'S BUILDING - NIGHT

The PATROL CAR comes to a STOP as MIKE and CLAIRE ENTER.

ANGLE ON THE TWO COPS AGAIN:  watching them go.

INT.  CLAIRE'S ELEVATOR - NIGHT

As they ride up in silence -- on opposite sides of the
elevator -- looking at each other.  It comes to a stop,
and neither moves; the tension is palpable.

She steps out first, he follows.  She moves to the doors
and stops -- her shoulders visibly relaxing as he moves up
behind her.  But he stops, too.  And she turns.

ANOTHER ANGLE:  Both captive to indecision.  It is he who
makes it, just by staying immobile for too long.  She
smiles and takes off her coat, holding it out to him.  And
in the moment of exchange is the return to reality.

                         CLAIRE
          Good night, Mike.

                         MIKE
          Sleep good.

She turns to open the door.  Entering she -- and we --
suddenly can see Neil pacing in the hall, b.g.  He's
returned.  He looks up, worried and very upset.

CLOSE ANGLES ON FACES.

                         NEIL
          It's 3 o'clock in the morning.
          Where the hell have you been?

INT.  DOWNTOWN HEADQUARTERS - DAY

MIKE heading down a LONG HALL TOWARD GARBER'S OFFICE:
It's like running a gauntlet.

                         COP #1
          Hey, Mike, tough night.

                         KOONTZ
          I guess it happens, you know?  A
          chick gives you a ride in her
          limousine, the next thing she wants
          is to wear your clothes...
                  (a beat)
          ... I heard he had her underpants on
          his head.

That one got to him; stopped dead by it, he turns, giving
KOONTZ a challenging look.

                         COP #1
          Ease up, Mike.  Ain't nobody gonna
          tell the old lady.

CLOSE ON MIKE:  cooling down -- then girding himself for
GARBER.

                         KOONTZ
          Ain't the first time the taxpayers
          paid for a blow-job neither.

INT.  CORRIDOR - DAY

GARBER and MIKE on the carpet.

                         GARBER
                  (steamed)
          Don't tell me it was "no big deal,"
          it was out of line, it makes you
          look like an asshole, and it makes
          me look like an asshole.  She's
          coming in, in a few minutes to I.D.
          Venza.  If Steinhart's with her, I
          want you to apologize.
                  (in motion)
          Let's get this over with...

In the room next to the corridor, KOONTZ interrupts the
shift already there, entering.

                         KOONTZ
          Okay, we're gonna have a line-up
          here...

The OTHER COPS grab their things and scatter, not wanting
to get involved in another cop's headache.

INT.  FARTHER DOWN THE CORRIDOR - SAME - DAY

CLAIRE approaching with NEIL, with T.J. on guard-duty.

                         GARBER
          Good morning, Miss Gregory.

MIKE AND CLAIRE catch each other's eyes.  He sees how
nervous she is.

                         CLAIRE
          It was my fault not Detective
          Keegan's, I'm sorry for all the
          fuss.

NEIL catches MIKE'S glance at her; reassures himself with
a glance at CLAIRE, straightens, still steamed from last
night.

GARBER picks up on it, not liking the tension, especially
not now; his eyes throw daggers at MIKE.

                         GARBER
                  (to Claire)
          You all ready?

                         NEIL
                  (playing the
                   protector role)
          Will this take long?

                         GARBER
          We'll see.

GARBER TURNS, getting them started.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  VIEWING ROOM - SAME - DAY

They crowd in; another MAN already standing there --
VENZA'S PARK AVENUE LAWYER.  A one-way window looks into
the brightness of the line-up (squad) room that's emptied
now and undergoing preparation by KOONTZ.

GARBER to CLAIRE, a professional reassurance.

                         GARBER
          They can't hear you, they can't see
          you...
                  (introducing pro
                   forma)
          Mr. Venza's attorney, Mr. Neuman;
          arresting officer Keegan...
                  (to Claire)
          Good luck.

With that, GARBER leads NEIL out.  NEIL manages a final
concerned stare at CLAIRE before he goes.  The DOOR
CLOSES.  MIKE, CLAIRE, and an unruffled MR. NEUMAN, THE
LAWYER, are left alone in the cramped space.


INT.  LINE-UP ROOM - SAME - DAY

KOONTZ beckons VENZA and the OTHER FOUR LINE-UP
PARTICIPANTS IN.

                         KOONTZ
          Okay, take a seat... you, put a
          couple phone books under your
          rear...

VENZA enters confidently, with the others.  He's number
three.  He takes his place, staring unconcernedly past the
bright lights toward the direction of the mirrored window,
as if he could see through it, into CLAIRE'S EYES.


INT.  VIEWING ROOM - SAME - DAY

CLAIRE, staring expressionless, her eyes etched with fear.
MIKE aware of that fear.  VENZA'S LAWYER waiting
patiently, casually.


INT.  LINE-UP ROOM - DAY

VENZA and the OTHERS WAITING, now STANDING ON DISPLAY.

                         KOONTZ (V.O.) (OVER SPEAKER)
          Will everyone except number three
          please take one step back?

VENZA'S JAW TIGHTENS, a flicker, before catching himself
and controlling the reaction.  Realizing.  She's making
positive identification.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  SUBWAY - EVENING

MIKE, empty-eyed.  On his way HOME.

INT.  MIKE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

ELLIE dressed for sleep, in a DISNEYWORLD T-SHIRT, pauses
to glance with worried eyes -- toward the living room
where WE HEAR the SOUND of a TV.

ANGLE ON MIKE:  on a couch, beer in hand -- mindlessly
watching.

                         ELLIE
          Coming to bed?

                         MIKE
          Few minutes.  Want to catch the
          news.

                         ELLIE
                  (hesitant)
          Should I wait up?  We've got to get
          up early for the beach tomorrow.

                         MIKE
          I'll be right up.

She accepts it, reluctantly -- returning to the BEDROOM.

CLOSE ON MIKE:  hitting the remote to SCAN the channels;
troubled.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  CLAIRE'S DEN - EVENING

CLAIRE at ease on the couch, staring, trying to follow the
images of the television.  NEIL, at the bar, pours them
both a drink.

                         NEIL
          They need me back in Miami, but I'd
          really like it if you could join me.
          The marlin fishing's supposed to be
          great off the Keys...

He steps forward with her drink.

                         NEIL
          The change would do you a world of
          good.

She straightens, suddenly attentive, in response to
something on the TV.

It's a REPORT FROM OUTSIDE THE COURTHOUSE, with the TV
NEWSMAN reporting:

                         TV NEWSMAN
          Denied bail, Joey Venza will remain
          behind bars at least until the time
          of the trial --

ANGLE ON NEIL, watching.

                         NEIL
          Hallelujah.

He gives her a drink, leaning down to kiss her on the
forehead.

                         NEIL
          At least now we can get on with our
          own lives.

INT.  MIKE'S KITCHEN - MORNING

Where life has indeed returned to normal, except for the
heavy weight of memory.  MIKE, at the counter, makes
SANDWICHES, packing a cooler for the game.  He grabs TOMMY
with an arm-hook as TOMMY tries to swipe a sandwich on the
pass through.

                         MIKE
          Hey, not yet!  How many times...

Roughhousing TOMMY, MIKE gets him squealing.  ELLIE
enters, stomping her feet clean, coming in from the
garden.

                         ELLIE
          God, it's freezin' out there.

She blows on her hands, shows MIKE how cold, putting them
against his cheeks.

                         MIKE
                  (wincing)
          Ah!

She does it to TOMMY, too, except he's too fast for her,
yelling and squirming out of the way.  The PHONE RINGS.
ELLIE doesn't answer it.  TOMMY picks it up.

                         TOMMY
                  (a beat)
          Wait a sec.

He offers the phone out to ELLIE.

                         ELLIE
          Hello.
                  (a beat)
          Yes, just a second.
                  (hands it to Mike)
          It's the Whip.

MIKE takes it.  ELLIE turns to TOMMY, who yelps and darts
away, avoiding her cold touch.

                         MIKE
                  (into phone)
          Hey Lieutenant, how are you...?
          What?!
                  (to Ellie)
          Venza's out.
                  (back to phone;
                   pissed)
          Why didn't the I.D. unit or the
          D.A.'s office know about his sheet?
                  (a beat)
          Ah shit... Yeah, yeah, okay I'm on
          my way in.

He SLAMS DOWN THE PHONE, raging.

                         ELLIE
          What?

                         MIKE
          Goddamn Venza assaulted a taxi
          driver in the Bronx, thirteen months
          ago.  It's coming to court and the
          judge let him walk because of the
          pending case law.

In a fit of RAGE, he SWIPES at a MILK CARTON, sending it
HURTLING AGAINST A WALL.  ANGLE on TOMMY:  amazed.

                         ELLIE
          Mike, take it easy...

                         MIKE
          Take it easy!  I set her up.  I saw
          it coming.

                         ELLIE
          It's not your fault.  Mike, please
          get off the case.

                         MIKE
                  (distraught)
          It is my fault!  I'm responsible for
          her!

                         ELLIE
          Did you hear what I said?

                         MIKE
          Did you hear what I said?!!

SILENCE.

                         MIKE
                  (to Ellie, with
                   finality)
          I'm due on at seven.

He dumps the rest of the lunch preparations in the sink,
exiting.

ANGLE on TOMMY and ELLIE looking distraught.

                         TOMMY
                  (dismally)
          We're not going to the game, are we
          Mom?

                  (pulling herself
                   together)
          Sure we are, let's go!

CLAIRE spills red wine over the counter, uncorking the

ANGLE FROM HIS POV:  CLAIRE'S FRONT ENTRANCE; extra
SECURITY -- A SQUAD CAR PARKED IN FRONT now.

behind the closed apartment doors.

KOONTZ grabbing his stuff, massive understatement.

                         KOONTZ
          She's a little upset.  You're going
          to have to piss in a bottle.

He holds up a beer bottle; half-filled with urine.

                         KOONTZ
                  (packs it under his
                   arm)
          Sorry, I don't have any extras.
          Have a nice night.

HE WILLINGLY LEAVE, and MIKE WAITS but a split second,
before going to the doors.  They are closed.  MUSIC blares
from within.  No other response.


INT.  CLAIRE'S LIVING ROOM - SAME - NIGHT

Distraught, CLAIRE tries to bring herself back from the
brink, placing the wine bottle rack down after she's
poured.

                         MIKE (O.S.)
          Claire?

                         CLAIRE
                  (frightened)
          What do you want?

                         MIKE (O.S.)
          Open the door, will you?

                         CLAIRE
          I can't open it.

                         MIKE (O.S.)
          It's just me.  I want to talk to
          you.  Let me in...

The lock turns and it opens, but just a crack, enough to
see that she's hysterical, her eyes reddened from crying.

                         CLAIRE
          You put me life in danger.

                         MIKE
          No, you'll be safe.  We're gonna
          pick him up again...

                         CLAIRE
          And then what?  I'll never be safe.
          I'll have to leave the country!  You
          can't protect me, and you can't keep
          him in jail!  And you knew that all
          the goddamn time!

Near bursting, she SLAMS THE DOOR, leaving MIKE STUNNED:
Inside, the MUSIC is TURNED UP AGAIN to THUNDEROUS
PROPORTIONS.

Clenching his fists, MIKE PACES in frustration, then SLAMS
his fist against the wall -- NOTICING the door has failed
to FULLY SHUT.

HE PUSHES IT OPEN, ENTERING THE APARTMENT, CAMERA
FOLLOWING HIM as he looks for her.  The MUSIC, bounding
off the high ceilings and marble floors, is thunderous.


INT.  CLAIRE'S HALL - NIGHT

                         MIKE
                  (searching for her)
          Claire...?

He moves HURRIEDLY DOWN THE HALL to her BEDROOM, entering,
without warning, to SEE HER REFLECTION in the MIRROR as
she PULLS ON SOME CLOTHES.

                         MIKE
          What are you doing?

The dress on, she SWEEPS past him, heading toward the
doors.

                         CLAIRE
          You told me I'm safe?  I'm going for
          a walk in the park.

                         MIKE
          Claire, will you calm down?

                         CLAIRE
          I'm perfectly calm, I'm a normal
          human being.  I'm going for a walk
          in the park.

                         MIKE
          Claire...!

She heads out the bedroom door.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  HALL - SAME - NIGHT

ANGLE ON CLAIRE:  as she heads down the hall moving fast,
he's right behind her.

                         MIKE
          Stop, will you?!

HE GRABS HER, SPINNING HER AROUND.

                         CLAIRE
                  (struggling)
          Let go!

                         MIKE
          Stop being nuts!

                         CLAIRE
                  (hysterical)
          I trusted you!  I thought you cared
          about me?!

                         MIKE
          I do care about you!

                         CLAIRE
          More bullshit!  More bullshit!
                  (struggling)
          What kind of odds are they giving
          me?  There must be some kind of
          office pool.  One month?  A couple
          of days?

Their physicality reaches a CLIMAX with MIKE pinning her
against the wall, she, restrained by him, finally GIVING
UP, with a SOB, and COLLAPSING INTO HIS ARMS.

                         MIKE
                  (handling her close)
          Easy... easy... I'm not gonna leave
          you alone like this...

ANGLE ON CLAIRE:  gasping as she clings to him.

                         MIKE
          I'm not gonna let anything happen to
          you...

He holds her; makes a tentative move toward her -- and
stops.  She CLOSES THE DISTANCE.  THEY KISS.  They
separate, making sure.  They KISS AGAIN, certain.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  MIKE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

ELLIE startles awake, premonitorily.

ELLIE:  She turns in the darkness to look at the clock.
Heart beating, she reclines again, lying awake, realizing
what it was that woke her.  She listens, hearing it again.

A shuffling SOUND, something moving, outside.

She stirs, sitting up, listening.

ANGLE:  Only silence answers.

ELLIE gets up, dissatisfied by the silence, and moves to
the rear bedroom window.

AT THE REAR WINDOW, she looks out into the darkness.

HER POV - BACK YARD

It's almost impossible to see anything.  Nothing moves.


INT.  HALL/LANDING - NIGHT

ELLIE closes TOMMY'S door, listens again for the SOUND;
starts quietly down the stairs.


INT.  DOWNSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT

ELLIE reaches the ground floor, moving for the kitchen.


INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT

ELLIE enters.  She GASPS.  A SMALL SHADOWED FIGURE TURNS,
CONFRONTING HER.  It's TOMMY, having left his room
earlier.

                         TOMMY
                  (hushed)
          There's somebody outside...

Recovering from the scare, ELLIE grabs him, relieved,
sinking to her KNEES and HOLDING HIM TIGHT.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  CLAIRE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

MIKE gets up, dressing.  CLAIRE watches from the bed.  He
returns her gaze, reluctant to go, but hesitating to touch
her again.  CLAIRE clasps his hand, bringing him closer.
They kiss, in affirmation.


INT.  VESTIBULE - NIGHT

MIKE stands by the front door as T.J. arrives to begin
his duty.

                         T.J.
          We're gonna need snow boots.

MIKE nods, absently, entering the elevator.  The PHONE
starts to RING in the apartment.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  SUBWAY - EARLY A.M. - NIGHT

MIKE; miserable.  The "QUEENS" exit is SEEN APPROACHING
through the TRAIN WINDOW; he attempts to pull himself
together, rising, waiting for the train to stop.


EXT.  MIKE'S STREET - SAME

As MIKE rounds the corner and looks up.  His breath
catches.  His heart starts to pound.

AHEAD, lights ablaze.  ONE COP CAR is in front of his
HOUSE, and a JEEP (Belonging to SCOTTY).  MIKE BREAKS INTO
A RUN.


INT.  MIKE'S ENTRY - NIGHT - MORNING

He rushes in.  The front door is unlocked, lights are on,
but otherwise there is nothing different.  He hears
VOICES.


INT.  MIKE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT - MORNING

MIKE hurries in.  The room is bright.  SCOTTY and another
cop, BROOKLYN from the 117th, look up from the kitchen
table, nursing cups of coffee.  BROOKLYN is on duty;
SCOTTY has come over on his own.

TOMMY has long since been ushered back to bed.  ELLIE
making coffee at the stove, turns as MIKE enters.

She is okay, returning MIKE'S stare with embarrassment.

                         SCOTTY
          Calm down, everything is okay.
          Ellie reported a prowler.  Probably
          one of those peepers who've been
          making this neighborhood such a
          pleasure...

SCOTTY collects his gun from the table, rising.

                         SCOTTY
          We all look like hell.

                         BROOKLYN
                  (rising)
          Well, there you are...
                  (to Ellie,
                   unconcerned)
          I'll come 'round in the car from
          time to time so you can get some
          sleep.  Just keep the shades pulled.

He gives her a peck, yawning.

                         BROOKLYN
          Thanks for the coffee.

                         ELLIE
                  (to both)
          Thanks.  You're terrific.

SCOTTY waves her off with a goodbye, exiting after
BROOKLYN.  ELLIE turns back to MIKE.

                         ELLIE
                  (sheepishly)
          I'm sorry.  I know I heard noises...
          the detective's wife...

                         MIKE
                  (tensely)
          I want you and Tommy to stay with my
          mother.

She shakes her head, amused.

                         ELLIE
          Don't be ridiculous... That's all I
          need, rubbing up against your mother
          and grandmother every day... I can
          take care of myself...
                  (gently, to him)
          C'mon, let's go to bed... we all
          need some sleep...

CLOSE ON MIKE.  Feeling like absolute hell.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  MIKE AND ELLIE'S DINING ROOM - AFTERNOON

MIKE is threading his necktie.  ELLIE stands behind him,
in the kitchen, grinning.

                         ELLIE
          C'mon, don't make an issue of it.
          Do you want the fucking meatloaf or
          not?

                         MIKE
          D'you have to say "fucking" every
          other word?

                         ELLIE
          What was that?

                         MIKE
          You heard me.

                         ELLIE
          Jesus, Mike, somebody's been feeding
          you a line of crap.

                         MIKE
          What're you talking about --

                         ELLIE
          I'm talking about I've been talking
          this way for sixteen years and now,
          out of the blue, it's vulgar!

She leaves the room, slamming the door behind her.  He
looks at himself in the mirror, wondering what's possessed
him.

                         MIKE
          Fuck.  What's happening?


INT.  MIKE'S KITCHEN - DAY

MIKE sits at the table with a cup of coffee.  He watches
ELLIE from the window.

MIKE'S POV

ELLIE:  Tight jeans, workshirt, scarf tied around her
head, she looks great.  She looks up, rinsing a greasy
grill over a bucket of hot water, playfully sprays the
window with the hose, seeing him watching her.

MIKE walking along the platform amidst the crowded car,
returning to his work and his destination.

INT.  CLAIRE'S ENTRY HALL - EVENING

A heavy silence.  MIKE sitting, on duty again.  He keeps
to himself.  He doesn't move from his chair.

CLAIRE finally enters.  She holds tensely, waiting, aware
of his mood.

                         CLAIRE
          Is everything all right?

His stare is unyielding.

                         MIKE
          Yeah.

                         CLAIRE
          They called here after you left...

                         MIKE
                  (sharply)
          She's okay.  Everything's okay...

He looks up.

                         MIKE
                  (anguished)
          I don't know you...

                         CLAIRE
          This is me, Mike.  There's nothing
          else...

                         MIKE
          You don't wash your clothes at the
          Boulevard Laundromat... you don't
          pick up your kids from some crummy
          public school... what is this?  A
          fuckin' joke?

                         CLAIRE
                  (beat; sustaining)
          Okay, then let's make it easy.  It
          was a mistake.  Don't make me feel
          guilty now that it's over, let's
          forget about it.

She walks away; MIKE sits.


INT.  CLAIRE'S STUDY

She turns to her table to resume work.  Scribbled pages
litter the surface.  Her hands betray her.  It's an effort
of will.  MIKE enters, moving closer.

Beginning to cry, she feels his embrace, turning into it.

                         CLAIRE
          Don't you think I know what this is
          doing.  I know you have a wife.  I
          know you have a family... I'm not
          asking for anything.  I don't want
          anything... Just please hold me I'm
          scared...

INT.  CLAIRE'S BEDROOM - EARLY A.M. - NIGHT

CLAIRE lies asleep.  MIKE leans over her as she wakes,
meeting his gaze, bringing him closer before he goes.
They kiss.  He withdraws, tenderly returning her gaze and
returning her to sleep.


INT.  HER HALLWAY - EARLY A.M. - NIGHT

T.J. standing in the hallway.

                         T.J.
          Mike...?

ANGLE ON T.J., as the bedroom DOOR OPENS -- REVEALING
MIKE.  T.J. recoils with surprise.

                         T.J.
          Oh, man.  I don't believe you.

MIKE steps out, closing the door behind him; distraught.

                         MIKE
                  (beat)
          All fucked up, T.J.

T.J. issues a long, saddened sigh; just staring at him.

INT.  MIKE AND ELLIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

MIKE sits in a chair by the far wall, staring out toward
Manhattan, which glows palely, in the distance.  Now PAN
OVER THE BED where ELLIE lies asleep.  But as WE MOVE
CLOSE TO HER FACE, WE SEE she is not asleep; wide-eyed,
aware of MIKE in the chair.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

INT.  MIKE AND ELLIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - LATER

ELLIE stirs as MIKE slips between the sheets.  She
embraces him, starts to kiss him.  He rolls over.

A moment of silence.

                         ELLIE
          You gotta get another tour.  We're
          gettin' too old for this.

                         MIKE
          I'm sorry.

                         ELLIE
          I'm not saying it's your fault.

More silence.

                         MIKE
          What did you do tonight?

                         ELLIE
          I watched TV.

                         MIKE
          What did you watch?

                         ELLIE
          I don't remember Michael, go to
          sleep.  You don't have to make
          conversation with me.

She snuggles up to him.

                         ELLIE
          I'll make a reservation tomorrow for
          early dinner.  You can sleep till
          noon.

INT.  BROOKLYN RESTAURANT - EVENING

THE LIGHTS of New York beginning to sparkle against a
darkening sky; MIKE and ELLIE at a table that looks out on
the East River.  It's an OK restaurant, not the poshest in
the world.  ELLIE finds herself carrying most of the
conversation.  They scan menus to order.

                         ELLIE
          Hey, we qualify for the Senior
          Citizens Early-Bird Special... Did
          you see Tommy today?  He misses
          you...

                         MIKE
          Well.  This'll be over soon.
          Venza's such a nut job, we're bound
          to pick him up soon.

                         ELLIE
                  (carefully)
          I'd like you to switch to the day
          shift, Mike.  To be home for dinner.
          Helen insists that T.J. be home for
          dinner... That's why he's on the
          morning shift.

                         MIKE
          Well, T.J.'s... seniority... and
          all.
                  (evasive)
          I'll talk to Garber about it.

                         ELLIE
                  (girds herself)
          I already did.  I mean, I talked to
          his wife, and she talked to him...

                         MIKE
                  (stopped)
          You talked to his wife?

CLOSE ON MIKE:  incredulous.

                         MIKE
          My wife talks to his wife about what
          shift I'm gonna take?

                         ELLIE
          What's the difference?

MIKE is nonplused; not knowing how to respond.

                         ELLIE
          Unless there's some particular
          reason why it feels better to be
          around her at night.

He shakes his head, dismissively.

                         ELLIE
          Is there, Mike?

No response; MIKE having trouble with it.

CLOSE ON ELLIE:  sensing deception.  Her eyes begin to
glisten.

CLOSE ON MIKE:  seeing her distress.  Unable to hide his
own.

She looks at him -- and knowing him as well as she does,
is certain.  She puts a hand in front of her mouth in an
attempt not to cry.

                         ELLIE
          What, what is it?  Is it serious or
          what...?  Quit looking at me like
          that!  What's with this ridiculous
          silence?!

Her eyes flush with tears.

                         ELLIE
          Goddamn.  I never thought this
          would happen to me... you fuckin'
          sonofabitch...

She UPSETS her SETTING, GETTING UP from the TABLE, shaking
him off.

                         ELLIE
          I just want you off the case.  Get
          off it, or don't come home.
                  (her voice trembling)
          And I want you to remember... when
          we're old... that when this awful
          thing happened... I behaved like a
          lady.
                  (embittered)
          The kind of "lady" you apparently
          prefer.

                         WAITER
                  (approaching)
          We got some specials.

She BOLTS from the room; MIKE following her.

                         MIKE
                  (to the waiter)
          We'll be right back.

EXT.  RESTAURANT - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

She weaves toward the car.  MIKE goes after her.

                         MIKE
          Let me drive...

                         ELLIE
          Get away from me... get away!  She
          means that much to you, you stay
          with her.  But you come back, you
          come back for me.  Not for Tommy,
          not for your mother, or your fucking
          job, but for me.

                         MIKE
                  (tortured)
          El?  I'm sorry.  I do love you.
                  (with difficulty)
          And you are a lady.  I have so much
          respect...

She TURNS and SWINGS AT HIM, catching him SQUARE IN THE
NOSE; he's stunned and bleeding.

                         ELLIE
                  (through her tears;
                   screaming)
          You fucker!  Don't tell me how much
          respect you have!  You dumb mother
          fucking FUCKER!  Now get off this
          case or don't come home!!

She RUNS to her car, BURNING RUBBER as she PEELS out of
the PARKING LOT -- leaving MIKE, distraught, gazing after
her.

EXT.  PHONE BOOTH - BROOKLYN BRIDGE - SAME - EVENING

TRAFFIC ROARING BY -- revealing MIKE, upset, on a pay
phone, a finger in one ear, waiting for the phone to
answer.

                         MIKE
          Hey, T.J.?  Yeah, listen, I need a
          huge favor from you, man.  I know
          Helen doesn't like you to miss
          dinner, but I need you to switch
          shifts with me tonight.
                  (a beat)
          Just "personal".  I don't know what
          the hell I'm doin', I need some time
          to think.
                  (angered)
          Look, do it or don't do it, but
          spare me the fuckin' lecture, all
          right?

He HANGS UP:  miserable.

EXT.  CLAIRE'S BUILDING - EVENING

A SQUAD CAR parked in front, CAMERA PANNING to the DOORS,
as the JOGGER (MR. SPARKS) EXITS, dressed in his usual
outfit, POUNDING DETERMINEDLY across the street.

ANOTHER ANGLE:  as he LOPES INTO THE PARK.

ANOTHER ANGLE:  as he REACHES a STOPLIGHT CROSSING that's
"RED"; he waits to cross, jogging in place; crosses into
the park.  A sinister lone black LIMO approaches, slowing
to a stop behind him, its back door slowly swinging open,
engulfing our sight of him...

EXT.  CLAIRE'S BUILDING - LATER

The "JOGGER" returning, obscuring his identity from the
parked PATROL CAR, by wiping his face with a towel.
Before heading to the door, where a DOORMAN stands guard,
he delays as though WAITING FOR SOMETHING.

It's happening:  A dainty teenage VIETNAMESE GIRL,
distracts the DOORMAN at his post, getting enough of his
attention SELLING FLOWERS, and SPOUTING VIETNAMESE, for
the "JOGGER" to SLIP BY, making it inside.

                         DOORMAN
          I know sweetheart... we have enough
          flowers here.

ANGLE:  VIETNAMESE GIRL, still spouting.

                         DOORMAN
          No, no, sweetheart... not here...
          get going... Okay.

ANGLE: VIETNAMESE GIRL, backing off, seeing the JOGGER
slip by and her mission accomplished.

                         VIETNAMESE GIRL
                  (sweetly, to Doorman)
          Have a nice day.

THE GIRL:  slyly cursing the DOORMAN in Vietnamese as she
skips off.

The "JOGGER," his face still obscured by the towel waits
for the elevator, as T.J., arriving, ENTERS the building.
They both enter the elevator in silence.

ANGLE on T.J. glancing at the JOGGER quizzically.  The
JOGGER avoids his stare, CAMERA TILTING UP to the
indicator, beginning to rise.

As the killer closes the door.  He's in the kitchen.  All
is quiet in there.

IN CLOSEUPS, WE SEE his JOGGING SHIRT coming off,
revealing a shoulder holster; a specially designed "belt"
removed and laid on the kitchen table.  A "SILENCER"
within.

INT.  CLAIRE'S KITCHEN - EVENING

CLAIRE eagerly and earnestly preparing dinner.  She makes
some fluffs, not really used to this.  CLASSICAL MUSIC
plays.  She looks up expectantly, hearing the FOOTSTEPS.

CLOSE ON CLAIRE:  surprised to see it's T.J.

                         T.J.
          Detective Keegan is... Mike...
          "Michael" asked me to tell you he's
          under the weather.

CLAIRE:  She handles it, crestfallen.

                         T.J.
          He'll probably take the morning
          shift.

                         CLAIRE
          He's okay?

T.J. spots, over his shoulder, the table, set for two.

                         T.J.
          Yeah, just... bad gut.  Y'know.

                         CLAIRE
          Oh.

Nothing left to say; she hides her disappointment with a
nod.

EXT.  CITY STREET - FIFTH AVENUE - NIGHT

Active with nightlife; CAMERA PANNING to a lone figure
walking in the night.  It's MIKE; his collar turned up
against the cold, his face grim and pensive.  He passes an
art gallery and PAUSES to gaze in, his eyes refocusing on
his own reflection staring back at him.

CLAIRE immobile, on a window seat in her LIVING ROOM, the
CLASSICAL MUSIC still playing softly in the background,
her eyes empty as she gazes out into the park.

THE MUSIC CONTINUES OVER:

EXT.  CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT

Outside and far below, the GLOW from the tip of a
CIGARETTE REDDENS the darkness with an inhalation.

VENZA:  He stands, impervious to the cold, looking up at
the windows of CLAIRE'S apartment.

ANGLE UP TO CLAIRE:  SILHOUETTED in the distant window.

VENZA:  finishes his butt, flicks it, satisfied, getting
into HIS CAR curbside and driving away.

INT.  CLAIRE'S VESTIBULE - NIGHT

T.J., DOZING as the ELEVATOR INDICATOR HEADS UPWARD --
finally reaching our FLOOR.

The DOORS OPEN, STARTLING T.J.  He stares at MIKE with
DISMAY.  MUSIC IS HEARD from just inside.

                         T.J.
                  (fatigued)
          Tell me I'm dreamin'.

                         MIKE
          I just gotta talk to her, T.J.

MIKE ENTERS, closing the doors behind him.


INT.  CLAIRE'S APARTMENT - SAME - NIGHT

Silent, save for CLASSICAL MUSIC -- as MIKE quietly
enters.

He pauses a moment, his eyes filled with unhappiness, then
MOVES in the direction of the MUSIC -- SPOTTING CLAIRE,
immobile since we last saw her, still gazing out the
window.

CLOSE ON MIKE:  as always, AFFECTED BY HER.

She becomes aware of his presence and slowly TURNS.  For a
long moment, neither seems willing to move -- or speak.
Finally, he does.

                         MIKE
          T.J. agreed to take my shift.  He
          knows about us.

She absorbs it, without response.

                         MIKE
                  (a beat; with
                   difficulty)
          So does Ellie.

She nods.  Thoughtfully.  As though willing to deal with
it intellectually, but avoiding any encounter with her
emotions.

                         CLAIRE
          You told her?

                         MIKE
          Not exactly.

                         CLAIRE
          What do you want to do?

                         MIKE
          I don't know.

Her eyes turn to his.  She moves toward him and sits.
CLAIRE pulls him close to her.  A soft GERSHWIN TUNE
plays.  She sees how drawn MIKE is.

                         CLAIRE
          You're tired.
                  (smiles, gently)
          Let me watch over you tonight...

her work at the bedroom desk nearby; glances gently over,

paraphernalia left on the kitchen table, being assembled
by the "JOGGER".

As the ELEVATOR slides to a stop, its DOOR GLIDING OPEN.
THE KILLER, keeping himself flattened back out of sight,
glances quickly out, gun and reflexes at the ready.

It's unnecessary.  The vestibule's deserted; T.J.'S post
is momentarily empty.

The KILLER steps silently, EASING out the elevator.

INT.  CLAIRE'S APARTMENT - SAME - NIGHT

As T.J. emerges from the bathroom.  He stretches, trying
to shake his fatigue.  Making a decision, he HEADS for the
KITCHEN to get a cup of coffee -- CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM as
he ENTERS, snapping on the light.

MOVING directly to the stove, he examines the Mr. Coffee;
the red "ON" button glows, but the pot is virtually empty.

Picking it up, he MOVES TO THE SINK, turning on the tap,
which is a thin, gooseneck spigot.  He look up, hearing a
slight SHUFFLE, seeing the KILLER'S FEET sticking out of
the shadows of the floor of the LAUNDRY ROOM.

T.J. reacts -- TOO LATE -- there's a slight chung, and a
hole opens up in T.J.'S gut; the bullet that went through
him, ricocheting and nicking off the end of the thin,
curving tap, sending a stream of water gushing straight
up.

The KILLER moves quickly, catching T.J.'S body, trying to
break its fall as it hits the floor.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  CLAIRE'S BEDROOM - SAME - NIGHT

CLAIRE asleep in MIKE'S PROTECTIVE EMBRACE:  MIKE, awake,
his eyes to the bedside table, notices the almost
imperceptible disturbance of VIBRATION ripple the surface
of the DRINK left there by the clock.

MIKE sits up; as if by instinct, sensing something is
wrong.  CLAIRE continues to sleep.


INT.  CLAIRE'S HALLWAY/OUTER BEDROOM - SAME - NIGHT

The KILLER OPENS THE BEDROOM SUITE DOOR, steps into the
ANTEROOM.  Off to the right is the closed DOOR of the
BEDROOM.  He steps in the direction, reaching the doorknob
-- thinks twice about it, though, seeing the door on the
other side of the anteroom which would take him the
longer, but unexpected route into the bedroom.  He backs
off, moving silently to the OTHER DOOR, turning it open
silently and slipping through into the CLOSET and WALK-
THROUGH DRESSING ROOM leading to the bedroom by the far
side.


INT.  CLAIRE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

MIKE:  on the other side of the door, listening.

He opens the door quietly, sees the anteroom door ajar,
remembering that he had closed it before.  He tightens,
closing the door and moving back to his gun in its holster
draped over the chair with his other clothes.


INT.  DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

The KILLER enters the reflective maze.


INT.  MASTER BATH - NIGHT

MIKE moves silently, backtracking through the bedroom and
bathroom toward the DOORS leading to the dressing room
ahead.


INT.  DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

The KILLER passes the door he wants, thinking it's just
another mirror; finds himself in the totally MIRRORED
ENVIRONMENT of the MAIN DRESSING AREA.

On the other side of the door, MIKE HEARS HIM, tightening
his grip on his gun and on the doorknob as he REACHES for
it.  MIKE grasps it, turning and opening the door
silently.  But the latch connects to the light, and the
LIGHT GOES ON OVERHEAD of MIKE.

The KILLER reacts quickly, gun drawn, on the turn.  But he
faces SEVERAL REFLECTIONS OF MIKE in front of him -- and
MIKE IS BEHIND HIM.

MIKE LEVELS AIM AT HIM.

                         MIKE
          Put it down!
                  (beat)
          Think about it!

The KILLER takes his chances, WHIRLING.  MIKE FIRES FIRST,
NAILING HIM right through the HEAD.  The KILLER SPINS
AGAIN, SLAMMING UP against the MIRRORS and falling DEAD to
the floor.

IN THE BEDROOM:  CLAIRE wakes.

MIKE:  checking quickly on the dead assassin, flattens
himself against the wall and scurries back through the
bath the way back into the BEDROOM.

                         MIKE
                  (entering, to Claire)
          Get on the floor!  There may be
          more!

CLAIRE does what he says.

MIKE RACES into the CORRIDOR, hugging the wall; he PAUSES
momentarily, then RACES down the HALL.

ANGLE ON THE OPENED FRONT DOOR as he REACHES IT, seeing
T.J.'S CHAIR empty.

                         MIKE
                  (desperate)
          T.J.!

MIKE RUNS, frantically, into the living room, the
bathroom, the den -- CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM into the
KITCHEN.

CLOSE ON HIS FACE:  twisting with GRIEF.

ANGLE ON T.J. face down in a pool of blood, MIKE RACING
TO HIM, rolling him over.

                         MIKE
                  (sobs)
          T.J...!

MIKE moves by REFLEX, starting mouth-to-mouth.  But there
is blood everywhere.

MIKE desperate; pumping T.J.'S chest.

                         MIKE
          Live, T.J.  Please...!

CLAIRE appears behind him, to help.

                         MIKE
                  (to her)
          Get security on the phone!
          Emergency!

She RUNS to the KITCHEN PHONE; it's dead, the WIRES CUT.

She TURNS, HURRYING to the VESTIBULE and THE ELEVATOR,
pulling the alarm, sagging in collapse.  The ALARM goes
off within the shaft, THROUGHOUT the building.

ANGLE ON MIKE:  shirtless and shoeless, on his knees in
T.J.'S blood, desperately pumping his chest.

                         MIKE
                  (his voice cracking)
          Ambulance!  Ambulance!  He's got a
          heartbeat...!

INT.  HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NEAR DAWN

MIKE alone on a bench, his head in his hands:  a couple of
COPS we recognize from the Precinct stand a distance away,
at a coffee machine, talking softly as they glance at him.
It is not yet dawn.

FOOTSTEPS are HEARD coming TOWARD; MIKE looks up to see
GARBER APPROACHING, his expression appropriate to the
occasion.  GARBER reaches him; they exchange a long look,
MIKE'S eyes etched with anguish.

                         MIKE
                  (softly)
          They're operating on him.  He's
          still alive.

                         GARBER
                  (grim)
          I heard.

A long pause, as he looks at MIKE.

                         GARBER
          I heard a lot... Anything you want
          to deny, Mike?

                         MIKE
                  (almost inaudibly)
          It should've been me...

GARBER:  aware of his own dilemma.

                         GARBER
          Then it would've been her, too.
                  (beat)
          I don't know... but I gotta protect
          the Precinct, too.  You're on
          suspension, pending Disciplinary
          Hearings.  Don't hold your breath.
          And you're not to go near that woman
          until she's no longer under Police
          protection and this case is closed.

ANGLE ON MIKE:  responding with a silent nod as GARBER
stands looking down at him.

                         GARBER
          Is it "love," Mike?  I hope so.  I
          want it to be worth it, for your
          sake.

No response.

In the response that follows, they HEAR MOVEMENT at the
end of the HALL, looking up to see the silhouetted figures
of ELLIE, with HELEN GREENING in tow.  They look small,
and lost, framed against a floor-to-ceiling window that's
beginning to illuminate with the first light of day.

Heavy with sadness, GARBER turns and heads toward the
women.  Taking a long moment.  MIKE decides not to follow.

CLOSE ON MIKE

CAMERA STAYS AT THIS DISTANCE as the THREESOME comes
together.  We do not hear their words, but sense the
emotion by what WE SEE.  After a brief exchange of words,
GARBER takes HELEN GREENING under his arm, and they MOVE
AWAY -- leaving MIKE and ELLIE alone.

CLOSER ANGLE:  MIKE and ELLIE, gazing at each other across
the gulf of their collective misery.

                         ELLIE
          I'm going to visit my sister for a
          few days.  I'd like you to get your
          stuff out.

                         MIKE
          What about Tommy?

                         ELLIE
          He'll live through it.  They all
          live through it.
                  (bitter)
          What a world, huh?

Nothing left to say; after a long, last look, she turns to
go.  But stops.

                         ELLIE
          Was it Venza?  Did you get him?

          No.

The last thing she's going to do is cry.

                  (her voice giving
                   out)
          What a shame.

She TURNS and LEAVES:  MIKE gazing after her.

INT.  SCOTTY'S "BACHELOR PAD" - DAY

MIKE is being shown in by SCOTTY, luggage in hand, SCOTTY
doing his best to be a good "host," under trying
circumstances.

                         SCOTTY
          You see a couple of the parties that
          go on at this place, you'll realize
          that marriage is an institution
          whose time has come and gone.

Opening a bedroom door.  They've entered a bedroom that's
sparse, but decorated with A BOY'S PARAPHERNALIA;
skateboard, "rock" posters, etc.  It looks sad and barren.

                         SCOTTY
          Little Scotty stays on Wednesdays,
          and every other weekend.  And know
          what?  Our relationship's never been
          better.

MIKE stares at the room, his heart too heavy to respond.
SCOTTY, with a pat on the back.

                         SCOTTY
          Make it home, Mike...

He leaves -- and after a long moment MIKE sits on the edge
of the bed, like an automaton.  Staring.

CLAIRE and NEIL in the aftermath.  CLAIRE remains silent,
staring.  Whatever is to be said is his.

                  (frustrated)
          I'm no saint, Claire, but I do love
          you.  I can understand the pressure
          of the circumstances... but what
          about when it's over?  Are you going
          to feel the same way about him?  Is
          he going to move in here and do
          shift work at the 21st if they'll
          have him back.  Think this through
          Claire.
                  (with feeling)
          This is the rest of your life we're
          talking about.

NEIL staring at her.

                         CLAIRE
          I have thought it through, Neil.

He adverts his gaze, turns, controlling himself, and picks
up his coat to go.

          Call me if anything changes.  I love

She attempts a laugh, trying to keep it "light".

          I'm taking them all out to Queens,

EXT.  QUEENS - SAME - DAY

CAMERA PANNING TO REVEAL MIKE, leaning on a CAR, under the
"El" waiting.  HE SPOTS TOMMY, coming around the corner
with his SKATEBOARD under his arm, going into a grocery
store.  MIKE crosses the street as TOMMY comes out of the
store.

                         MIKE
          Tommy!

TOMMY SPOTS HIM:  hesitant -- slowly approaching the car.

                         MIKE
          How are things going, pal?

                         TOMMY
          Okay, I guess.

                         MIKE
          How about dinner tonight?

                         TOMMY
                  (evasive)
          Mom and I got plans.

                         MIKE
          What "plans?"  You and Mom got
          "plans?"

                         TOMMY
                  (after a long pause)
          She's taking singing lessons.

                         MIKE
                  (incredulous)
          She's what?

                         TOMMY
          She met some friend of Aunt Millie's
          who works for a record company.  He
          thinks she's got a great voice.

TOMMY is mum:  something dawns on MIKE that sobers him up.

                         MIKE
                  (outraged)
          What!  What kind of pathetic line is
          that?

                         TOMMY
                  (pointing)
          We're gonna pass the street.

MIKE stops.  His goat is gotten.

                         TOMMY
          You coming in?

                         MIKE
          No, I'm not coming in.  And if you'd
          rather go to a "singing lesson" than
          have dinner with your father...

                         TOMMY
          We're not going to a singing lesson,
          she's just gonna start taking
          singing lessons.

                         MIKE
          So, what are you doing tonight?

                         TOMMY
          Shooting.

                         MIKE
          Shooting?

                         TOMMY
          Yeah.  She says we gotta get used to
          being alone in this neighborhood.
                  (a long beat;
                   observing his
                   father)
          'Bye, Dad.

TOMMY starts toward the HOUSE.  He's emotional, but
doesn't know how to express it.

                         MIKE
          Tommy!
                  (a parting shot)
          The guy's a sleaze-bag.  She can't
          sing.

                         TOMMY
                  (turning back,
                   smiling)
          I don't think she can sing, either.

                         MIKE
          Take care, pal.

HE TURNS AWAY.

ANOTHER ANGLE:  MIKE'S CAR LEAVING.  TOMMY watches it
until it can be seen no longer, then TURNS, going into the
house.

CAMERA PANS SLOWLY -- REVEALING, far down the BLOCK, a
CAR.  VENZA, and ANOTHER MAN (SOSA), are within:
WATCHING.


EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

MIKE pounds it out running on the darkened street.  He
pauses to look up at his dark, empty house as a PATROL CAR

INT.  MILTON GREGORY - BANQUET HALL - EVENING

Overhead, chandeliers gleam.  A small orchestra comprised
of STUDENTS of the school plays a variety of tunes.
Mirrors reflect a profusion of flowers, carved gilt and
candlelight.

Gloved service PERSONNEL wait to be of service at the
sides.  The room is quite large yet intimate.  The tables
set perfectly.  GUESTS continue to move toward their
places engaged in animated chatter.

ANOTHER ANGLE:  CLAIRE moving through the crowd,
PLAINCLOTHESMEN flanking her as anonymously as possible
(KOONTZ among them), HER EYES anxious, scanning the crowd.

SHE'S SPOTTED by the PRINCIPAL of the school (GIDDINGS),
who APPROACHES, surprised to see her.

                         GIDDINGS
          Hello, Claire.  How extraordinary
          that you came.

                         CLAIRE
          It was something my father always

                  (understands; gamely)

SPEECHES droning on -- CAMERA FINDING CLAIRE at a round
dinner table, with OTHERS, who think they're engaging her
in conversation; but her thoughts are elsewhere, her eyes
continually glancing toward the doors -- both hoping and
fearing.

INT.  THE BANQUET ROOM - LATER

The SPEECHES have long since ENDED, PEOPLE DANCING, slow
dances to the live orchestra -- CAMERA PANNING to CLAIRE,
sitting in silent isolation at the now sparsely populated
table, having lost hope, feeling utterly alone.  Her chin
is resting in her hand, her eyes fixed sadly on her wine
glass.  PLAINCLOTHESMEN, situated around her, study her
dispassionately.

CLOSE ON HER FACE:  expressionless.  But it slowly gains
animation, as she realizes the MUSIC has changed, made a
segue to something new.  It's "SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME."

SHE LOOKS UP -- to see MIKE; his approach from the
bandstand indicating that the change of music was his
doing.

HER FACE breaks into the most enormous, and grateful,
GRIN.

CLOSE ON MIKE:  returning the smile as he COMES TOWARD.

                         KOONTZ
                  (as he passes)
          Don't do it, man.  I love ya, but
          you're out of your mind.

Uncaring, MIKE MOVES TO CLAIRE.

ANGLE ON BOTH:  gazing at each other.

                         CLAIRE
                  (overwhelmed)
          What a memory.

                         MIKE
          Do you dance?

                         CLAIRE
          Do you?

                         MIKE
          Pretty bad.

                         CLAIRE
          Let's do it.

They TAKE to the FLOOR, she MOVING INTO HIS ARMS.  She
puts her head on his shoulder, then draws back to look at
him, studying his face with the hunger of a woman who
knows it might be for the last time.

                         MIKE
          They guys treatin' you all right?

                         CLAIRE
                  (too emotional to
                   really talk)
          Yeah.

                         MIKE
          I've been doing a lot of thinking.

                         CLAIRE
                  (a pause)
          I know.

CLOSE ON HIM:  studying her saddened eyes.

                         MIKE
          It wouldn't work.

                         CLAIRE
          I know.

The conversation is deeply caring; the tone opposite to
the words.

                         MIKE
          I'd miss my life...

                         CLAIRE
          ... Don't explain.

She rests her head on his shoulders again; they continue
to dance.

                         MIKE
          How long you going away for?

                         CLAIRE
          Long enough.

                         MIKE
          "For"...?

                         CLAIRE
          "To"... Forget about you.

CLOSE ON HER:  awash in the nearness of him.

                         CLAIRE
          I'll have to pack a lot of clothes.

                         MIKE
                  (choked up)
          Yeah...

He holds her tight -- his eyes EMOTIONAL as they roam the
room --

But HIS EXPRESSION CHANGES as he SPOTS SOMETHING at a far
end of the room.  Near the rear doors.

It's a PLAINCLOTHESMEN, headed purposefully toward KOONTZ,
conferring with him -- both men looking to MIKE, a sense
of bewilderment in their eyes.

ANGLE ON MIKE:  Stopping -- as KOONTZ heads quickly
toward.

                         KOONTZ
          Brook's patching a call through to
          you.  He thought he'd find you here.
          It sounds urgent.

MIKE:  Baffled.

                         KOONTZ
          He says it's your son.

Exchanging a quick LOOK with CLAIRE, MIKE heads for the
DOORS; she pauses, heading after.

                                            CUT TO:

OUTER LOBBY - SAME

as MIKE BARRELS through doors.

                         KOONTZ
                  (pointing)
          The office down the hall.

MIKE BREAKS INTO A RUN.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  OFFICE - SAME

as MIKE RACES IN; A PLAINCLOTHESMAN hands him the phone.

                         PLAINCLOTHESMAN #2
          He's crying.

                         MIKE
                  (grabbing the phone)
          Tommy?  What...?
                  (frightened)
          What?!  Hello?
                  (listening; stunned)
          Who is this?
                  (trying to be calm)
          Yeah.  I'm listening.
                  (quick)
          No.  Nobody but me.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  MIKE'S HOUSE - NIGHT - SAME MOMENT

CLOSE ON the RECEIVER of the PHONE:  as JOEY VENZA'S mouth
SPEAKS into it --

The images of ELLIE and TOMMY SEEN, dimly lit, in the
background, petrified; GUARDED by a SECOND MAN (SOSA)
whose figure is shrouded in darkness.

                         VENZA
          I'm glad you're where I expected you
          to be, Detective Keegan, 'cause
          you're got two minutes to get home
          or I take your family out.

                                            CUT TO:

MIKE - SAME

caught in a nightmare.

                         MIKE
                  (desperate)
          I heard you.  I'll do it.  Just
          don't touch them.
                  (a beat)
          I...
                  (a pause)
          Lemme talk to my son.
                  (suddenly)
          Hello?

It goes dead.  MIKE PARALYZED with FEAR.  CLAIRE is
ENTERING, PLAINCLOTHESMAN #1 close to her heels, MIKE'S
breath coming in SHUDDERS as he stares helplessly at her
-- then turns to the PLAINCLOTHESMAN and KOONTZ.

                         MIKE
                  (stunned)
          They got my family.
                  (to Koontz)
          I need you guys.

                         PLAINCLOTHESMAN #1
          Who...

                         MIKE
          Venza.

OTHER PLAINCLOTHESMEN are COMING.

                         MIKE
          At my house...!

                         KOONTZ
                  (shouting to others)
          Call a cruiser!

                         CLAIRE
          ... Mike.

                         MIKE
                  (to Claire)
          It's Venza.  He wants you.  You, for
          Ellie and Tommy.

                         KOONTZ
                  (to Claire)
          Let's go.
                  (to others; urgent)
          We're takin' her home!
                  (swinging into
                   crisis mode)
          Move it!  Get the cars!

                         MIKE
                  (pleading)
          Koontz!  I need you guys!

                         KOONTZ
          We'll call SWAT.  We'll get the
          locals.
                  (re: another cops's
                   radio)
          Throw it!

                         MIKE
                  (pleading)
          No, I need'm now!

                         CLAIRE
                  (to Koontz)
          Go with him!

                         KOONTZ
          My job is to protect you!
                  (into radio)
          This is Koontz --

                         MIKE
                  (near hysteria)
          No One-Seventeen, they'll fuck it
          up!  He told me not to tell anybody,
          to bring Claire and come alone!  He
          won't wait, he knows I'm two minutes
          away!  Koontz, please!

                         KOONTZ
          I can't do it, you know that... He's
          not gonna allow it anyway, Mike.  No
          way is he gonna let anybody walk out
          of that house alive, who can finger
          him.

MIKE WHIRLS, heedlessly, running for the DOORS, CLAIRE
RACING AFTER HIM.

                         PLAINCLOTHESMAN #1
                  (calling after her)
          Hey...!

                         CLAIRE
          Mike!  Don't go there...!  Then make
          them come with you!

                         MIKE
          They can't, they're assigned to
          you!  I'd do the same thing!

He RACES OUT THE DOOR:  she in PURSUIT.

                         KOONTZ
                  (re: Claire)
          Go get her.

PLAINCLOTHESMAN #1 hurries out.

                         KOONTZ
                  (reconsidering)
          Fuck it, man.  Our brother needs us.
          Let's go.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  MILTON GREGORY SCHOOL - SAME MOMENT - NIGHT

MIKE BOUNDING to his car, CLAIRE hot on his heels.  She
JUMPS into the PASSENGER SEAT, pounding the DOOR LOCK
SHUT.

                         MIKE
                  (into his car)
          Go!  Get outta here!

PLAINCLOTHESMAN #1 REACHES HER, pulling on the DOOR.

                         PLAINCLOTHESMAN #1
          Hey!

                         MIKE
          Get OUT!

                         CLAIRE
          They're assigned to me, they'll have
          to go if I come with you!

MIKE HESITATES.

                         CLAIRE
                  (screaming)
          I'm not getting out!  GO!

MIKE hits the ACCELERATOR -- PEELING OUT, leaving
PLAINCLOTHESMAN #1 stranded on the curb.

                         KOONTZ
                  (calling to him,
                   emerging)
          Adams...!  C'mon, move it!

EXT.  STREETS OF QUEENS - SAME - NIGHT

MIKE'S CAR tearing down the STREET -- PURSUED by TWO MORE
SQUAD CARS, one of them not knowing better, GIVING VOICE

MIKE'S terrified eyes glancing into the REARVIEW MIRROR.

                         MIKE
          Turn off the siren...!

Luckily, THEY DO.

CLOSE ON CLAIRE:  wide-eyed.  In silence.

                         MIKE
                  (breathless)
          We get there, you get down, stay out
          of sight.  Don't get near that
          house.  Understand me?  Venza's not
          to know you're there!

She NODS:  terrified.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  MIKE'S HOUSE - SAME - NIGHT

As MIKE'S CAR COMES TO A SCREECHING HALT, MIKE RUNNING OUT
as CLAIRE DUCKS DOWN.  The house is COMPLETELY DARKENED,
blending in with the night; the PURSUIT CARS CONVERGE as
MIKE makes it to the DOOR, his HANDS TREMBLING as he
FUMBLES with his KEYS... takes a deep breath... and
ENTERS.

                                            CUT TO:

INT.  THE HOUSE - SAME - NIGHT

Darkened and pin-drop silent.  They only thing that can be
heard is the SOUND of CAR DOORS slamming outside, as COPS
run into combat positions.

                         MIKE
          Tommy?  Ellie...?

The SOUND of a MUFFLED WHIMPER comes from the kitchen; he
HEADS TOWARD down a narrow HALLWAY.  He falters, ALMOST
STEPPING on a SKATEBOARD.

                         MIKE
                  (calling out)
          I'm not armed!  I'm the only one in
          here!  I can help you get away if
          you listen to what I say!

He's used to the SOUND OF HIS VOICE to mask the slight
"roll" of the SKATEBOARD under his foot:  He's sliding it
into the middle of the doorway.

                         MIKE
          I'm comin' in the kitchen!  If you
          fuckin' shoot me, they'll come in
          here, and we're all dead!  You hear
          me, Venza?!

No answer -- MIKE continues on, girding himself as he
steps into the KITCHEN DOORWAY.  He tries the light-
switch; it doesn't work.  And then a VOICE SPEAKS.  Its
breath, like his, is labored; the VOICE CRACKLING with
tension.

                         VENZA
          You made a terrible mistake, Keegan.
          You didn't do what I said.

                         MIKE
                  (his voice shaking)
          That's right, you're gonna do what I
          say.
                  (desperate)
          Joey.  I want to help you out of
          this.

                         VENZA
          You should'a brought the girl.

                         MIKE
          I brought the girl.  She's outside.

He MOVES to the WINDOW; it's right BESIDE THE TABLE.
VENZA TENSING.

                         VENZA
          Hold it...!

                         MIKE
          I'll prove it!

He LIFTS THE WINDOW, CALLING OUT:

                         MIKE
          Claire!

                         CLAIRE (V.O.)

CLAIRE, having shouted from behind a COP CAR:  KOONTZ
grabbing hold of her to keep her in place.

                         KOONTZ
                  (a hiss of warning)
          Not another word until I tell you.

          How do I know that's her?

                         MIKE
          I'll bring her in.  You let them go,
          and I'll bring her in.

                         VENZA
                  (wary)
          Why should she come in?

                         MIKE
          She trusts me.  She'll do what I
          say.

                         VENZA
          Bullshit!  Prove it.

                         MIKE
                  (calls out the
                   window)
          Koontz!  Let her come in!  Claire!
          It's pitch dark in here!
                  (his words are
                   carefully chosen)
          You're gonna have trouble seeing
          anything, so just come in, and
          straight down a long hall.  Then
          stand at the door so we can see you.
          We want to see your face and we
          won't be able to until you get to
          the kitchen door!

KOONTZ receiving his "message".  Quickly assessing CLAIRE,
he looks to the COPS around him -- then GRITS HIS TEETH
with DECISION.

INT.  THE KITCHEN - SAME - NIGHT

                         MIKE
          I want your guarantee they'll be
          turned loose when she opens the
          front door.

                         VENZA
          I get my hostage first.  No one's
          turned loose until I say so.

                         MIKE
          Let my kid go.

                         VENZA
          I'm not lettin' no one go.

                         MIKE
          Get that gun away from his head, or
          I'll keep her from coming in!  Put
          the gun on me, he can't hurt you!
          He's tied up!  Put him under the
          table!

                         VENZA
          Don't you fuckin' give orders to
          me...

                         MIKE
          Put him under the table or I'll stop
          her from coming in.

MIKE turns to the window, about to shout.

                         VENZA
                  (to Tommy, an order)
          Under the table.

                         MIKE
          I'll take his place, all right?  Put
          the gun to my head.

MIKE YANKS TOMMY under the TABLE, taking HIS PLACE in THE
CHAIR; the COCKED GUN presses up against MIKE'S TEMPLE.

ANGLE ON ELLIE:  Her widened eyes continuing to INDICATE
"beneath the table".

CLOSE ON TOMMY, ON HIS KNEES, his hands tied behind his
back; emitting a whimper of terror.

                         ELLIE
          Be careful, Tommy.

HE LOOKS UP:  SPOTTING HER GUN, where she'd hidden it for
safe-keeping, TAPED SECURELY, just OVER HIS HEAD.

The FRONT DOOR OPENS -- with a SLOW CREAK -- the FIGURE OF
CLAIRE, her dress silhouetted by the moonlight from
outside, SEEN standing in the front hallway.

                         MIKE
                  (frantic)
          Claire!  It's dark.  Watch your
          step.  Come slowly.

ANGLE ON TOMMY:  trying desperately to get his hands, tied
behind his back, within reach of the GUN taped over his
head.  It's impossible.

CLOSE ON MIKE:  eyes darting to ELLIE -- as the FIGURE
slowly APPROACHES down the DARKENED HALL, his HAND
lowering beneath his knees, within reach of TOMMY, under
the TABLE.

ANGLE ON TOMMY:  in a near HEADSTAND, his small hands
managing to TOUCH THE TAPE, his fingernails futilely
attempting to DIG BENEATH IT -- as the FOOTSTEPS continue
to APPROACH down the DARKENED HALL.

ANGLE ON THE FIGURE:  almost at the kitchen door -- about
to STEP INTO THE LIGHT.

                         MIKE
          Watch your step!

                         VENZA
                  (rising)
          What the fuck you doin'?!

TOMMY'S HANDS are on the GUN.

                         MIKE
          There's a skateboard in the door!

With a sudden SOUND of TAPE "RIPPING" from under the
TABLE.  ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE.  TOMMY ROLLS, THRUSTING THE
GUN INTO MIKE'S HAND as the FIGURE at the DOOR KICKS THE
SKATEBOARD, sending it ZOOMING INTO THE ROOM.  VENZA LEAPS
ASIDE AND FIRES, the FIGURE at the DOOR OPENING FIRE in
RETURN.  MIKE LEAPS FOR ELLIE, knocking her off her CHAIR,
rolling FAST as the ENTIRE KITCHEN ERUPTS IN GUNFIRE.

ANGLE ON ELLIE:  throwing herself OVER TOMMY, BULLETS
"PINGING" AROUND MIKE as he ROLLS, RETURNING THE FIRE.
The pitch-black kitchen shudders with BANGS and FLASHES
like the Fourth of July, mixed with the "WHINE" of bullets
hitting pots and pans, and the sight of BODIES hurtling
through the dark.

The "FIGURE AT THE DOOR" is firing with both hands,
SCORING A HIT ON VENZA'S ACCOMPLICE, who goes down,
wounded, HIS GUN CLATTERING to the FLOOR.  He REACHES for
it, but ELLIE GETS THERE FIRST, grabbing it with her two
hands tied in front of her.

                         ELLIE
                  (to Tommy)
          Stay down!

The ACCOMPLICE is staggering upward as ELLIE gets to her
feet, SQUARING OFF in POLICE STANCE -- and FIRES, catching
him square between the SHOULDER BLADES; HE SPINS, crashing
BACKWARDS through the GLASS DOOR -- SWISH-PAN to VENZA,
trying to get out THE KITCHEN WINDOW...

                         MIKE
          Turn around, fuck!

He DOES, BLASTED by MIKE, and the "FIGURE" in the door,
SIMULTANEOUSLY.  He falls out the window, but still has
life in him, staggering to his feet, and hit by SPOTLIGHTS
from the CARS OUTSIDE.  In a sudden barrage, he's hit by
CROSSFIRE, SPINNING, LURCHING -- finally going down.

And then all is quiet.

INSIDE THE KITCHEN -- all sound and movement has suddenly
ceased; everyone is a state of shock.

                         ELLIE
                  (desperate)
          Tommy...!

                         TOMMY
          I'm all right.

                         MIKE
          Ellie...

                         ELLIE
          I'm all right.

The overhead LIGHT is SNAPPED ON by the "FIGURE" in the
doorway -- revealing it to be KOONTZ.  In CLAIRE'S DRESS.
Guns in both hands, still smoking.

                         KOONTZ
                  (emphatic)
          Fuckin' miracle, man.

In the BACKGROUND distant SIRENS are HEARD heading toward.
The SWAT squad.  CAMERA MOVING ACROSS THE FACES OF ELLIE,
TOMMY, MIKE... and KOONTZ; all holding in place.
Listening to them come.

                         KOONTZ
                  (re: the sirens)
          Told you they'd be here in a few
          minutes.

The grim humor of it is registered in SILENCE.  MIKE picks
up VENZA'S HUNTING KNIFE from the floor, cutting through
the ropes that bind TOMMY'S and ELLIE'S HANDS; she PULLS
TOMMY to HER, in a tearful EMBRACE, shielding his face
from the ghastly sight of the man, lying dead, on the
floor.

OTHER PEOPLE are MOVING INWARD, CLAIRE among them, clad in
an OVERSIZED POLICE OVERCOAT -- looking frail and
frightened, SHUDDERING WITH RELIEF when she sees that all
are safe.  But there is no mistaking the presence of
something else in her eyes.

CLOSE ON CLAIRE'S FACE:  gazing at MIKE, his family
wrapped in his protective embrace.  He LOOKS UP, meeting
her eyes.

                         CLAIRE
          Everyone's all right...?

                         MIKE
          Yeah.  It's all over.

LONG ANGLE on the ROOM:  dimly illuminated by the single
light, shed from the opened refrigerator door, as people
begin to move -- awakening to life, and its necessary
details, in the aftermath of the crisis.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT.  THE HOUSE - SAME

The LAWN virtually FILLED with POLICE VEHICLES, their
revolving red lights illuminating the grim scene; a small
gathering of onlookers gawking from behind police ropes,
AMBULANCES pulling SLOWLY, SILENTLY, away.

CAMERA PANS to two figures ALONE, beside a squad car, in
the distant shadows.  It's CLAIRE, still clad in the
police overcoat, and MIKE.  They are together, but
separate, maintaining the proper distance to say goodbye.

CLOSER ANGLE ON THEM:  not knowing quite what to say.

                         MIKE
          So.

                         CLAIRE
          So.

ANGLE ON BOTH:  their eyes locked into each other's.

                         MIKE
          You still going away?

                         CLAIRE
          I don't know...

                         MIKE
          You don't have to, now.

                         CLAIRE
          I think it's probably still a good
          idea.

CLOSE ON MIKE:  getting her message.

                         MIKE
          Yeah...

Both are hurting.

                         CLAIRE
                  (heartfelt)
          I'll miss you, Mike.

                         MIKE
          Listen, I'll... see you again.

Her eyes are glistening; she gives him a bracing smile.
But he can't quiet manage it.

                         CLAIRE
                  (barely able to
                   speak)
          Say goodbye.

He struggles with it; unable.

                         MIKE
          I like your coat.

                         CLAIRE
                  (half-laugh, half-cry)
          You have a weakness for Lady Cops.

                         MIKE
          I do.

Silence now; their eyes adoring.

                         CLAIRE
          Say goodbye, Mike.

                         MIKE
                  (thick voiced)
          You take care.

MIKE TURNS -- CAMERA MOVING WITH HIM as he WALKS SLOWLY
AWAY -- finding himself on a collision course with GARBER.
They meet, spending a long moment in non-communicative
greeting.

                         MIKE
                  (finally)
          What do you think?
                  (a beat)
          Any chance?  There's nothin' else
          I'm any good at, but this.

                         GARBER
                  (noncommittal)
          Call me next week.  We'll talk about
          it.

MIKE absorbs it, looking up to SEE ELLIE and TOMMY, beside
a SQUAD CAR, a distance away.  Girding himself, he HEADS
TOWARD.

ANGLE ON ELLIE AND TOMMY -- as he APPROACHES, and stands
beside them.  Not much to say.  Finally he reaches out and
tousles TOMMY'S hair.

                         MIKE
          Good police work, kiddo.

He catches ELLIE'S eye, both assessing each other.

                         ELLIE
                  (re: Tommy)
          He doesn't want to sleep here.
                  (a long beat)
          Neither do I.  It's not my house
          anymore.

                         MIKE
          Me neither.

ANGLE ON ALL:  finding each other's eyes.

                         MIKE
          Let's find some place to start over.

MIKE puts an arm AROUND TOMMY -- and the CAMERA BEGINS A
LONG PULLBACK, as ELLIE moves to his side, and the KEEGAN
FAMILY begins to MOVE AWAY.  WE SEE CLAIRE, being helped
into a SQUAD CAR, turning to look back at them as it PULLS
AWAY -- CARS REVVING UP and PULLING OUT, in ALL
DIRECTIONS.

From a distance, we HEAR MIKE'S VOICE.

                         MIKE (V.O.)
                  (to Ellie)
          What this crap about singing
          lessons?

                                            FADE OUT.

                         THE END
SPARTAN

FADE IN:

EXT. WOODED HILLSIDE. DAY.

We see the drawn face of a young woman. Camera tracks with
her as she runs through the thick woods. She is exerting
herself heavily as she moves up a steep hillside. She looks
behind her quickly, and continues.

ANGLE, we see a young man, and then another, running through
the woods, out of breath. They are dressed in filthy BDU's,
and show several days growth of beard. The leader stops for
a moment, and looks around. The two men separate.

ANGLE, the  young woman, who has come to a small ledge, over
a ravine.  She stops, panting, and bends over, to attempt to
catch her  breath. She looks around, and looks back, her back
to a steep  wall, a steep drop before her.

ANGLE, the first young man, having come up to the spot
vacated by the young woman. In the BG we see his colleague.
He looks down, and sees movement in the brush below him, in
the ravine. He starts to descend, and then looks up.

ANGLE, the young woman, pulling herself up the steep
rockface. The young man regains the ledge and looks up.
Camera takes him around a bend in the ledge.

Standing here we discover ROBERT SCOTT. He is somewhat older
than the two men, he is very fit, also dressed in filthy
BDU's. He is making a note in a small notebook, which he
closes. Now, the two men look across the ravine at the young
woman, seen disappearing over a ridge.

                       SCOTT
                  (quietly)
             ...you better catch her...

The man looks around, and begins climbing up the rockface
behind him, pulling himself up, hand over hand by the roots
of trees. Several feet up, he falls on his back. He tries to
work himself to his knees and winces in pain. He looks to
Scott for help.

                       SCOTT
             ...your Dad's napping on the
             sofa, your Mom's watching Let's
             Make A Deal, and God is Dead.
             What do you expect me to do...?

                       YOUNG MAN
                  (very weakly)
             ...I'm tired, Sir...Sir, there's
             no way...

                                                              2.


                      SCOTT
            There's always a way...Don't You
            tell me there's no way...

A pause, as the man tries again to get to his feet. Scott
looks up at the young woman on top of the ridge and gives
her a "hold" gesture. She stops, at his command. Scott nods,
as if to himself, and then kicks the young man in the ribs.
The man starts, his eyes grow, and he gets to his feet.

                      SCOTT
            How 'bout that? That's called
            'Adrenaline'. You said you Wanted
            In.

He moves into the now-standing young man, and hits him, not
heavily, but convincingly, several times.

                      SCOTT
            This is where you get in. The
            mugger don't care. The shooter
            don't care...get up...Or I will
            beat you to death on this fucken
            hill...Now: you better Catch her...

He motions with his head. In the BG we see the young woman
nod, and begin running again. We see her, for a moment,
breast a hill, and disappear again...

ANGLE, on the young man, as he looks at Scott, empty, now,
of self-pity, as if he just realized something.

                      SCOTT
                 (responding to his look.
                 As if to say "That's right.")
            There's nothing but the mission...

The young man begins to climb the rockface.

HOLD on Scott for a moment.

INT. TRAINING FACILITY. DAY.

A large, hand-painted sign hangs on the cinderblock wall of
the rough building. It reads:

                    These are the precincts of pain.
                    A goddess lives here.
                    Her name is Victory.

In front of the sign walks the young woman we saw earlier.
She is exhausted, she has a towel wrapped around her neck.
Camera takes her to Scott, who is holding a cup of coffee,
and making notes in the small notebook we saw earlier.

                                                             3.


She stands, waiting, as she finishes his note.

                         SCOTT
            Well done.

                      YOUNG WOMAN (JACKIE BLACK)
            A signal honor to work with you,
            sir.

                      SCOTT
            Thank you, Sergeant.

He starts away from her, and she raises her hand slightly,
to indicate she has something more to say. He turns back to her.

                      JACKIE BLACK
            Sir: Day or Night. Black or White.
            You reach out for me. "Black,
            Jaqueline A. US 24191489."

                      SCOTT
            I'll remember, Sergeant.

She nods, and walks off. Scott walks toward a mess tent. He
is joined by George Blane, a very military-looking figure of
an older man. He wears an informal fatigue outfit, mismatched
jacket and trousers, without insignia. Scott is greeted by
him, as they walk toward the mess tent. Scott shows the
notebook to Blane, and Blane refers from the notebook to
what we see are a group of eighty young men, in the mess
tent, two of them the men we saw on the hill. Blane takes
the notebook and walks off, as Scott enters the mess tent.

ANGLE HIS POV, Scott enters the tent. Several of the young
men react to him. He nods to them. Among them, we see the
young man Scott berated on the hill, who rises and comes
over to Scott.

ANGLE, on Scott, who sits, as a uniformed man brings him a
tinfoil tray with some food on it. Scott takes out a
stiletto from his pocket, presses a button and the blade
emerges. He begins to use it to cut up his meat. The young
man from the hill, Anton, stands sheepishly near Scott, till
Scott turns, acknowledging him.

Anton takes a card out of his pocket, the size of a credit
card, old, creased cardboard: It reads, "Rogers Rangers,
Rules for Engagement. 1782". There is a line drawing of a
man with a musket, and we read, on the card, beneath it,
boldtype rules for fighting guerilla style. Written on the
card, in old faded ink, "SGT. Anton, M. US. 3149584, United
States Special Forces." The young man (Anton) shows the card
to Scott.

                                                           4.


                      SCOTT
                 (of the card)
            What's this then?

                      ANTON
            It was my father's, sir.

                      SCOTT
            He carry it Over There?

As they speak, we see, in an insert, the printed rules -
"Dated 1759". "Rule 4: Tell the truth about what you see and
what you do - there is an army depending on us for correct
information. You can lie all you please when you tell other
folks about the Rangers, but don't never lie to a Ranger or
an Officer".

                        ANTON
            Yes, sir.

                      SCOTT
            He come back?

                      ANTON
            Yes, sir. He did.

                      SCOTT
                 (nods. Pause)
            Well, so.

Scott pauses again. As he looks at the young man, who is
obviously unable to express his gratitude, and sense of
occasion.

                      SCOTT
            You carry that card, son. It
            might save your life.
                 (Anton nods)
            ...You could use it to light a
            fire, or something...

Blane's Aide calls the men to order.

                      BLANE'S AIDE
            The Candidate Cadre will fall in
            on the White Line...

The men start to come to their feet, and leave the mess tent.

                      ANTON
            I just wanted to say, sir...That,
            to meet you...

                                                              5.


                      SCOTT
                 (rising, as he gives
                 the Ranger card back
                 to Anton)
            You never met me. You've been up
            for a week. You're seeing Snakes...

The exhausted men come to their feet, and into a line. They
are happy, and joking with one another. In the BG we see
those who failed the course, sitting apart, file onto a bus
which has just pulled up.

ANGLE on a young man, who looks out of the window.

ANGLE HIS POV. Twenty or so similarly exhausted men, with
dufflebags, are being shuffled onto the bus.

ANGLE, on the young man, Anton, as he exits the tent, who
stands next to Scott, outside the tent. Scott stands next to
an old, but pristine Mustang Cobra. He withdraws a small
dufflebag from the front seat, and looks up to see Anton
standing next to him.

                       ANTON
                 (looking after the
                 departing, failed men)
            ...I can't imagine how they live
            with it...

ANGLE on Scott. As he thinks a very brief moment, as if
reluctant to become philosophical, and then turns back to Anton.

                      SCOTT
            Make sure you can't imagine it,
            cause, if you can, it's just one
            step to doing it.

Anton shakes his head, sadly, at the spectacle of the failed
men.

                      SCOTT
                 (pause)
            ...they'll be back where they
            came from by Morning, and all
            this is just a Bad Dream.

                      ANTON
            My name is...

                                                             6.


                      SCOTT
            Do I need to know?
                 (pause)
            If I want Camaraderie, I'll join
            the Masons.
                 (pause. Then, summing
                 it all up:)
            There's just the mission.

Beat. Anton steps away.

                      BLANE'S AIDE
                 (as he glances down at
                 his clipboard)
            Congratulations on completion of
            this evolution. I know you would
            probably like some sleep, but I
            do not think you'd mind sparing
            ten minutes for Induction.

The camera pans over the smiling faces of the eight very
proud young men.

ANGLE on Blane and Scott, off to the side.

Beyond them, we see the bus holding the failed candidates,
filling up.

                      BLANE
            Thank you, Bobby.

                      SCOTT
            Not at all, Sir...

                      BLANE
            ...You going home?

                      SCOTT
            ...weather permitting, Sir...

                      BLANE'S AIDE
                 (in the distance. As
                 camera tracks with
                 Blane and Scott)
            ...as I call your names:
                 (he consults his clipboard)
            Grossler, Anton...

These two men steps forward.

ANGLE, on Anton, nodding to himself at the proudest moment
of his life.

ANGLE, CU Scott, looking at him.

                                                                7.


Camera takes Blane and Scott into a cinderblock building
which houses a shooting range. We see various housefronts,
and storefronts, and targets. A long table along one wall
holds a coffee urn. Blane draws two cups of coffee.

Through the open door we see Anton and Grossler, smiling,
entering the building. Anton comes into the room, and smiles
at Scott.

We see Scott look away, sadly. He shares a look with Blane,
drains his coffee cup, crumples it, throws it away. Blane
gestures to Scott, meaning, "Shall we begin?" Scott
hesitates for a moment, and then nods.

FOCUS.

ANGLE, on Scott, in the BG, as Blane steps forward to
address the two candidates.

                        BLANE
                  (over his shoulder, to
                  an Aide)
             ...would you bolt the door,
             please...?

Scott gestures to the Aide, "One Moment".

                        BLANE
                  (to the candidates)
             ...are you tired, Gentlemen?
                  (the two young men smile)
             This is the completion of the
             evolution:
                  (beat)
             Only one of you may join the
             unit. The first man through that
             door will be inducted.

He gestures at a far door in the room.

ANGLE, on Scott, as he looks at the candidates, as they get
the picture.

Beat.

                       SCOTT
                  (to himself, quietly)
             ...yeah...you wanted to know the
             'secret knowledge'...

CU Scott  as he looks, interrogating the   two men, weighing
them, as  they look at each other. Beat.   Grossler starts to
advance  on Anton, in a fighting crouch.   Scott gestures to
the Aide  that that was what he wanted to   see.

                                                              8.


The Aide lets Scott out of the back door.

EXT. CINDERBLOCK BUILDING. DAY.

Scott, showered, in civilian clothes, a lumberjacket and
jeans, comes out of the building, carrying a small, yellow
duffle-bag. He opens the trunk.

He takes the yellow bag, and puts it into the trunk which we
now see contains woodworking tools - old levels and planes
and saws. He closes the trunk. We see the young woman from
the first sequence, now in civilian clothes, conferring with
a colleague. She nods at him, and he responds. As he starts
to get into the car. A squad of exhausted men is marching
past. As they come to a halt one of the men turns in the
direction of Scott.

                      DRILL INSTRUCTOR
                 (to that man)
            What the hell are you looking at?
            There ain't nobody there...

EXT. CONSTRUCTION TRAILER. DUSK.

A young worker in a hardhat, by a large gravel pit, at which
we find several earthmovers, idle. He is standing by a high
chainlink fence topped with barbed wire.

ANGLE HIS POV. Some half-mile away, the Mustang, heading in
his direction on a rough road. The young worker opens the
lock on the chainlink fence and swings it open.

We see a sign "McGarrity Construction Company" on the gate.

The young man walks back toward a construction trailer. We
see a red light blinking on a telephone on top of a littered
desk. The young worker enters the trailer hurriedly, and
opens a cabinet which we see contains several assault rifles,
and grenades. Another phone, its red light blinking, is
found in the cabinet. The young worker picks up this phone
quickly.

                      YOUNG WORKER
                 (into phone)
            ...Frontgate...

We see his face grow serious, as he begins to write on a pad.

INT. MUSTANG. DAY.

Scott, driving, comes around a bend.

                                                              9.


ANGLE HIS POV. The construction trailer up ahead. We see the
young worker come out of the trailer, and stand in the road
giving a "Stop" signal to the car.

ANGLE EXT. THE CAR. We see Scott bring the Mustang to a stop,
and get, inquisitively, out of the car. We see the young
worker run up to him and hand him a sheet of paper. Scott
takes the paper and begins to read.

He looks up, to ask a question of the young worker. We see
the worker begin to respond, his body language saying
"That's all I know." As he starts to speak his words are
drowned out by the sound of a helicopter. Scott looks up.

ANGLE HIS POV. A helicopter, flying low.

ANGLE INT. THE HELICOPTER. A man in civilian clothes points
out Scott, on the ground, to the Pilot. Through the canopy
we see Scott and the construction canopy down below. The
helicopter goes into a tight turn.

ANGLE Scott. Above him, the helicopter goes into its turn,
and begins to descend in a field some fifty yards away.

ANGLE, the sheet of paper Scott holds. Is reads: "All hands."
Over the throbbing of the helicopter, we see Scott giving
directions about the car, to the young worker. Camera takes
Scott to the trunk, which he opens, and from which he
retrieves his gym bag. He hands the keys to the young worker,
and takes off, running, to the helicopter.

ANGLE, on Scott, as he is pulled up aboard, and the
helicopter takes off.

ANGLE, over the worker, watching the helicopter disappear.

INT. HELICOPTER. NIGHT.

Scott, asleep. As the helicopter banks low over the Charles
River and Harvard College. A Crewman shakes him awake.

ANGLE, EXT: the helicopter descends into the field of a
football stadium. A black suburban is waiting.

EXT. BOATHOUSE. CHARLES RIVER. NIGHT.

Seen through the windshield of a car.

ANGLE, a black, government Suburban pulls outside the
boathouse. We see scaffolding being erected outside the main
entrance.

                                                            10.


Scott and several types in suits get out of the Suburban,
and proceed toward the door, over which is hung a large,
paint-spattered drape. A sign on a stanchion reads
"Temporarily Closed For Repairs".

ANGLE, INT. THE BOATHOUSE. The group pushes through the
drape, beyond which we see several men in suits, holding
assault rifles.

An older government type, MILLER, followed by an AIDE, walks
up to meet the group, the Aide motions to the armed guards
that Scott is to be admitted, that he is "okay". Miller
gestures to Scott that it will just be a moment. The Aide
hands Scott a sheaf of papers, and leads him through the
boathouse. We see the long skiffs up on their rests, the
Charles River beyond.

ANGLE on Scott. As Scott looks through the papers. Around
him we see communications equipment being hurriedly assembled.

ANGLE INSERT. The top sheet shows a color photo of a
phenomenally lovely redheaded girl in her teens. As Scott
talks, he leafs through the sheets to reveal several photos
of her and a man, obviously her father, holding her hand.
One is a print of a glossy magazine article.

                      SCOTT
                 (of the photo, nodding
                 to himself, as he reads)
            "...Betty Coed, has hair of red
            for Harvard..."

                      AIDE
                 (of the top photo)
            It's not current.

                      SCOTT
            Why not...?

ANGLE on them as they arrive at a small equipment room.
Through the door we see a young government type, Gaines, his
suitcoat off, his shoulder holster empty, being interrogated
by several colleagues.

                      AIDE
            It seems she got a makeover today.
            We're working on it.

He hands a small log book to Scott, and points to an entry.
Scott looks down the entries, and glances up, now and then,
at the man being interrogated.

                                                          11.


                      SCOTT
                 (reads)
            4PM. Cut n'Curl...

                      AIDE
            Gave her a crewcut, dyed it
            platinum blonde...

                      SCOTT
                 (glancing up at the
                 man in the chair)
            Met with her boyfriend at ten.
            Then...?

The Aide shrugs, meaning, "That's it..."

                      SCOTT
            ...he's on Post until he turned
            her over to the Nightwatch...?

                      AIDE
            He says he was...

                      SCOTT
            Who else you got...?

Miller gestures to an associate, who comes forward, passing
photos to Scott, as Miller goes to look through the glass at
the young man being interrogated.

                      AIDE
            ...we got the boyfriend, Michael
            Blake.

                      SCOTT
            ...where is he...?

We are shown a photo of an Ivy League preppy chap around 18.
He is on a sailboat.

                      AIDE
            Was not in his dorm last night,
            we're shaking the trees...And...
                 (Scott is passed
                 another photo)
            Professor Gerald Sloane, notably
            chummy with his female students,
            of which she was one. Weekend
            home, Martha's Vineyard...

                      SCOTT
            ...for sure...?

                                                             12.


                      AIDE
            Been there since Friday.

We see a photo, obviously from a school catalogue, of a
youngish bearded man, in front of a blackboard. We see
Miller in the BG finish his meeting and turn to the group.

                      MILLER
            I'm light. I'm light, people...I
            need another team on the
            Professor, I need an overwatch
            on the boyfriend...

The Aide hands him a sheet of paper, obviously a roster.

Scott, looking at the board. He puts down his head for a
moment, and blinks his eyes, trying to clear his head.

                      MILLER
            You just come from the Cadre.

                       SCOTT
            Yes sir.

                      MILLER
            How long since you've slept?

                      SCOTT
            Not significant.

                      MILLER
            You take a team, and Bulldog.
            Are you up for it?

                      SCOTT
                 (absently, as he looks
                 over the materials he
                 has been given)
            Sir, "this Marine pisses av gas
            and farts blackpowder, Sir."

                      MILLER
            Thank you for coming, Bobby.

                      SCOTT
            Are you kidding, sir...?

An Associate comes over and hands him a piece of paper.
Miller shakes his head.

                      MILLER
            I don't have the bodies. Call em
            in...call em in...

                                                             13.


ANGLE on Scott. CU. As he watches the interrogation of
Gaines in the next room. The young man begins to pick up his
coffee cup, and we see that it shakes.

ANGLE on Scott, as he gestures to Miller to look through the
glass, at the young man being interrogated, who is now seen
to be wiping his brow, and shaking his head. The young man
tries to take a sip of coffee, and spills it, inadvertently,
down his shirtfront. Scott exchanges a glance with Miller,
and walks into the equipment room, to the interrogation.

The man being interrogated, the government type, Gaines, is
in his early thirties. He is sweating and obviously
frightened. An Aide comes and stands by Scott.

                      AIDE
                 (whispering)
            His post was Harvard Yard.
            Harvard Yard, Northeast Corner,
            Lowell House, across from her
            dorm. Nightwatch relieved him
            there, Midnight...

ANGLE, on Miller in the interrogation room. Miller nods to
Scott, meaning "You know what to do."

ANGLE on Gaines, as Scott enters, the interrogators step
back for Miller, who is obviously their superior. He motions
them to continue.

Camera holds Scott throughout the following interchange,
with the suspect and questioners seen reflected in the glass
of the door.

                         INTERROGATOR
            Once more:

                      GAINES
            She, uh. She had lunch with her
            father.

                      INTERROGATOR
            Lunch with her father - you
            seconded to that detail?

                      GAINES
            No, sir. I just had her.

                      INTERROGATOR
            "...you just had her..."

                      GAINES
            I. Uh...uh. I had her all day.
            Tucked her in. At Ten. And she...

                                                      14.


                      INTERROGATOR
            ...yeah, "she had a tiff with
            her boyfriend..."

                        GAINES
            Yes. I...

                      INTERROGATOR
            Michael Blake -
                 (he holds up a photo
                 of a preppy fellow)


                      MILLER
            What was it about?

                      GAINES
            I think it was about her...her...
                 (he makes gestures of haircutting)


                      MILLER
            Her haircut...
                 (Gaines nods)
            So it wasn't a serious...?

                      GAINES
            No, no.
                 (pause)
            No.
                 (pause)
            And then I,
                 (he covers his mouth
                 as he speaks)
            I held the post until relieved...
                 (he gestures at his
                 notebook, as if to
                 support him)


Miller motions at Scott.

                      MILLER
            Well, then, we've got a little
            problem.

                      GAINES
                 (shaking his head in denial)
            I was there.

                                                            15.


                      MILLER
                 (reading)
            23.12 Hours, 19 May. Harvard
            Yard, Northeast Corner, Lowell
            House, reveals no Secret Service
            Presence, neither this post nor
            adjacent...
                 (he looks through his notes)
            ...a second tour, 23.30, reveals,
            similarly...

                      GAINES
            I was there, Sir.

                      MILLER
                 (to Gaines)
            Who's lying?
                 (pause)
            You or him?
                 (pause. Gaines slightly
                 averts his head.)


ANGLE on Miller, who gives an infinitesimal sign to Scott
who steps forward and slaps Gaines across the face.

                      SCOTT
            You son of a bitch, I've got
            fifteen years in, and three kids,
            and you're gonna sit there, and
            lie away my Pension...

He makes a move toward Gaines.

                      GAINES
            I...

                      SCOTT
            ...don't you tell me you were
            there...

                      GAINES
            I was On Post...

                      SCOTT
                 (as he moves towards
                 Gaines seriously)
            ...you lying swine...Don't you
            tell me you were On Post!

Miller gestures to a couple of the types who take Scott out
of the room and sit him forcefully, in a chair...cautioning
him to stay still.

                                                           16.


Miller now stands by him.

HOLD on Scott who uses the pause to review the documents he
holds, the photos of the girl, of the Boyfriend, of the
Professor. He picks up another glossy magazine showing the
redheaded girl - the caption reads "America is Seeing Red".

                      INTERROGATOR
            Shall I tell you what's gonna
            happen to you, when we find you out?

                      GAINES
            ...I...
                 (he gets up and walks,
                 wearily, toward the
                 windows, and turns)
            I...Uh...

                      INTERROGATOR
            Were you fucking her...?
                 (pause)
            We're gonna find out...

                      GAINES
            No, I...um...

                      INTERROGATOR
            ...Where Is She?

Scott turns, to Miller, who is seen, beyond the door, in
conference with several government types.

Scott leaves the room, and is seen, on the outskirts of the
conference.

                      MILLER
            We've got until her Monday
            Morning Class, and then it's
            Meet the Press; and "Where is
            she...?"
                 (he shakes his head)
            Who's got the Professor...? Where
            is he...?

                      AN AGENT
            Martha's Vineyard.

                      MILLER
            Who's got him?

                      AN AGENT
            Jones and Shannon.

                                                            17.


Throughout this section camera holds Scott. As he looks
through the file, the various photos, and notations, and
takes notes in as small pocket notebook, in which we also
see the small cardboard card of "Rogers Rangers Rules of
Engagement".

                      MILLER
                 (to the group)
            Wake him up, shake him up. He
            don't want to talk...
                 (he holds out his hand,
                 and an Aide puts some
                 papers into it)
            Here's what we have him doing
            with his Female Students, show
            'em to his wife...The Photo...?
                 (one of the agents
                 brings in two photographs)
            Here is the last known photo...of
            the girl.

HOLD on Scott, at the back of the group, taking notes. We
see him holding several newsclippings. One of them shows the
girl, and the headline reads "America is Seeing Red."

We see the photo blown up, of the ravishingly beautiful
young girl with long red hair. It features a small, red
enamel crescent earring. The second photo shows the same
girl, in the same pose, but now her hair is short and
platinum blonde and spiky. The agent opens two boxes and
begins distributing the photos to the group.

                      MILLER
            The lab ran it up, based on the
            testimony of the beauty shop. We
            have not told Boston or Cambridge
            PD, nor have we...

An agent comes up and hands him a sheet of paper.

                      AN AGENT
            The Professor...

                      MILLER
                 (to the associate)
            You had him in his home...

                      AN AGENT
            Sir, we were in Error, we...

                      MILLER
            Where is he...?

                                                             18.


                      AN AGENT
            Best guess puts him on his boat.
            Last seen out of West Tisbury,
            Martha's Vine...

                      MILLER
            Find him. Put the guard on him.
            Get me an overflight.
                 (generally)
            I'm light, I'm light, people.
                 (he points to an associate)
            Shake the Trees. I'm light,
            here...I'm 25 men light. Get 'em
            in. Who's got the
            Coastguard...What's the name of
            his boat? Professor Gerald Sloane...

An Aide comes in, hurriedly.

                      AIDE
            It's the boyfriend. He's moving...

Miller points at Scott, who rises.

                      SCOTT
            I've got him...

                      MILLER
                 (coming over to Scott)
            ...I've got two days to run in.
            Before the Press wakes up.

                      SCOTT
                 (as he responds to the
                 inherent request in
                 Miller's voice)
            Whatever it takes, sir...

Miller nods his appreciation.

Scott exits, and we HOLD on Miller giving orders to his group.

EXT. HARVARD YARD. NIGHT.

Two students, walking through the yard. They acknowledge a
uniformed security guard, who walks, with his back to us.

A slight, Asian young woman, her arms full of books, walks
toward the camera, hurrying. She indicates something, back
over her shoulder, and the guard, who is in front of the
camera, walking away, veers off in that direction.

                                                             19.


EXT. VESTIBULE, HARVARD DORM. NIGHT.

A young man (MICHAEL BLAKE) is, furtively, working on
jimmying open one of a set of mailboxes. He senses something,
and turns.

ANGLE HIS POV. The Security Guard (Scott) standing just
beyond a glass door, looking in at him. Scott enters, coming
to camera.

                      SCOTT
            Could I see your hands, son...?

The Boy, Blake, moves his hands away from his body, to show
a screwdriver. Scott motions him away from the mailbox,
which we see is in the process of being demolished. Scott
reads the name on the mailbox.

                       SCOTT
            L. Newton.
                 (pause)
            You lose your mailbox key, Mr.
            Newton...?
                 (pause)


                      BLAKE
            Um.

                      SCOTT
            You a student here?

                      BLAKE
            Yes.

                      SCOTT
            Could I see some identification,
            please...? Mr. Newton?
                 (Scott takes out a
                 walkie and begins to
                 talk into it)
            Ten-Twelve patrol, requesting...

                      BLAKE
            No, please...please...
                 (pause)
            Please, Oh, God.

He starts to advance on Scott, who draws a nightstick, and
keeps him at bay.

                      SCOTT
            Calm down, Son. It's gonna be
            what it's gonna be...

                                                          20.


                      BLAKE
            One minute, could I please talk
            to you for one minute...Look
            look look: I broke up with My
            Girlfriend...

ANGLE EXT. THE VESTIBULE. The young Asian girl, now walking
with a male friend, pass in front of the vestibule. Beyond
them we see Blake and Scott, as Blake motions to the mailbox,
and moves to the mailbox and takes out a letter.

ANGLE INT. THE VESTIBULE. On Scott, as he watches Blake take
a letter out of the jimmied mailbox.

                       SCOTT
                 (of the letter)
            Laura.
                 (he rereads the
                 nameplate on the mailbox)
            Laura Newton?
                 (pause)
            Laura Newton? Is that 'the' Laura
            Newton...?

                      BLAKE
            We broke up. Alright? Laura
            Newton. They know who I am.

                      SCOTT
            Who?

                      BLAKE
            The Secret Service.

                      SCOTT
            The Secret Service?

                      BLAKE
            That's right, that's right. They
            know who I am. You...They've
            "cleared" me.

                      SCOTT
                 (gesturing to the
                 jimmied mailbox)
            They didn't clear you for this.

                      BLAKE
            You, you hear me out, and, if
            you want to, Then...
                 (pause)
            Okay? Okay???
                 (pause)

                                                             21.


                        SCOTT
              I have to call it in.

                        BLAKE
              Please...please. Five
              minutes...That's all I want.
              Please. Please...She
              would...she...
                   (his face brightens at
                   the new idea)
              Maybe she's in her room!

                        SCOTT
              You tried the bell, you called
              her...

                        BLAKE
                   (as it dawns on him)
              Maybe she's ill...

INT. CORRIDOR, HARVARD DORM. NIGHT.

Blake and Scott, as they walk up to a door. Scott knocks on
the door.

                        SCOTT
              ...Mzz Newton...?
                   (pause)
              Mz Newton...this is Campus
              Security...

He begins to fumble with keys at his belt.

ANGLE INT. THE ROOM. Several agents, obviously involved in
investigating the room, wearing plastic gloves, stop. One,
silently, unlocks the door.

We   see Scott enter the room, "miming" using a key, and turn
on   the light and look inside. We take him to her desk, where
he   finds several photos of her and her father - and a note
on   he desk, reading "Dear Dad-Thanks for coming-signed %-)".

We see the boy, Blake, out in the corridor, unable to see
into the room.

                        SCOTT
              Mz Newton...?
                   (pause)


ANGLE, in the hall, as Scott and Blake stand there, a young
girl comes down the hall and stops, opposite her room.

                                                             22.


                      YOUNG GIRL
            Hey, Mike. Sprised to see you
            there.
                 (smiles)
            That was some Vicious Performance...

She smiles brightly and goes into her room. Scott looks at
Blake.

EXT. HARVARD YARD. NIGHT.

Blake and Scott sitting on a bench in the deserted yard.
Scott holds the envelope and the letter, on which we see
this symbol %-) and begin to read: "This is a sham. Your
view of the world is not cockeyed, but corrupt. You cunt.
And you deserve everything that is going to happen to you..."

                      BLAKE
            ...I was just...trying to
            retrieve the letter.

ANGLE, on Scott, as he looks at the letter.

                      SCOTT
            ...this is not very nice language.
                 (pause, Blake looks away)
            How old is this girl?

                       BLAKE
            She's...just turned 18.
                 (Scott shakes his head,
                 sadly. pause)
            I was mad.

                      SCOTT
                 (of the letter:)
            ..."everything that's going to
            happen to her"...What was going
            to happen to her?
                 (pause)
            You hurt her...?
                 (pause)
            Did y'hit her, son...?

                      BLAKE
            Hit her? No. I...
                 (he gestures to the note)
            I called her...I called her a
            whore...I...

                      SCOTT
            Why...?

                                                          23.


The boy bangs his head. Scott, as he rises, brings Blake to
his feet.

                      SCOTT
                 (as if realizing "This
                 is the question")
            Where is she?

                      BLAKE
                 (as if the question
                 had not occurred to
                 him previously)
            She must...she must...she must
            have gone home...

                      SCOTT
            Why...?

                      BLAKE
                 (gesturing around, quietly)
            Because the Secret Service, isn't...

As they walk by a parked van, we cut inside the van. Where
we see a Secret Service type. Through the windshield we see
Scott gesture "Do Not Intervene."

ANGLE, on Scott and Blake, as they walk down the near-
deserted Mass Ave.

                      SCOTT
                 (of the sign on the
                 letter,the "Picasso"
                 sign, that is %-}. He
                 turns the sign
                 rightside up to show
                 it is a 'cockeyed smile')
            What is this sign?

                      BLAKE
            It's how she signs her letters.
                 (smiles)
            Cause she looks at everything
            cockeyed...Like Picasso - she
            said they called her "Picasso".
                 (pause)


                      SCOTT
            Who called her that...?

                                                             24.


                      BLAKE
            You know, her, her...
                 (remembering)
            He saw her yesterday! Maybe
            she's...maybe she's with him!

                      SCOTT
            Why'd you fight with her, Son...?

                      BLAKE
                 (pause)
            She, uh, she got her hair
            done...She cut it off. She dyed
            it blonde. I said she looked
            like a slut...and...
                 (pause)


                       SCOTT
            Beautiful young girl like that.
            We've all seen her pictures.
            What'd you care how she dyed her
            hair?
                  (pause)
            What'd you care...? Why's that
            make her a slut...?
                  (pause)


                       BLAKE
            She...
                  (pause)
            Uh...

                      SCOTT
            She seeing another fella...?
                 (as he moves closer, confidingly)
            ...just between us. Off-the-
            record, son...

ANGLE, INT. THE VAN. We hear the conversation, and see the
tape machine moving.

                      SCOTT (V.O.)
            ...I was young once, too.

                      BLAKE (V.O.)
            I...

ANGLE EXT. THE VAN. Blake and Scott.

                                                          25.


                      SCOTT
            I know that nothing hurts worse
            than that. She seeing another
            guy...?

                      BLAKE
            I...
                 (pause)
            There's this, um...Teacher...I
            shouldn't, I, I shouldn't tell
            you this: She...

                      SCOTT
            She sleeping with a teacher...?

                      BLAKE
            She says she isn't. I said she
            looked like a slut. She wants to
            fuck old guys, she should go to
            The Regency. Go all the Way.

                      SCOTT
            The Regency, what's that?

                      BLAKE
                 (as if everyone knows
                 this place)
            S'the Club, by the Fenway...it's
            like a joke at school, it's like
            a rumor: this or that girl, made
            a thousand bucks, went with a
            businessman for One Night...
            Look: it's a Lover's Quarrel. I
            said something I regret. I sent
            her a note which I regret, and I
            assure, you, Officer. If...
                 (pause)
            If you would...

ANGLE. From inside the windshield of the van we see, through
their body language, that Scott is "giving the boy a break",
the boy is very thankful. Scott is admonishing him and the
boy is contrite. Now Scott begins to walk away, and we see
him minutely, signal to the van, we see the driver of the
van pick up a phone and speak softly into it.

ANGLE, Scott, walking down a sidestreet. The boy in the BG,
we see the young Asian girl, take up a tailing position some
half-block back of the boy, as a car glides to the curb. And
Scott gets in.

ANGLE, tight on Scott in the car, as he rubs his eyes,
beyond exhaustion. The car pulls away.

                                                          26.


He gives several instructions to the young man driving, and
then leans back, eyes closed. He opens his eyes again, and
we see him mouth, insistently, "The Regency". The driver nods.

INT. BOATHOUSE. NIGHT.

As Scott enters. The activity is more widespread than
previously. An agent walks him into the fray.

                      AGENT
            No morgue. No hospital. No note.

                      SCOTT
            The parents?

Agent, nods, shrugs.

                      AGENT
            The mother,
                 (makes a "drinking" gesture)
            You know where she is...He's
            holding up...
                 (as an afterthought)
            He was in town yesterday. To see
            her.

                      SCOTT
                 (as he shakes his
                 head - to clear it)
            He was?

                      AGENT
            ...we snuck him in, and out.

We see Miller, in the BG, in a hurried conference, nod at Scott.

                      MILLER
                 (looking at a chart)
            "The Colophon - 36-foot sloop".
            Where is she...?

They walk off, an Aide talking to him.

                      AIDE
            ...the Coast Guard has a watch
            over this area:
                 (he points to the chart)
            And they have scheduled the
            Colophon first...

Scott and the Agent stop in front of the interrogation room,
where we see the agent, Gaines, a guard over him. Gaines is
sitting, looking as if he had been weeping. The guard
addresses Scott and the other agent.

                                                             27.


                      GUARD
            He copped to it.

                      SCOTT
            He copped to what?

                      GUARD
                 (of Gaines)
            Off-post - punched out early to
            go boffing his girlfriend.

Scott shakes his head as if to say "How about that..." The
agent holds a photo of a very lovely Eurasian woman in a
business suit, and shows it to Scott.

                      AGENT
            Hope she was worth it...

                      SCOTT
            Uh huh.

Scott stands wearily, watching several large men berating
the seated Secret Service Agent. An agent appears with a
tearsheet showing the ad for "The Regency Club". We see the
ad for exotic young companions, and the address is Boston.
Scott gives instructions to the Aide.

ANGLE INT. WASHROOM. Scott, having stripped off his shirt,
is washing himself at the sink. The "Regency" ad, and a
description of the club is pasted with water to the mirror
before him. We read, in the mirror: "REGENCY. 243 Charles
Street, Boston, Mass. Owners of Record..." Et Cetera. In the
mirror we see the Aide bring a fresh shirt and a tie to
Scott. Scott turns, as the door swings, and he sees, in the
BG, ANTON, just entering the establishment.

ANGLE INT. THE BOATHOUSE. A Swat team is laying out its
weapons and assault gear, on a long table.

HOLD on Anton, who is standing, unassigned, and looking it.

We see, on an improvised bulletin board, photos of the Boy,
Blake, the Professor, and the Girl, blown up from a
newspaper shot, and in various photos. As we watch an Agent
walks up with a box full of photos, and tacks one up on the
board. It is an altered shot showing the young girl with
short, spikey platinum hair.

ANGLE on Scott, dressed in a clean shirt, a tie, as he takes
a photo from the box. We see him put it next to the original,
blonde photo, and look at both.

                                                            28.


                      AGENT
            We ran it up from a description
            of the colorist from the Beauty
            Parlor...

                      SCOTT
            Gimme your coat.

The Agent takes off his suitcoat, and gives it to Scott, who
puts it on.

ANGLE, on Scott, as he holds the photos, and the Regency
description. He walks toward the door, through the mass of
agents. He stops by Miller, who is on the phone, looking at
a photograph of the Professor, as a tech hooks up a video
feed of a house on the water, the Professor's house. A photo
of a sailboat is tacked up. We read 'The Colophon' on its stern.

                      SCOTT
                 (to Miller)
            I need five thousand dollars.

Miller gestures "Just a Moment", and then waves to an Aide,
meaning "Do It".

                      SCOTT
            How long do we have? Sir?

                      MILLER
                 (shakes his head)
            It hits the papers, and we're done.

                      SCOTT
            No...note? No...

Miller shakes his head, he holds up the "Regency" note...

                      SCOTT
                 (nodding)
            I've got it...
                 (to Miller)
            Can I have some backup?

Miller, gesturing around the room, meaning "what you see is
what you get". All the occupants of the room are engaged on
some task, save Anton, who sits alone on a bench. Scott
looks at Anton, who glances at Scott, trying to keep the
appeal out of his glance, "Please take me".

                      SCOTT
                 (to Anton)
            We're scraping the bottom of the
            barrel here, aren't we?

                                                             29.


                        ANTON
            Yes. Sir.

Scott looks at Anton and shakes his head. He is summoned to
the front of the room by a young woman, who is putting cash
into an envelope. Scott comes over to her, and we see her
filling out a slip of paper. She hands him the cash in the
envelope, and the slip of paper.

                      YOUNG WOMAN
            I need you to sign it.

                      SCOTT
            You sign it.
                 (He scans the room
                 again, shrugs, and
                 motions to Anton)
            Come on, Wallflower...
                 (Anton rises and walks
                 over to him)


Scott turns to Anton.

                      SCOTT
            Now: your mouth shut. Your eyes
            open, and form on me...Here's
            where we're going...

There is the sound of a gunshot. Scott and Anton
instinctively take cover against the side of the building,
drawing their sidearms.

HOLD TIGHT on Scott. As he looks through the half-open door.

We see several of the Swat men, taking up positions, one of
them kicks open a door, and his partner enters. Pause. We
hear the partner call "clear".

ANGLE, on Scott, as he re-enters the building, and proceeds,
pistol out, toward the room.

ANGLE HIS POV. On the floor, we see the dead Secret Service
Agent, a pistol in his hand.

We see Miller turn to his team. An Agent kneels to the
fallen Secret Service Agent, and prods a small hideout
pistol from his hand. Scott turns to leave, and sees Anton
standing next to him.

                                                            30.


                      SCOTT
            Don't look at him. Don't look at
            the Downed Man. He's dead...
                 (as he turns his back
                 on the scene)
            Kick the fool overboard...

ANGLE on Anton and Scott as they leave. In the BG we see
Miller et al. Miller giving directions.

                      MILLER
            ...who is the girl he went to
            see? Get her in...The girl he
            was fucking...Who's got the
            Coastguard...

TIGHT on Anton and Scott as they exit the building.

                      SCOTT
            I'd hate to be the Lucky Duck
            who frisked him...
                 (beat)


                      ANTON
            He was off-post when they
            snatched the girl?

                      SCOTT
                 (as he looks at the
                 fallen agent)
            Yeah. Well, apparently, he felt
            bad about it...

EXT. REGENCY CLUB. NIGHT.

A garish neon sign, beneath which we see a couple exiting,
getting into their limo. Scott, in his sportcoat, walks up
to the large and threatening bouncer at the velvet rope to
the club. We see the bouncer bar his way, and gesture to his
watch, meaning "closing up".

ANGLE INS. Two one-hundred dollar bills are passed to the
bouncer.

ANGLE, Anton, in a cab across the street, looking on.

ANGLE INT. THE REGENCY CLUB. Several well-dressed couples
are leaving. A group of raucous, drunk businessmen types
push past them. Scott walks up to the bar. The Bartender is
beginning to ring out the cash register. In the BG we see a
manager eye Scott, and continue to direct the closing
operations.

                                                          31.


                      BARTENDER
            Closing up...
                 (he points to his watch)
            Can't sell you booze after 3 AM.

                      SCOTT
                 (laying money on the bar)
            No, no. I just came buy to pay
            you that money I owe you.

He gestures to the bills on the bar. The Bartender swoops
them up, and gestures to the back bar, meaning "What'll you
have?" Scott points to a bottle of Bourbon, the Bartender
pours for him.

                      SCOTT
                 (as he drinks)
            ...how about them Sox, huh...?

                      BARTENDER
            Yuh. Whaddaya gonna do...?

                      SCOTT
            "Curse of the Bambino".

                      BARTENDER
            ...that's right.
                 (pause)


                      SCOTT
            Nice place you got here.

                      BARTENDER
            You from out of town...?

                      SCOTT
            Yeah, you know, actually, I was
            just looking for my Daughter...

                      BARTENDER
                 (as he smiles)
            ...that's what you're looking
            for...?

                      SCOTT
            ...I. Uhh...

                      BARTENDER
            ...ask, because a lot of out-of-
            town guys, come in, lookin,
            someone else's daughter.

                                                           32.


                      SCOTT
            No, I...Oh, no...

                      BARTENDER
                 (smiling)
            You sure...?

                      SCOTT
            Abso, absolutely...

He brings out his case, with the photo of the platinum-
haired girl. The Bartender comes over and glances at it.

ANGLE XCU on Scott as he looks incisively at the Bartender,
who displays no flicker of recognition.

                      SCOTT
            ...girl like that been in
            tonight...?

                      BARTENDER
            ...pretty girl...

                      SCOTT
            None prettier.

ANGLE on Scott, who looks around the club. We see him eyeing
the lovely young scantily clad waitresses, who return his
looks with disdain. The Bartender, observing him, comes back
to him.

                      SCOTT
            Yeah...I'm looking for a girl
            like that...

                      BARTENDER
            ...You're sure it was your
            daughter...? B'cause, a lot of
            guys, come in here, guys your
            age, go home with some...some
            rather 'younger' girl...

The Bartender smiles.

                      SCOTT
                 (as he leans forward)
            Well, why would a, one of these
            'younger girls'. What would they
            want to do with me...?

The Bartender leans close and hesitates. Scott takes out
several more bills and passes them to the Bartender.

                                                               33.


He hesitates a second, as if to say   "You wouldn't fuck me,
would you...?" The Bartender signs,   "I am your man", the
Bartender takes the bills and leans   close and whispers to
Scott, indicating someone over in a   dark corner.

In this corner, as the lights are flicked up, we see a
youngish man in very expensive casual clothes, an American,
dressed like Eurotrash, sitting talking with the man we saw
earlier was the Manager. As Scott approaches, we see the
Manager, knowingly, drift off. Beat. The young man (ZIMMER)
rises from the booth, and tugs himself into neatness, and
stops, as if bemused by Scott.

                      ZIMMER
            'Howdy, Pard'.

                       SCOTT
            Hello. I wonder if you could
            help me...

                      ZIMMER
                 (as he yawns and looks
                 at his watch, as he
                 pushes past Scott)
            I love you, Baby, but the
            season's over...

Zimmer starts for the front door, and Scott falls into step
with him.

                      SCOTT
                 (gestures at the Bartender)
            ...my friend says that
            you're...you're sort of a
            'matchmaker'...

                      ZIMMER
            Izzat what he says...?

Camera takes the two out of the front of   the club, where
Zimmer tips the bouncer, who his putting   on his coat,
preparatory to going away for the night.   Zimmer begins
walking into a parking lot, where we see   several run-down
employee's cars, and his, Zimmer's prime   Mercedes. Scott
tags along.

                      BOUNCER
                 (as he walks away, to
                 Zimmer, of Zimmer's car)
            I put her back in your space...

                      SCOTT
            I was looking for a girl...a
            young girl...

                                                             34.


                      ZIMMER
            Aren't we all.

                      SCOTT
            My, my, my, my, my, my question
            was: why would a young girl want
            to go out with an older man like
            me? And, if you could "answer"
            that...

He takes out money from his pocket. Zimmer begins to speak
slightingly, dismissively to the 'hick'.

                      ZIMMER
            Look, Bub...

Zimmer starts to open his car door. He turns back to Scott,
and we see, Zimmer's POV, Anton, standing behind Scott, at
the doorway to an alleyway. Obviously backing Scott up.

ANGLE CU, Zimmer reacts infinitesimally, to the sight of Anton.

ANGLE XCU, Scott, sees him, and slams him against the side
of the car. Zimmer reaches through the half-open door, and
comes out with an automatic pistol in his hand. Scott kicks
him in the stomach, Zimmer tries to raise the hand with the
gun, and Scott throws him to the ground, the pistol falls on
the concrete.

ANGLE on Scott as Anton emerges from the alley. Scott
directs him to drag Zimmer into the alleyway, near a
dumpster. Anton thrusts his hand into the car and starts to
reach for the dropped pistol.

                      SCOTT
            Don't touch the piece, don't
            touch the piece, don't touch the
            piece, th'out your gloves on...

ANGLE INT. THE SMALL ALLEYWAY. As Anton now pulls off
Zimmer's sportcoat, and begins emptying the pockets. Scott
interrogates Zimmer.

                      ZIMMER
            ...I think you broke my arm.

                      SCOTT
                 (as he shows the photo
                 to Zimmer)
            You seen this girl before...

                      ZIMMER
                 (of his arm)
            ...I think it's broken...

                                                          35.


                      SCOTT
            You seen her tonight...?

Zimmer turns away from the photo.

                      ZIMMER
            ...I think it's...

                      SCOTT
                 (to Anton)
            Pull him up...

Anton pulls Zimmer to his feet. Scott puts a lock on Zimmer
and breaks his arm. Zimmer screams.

                      SCOTT
            Now it's broken.
                 (of the picture)
            What's her name...?
                 (pause. He strikes
                 Zimmer in the face)
            WHAT'S HER NAME...
                 (to Anton)
            Break his other arm...

                      ZIMMER
            I DON'T KNOW HER NAME...

                      SCOTT
            You don't know her name, then
            who is she...?

                      ZIMMER
            Some, some 'girl'...

                      SCOTT
            Some 'girl', some 'pal' of yours?
            Where is she Now...?

Anton, tossing Zimmer's coat, comes up with a small medicine
vial. He holds it up to Scott. Who takes it, looks at it,
sniffs it. Pause.

                      SCOTT
                 (to Zimmer)
            Oh no...
                 (pause)
            Oh no...this isn't Rohypnol...
                 (pause)
            Is it...?
                 (pause)
            Izziz Rohypnol? Is this "Rho"?
                 (pause)
            IZZIZ A ONE-SIDED CONVERSATION...?
                 (to Anton)
            Whatzisname?

                                                            36.


                      ANTON
                 (looking at his
                 driver's license)
            Donny Zimmer.

                      SCOTT
            Donny. Donny: where's the girl...?
                 (pause)
            You dose her...?
                 (pause)
            Where is she? Donny...?

Anton tossing Zimmer's clothes comes up with an envelope.
Scott takes it, and leafs through many bills.

                      SCOTT
            ...what is this? Ten, what is it,
            Fifteen thou...? For what...?

                      ZIMMER
            I never saw that girl...

                      SCOTT
            Oh, alright, then we've got to
            let you go...

ANGLE CU, Scott.

                      SCOTT
            Where'd you take the girl,
            Donny...?
                 (pause. Silence. To Anton)
            You touch his piece?

                      ANTON
            No.

                      SCOTT
            Good.

Scott gestures to Anton to let Zimmer go. Zimmer hesitates,
knowing he must not move. Scott holds the photo to Zimmer's
face.

                      ZIMMER
            THAT'S NOT THE GIRL...THAT'S NOT
            THE GIRL!

                                                             37.


                      SCOTT
            That's not what girl...?
                 (pause)
            Where'd you take her...?
                 (Scott points to
                 Zimmer's pistol. To Anton)
            Put your glove on. Pick up his
            pistol. Two knees, the other
            elbow,
                 (he points to the head)
            Mozambique...

ANGLE XCU, Anton looking at Scott, to say "Really"?

ANGLE XCU Scott, nodding back, "Really".

                      SCOTT
            You bet your life.

Scott starts to walk away. Zimmer begins screaming.

                      ZIMMER
            Wait...Wait...Wait...

EXT. NORTH END, BOSTON QUIET STREET. NIGHT.

A large Mercedes is parked outside on the quiet street. A
chauffeur reads the paper, he half turns, sleepily, at the
sight of a man walking across the street.

ANGLE Scott and Anton pulling up in a Camaro.

ANGLE INT. THE CAMARO. Scott and Anton, as he turns off the
motor. He looks over at Anton, who holds a piece of paper.

ANGLE THEIR POV. A townhouse across the street. A large
Mercedes in the courtyard driveway. Beat. Scott and Anton
watch, as a door starts to open.

                      SCOTT
            ...okay, then...

Anton begins to respond, when Scott gets out of the car,
motioning Anton toward the Mercedes.

ANGLE EXT. THE TOWNHOUSE. We see a middle-aged Businessman
coming out of a side entrance, adjusting his clothes as he
walks. As Scott walks nearby - we take him to a garbage pail,
where he retrieves a small black bag - that is, as used to
transport dog shit. He walks up.

ANGLE, on Anton, getting out of the Camaro. Behind him,
around the corner, we see a dark van pull up. Anton motions
the van to hold.

                                                             38.


ANGLE, on Scott. As he walks up toward the Businessman,
holding the black bag. He whistles once or twice for his dog,
and then turns to see the Businessman.

                      SCOTT
            ...beautiful night...

                      BUSINESSMAN
                 (nods)
            'Less you got hayfever...
                 (he gestures at the
                 flowering trees)


Scott walks up to him, and pushes him back into the vestibule.

ANGLE TIGHT on Scott as he flicks open his switchblade, and
holds his knife up to the Businessman's throat and whispers.

                      SCOTT
            ...you left something back inside.

Beat. The Businessman looks frantically around, beyond him
we see Anton taking his Chauffeur out of the car. The
Businessman turns to the intercom and pushes a button. We
hear a female voice answer, after a beat, "...yes...?"

ANGLE on Anton, holding a machine pistol, behind a corner of
the wall.

                      BUSINESSMAN
            ...I left my case inside.

There is a beat. And the far door in the vestibule is buzzed
open. As it opens several men in Swat gear stream through
the vestibule and up the stairs. Scott hands the Businessman
over to an Agent, who takes charge of him, and camera holds
on Scott, standing, wearily, at the bottom of the stairs.

He motions for Anton near him to hand him a cigarette. Anton
does so. Scott lights up. From the top of the stairs we hear
screams, sounds of breaking, yells, commands being shouted.

Beat. An Agent comes to the top of the stairs, looks down,
and shakes his head. Beat. Scott turns and finds the
handcuffed Businessman in his field of vision.

                      SCOTT
            ...they got some young girls up
            there...?

Beat. The Businessman, terrified, is silent. Scott holds out
the photo of the girl in the black hair.

                                                             39.


                         SCOTT
               You see this girl...?
                    (pause)


The Businessman looks at the photo. Scott gestures at Anton,
and passes the photo of Laura Newton to Anton. And then
looks as if to say "In or Out?" Anton hesitates a moment,
and then strikes the Businessman.

                         ANTON
               Did you See This Girl...?

ANGLE on the Businessman, on the ground. Terrified. He looks
back at Scott, as if unable to focus. Scott gives him a beat,
nods, as if to say, "What would you expect", and starts up
the stairs.

INT. WHOREHOUSE. NIGHT.

Scott enters the vaguely Japanese modern establishment.
Several Swat figures are being stood down. They sit, sharing
a thermos of coffee. One of the Swat team nods to Scott, and
motions him to the direction he knows Scott wants to go.

Camera takes Scott past a room where two female Agents are
holding five young women, who are supervised, changing out
of "escort" wear, and into jeans and sweatshirts,
"streetclothes".

ANGLE on Scott, as he enters what is obviously the "office"
of the Bordello. One of the techs is sitting at a bashed-in
computer, he is hooking it up to another laptop. He turns to
Scott.

                         TECH
               ...she was trying to scrub the
               thing...

Beyond them we see Miller. And a very attractive European-
looking woman in her forties. In a room beyond two bodyguard
types are handcuffed, watched over by a Swat officer.

Scott moves back to watch Miller interrogating the woman,
the Madam, who speaks with a middle-European accent.

                         MADAM
               ...an escort service. There is
               no impropriety, and there is no...

                                                            40.


                      MILLER
                 (calling back to one
                 of his techs, who
                 consults a computer)
            ...who is she?

                      TECH
            ...Nadya Tellich, Serb. Green
            Card, in...

Miller waves the rest of the information away. Miller shows
her the photo.

                      MILLER
            Have you seen this girl...?

                      NADYA
            We see a lot of girls. They apply.
            For the job, as Hostesses...

ANGLE on Scott, who stands by the Tech, who is trying to
reconstruct the broken computer. It prints out a file, on
which we see photos of various faces. Each girl holds a
placard with a number on it.

ANGLE on Anton, who looks down.

ANGLE HIS POV. The wastebasket. In the BG we hear Nadya
going on about the benefits of working as a Hostess. He
motions to Scott.

Scott squats to the ground, and pours out what are revealed
to be several polaroids of beautiful young women. He uses
his knife to rearrange them without touching them. They are
now alighted and we see the numerals twelve, thirteen,
fifteen, on placards which they hold up.

ANGLE on Scott, as he walks back into the interrogation room,
holding the sheet printed out by the computer.

                      NADYA
            ...a contact for Personal
            Services...They pay us so much
            for each call, and...The girls
            pay us! We are just a -

                      MILLER
            They show you proof of their age...

                      NADYA
            Of course, of course, I...you
            think I...What do you think, I...

                                                           41.


                      SCOTT
                 (showing her the printout)
            Where's Number Fourteen?
                 (pause)


                      NADYA
            ...I don't understand you.

                      SCOTT
            ...where's Number Fourteen?
                 (pause)


                      NADYA
                 (pause)
            I want my Lawyer...

Miller takes the photos of Laura and shows the platinum-
haired one to Nadya.

                      MILLER
            ...is this the Girl? Is this her?
            Was she in here?

                      NADYA
            I, wait, I no...I...I want to
            talk to my lll...

                       MILLER
                 (of the platinum-haired
                 girl)
            Izzat her? It's her, isn't it.
            She was here. Is that her...?

ANGLE, on Scott, as he steps away. He takes us through the
Whorehouse. In the adjacent room we see a bank of video
monitors, showing people in various sexual activities. On
the screen for a moment comes the face of what looks like a
very young girl indeed, camera swerves onto the face of the
Businessman we saw outside the Whorehouse, he is disrobing,...

                      BUSINESSMAN (ON TAPE)
            ...come over here, you little
            bitch...That's right, get your
            sweet ass over here...

ANGLE on Scott. As he looks to the Businessman, himself, who
is seated in a chair, presided over by several agents,
forced to watch the video. He turns his head away.

                      SCOTT
                 (to an Agent)
            Make him watch it.

                                                             42.


One of the agents turns the Businessman's head brusquely back.

                      BUSINESSMAN
            I...I...listen...listen: I'm a
            wealthy man. I am, I am not-
            without-friends in, in the
            Administration...
                 (he takes out a
                 business card and hands
                 it to Scott)
            ...whatever it takes to...

                      SCOTT
            This here, sir. This is a piece
            of cardboard.

Scott holds the card. He shakes his head sadly. Scott nods
to the Interrogator and Scott throws the card into the
Businessman's lap.

                       INTERROGATOR
                 (as the Businessman
                 starts to look away)
            Don't you look away, you son of
            a bitch...
                 (he forces him to watch
                 the video)


ANGLE CU, on Scott, as he looks disgusted. Anton stands on
one side, looking to Scott for a cue as to how to react.

                      BUSINESSMAN
            I...I...I...

                      SCOTT
                 (stepping in)
            "I-I-I" - What are you, Carmen
            Miranda...?

He holds the photo of the platinum-haired Laura Newton.

                      BUSINESSMAN
            I...
                 (he draws Scott close,
                 turning from Anton to
                 the "good" cop)
            Listen to me: I cannot. Be caught
            here. You write an amount on a
            sheet of paper...write it on my
            card...
                      (MORE)

                                                          43.


                      BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)
                 (he takes out his
                 business card and hands
                 it to Scott)


                      SCOTT
            No, Baby. Today we got the Barter
            System. And you best pray to God
            you got something to trade...

                      BUSINESSMAN
            I...I...
                 (he takes out his wallet)


                      SCOTT
            IT AIN'T MONEY. YOU SICK FATCAT
            FOOL. WHERE IS THE GIRL...?
                 (he slaps the
                 Businessman, and Anton
                 pulls him off)
            LEAVE ME ALONE, I'LL GET THE
            TRUTH OUT OF HIM...
                 (he picks up the man's
                 business card)
            Come in here, try to buy me off?
            I've got Three Daughters...

Anton succeeds in pulling Scott off the Businessman. He
drags him around a corner. We see the terrified Businessman
in the background, as Anton tries to reason with Scott.

                      ANTON
            ...maybe we'd...

ANGLE, on Scott, now appearing transformed, and easy. He
gestures "shusshh" to Anton, meaning "It is all an act". In
the BG we see the Interrogator browbeating the Businessman.

                      SCOTT
                 (as he looks down at
                 the Businessman's card,
                 and shakes his head.
                 He moves back toward
                 the Businessman,
                 terrifying him)
            ...I thought when you wanted to
            pet little girls, you picked on
            your Daughter...Ain't that what
            you rich people do...now you
            step off the Reservation and you
            want to buy me?
                      (MORE)

                                                          44.


                      SCOTT (CONT'D)
                 (he shows a photo of
                 the platinum-haired
                 Laura to the Businessman)
            Where Is This Girl...

The Businessman is terrified. He looks around the room in panic.

ANGLE on Scott, as camera takes him to where the Female
Agent is interrogating the Young Whore. Anton follows.

                      YOUNG WHORE
                 (looking at the photo
                 of Laura Newton)
            I...She was sick...she was Not
            Very Well. She came in
            here...and...and...

                      FEMALE AGENT
            ...who was she...?

                      YOUNG WHORE
            I dunno...some young girl. I
            dunno...They took her, I told
            Nadya, she shunnt be here, they
            took her...

                      FEMALE AGENT
            Who took her?

                      YOUNG WHORE
            I think that was her.

                      FEMALE AGENT
            Was she here?

                      YOUNG WHORE
            I think that's the girl...they
            took her. The two, two
            men...they...
                 (she draws the Female
                 Agent closer, frightened)
            ...they gave her a shot...

ANGLE on Scott, as he turns back to Nadya.

                      NADYA
            I am entitled to my rights, and
            I am entitled to a phonecall to
            my lll...

                                                             45.


                      SCOTT
                 (brusquely)
            Your lawyer ain't going to help
            you...want to guess 'why'?
                 (he looks to Miller,
                 who nods, "Go ahead".
                 he takes the photo of
                 Laura with the red
                 hair, sharply, from
                 Miller and shows it to Nadya)
            Y'understand the picture...

                      NADYA
            ...ohmigod...

ANGLE on Miller, as he beckons Scott. Anton starts to come
and Miller signals him to stay behind.

                      SCOTT
            He's with me...

Miller nods and the three walk out of the room.

ANGLE on Scott, as he and Miller retreat behind a door. Beat.

                      MILLER
                 (as it dawns on him)
            They don't know who they've
            got...they just snatched "some
            Young Girl". When they find out,
            they're going to have to...

Scott moves back to Nadya.

                      SCOTT
            She was here. She was here, where
            is she...? WHERE IS SHE?
                 (Scott thrusts the
                 Laura Newton photo at her)
            She was here -

                      NADYA
            ...I...I don't know if this is
            the...

                      SCOTT
            She was here.
                 (pause)

                                                           46.


                       NADYA
                  (very softly, as she
                  looks around, broken,
                  for sympathy)
             ...they'll kill me.

                       SCOTT
             Who did you call. How did they
             know, to come get her?

                       NADYA
             I...it's just a number, I...

Miller pushes a pad of paper and a pencil across to her.

ANGLE TIGHT on Scott. As he looks on. Beat. He nods, as if
to say "We're getting there". There is the sound of a phone
ringing, and an Agent comes in, and beckons Miller, who
waves him away. The Agent indicates, "No, you have to take
this call." Miller steps back from Nadya, not wanting to
break the mood, and moves toward the phone. Scott moves to
stand by the girl.

ANGLE on Scott as he pushes the paper toward her, again,
forcing and willing her to put down the number.

                       MILLER
                  (softly. To phone)
             ...hello...

INT. FOOTBALL STADIUM. NIGHT.

A helicopter is settling onto the playing field.

ANGLE. Two men getting out of a Suburban, across the field,
run toward the helicopter.

ANGLE, a powerful-looking older man in a suit, BURCH, steps
down from the helicopter, and an Aide greets him and leads
him away from the helicopter. We see the Aide indicate the
two men running toward them. Burch turns.

ANGLE HIS POV. Miller and Scott, who join with Burch, as
they all move toward the stadium building.

INT. STADIUM BUILDING, LUNCHROOM. NIGHT.

ANGLE, on an assembly of the information of the chase. On a
table, the photos of the Eurasian businesswoman, of Laura
Newton, of the Regency Club. A disassembled machine pistol,
and a cup of steaming coffee.

HOLD on Scott, looking at something, off. As he picks up the
cup of coffee. Beyond him we see Anton, asleep in his chair.

                                                            47.


ANGLE INT. LUNCHROOM. Burch, Scott, and Miller are found in
the empty, stainless steel lunchroom, with them a clean-cut
young man, STODDARD, obviously Burch's assistant.

                      BURCH
            ...where's the girl...?

                      MILLER
            Sir, we believe she was abducted,
            from this club...
                 (as Miller speaks he
                 passes pertinent sheets
                 of information to Burch)
            That she was taken to...that she
            was taken to a bordello...

                      BURCH
            ...here in Boston...

                      MILLER
            Yessir, and, that...that...

                      BURCH
            Come on, let's hear it:

                      MILLER
            That she may have been...that
            she may have been delivered -
            for sale - that she may have
            been sent down the pipeline and
            overseas.
                 (pause)


                      BURCH
                 (pause)
            "...just some girl..."
                 (pause)


ANGLE. HOLD on Scott. Sitting quietly, as he watches the two
other men.

Stoddard takes out a cigar case. Looks to Burch, who nods
his consent, and Stoddard takes out a black cigar, and
lights it.

                      BURCH
            How certain are you she was the
            girl in the whorehouse?

                                                             48.


                      MILLER
                 (shakes his head,
                 meaning "not positive")
            ...we...

                      BURCH
            Was the girl in the whorehouse?
                 (pause)
            What about your other
            leads?...the Boyfriend,
            the...Professor...?

                      MILLER
            ...sir.

                      STODDARD
            The Professor, where's his boat?

                      MILLER
            The Coast Guard is on the...

                      STODDARD
            WHERE IS THE FUCKEN BOAT? IS SHE
            ON THE BOAT...

ANGLE on Scott and Anton. As Anton comes awake to the sound
of the shouting. Scott gestures him to keep quiet.

ANGLE on the two. As Anton wakes up. He picks up a sheet
bearing the Picasso symbol, and starts to speak. Scott
shakes his head, meaning "be quiet".

                      SCOTT
            ...we just go where we're sent
            and do what we're told when we
            get there...

He motions to be quiet - and to pay attention to the drama
in the next room.

ANGLE INT. THE STEEL LUNCHROOM. As Burch and Stoddard
interrogate Miller.

                      BURCH
            You've got the fucken Service
            Agent, shot himself...you're
            you're telling me, your best bet,
            some cocksuckers nabbed her,
            took her, took her, they don't
            know who she is. And they're
            gonna sell her down the river...?

                      MILLER
            Sir...

                                   49.


          BURCH
The Detail Agent. Was he fucking
her?

            MILLER
The girl?

          BURCH
The Secret Service Agent, was he
fucking Laura Newton...?

          MILLER
He was off-post, with his
girlfriend.
     (pause)


           STODDARD
     (as he holds up the
     "Picasso" letter from
     the Boyfriend, to read
     it. He reads:)
The Professor, the Boyfriend,
"...you behave like a slut...",
this is who you like...?
     (he holds up the
     advertisement of the
     Regency Club)
Aah...fuck
     (he holds up the photo
     of her hair)
She dyed her hair. What do they
do, her hair grows out, what do
they do when they realize who
she is...?
     (pause)


          SCOTT
     (under his breath, not
     realizing he's speaking)
They kill her.

          BURCH
     (reacting, as if to
     say, "That's the first
     sensible thing I've heard")
You're fucken A Right they kill
her. Okay. Good.
          (MORE)

                                                          50.


                      BURCH (CONT'D)
            Now: Let's talk some commonsense:
                 (pause)
            What can you do for me?
                 (to Miller)
            ...who is that...?
                 (Miller whispers to
                 Burch. To Scott)
            ...Get in here...
                 (Scott comes and stands
                 by Burch)


Scott, and then Miller, looks at Burch's clean-cut and very
fit assistant, Stoddard. There is a pause, and then Burch
motions Stoddard to leave the room, which he does. Pause.

                      BURCH
                 (quietly)
            ...what can you do for me? What
            can you do for me - I need it
            now - I need it before the Press
            gets it on Monday. Cause they
            will kill her. The jackals start
            a feeding frenzy, and she's red.
            Help me.

Miller nods to an Aide, who comes forward, with a white
scrap of paper. He hands it to Burch.

                      MILLER
            Sir: This is the number of a
            public phone in Downtown Boston.
                 (Burch nods)
            It's a cutout, between the
            Bordello, and the abductors. A
            call is placed when they have a
            package to deliver.

                      BURCH
            ...you going to stake out the
            phone...?

                       MILLER
                 (nods)
            We have a watch on the phone.
            More importantly: N.S.A. reports
            calls placed to that phone.
            Regularly.

                      BURCH
            They can track calls to a payphone?

                                                             51.


                      MILLER
            In this case they can.

                      BURCH
            How?

                      MILLER
            They were made from a Federal
            Prison.
                 (he gestures to the
                 Aide, who shows to
                 Burch and the camera a
                 photo of a smiling man
                 in his forties, in an
                 expensive suit. Of photo:)
            This is Eli Assani. He is a
            Lebanese National, serving life
            without, for kidnapping. He was
            the head man in a white slavery
            scheme.

                      BURCH
            And where is he?

                      MILLER
            He's in Lewisberg. We have a
            Plan...
                 (pause)
            I hesitate to...

                      BURCH
            Give it to me...

ANGLE, on an Aide who comes in and passes a piece of paper
to Miller, who reads it and looks up.

                      MILLER
            They've got some action on the
            Payphone...

Scott and Anton start to get to their feet.

EXT. COPLEY SQUARE, DOWNTOWN. NIGHT.

In the foreground we see a lonely payphone in the deserted
square. It is festooned with ads for escort services. In the
deep background we see the lights on in a corner bank
building, and the cleaners at work.

ANGLE INT. THE BANK. One of the cleaners polishes the
counter in the bank. He wipes his brow and looks outside.

ANGLE HIS POV. A sedan at the curb. Beyond it, a man,
smoking a cigarette, stands near the payphone.

                                                             52.


The man looks at his watch, looks around, throws away the
cigarette, and continues to pace.

ANGLE, in the bank the "Cleaner" whispers into a lapel mike.

EXT. BOSTON STREET. DAY.

Scott, in the backseat of a car, apparently asleep. Anton,
sitting in the front. Listening to the faint sounds from an
earwig.

ANGLE, XCU. Scott, his head tilted back, looking through
almost fully closed eyelids.

                      SCOTT
            ...who's walking up on us...?

ANGLE, Anton, as he looks around, down at Scott, and then up,
at a man in a suit, some thirty yards away, walking towards
the car.

Anton, as the man draws closer, looks down at Scott, as if
to say "How did you know"?

                      SCOTT
                 (as he loosens his
                 jacket, over his pistol)
            ...who is he?

                      ANTON
            Boston. P.D.

We see Scott, relax for a moment. And then, putting Anton
out of his misery.

                      SCOTT
            ...always a reflective surface...
                 (then, to himself, as
                 if reciting a litany)
            "...in the city, always a
            reflection. In the Woods. Always
            a sound..."

HOLD. On Anton, as he digests this. BEAT.

                      ANTON
            ...and in the Desert?

                      SCOTT
            You don't want to go into the
            desert.

ANGLE, EXT. The Phonebooth in Copley Square. We hear the
phone begin to ring.

                                                             53.


EXT. BOSTON STREET. DAY.

Scott and Anton, in the sedan. Anton listening on the
earpiece. Anton brightens.

                      ANTON
            ...they're moving...

Anton starts to put the car in gear, an Agent comes jogging
down the street, out of an alley, and motions Anton aside,
and gets into the car.

EXT. BOSTON HIGHWAY. NIGHT.

A shot of the helicopter, flying over the highway.

ANGLE, the sedan speeding down the deserted highway, the
city in the background. The helicopter, flying away overhead.

INT. SCOTT'S CAR.

A Driver, Scott, and Anton. Listening to transmissions on
the radio. As they drive Anton leans forward, his hands on
the seatback of the front seat. Scott picks up one of
Anton's hands, and turns it over.

                      SCOTT
                 (of the hand)
            ...what is this...?

                      ANTON
                 (as he looks down, and
                 then realizes the
                 nature of the question)
            ...it's a wedding ring.

                      SCOTT
            ...take it off.
                 (pause. While Anton
                 hesitates, not comprehending)
            ...the ring clicks against your
            riflestock, some sonobitch hears
            that noise, hundred yards out,
            and you're gonna get me killed.

Anton nods, and begins to work the ring off his finger.

ANGLE THEIR POV. Far ahead, the speeding sedan turns off the
highway, onto a "feeder" road.

Anton and Scott in the backseat. As we see Anton take out a
machine pistol from his "Go" bag, and check it. Scott looks
at him. A chatter comes over the radio, and Scott addresses
the two men in the front seat.

                                                             54.


                      SCOTT
            ...where's he going...?

The Driver hands a printout to the shotgun man, who reads.

                      AGENT
            One Five Four Nine, Alpha Sierra,
            Mass Reg. William Barak.
            Somerville, Mass...

                      SCOTT
            That's where he's going?

The Agent shakes his head, looks down at the paper.

                      AGENT
            Also, owner of Record, In Essex...

                      SCOTT
            Izzey going toward Essex?
                 (Agent nods)
            ...what sort of place is it...?

The Agent looks at the piece of paper.

                      AGENT
            It...it'd be a Beach house...

                      SCOTT
            Get me there.
                 (to the Driver)
            Get on the net. Call 'em off.
            Everyone off. Just me.
                 (of Anton)
            Just me and him.

                        DRIVER
            ...sir...

                       SCOTT
            Nobody out there...
                 (to Anton)
            Just. Him.
                 (to the Driver)
            You indicate that you heard me.
                 (beat. The Driver nods)
            Put it out.
                 (the Driver begins to
                 speak softly, relaying
                 his instructions on
                 the radio. Scott turns
                 to Anton. Softly)
            How you doing bright eyes...?
                 (Anton nods. Beat, as
                 Scott looks him over)

                                                            55.


                      SCOTT
            ...breathe through your nose.

Anton looks at Scott inquisitively, not sure he has heard right.

                      SCOTT
            It stills the heartrate.
                 (pause)
            You got my back.

                      ANTON
            Sir, Yes, Sir.

                      SCOTT
                 (to himself)
            ...alright, then...

ANGLE the Sedan, on the deserted highway. HOLD. We see
another car come screaming up behind it, doing one-ten, a
red light on the roof, flashing.

ANGLE INT. THE SEDAN. A middle-aged man watches the other
car come up, and disappear around a bend, going furiously fast.

EXT. ESSEX BEACH. NIGHT.

The margin of the scrubwoods, in the dunes. Scott and Anton,
moving quietly through the woods. Scott points to Anton,
indicating where he should stop.

ANGLE, Scott's POV. A run-down beach house on a deserted
cove. The blue light of a television flickering through the
window.

ANGLE, Scott peering through some scrubgrass. We see he
holds a small handful of torn-off grass before and over his
face, to break up his outline. He turns. To Anton, who
stands next to him, holding a sniper rifle. He points out a
position to Anton.

                      ANTON
            ...you want me to Come Through
            the Door...?

                      SCOTT
                 (as he checks his
                 weapons. He shakes his head.)
            Don't you go through the door
            without an Overwatch.

He takes the small handful of grass and throws it into the
air, watching the way the wind takes it. Scott gestures to
Anton to take up a position beside a small run-down boat shed.

                                                             56.


We see Anton do so, then Scott moves across the dunes, to a
small skiff. Which lies just across a little cove from the
beach house.

ANGLE, on Scott, as he moves down the dune, to the skiff. He
opens his switchblade quietly, and severs the line holding
the skiff to the dock. He gets into the skiff, and pushes it
off, and we see it begin to drift across the little cove
toward the beach house.

ANGLE, on Anton, kneeling, beside the old boat shed, as he
assumes a prone position, and sights his rifle in on the
beach house.

ANGLE, HIS POV. Through the sniperscope, the house, the
television, flickering in an empty living room.

INT. THE WOODS.

Anton, acknowledging the command. He finds a vantage point,
and assumes the prone position, covering the house with his
rifle.

ANGLE on Scott, surveying the beach house.

ANGLE HIS POV. The dark beach house.

ANGLE on Scott, as he moves across the lawn, and to a back
door. He removes his switchblade, opens it, and uses it to
jimmy the screen latch. He replaces it, and takes out a set
of lock picks, and begins to work on the door. We faintly
hear the sound of a television.

ANGLE INT. THE BEACH HOUSE. We hear the sound of the TV and
faintly, see a blue glow from a room or two down the hall.

ANGLE on Scott, entering the kitchen, where he looks down at
the various dirty plates and cups on the table.

ANGLE on Scott, coming through the door. As he moves, flat
to the wall. Camera follows him past the doorway, beyond
which we see the TV on low. Scott looks in, and finds it empty.

ANGLE on Scott, as we follow him into the bedroom. It is empty.

HOLD on Scott, looking around.

ANGLE, as he comes back into the living room. He stops. We
see something beyond him.

ANGLE HIS POV. A small boat some twenty yards from the house.
Out near the water.

                                                          57.


ANGLE, on Scott, as he starts to open the rear, sliding
glass door which will lead him out to the boat.

Behind him, we see the MAN FROM THE SEDAN open the front
door of the house, and begin to enter. Scott hears him, and
turns.

                      MAN FROM THE SEDAN
                 (as he sees Scott)
            ...what the fuck...?

                       SCOTT
            ...I heard the TV, so I came
            in...
                  (pause)


The Sedan Man is put a bit off, as the comment makes no
sense. Scott uses the moment to advance toward the man.

                      SCOTT
            ...what the hell you got the TV
            on for, there's nobody here...?
                 (the man puts up his hands)
            I don't wanna hurt you. Why would
            I hurt you? I just wanna know
            why the TV's on.

ANGLE EXT. THE BUILDING. Where we see the man, and Scott. We
see the scene in green, through a sniperscope.

ANGLE, on Anton, looking through the scope.

ANGLE CU Anton, as he sees something in the scope.

ANGLE, in the house. Scott advancing toward the man.

                      SCOTT
            ...I just wannit to know, I just
            came to ask you that question...

The man backs up, past a half-open glass French door.

ANGLE, on Scott, as he advances toward the man.

ANGLE, ANTON'S POV. Through the sniperscope. The faint
traces of what might be the Picasso symbol.

ANGLE, on Anton, as we see him move the sniperscope and
adjust its magnification toward the symbol. In a corner of
the scope, we see another man, in a dirty white shirt,
emerge, coming up the stairs from what might be the basement
of the beach house. We see this man take in the scene in the
next room, and secrete himself behind a wall.

                                                             58.


ANGLE, on Anton, whose vision is blocked - Camera takes him
to a position next to the white tool shed.

Scott, moving toward the Sedan Man, unaware of the man
around the corner.

ANGLE through the sniperscope. We see the man in the white
shirt ready himself behind the opening through which Scott
will come. We see him raise a pistol.

ANGLE Anton, as he realizes he is behind the curve. As the
man in the white shirt steps into the doorway Anton fires at
him through the sniperscope. We see this man fall.

ANGLE, INT. THE HOUSE. The man in the Sedan, his hands
raised, fetches down a small shotgun from the lintel over
the door, and levels it toward Scott. Who draws and fires
several rounds at him.

ANGLE INT. THE HOUSE. As the man goes down heavily. Scott
comes forward to the dying man, and kicks the shotgun away.

Camera takes Scott warily into the next room, where he sees
the man in the white shirt sprawled on the floor. Scott
moves past him, and down to a door leading to the basement.
Scott takes a long look down the basement stairs. We see a
faint light, and a shadow moving across the light.

ANGLE on Scott, as he takes a deep breath, and bursts down
the stairs, screaming.

ANGLE INT. The Basement. A rough, dirt-floored room. Scott
standing alone. We see a bare bulb hanging from the ceiling,
swinging slightly in the breeze from an open window.

                      SCOTT
            I'm Coming Up...

ANGLE, Anton, inside the house, in a covering position,
watching out. Scott comes up the stairs.

                      SCOTT
                 (to Anton)
            Call em in...

We see Anton take out a walkie and talk into it, Scott
proceeds to the Sedan Man. He kneels by him.

                      SCOTT
            ...where's the girl...? You're
            dying, pal. Even it up. WHERE IS
            THE GIRL... WHERE IS THE GIRL...

                                                             59.


Scott pulls the dying, bloody man to him, and starts to
shake him.

                      SCOTT
            You're dying. You're dying, man.
            Where is the girl...

Beat. The man begins to shudder, violently, and then stops,
obviously dead. Beat. Scott throws the dead man down onto
the floor. Beat.

ANGLE, on Anton, who turns to look back. He stares at the
dead man.

                      SCOTT
            ...well, you wanted to know...
                 (pause. Scott kicks
                 the dead man viciously)


Anton looks at Scott. Beat.

                      SCOTT
                 (to himself)
            Yeah, everybody wants to know
            the Secret Knowledge...

Scott sits on a chair, by an old rolltop desk. On the desk
we see a bunch of junk, old cigarette packets, empty. A box
half-full of yellowing stationary. Scott prods the stationary
with his knife. We read, in an insert: "Hanson Marine.
Everything for the boat. Box 38 Essex, Mass." (and see, on
the envelope, an old fashioned, stylized drawing of an old
chriscraft-like power boat).

We hear the sound of a helicopter. And Scott turns, looking
out of the window. He then turns back, to see Anton, who is
standing, looking down at the man he shot. Anton, feeling
Scott's gaze, turns to look at him.

                         ANTON
            ...I...

                      SCOTT
            ...tell it to the Chaplain.

Scott gets up wearily, and walks toward the door out onto
the beach. We see a helicopter landing, and several men in
BDU's, jumping out, and proceeding toward the house.

INT. STADIUM DRESSING ROOM. DAY.

Burch and his Aide. As Scott and Anton enter. Followed by
Miller.

                                                             60.


Burch motions Miller over, and they confer, looking at Scott
and Anton.

ANGLE, on Scott and Anton, as they stand by a television, an
Agent is watching, shaking his head.

                      BRUNETTE TALKING HEAD
            ...apparently, had her hair
            restyled, and cut today, our
            Newsteam interviewed her stylist,
            and has reconstructed...

                      SCOTT
            Ah, shit...

ANGLE. He is summoned, into the next room. By Burch et al.

Burch and his Aide. As Scott comes in with Anton, followed
by Miller. Burch takes Scott aside.

                      BURCH
                 (looking at a TV in
                 the BG silently,
                 showing photos of Laura
                 as a brunette)
            ...here's the deal:
                 (pause. He holds up a
                 photo of Eli Assani,
                 the Businessman, both
                 in a suit, and in his
                 prison garb, with a
                 number in front of him.
                 His name, and
                 "Lewisberg Federal Penitentiary")
            ...this is the man.
                 (pause, to Scott)
            ...you're covered in blood.

                      SCOTT
            Sir, it ain't mine.
                 (Burch looks at Anton.
                 Scott, seeing his glance)
            On my team, sir.

                      BURCH
            How deep is he?

                      SCOTT
                 (saying, in effect,
                 this sums it up)
            ...He's on the team.

                                                          61.


                      BURCH
            Yeah, well. He may have to be a
            little more than On the Team...
                 (pause. After considering)
            I've been speaking to the father.
                 (pause)


Burch walks a few steps away. Thinking. Scott looks at Anton,
questioning.

                      BURCH
                 (pause)
            What about if we had to go "off
            the meter"?

                      SCOTT
            ...With the Mission, sir.

Burch thinks for a moment. And then draws Scott aside. Burch
glances over at the television, spewing information about
Laura Newton, and shakes his head with disgust.

                      BURCH
                 (to himself)
            ...I'm out of time...

He turns back to Scott. And gestures him into a small room,
and closes the door.

                      BURCH
            ...man to man.

                      SCOTT
            The door's closed, Sir.

                       BURCH
            I. Need. To Ask You. To do
            something.
                 (he is hard-pressed to continue)


                      SCOTT
            I am here to get the girl back.

Burch thinks a moment, he rubs his face, and shakes his head,
and looks up as if to say "This is all we have, this is the
best we have". Pause. He nods, as they do not move.

Burch takes out a photo of a bearded middle-eastern looking
man in a business suit, and another, in a mugshot marked
"Lewisberg Federal Penitentiary".

                                                          62.


                      BURCH
            This man...Placed a phonecall.
            Yesterday. From the phonebank at
            Lewisberg. To the Copley Payphone.
                 (pause)
            Here's the cut-off-point...
                 (he looks meaningfully
                 at Scott. Pause)
            ...here it is: This man, Eli
            Assani, is to be transported,
            tomorrow, Wednesday, with another
            convict. A Man on Death Row. For
            their medical procedures...Now:

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD. DAY.

A Police Cruiser coming quickly down a two-lane, deserted road.

ANGLE INT. THE CRUISER. A road sign reads "Just Two Miles To
'The Owl', Rest Stop, Restaurant, Gas-Diesel".

ANGLE EXT. THE OWL. Rest Stop. A run-down rural gas station,
restaurant. Off to the side we see the cruiser coming down
the road. As a roughly-dressed man runs out of the restaurant,
carrying a full paper bag in his hand. The Cruiser, unseen
by the man, pulls up to the gas pump, and the Trooper starts
to get out of the driver's seat. When gunfire erupts from
the restaurant. People are shooting at the fleeing man. A
man opens the door of the restaurant and fires at the
roughly-dressed man in a very urban leather jacket, who
returns fire. Glass breaks in the windows of the restaurant.

The roughly-dressed man runs to his car, an 80's Pontiac,
parked near the pumps. The man in the doorway fires again,
and the windshield of the Pontiac blows out and a tire
bursts. The roughly-dressed man returns fire, and the man in
the doorway falls. The roughly-dressed man turns to see that
the Trooper is out of his Cruiser, and is about to fire at
him. The roughly-dressed man drops his satchel, and fires at
the Trooper, who falls.

The paper bag has fallen to the ground and burst, and
currency is spilling out of it, and being taken on the wind.
The roughly-dressed man frantically begins to try to scoop
it up and into his jacket.

ANGLE CU on this man, who we now see is SCOTT. He stands
around, and moves to the fallen Trooper. He strips the keys
from the Trooper's keyring, and looks up. Feeling someone
gazing at him.

ANGLE HIS POV. In the car, two convicts, a Heavyset Man and
ELI ASSANI, the middle-eastern man we saw in the mugshot. He
is holding his neck, which is bleeding copiously.

                                                            63.


We see the back window behind him, shattered by gunfire.

ANGLE on Scott, who gets into the car, takes the keys he
took from the Trooper, and begins screaming off down the
highway.

LOW ANGLE, showing the car taking a turn vastly too fast,
the car careens up on two wheels, rights itself, fishtails,
corrects, and disappears in the distance.

ANGLE INT. THE CAR. Scott driving steals a look back at
Assani, in the back seat, whimpering.

                       SCOTT
            Shut up.

The Police Radio chatters: "Two Twelve Sierra, come
back...Two Twelve Sierra, come back, we have your request
for Code Seven...please come back with your Twenty."

                      HEAVYSET CONVICT
            Yeah, two twelve sierra took all
            the 20 he's gonna take...Oh, man,
            you left him there...

ANGLE on Scott driving. He looks behind him.

ANGLE, POV. In the rearview mirror. A dust cloud settling
over the deserted highway.

ANGLE INT. THE OWL. Various techies, in the kitchen,
monitoring the broadcast of the microphone in the Police Car,
Anton among them. The Trooper comes in, taking off his
bullet-proof vest, and sits to listen, where we find Miller
and his Agents. The 'Restaurant Owner', who we now see is
Anton, takes off his jacket and his bullet-proof vest and
picks a slug, fired by Scott, out of the center of the vest.

                      HEAVYSET CONVICT (V.O.)
            ...yeah. You marked him Paid in
            Full...

                      ASSANI (V.O.)
            ...you got to pull over, you got
            to stop...I'm bleeding.

ANGLE INT. THE POLICE CAR.

                      HEAVYSET CONVICT
            Yeah, he done ate from the tree
            of knowledge, our Sierra Two Twelve.

                      ASSANI
            ...help me...

                                                             64.


                       SCOTT
            Shut up.

ANGLE, EXT. COUNTRY ROAD. The car comes to a panic stop,
fifty yards beyond a turnoff onto a dirt road. The car is
put in gear, backs up, and takes the road.

EXT. FARM ROAD. DAY.

The car comes quickly up a small farm road, we see a run-
down barn, and a farmhouse, washing on the line. Scott pulls
the car into the barn, next to an old pick-up truck. He gets
out of the car, we hear Assani in the backseat calling to him.

ANGLE, Scott, as he turns to Assani, who is pressing a
blood-soaked shirt to his neck. Calling "Help me".

Scott opens the back door of the Cruiser, and the Heavyset
Man gets out, and offers his manacled hands for release.
Scott motions to Assani.

                      SCOTT
            ...drag him out...
                 (the man does so. Scott
                 motions for them to be quiet)
            ...got some business to do...

He takes his pistol and walks toward the farmhouse.

HOLD on Assani, and the other Convict, Assani is holding a
rag to his bleeding neck.

                      ASSANI
            ...help me...

                      HEAVYSET CONVICT
            ...yeah, I heard yah...

ANGLE, on Scott, as he walks past a clothesline heavy with
drying clothes, he is seen to go into the house. We hear a
woman's scream, and then two shots are fired.

ANGLE INT. THE HOUSE. As Scott is found at a table in the
kitchen next to which are various foodstuffs laid out.
Inside the house we see a female techie, at a table by the
wall, various communications gear in front of her. Scott
begins loading up his pockets with food. The techie hands
Scott a slate on which is written, in large block letters,
"The helo is standing by, will assault in support when you
have found the girl. On your command." Scott gestures for
the slate, and writes on it, and hands it back. Scott nods,
and walks out of the house.

                                                             65.


ANGLE INSERT. The slate, on which we see Scott has written
"Keep Your Distance!"

ANGLE, on Scott, as he walks back through the yard, pulling
clothes off the line.

ANGLE INT. THE BARN. The two convicts, as Scott enters, and
begins changing out of his clothes, and into the clothes he
found on the line.

                      HEAVYSET CONVICT
            Yeah, Baby. Pass some my way...

                      SCOTT
            Sorry, my man...traveling light...

He turns to the Heavyset Man, and fires his revolver at him
twice. The man falls, dead. Scott turns his revolver at
Assani, who begins to scream.

                      ASSANI
            Don't shoot me, don't shoot me,
            I have what you want. I HAVE
            WHAT YOU WANT. I CAN GET US OUT
            OF THE COUNTRY TONIGHT. TONIGHT.
            NO PASSPORT. FLY OUT.
            TONIGHT...OH GOD, DON'T SHOOT ME!
            I SWEAR ON MY MOTHER. LOOK AT ME:
            AM I LYING TO YOU? A SEA PLANE.
            TONIGHT. HELP ME. I SWEAR TO YOU.

                      SCOTT
            Why in the world would I believe
            a lying convict like you...

                      ASSANI
            Oh, ah, ah, but you do believe
            me...I see it...you do. I can
            get us out. Help me. I SWEAR TO
            YOU. HELP ME...and I will treat
            you like a brother...I...

Scott advances on him.

                      SCOTT
            My brother used to beat me
                 (he raises the cop's
                 service revolver and
                 cocks the hammer)
            Nice guess, though.

                         ASSANI
            OH GOD NO!

                                                          66.


Scott pulls the trigger, which falls on an empty chamber.
Assani whimpers, as Scott goes into the Cruiser, comes out
with a box of shells, clears the empties from the cop's gun,
and begins loading it.

                      ASSANI
            No, no. Listen to
            me...listen...make one call. One
            call - go in the house. Make One
            Call. ONE CALL. An Aviation
            Company. Tell...tell them...tell
            them the word I say, and they
            will say: THE PLANE WILL MEET
            YOU AT...
                 (Scott hesitates for a
                 moment, and Assani
                 attempts to capitalize
                 on it)
            Yes. Yes...

INT. PICK-UP TRUCK. DAY.

Scott is driving. The dash is littered with empty coffeecups,
cigarette packs. He turns.

ANGLE HIS POV. Assani, sitting in the shotgun seat, a map in
his lap, looking at him.

                      SCOTT
            You a fag my friend?

                      ASSANI
            No.
                 (pause)
            I am not.

                      SCOTT
            Then why the hell you looking at me?

                      ASSANI
            I was thinking...how fucking
            surprised you're going to be.
                 (pause)
            Because, Baby, you just did that
            fucken good turn, going to Make
            You Rich, Fat, and Happy...

                      SCOTT
            ...just get me on that plane.

                      ASSANI
            Didn't they tell you...?

                                                      67.


                      SCOTT
            All I heard's a voice on the
            phone...

Assani grins, as if to say, "Just Wait".

                      ASSANI
            ...you like girls...?

                      SCOTT
            Better question, where you've
            been so long, do you like girls?

Scott grins, and Assani shares the moment with him.

                      ASSANI
            We have. You will have...the
            most beautiful...

                      SCOTT
            ...most beautiful women, eh?

                      ASSANI
            Not women, Baby. Girls. You got
            to trust me, I'm the Doctor
            here...All young. All blonde...

                      SCOTT
            And this all takes place Where...?

                      ASSANI
            In Dubai. In Yemen...

                      SCOTT
            Well, that's a long way from
            Tiperrary, pal...

                      ASSANI
            ...what do you have here...?

                      SCOTT
            Yeah, but I'm not cut out, to
            live in a fucken tent.
                 (Assani laughs)


                      ASSANI
            If you think you can imagine
            luxury...I am here to tell you,
            my friend...
                 (he smiles broadly)

                                                          68.


                      SCOTT
            Well, may it Just Be So...

                      ASSANI
            When we get to Maskala...

                      SCOTT
            And, now, what's Maskala...?

                      ASSANI
            ...when we get to Dubai, better...

                      SCOTT
            What's Maskala...?

                      ASSANI
            ...that's where we clean them up.
            We ship them Rough, we make them
            Smooth, and everybody's happy.

                      SCOTT
            Well, then, you're a
            philosopher...huh...? How 'bout
            making me happy tonight...

                      ASSANI
            If there's a girl, in the
            pipeline, tonight, you shall
            have her, what do you say to that?

                      SCOTT
            ...I say you're a stone cold
            whoremaster...

Assani joins with him in the joke, nodding his assent.

                      ASSANI
            No, no baby. Take it to the    bank.
            The Arabs, Man. All the oil    -
            all the money in the world.    What
            can't they have? Booze and    Pussy.
            How do they get it...?

                      SCOTT
            You the candy man? Is that it?

Assani begins to swoon. He puts his hand to his neck, and it
comes away covered in blood, where it was cut by the glass
fragment.

                      SCOTT
            Ah. Hell...

                                                          69.


                      ASSANI
            Yeah, no. I'm bleeding bad here,
            friend...

                      SCOTT
                 (he looks over)
            Yeah, we just, we got to get
            some...yeah, you need, all we
            need, some tailoring tools.

ANGLE, Sedan. Holding Anton and several agents, listening to
the broadcast from Scott's car.

                      SCOTT
            Yeah, in my wishlist, we had a
            drugstore, get us some morphine,
            some...

ANGLE EXT. ANTON'S CAR. As it increases speed.

ANGLE INT. SCOTT'S CAR. As he tries to staunch the fellow.
Scott steers with one hand. And turns off the highway at an
exit, showing two miles to a town.

INT. SMALL TOWN PHARMACY. DAY.

Scott, dressed in the farm clothes that he took off of the
line. Scott is buying supplies. On the counter we see
bandages, hydrogen peroxide, etc. Behind the counter we see
a newscast, showing a picture of Laura Newton, in long
blonde hair, and a woman is doing a talking-head about fashion.

                      TV WOMAN
            ...America's Number One Redhead,
            "She Sets the Style, She Brings
            a Smile", she's Betty co-ed, in
            College, and she's off for what
            her father's office says is an
            "extended sailing weekend".
                 (the screen shows a sailboat)
            With "person or persons
            unknown"...yo ho, yo Ho...she
            "old" enough for that, our
            "Little Red Riding-Hood", Cathy...?

Scott ignores the screen.

ANGLE EXT. THE STORE. In back, Assani is sitting in the
pickup, a woman driving another beat-up pickup pulls into
the lot, there is a shotgun in the rack by the rear window.
Assani crouches lower, to prevent being seen.

ANGLE INT. THE STORE. As Scott is checking out. A policeman
enters from the police car. We see it is Anton.

                                                             70.


ANGLE. On Scott, as he moves to the back of the store, to
meet Anton. Scott looks inquisitively at him.

                      ANTON
                 (whispers)
            ...the helo just went down...

                      SCOTT
            ...don't whisper to me, Baby, it
            draws heat. What helo?

                      ANTON
            ...the assault helicopter. You've
            got no backup, at the house.
                 (beat. Scott nods)
            You'll be in there, alone, the
            first few minutes...

                      SCOTT
            Well, there you go, then.

                      ANTON
            You said "Never go in without an
            overwatch".

                      SCOTT
            That's all fine, lad, "But this
            is the fleet".

                       ANTON
            You know you deliver him in the
            door, you know they're going to
            waste you.

                      SCOTT
            ...gimme whatever nine mil you've
            got...

Anton takes out the magazines in the pouches on his belt.
And starts to strip off the rounds.

                      SCOTT
            ...just gimme the mags...
                 (Anton does so)
            ...gimme your piece.

Anton takes the pistol from his belt. Scott checks it, and
puts it in the small of his back.

ANGLE EXT. THE STORE. Assani, in the pickup, sees through a
small window in the store.

ANGLE on Anton and Scott. Scott is walking away from him,
and Anton puts a hand on him, and turns him back.

                                                             71.


ANGLE INT. THE STORE. Anton gestures Scott to wait a moment.
Scott waves, it is not necessary. He goes to the counter,
and picks up the medical supplies. He starts toward the back
door. He calls back, over his shoulder

                      SCOTT
            Thank you...

ANGLE on Anton, as we see something occur to him. He turns
to the other officer with him, and asks a question, and we
see the other officer hand Anton several magazines of
ammunition.

ANGLE on Scott, as he is coming out of the back door.

ANGLE on Anton, as he follows him.

                      ANTON
                 (calling)
            Mister...mister: you forgot your
            change...

ANGLE on Scott, as he turns back. We see Anton bringing the
ammunition.

ANGLE on Assani, weak, holding the shotgun, as he supports
himself along the wall, he peers around the corner, at Anton
and Scott.

                      ANTON
                 (sotto)
            ...you better take care of
            yourself, because...

ANGLE, on Assani, who comes around the corner, and fires the
shotgun at Anton, who falls. Scott screams "No".

ANGLE, on Scott, who drops the packages, and turns to Assani,
who is jacking another round into the chamber of the shotgun.
Scott draws and fires at him several times.

ANGLE on Scott, who kicks away the shotgun, and turns back
to Anton, who is crawling on his back, out of the line of
fire...

                      ANTON
            A...I'm alright...I'm alright...

ANGLE, on Scott, turning to look at Anton. And, then, back
at the obviously dead Assani.

INT. SMALL TOWN HOSPITAL. DAY.

In a waiting room. Scott, who looks up, as Miller enters.

                                                            72.


                      MILLER
            Your partner's going to be alright.

                      SCOTT
            I do not look at the downed man,
            Sir...

                      MILLER
            Yeah, well...

Miller nods, and starts to walk away.

                         SCOTT
            ...Sir...?

Miller turns back, understanding Scott's request.

                      MILLER
                 (sits, acceding to
                 Scott's request)
            ...Air Force Assault is airborne,
            five minutes out.
                 (pause, Scott shakes
                 his head sadly)
            Standing down's a bitch.

                       SCOTT
            I stand down when the girl's
            back, sir.

                      MILLER
            They'll get her out, if she's in
            there...
                 (pause, as he looks at Scott)
            You did your part, what the fuck
            do you want, a Citation?

Out of the window we see a   medical helicopter. Its rotors
just starting to turn. We   see two white-coated medical types,
carrying bags, run toward   the medical copter. An Aide comes
in, and gestures to Miller   that the copter is ready to go.

                         AIDE
            ...sir...

Miller turns to leave. Scott stands wearily.

                      MILLER
            Where are you going.

                      SCOTT
            On the dustoff.

                                                             73.


                         MILLER
            Forget it.

                      SCOTT
            Sir...? Sir...?

                      MILLER
            There's no room.

                      SCOTT
            I'm pleading with you, sir...

                      MILLER
            Let him hear the assault on the
            Net...

                      SCOTT
            I want to see the girl.

Miller shakes his head - at the door, turns back for one
last word to Scott. And then he stops.

ANGLE. HIS POV. The television, in the next room, playing a
news program. Scott looks inquiringly at Miller, who is
transfixed by the television.

ANGLE the television. A "Breaking News" story. We see an
overturned sailboat, and the talking head narrating: "...the
tragic, the stunning...the...Jim, I don't know what to
say..." The woman's co-anchor, obviously very shaken, takes
up the story, and we see live footage of an overturned
sailboat being towed into a harbor, then inserts of "Our
Redhead" Laura Newton, and, after a moment, the Professor.

                      JIM (TALKING HEAD NEWSCASTER)
            The death, just reported, the
            death of Laura Newton. The... the...

ANGLE, on the TV. On two bodies being taken from the water
by medical technicians.

ANGLE, the woman, as a shot of the political man we saw
earlier in the newspaper, comes on the screen.

                      TALKING HEAD WOMAN
            ...her father, on the eve of the
            campaign...
                 (we switch to a video
                 shot of this man,
                 waving off reporters)
            Jim, can there be any doubt...

                                                            74.


                      JIM
            Tracey, the Secret Service, for
            obvious reasons, their records,
            the DNA, fingerprints... the...
            and, she had just been in the
            water a scant, less than four
            hours, the...apparently the boat
            swamped... she -

                      TRACEY
            She was sailing with...?

                      JIM
            With her professor, Professor...?
                 (the video shows the Professor)


ANGLE, on Tracey, as she is overcome, and tries to steady
herself.

ANGLE, on Miller, and the Troopers in the room. Miller looks
away from the screen, to Scott.

                      TRACEY
            ...a Tragedy, such as this.

                      JIM
            ...particularly. Particularly,
            Tracey, coming, right at the
            start of his Campaign...

An insert of Laura's father, his sportcoat slung over his
shoulder, comes onto the screen.

                      TRACEY
            Will he delay the start of the
            Campaign?

ANGLE. On Scott. As he is found, standing, near the
television. Off to the side, behind him, we see Miller,
intently, on the phone, listening.

                      JIM
            ...his grief...

                      TRACEY
            ...he was very close to his
            daughter, wasn't he?

                                                            75.


                      JIM
            Well, indeed, he saw her, the
            day...that would be, the day
            before last. He was in Boston
            for the Strategy Meeting, and
            saw her then...

                      TRACEY
                 (sadly)
            ...and that would be the Last
            time...that...

ANGLE. On Scott. As he is looking at the television, he
shakes his head minutely, as if in a dialogue with himself.
He walks back to the interrogation room.

Scott sits heavily. Miller walks in and sits next to him.

                      MILLER
            Her boyfriend called her a slut.
            She went off to prove it. Her
            and the Professor. Coked up,
            boat capsized...Both bodies
            washed up naked. Coast Guard
            dressed 'em up...full of Ecstasy...

                      SCOTT
            ...he killed her...

                      MILLER
                 (shrugs, meaning "who knows")
            He was fucking her, they're
            stoned...the boat capsized...

Miller looks down at the artifacts.

                      MILLER
                 (almost to himself)
            ...so much death.

                      SCOTT
                 (philosophically, as
                 if summing the whole
                 thing up)
            ...rock crushes scissors...

We see Miller leave, as Scott turns away, and lights a
cigarette. Miller turns back.

                      MILLER
            I'm sorry about your man.

                                                           76.


                      SCOTT
            He isn't my man, Sir. He's a
            trainee.

Beat. Miller leaves the room. Scott hangs his head with
weariness.

INT. GOVERNMENT TRANSPORT PLANE. NIGHT.

Anton, in bandages, in a bunk in the transport plane. Scott,
asleep, in a chair near him.

ANGLE on Anton, as he comes awake.

                      ANTON
            ...what time is it?

                      SCOTT
            What do you care...?
                 (pause. We see that
                 Anton is having
                 difficulty formulating
                 his thoughts)


                      ANTON
            I fucked up.

                      SCOTT
            ...in what way was that?

                      ANTON
                 (groggily, as he tries
                 to move, to draw closer
                 to Scott)
            ...but I was trying to help.
                 (Scott reacts to
                 Anton's pain.)


                      SCOTT
            What? Do you want some more Dope?
            Whaddaya want, a Dr. Pepper...?

Scott takes a pill vial from Anton's jacket. Takes out a
pill, and administers it to him.

                      ANTON
            ...but I was trying to help.

                                                77.


                      SCOTT
            ...yeah, well, that's when people
            generally do fuck up. Wait for
            that to kick in.
                 (Anton starts to lay
                 back, and then, as if
                 he is remembering
                 something, he draws
                 closer to Scott again.)
            You're gonna take that fight to
            bed for a while. You don't got
            to do it all now.

Anton gestures Scott to draw close.

                      ANTON
                 (sotto)
            I saw the sign.

ANGLE XCU on Scott as he turns away.

                      SCOTT
            ...uh huh...

Scott turns away.

                       ANTON
                 (drawing him back, as
                 if saying LISTEN:)
            I saw the sign...at the Cape. In
            the House.

                      SCOTT
            You saw-the-sign. What sign?

                      ANTON
            ...when I dropped the guy. The
            girl's Picasso sign...
                 (he draws the sign in
                 the condensation on
                 the plane's window)
            She was there. At the Cape. The
            girl was there.

                      SCOTT
            The girl wasn't there. She was
            on a boat. She fell off the boat.
            She's dead.
                 (pause)
            You did what you could. You did
            what you were trained to do.
                 (pause)
            You did what you could.

                                                             78.


                      ANTON
            ...I saw the sign...

                      SCOTT
                 (turning away)
            ...then you are Truly Blessed.

INT. TRAINING FACILITY. DAY.

We see the Dojo, training room. Several exhausted young men
in sweat stained fatigues watch a lecturer, with a knife in
his hand, demonstrating a manoeuvre with a trainee.

Beyond, on the wall, we see the sign. "These are the
precincts of pain. A Godess lives here. Her name is Victory."

Beyond, through the open doors, we see Scott's Mustang
driven up to a nearby building. A young man gets out.

ANGLE, INT. THE BUILDING. Scott, rested, clean, shaved,
drinking a cup of coffee. Sitting across a desk from an
Interrogator, who has several notes in front of him.

                      INTERROGATOR
            ...from the house, a house, a
            holding facility, a compound?
            called Maskala. The girls are
            taken from Maskala, to the
            ...Royale Hotel, in Dubai.
                 (he closes the notes,
                 as if completing his presentation)
            As time passes, you may remember
            other aspects of...well,
                 (the Interrogator stands)
            You've heard this speech before...

He extends his hand to Scott. Scott looks inquisitively at
him, then pauses, then stands.

ANGLE EXT. THIS BUILDING. Scott exiting, as Blane comes out
of his office. They walk through the compound. And to the
camera, toward the Mustang.

                      SCOTT
            ...would be most grateful, sir,
            to be included on the mission.
            "At Such Time..."
                 (pause)


                      BLANE
            ...on a mission to Dubai.

                                                             79.


                      SCOTT
            Is it in contemplation, sir...?
                 (pause)


ANGLE, on Blane, who looks at him to say "you know better
than to ask."

                      SCOTT
            Yes, sir.
                 (pause)
            If and When, Sir...

                      BLANE
            You need a rest, Bobby.
                 (pause. as he extends
                 his hand)
            Thank you, Bobby...

Scott puts down the small yellow duffle he carries, next to
his Mustang. The young man who drove it in stands by, as
Blane and Scott shake hands. Scott looks at the training
facility.

ANGLE HIS POV. The lecturer, executing unarmed combat moves
against a trainee, who holds a knife. The lecturer puts the
trainee on his back.

Scott starts to walk toward this facility. He stands outside,
by an open double-door, next to a water cooler, and draws
himself a cup of water, which he drinks. As he watches the
lesson.

He turns back, as he sees the young man who drove in the
Mustang pick up the yellow duffle, to put it into the car.

                      SCOTT
            ...please don't touch that.
                 (Scott picks up the
                 duffle and puts the
                 strap over his shoulder)


ANGLE, Scott's POV, as he turns. We see the young female
sergeant, Jackie Black, in the BG, walking across the area.

Scott nods at her. She nods back. Scott starts to get into
his car, and then turns back.

ANGLE. SCOTT'S POV as the trainee on the mat gets up, and
the lecturer gestures at the knife he has dropped on the mat.

                      LECTURER
            ...pick it up.

                                                          80.


The trainee picks up the knife. The lecturer shakes his head.

                      LECTURER
            What are you studying here...?
            I'm talking to you, son... What
            are you studying?

                      TRAINEE
            Sir, this Candidate is studying
            knife fighting.

The lecturer pauses, looking down at the ground. Beat.

                      LECTURER
            Hold your ground, son.

The Trainee goes into a knife fighting stance.

                      LECTURER
                 (pointing behind him)
            ...you, and your friend...

The Trainee lets his attention drift for a second, in the
direction the Lecturer has pointed. And the Lecturer screams,
steps in, disarms the Trainee, throwing him to the mat. As
the Trainee picks himself up the Lecturer turns to the class.

                      LECTURER
            There are two ways to fight, you
            can fight fair, or you can fight
            to win.

The Trainee puts his hand to his head, and discovers he is
bleeding. The Lecturer nods his permission, and the Trainee
walks to a water cooler, next to which Scott is standing.
Scott looks at the shamed Trainee.

                      SCOTT
            Don't you study knife fighting,
            son. You Learn to Kill. And then,
            f'you meet some other fellow,
            studied knife fighting, you send
            him to hell.

ANGLE, on the Lecturer, who calls another Trainee up.

                        LECTURER
            Next man:

A Trainee stands.

                      LECTURER
            Now: I want to see some evil intent.

                                                            81.


The Lecturer glances at Scott, and makes a small "have a
drink" gesture. The Lecturer nods back "yes". Scott walks
toward his car.

EXT. "CONSTRUCTION GATE". DAY.

The man inside the "construction booth" raises the barrier,
and looks at Scott, who drives through.

INT. ROADSIDE TRUCKERS BAR. NIGHT.

The Lecturer (Grace) and Scott, in a booth drinking.

Pause.

                      GRACE
            Hey, fuck it, Huh...?

                      SCOTT
            I've always thought so.

Scott gestures for another round to the bartender. Who is
serving some rough trucker types, two of whom are at the bar
with a couple of very attractive young women. One is a
stunning redhead, who looks back at Scott.

                      GRACE
            How'd the puppy like it out there?
            He piss in the punchbowl?

                      SCOTT
            He did okay.

                      GRACE
            I heard he caught poison ivy.

                      SCOTT
            He did okay. Why? You goin' out?

                      GRACE
            What?

                      SCOTT
            You recruiting?

                      GRACE
            Why would I be recruiting?

                      SCOTT
            You speak Arabic, huh...?

                      GRACE
            That's what the Arabs tell me.

                                                          82.


                      SCOTT
            You, reason I ask: you going in
            the Sandbox...?

                      GRACE
            Ain't you overdue for some Down
            Time?

                      SCOTT
            I'm just saying:

Scott is distracted. He is watching the talking heads, on
the bar TV talking about Laura Newton. We see the photos of
her in high school, with her father in some African country,
et cetera.

ANGLE. On Grace, watching Scott. Who shakes his head very sadly.

                      GRACE
            Yeah. You Marines are a weepy
            bunch of motherfuckers.
                 (Scott nods minutely
                 in acknowledgement.
                 And returns to watching
                 the television)
            ...you get a chance to bowl in
            that tournament...?

ANGLE on Scott. Caught in the image of Laura Newton, on the
television.

                      SCOTT
                 (to himself)
            ...beautiful girl...

ANGLE on the truckers, near the television, looking at Scott.
One comes over to him.

                      TRUCKER
            ...you say something, Mister...?

                      SCOTT
            No, I was looking at the
            television.
                 (pause)
            I was talking to the television.
                 (he turns to look at
                 the girl)
            That girl's too good-looking for
            you anyway. What are you "rich"?
            What do you, "own" something?
                      (MORE)

                                                           83.


                      SCOTT (CONT'D)
                 (pause)
            Or are you "funny" or
            something...?
                 (pause. Hold for a
                 beat, on the confused
                 face of the Trucker)
            Siddown. Lemme buy you a drink.

INT. SLEAZY MOTEL ROOM. DAWN.

A sound of a truck, coming down the highway.

ANGLE, on the doorknob of the hotel room. We see several
quarters stacked. As the truck sound comes closer, the
quarters start to rumble, and fall off the doorknob.

ANGLE, on the floor, a glass ashtray. The quarters fall into
the ashtray.

ANGLE, Scott, in bed, naked, comes awake, as the quarters
hit the ashtray. He has a pistol in hand, and awakes with a
start, screaming. He surveys the motel room, taking in his
new surroundings. Beat. Next to him, the redhead from the
bar, also naked, comes awake, frightened, looking at Scott.

ANGLE, on Scott, as he surveys the hotel room.

ANGLE HIS POV. On a dresser, a cheap imitation pewter bowl,
an orange and a banana in it, on the table next to it, his
switchblade, open, and the remains of a peeled apple. He
looks at the knife, and at the girl.

                      SCOTT
            You peel the apple?

She nods, not sure how to take Scott.

                      SCOTT
                 (as he starts to come
                 down from the
                 adrenaline rush)
            ...well. You should wipe off the
            blade.
                      (MORE)

                                                            84.


                         SCOTT (CONT'D)
                   (pause. Scott does so,
                   cleaning the blade on
                   a napkin)
            Or   else...
                   (as if explaining the
                   simplest and most
                   perfect axiom of the universe)
            Or   else, it "rusts"...
                   (a pause. He smiles at
                   her. Pause)
            D'I   scare you...?
                   (he closes the blade
                   and sits on the bed,
                   shaking his head to
                   clear it)
            I'm   sorry if I frightened you.
                   (pause)


EXT. SMALL TOWN RURAL MAIN STREET. DAY.

A three-store town, a couple of pick-up trucks parked in
front of the country store. A large double log truck goes
through the town. The girl looks for some topic of
conversation, to bridge the awkward moment.

                      GIRL
            ...it's an odd knife.

                      SCOTT
            Yeah. I got it from a Russian
            fellow.

                      GIRL
            Was it a gift...?

                      SCOTT
            No. As I remember, he seemed
            rather reluctant to part with it.
                 (pause)
            It's just a knife.

EXT. SMALL RURAL VILLAGE. MAIN STREET. DAY.

A three store town. A couple of pickup trucks parked in
front of the country store. Scott's Mustang parked next to
them. A large, filled, double-length log truck speeds
through the village. Scott, in his lumber jacket, is
assembling various maintenance items on the checkout counter.
A large paintbrush, several boxes of nails, a gallon of
paint. The Proprietor, a good-natured fellow in his fifties,
comes up to the counter to check Scott out.

                                                             85.


                      PROPRIETOR
            How you been, John...?

                      SCOTT
            ...workin hard...

                      PROPRIETOR
            ...bet you have...

                      SCOTT
            How you, Billy...?

Proprietor pours Scott a cup of coffee from the pot on the
back counter. He mixes in sugar and cream. Billy nods in
response to Scott's question.

                      PROPRIETOR
            ...one gallon goin to do it...?

                      SCOTT
                 (pointing at him accusingly)
            ...you been lookin' at my house...?

                      PROPRIETOR
            Nope, just trine a sell you some
            paint...
                 (as he puts the cup
                 down in front of Scott.
                 Joking)
            ...but, now you mention it...

ANGLE, On Billy, as he moves to a new customer, a farmer,
who comes in, and nods at Scott.

                         NEW FARMER
            ...John...

                      SCOTT
            Mr. Reese, how are you...?
                 (Billy goes to take
                 care of the new
                 customer, and turns
                 back to deal with Scott,
                 who is waiting to ask
                 a question)
            That new saw blade come in?

                      BILLY
                 (as if just remembering)
            No, John. It did not. I beg your
            pardon. I know that's your
            baby...I'm gone call them up and
            get Right On That.

                                                             86.


ANGLE on Scott, who sees something out the window, and moves
toward the front of the store.

                      BILLY
                 (as an afterthought)
            ...'spected you back a few days
            ago...

                      SCOTT
                 (looking out the window,
                 absently)
            I took the Long Way Home.

ANGLE Scott, who is looking, over his coffee, at something
on the street. And we see, his POV, a very city rent-a-car
which is now across the street. We see a man getting out of
the car.

EXT. GAS STATION. COUNTRY VILLAGE. DAY.

We see the back of a man, next to the rental car, which is
next to the Mustang. He turns, and we see that it is Anton,
his arm in a slig, his face creased by pellet scars.

ANGLE, his POV. Looking at Scott, who has just snuck up
behind him.

                       SCOTT
            Could I see your Right Hand,
            please...?

                      ANTON
            There's nothing in my right hand.

                      SCOTT
            Could I see it, please...?

Anton holds up his right hand. Scott relaxes, and comes
forward. Anton gestures, meaning, "what was that about"?
Scott takes Anton's right hand, by the wrist, and turns it
over. He explains:

                      SCOTT
            You put your wedding ring back on.

                       ANTON
                 (not understanding the
                 import of the question)
            ...yes...?

                                                             87.


                      SCOTT
            Then I have to guess you're not
            "on assignment".
                 (pause)
            You're in the wrong place, baby.
                 (pause)
            How did you find me...?

Anton gestures at the "Oilchange" sticker on the Mustang's
windshield.

ANGLE from INT. The Car. We see the sticker reading "Mike's
Service Station, Bradford, PA". And beyond it, the actual
old, tin sign of the garage, reading "Mike's Service Station".

ANGLE, on Scott and Anton.

                      SCOTT
            Well, I guess I'm not as smart
            as I thought I was.
                 (pause)


                      ANTON
            I need to talk to you.

A beat. Scott shakes his head, as if in a sad comment to
himself. He sighs.

EXT. RURAL STREET. DAY.

Anton and Scott walking down the street.

                      ANTON
            I saw the sign.

                      SCOTT
            "You saw the sign". You were up
            for a week, you coulda seen Jack
            Ruby, you don't know what you
            saw...your first-time-out.

                      ANTON
            I saw the sign.

                      SCOTT
            ...then, you tell me: you saw
            the sign, how is it, they found
            the girl, the DNA...why would
            they do that...? Her father? Her
            father would do that to her?

                      ANTON
            ...maybe he doesn't know...

                                                   88.


                      SCOTT
            Well. You're living in a
            fairyland of your Own Devising.
            You're seeing snakes.
                 (pause)


                      ANTON
            Who's going to Dubai...?
                 (pause. Scott hesitates)
            They've got a white slave ring,
            in Dubai, with American girls
            there - are they going in?
                 (pause)
            Are they sending you in...?
                 (pause)
            Ask them...
                 (pause)


                      SCOTT
            You Got. To Leave it for your
            Betters.

                        ANTON
            Ask them.

                      SCOTT
            Why would you want to know?
                 (pause)
            Listen up, Pal. THEY don't go
            through the door. WE don't ask
            why. That's not a COST, it's a
            Benefit. Because we Got to Travel
            Light. You wanna lose sleep over
            it, get over it, or get out.
                 (hold. pause)
            You wanted to go Through the
            Looking Glass. How was it? Was
            it more fun than Miniature Golf...?

                      ANTON
            I want a favor.

                      SCOTT
            Why would I do you a favor?

Two old ladies come down the small main street.

                      OLD LADY
            Morning, John, who's your friend...?

                      SCOTT
            Fella wants to buy my car.

                                                 89.


The old ladies walk on. Pause.

                      ANTON
            I saved your life.

                      SCOTT
            Well what were they paying you
            for...?

                      ANTON
            Bobby, I saw the Sign...

                      SCOTT
            My name ain't Bobby.
                 (pause)


                      ANTON
            I saw the sign.
                 (he draws the Picasso
                 sign in the dust on
                 the window of the
                 country store)
            I Saw it. At the beach house.
                 (pause)
            I'm going back.

                      SCOTT
            Back?

                      ANTON
            To the beach house.

                      SCOTT
            They took it apart with a
            tweezers.
                 (Anton shakes his head)


                      ANTON
            She was there. The Girl was There.
            I'm going back.
                 (pause)
            I want you to do something.

                      SCOTT
            What would that be?

                      ANTON
            The Secret Service Agent. Offed
            himself.

                      SCOTT
            ...he was off boffing his girl.

                                                          90.


                      ANTON
            He shot himself with a hide-out
            pistol.

                        SCOTT
            Yeah?

                      ANTON
            Who frisked the sonofabitch?
                 (pause)
            You ask them.

ANGLE, on Scott, obviously off-balanced by the question. Hold.

INT. GOVERNMENT OFFICE BUILDING. DAY.

Stoddard, smoking a black cigar, and several "Bureau" types
in the office. Scott is sitting at a conference table, as is
Miller. Beat.

                      STODDARD
            Number one, the girl's dead.
            Number two, the hide-out gun the
            Agent shot with's registered in
            his 1020 for the past five years.
            The man who tossed him has been
            sacked. His name is none of your
            concern. Now: what the fuck are
            you doing here?

                      SCOTT
            Sir, I am not here to question...

                      STODDARD
            Well, then, what the fuck are
            you doing here...?

                      MILLER
            Sir, as he said, he is here to
            apprise you of a security leak...

                        SCOTT
            ...and...

Miller gestures to him to shut up.

                      MILLER
            To call your attention to what
            may be a problem in discipline
            with this...

                                                             91.


                      STODDARD
            Granted. Granted.
                 (he stands)
            Granted. Fine. Thank you.

                      SCOTT
            And. Sir...If I may...

                      STODDARD
            What is it?

                      SCOTT
            When the operation is staged in
            Dubai...

                      STODDARD
            What is this...?

                      MILLER
            He...

                      STODDARD
            ...what the fuck are you talking
            about?

                      SCOTT
            I am merely saying, when -

                      STODDARD
            Forget it. Walk away.

                      SCOTT
            I...

                      STODDARD
            Yeah...you're a pit bull. I said
            forget it. How do we contact Anton?

                      MILLER
            ...Anton...

                      STODDARD
            Your partner...He's gone to
            ground...

Scott shrugs, as if to say, "Is that the way you want it?"

                      MILLER
            Yes, sir...

                                                             92.


                      STODDARD
            And, wait, wait, wait, wait,
            what does this mean...?
                 (of Scott)
            When and if, any operation is
            staged which may require your
            talents, I give you my word...
                 (Scott shakes his head,
                 saying "I don't believe
                 a word of it")
            You impertinent motherfucker.
            What the fuck is with you, you've
            got on your "thinkingcap" all of
            a sudden...?

Stoddard gestures to an aide to call a number.

                      SCOTT
            I'd like to finish what I started.

                      STODDARD
            And I'm telling you to Stand
            Down. Where's the kid?
                 (pause)


                      SCOTT
            Is there no operation in Dubai...?

Stoddard shakes his head in exasperation.

The Aide hands Stoddard the phone. Stoddard answers. Listens
for a moment, and then points at Scott.

EXT. GRAVESIDE. DAY.

A small photograph on an easel - it is an image of Gaines,
the dead Secret Serviceman.

ANGLE, a small funeral. A Marine Honor Guard in attendance.
Small suburban cemetery.

ANGLE on the Pastor.

                      PASTOR
            ...in the Service. In the Service
            of his Country. No less than had
            he died in Combat. George Gaines,
            a man who gave his life to
            service, to protecting those who...

ANGLE, an unmarked sedan. Scott, and a Driver. Looking on.

                                                            93.


                      DRIVER
            ...sucker did the Dutch.

                      SCOTT
            I heard it was a training accident.

                      DRIVER
            Nope, he Ate the Gun. Didn't you
            know?

                      SCOTT
            I've been out of town.

                      DRIVER
            Punched out early, off with the
            girlfriend, his Principal wanders
            off, winds up dead: hari-kari...

ANGLE, on Scott, as he sees something. Scott takes a book of
matches and starts to light a cigarette.

                      DRIVER
            ...rather you didn't smoke in here.

Scott gets out of the car.

ANGLE, on Scott, who takes out the Anton "Rogers Rangers"
card. He motions the driver to pass him a phone and Scott
looks at the number on the card and dials.

Beyond him we see, just at the limits of the gravesite.
Holding himself apart. A young man in a raincoat. The young
man turns at the sound of a limo driving up.

ANGLE Scott, looking at the limo. Out of the limo, which
stops near the grave, we see Burch emerge. There is a
susurrus among the crowd, which, visibly, straightens a bit,
at the honor of Burch's presence. We see Burch walk to the
gravesite, and have a word with the widow. Burch puts his
hands on her shoulders and comforts her.

ANGLE, on Scott, looking at the man in the raincoat. We hear
rifle fire, and Scott flinches.

ANGLE his POV. The Marine Honor Guard, rendering a salute.
We see a Marine bear the flag to Burch, who presents it to
the widow. He shakes several hands, and then moves off, back
to the limousine. He beckons Scott over to him.

ANGLE, Scott and Burch, walking through the cemetery. Burch
shakes his head. He hands Scott the program from the funeral,
and reluctantly begins.

                                                94.


                      BURCH
            I put myself in your hands.
            Didn't I...?

                      SCOTT
            I do not follow you, sir.

                      BURCH
            I reached out to you.
                 (pause)
            I put my life into your hands. I
            entered into a conspiracy with
            you. To commit Murder. Because
            it needed to be done.
                 (pause)
            I trusted you with my life.

                      SCOTT
            I would never betray you, sir.

                      BURCH
                 (waving his assurances away)
            I trusted you with my life. And
            yet you cannot trust me.
                 (pause)
            There are things you have not
            been told. That's right.
                 (pause)
            And now you're all out-of-line,
            "Play me or trade me..."
                 (pause)


ANGLE, on the two.

                      BURCH
                 (almost as if against
                 his better nature)
            There is an Arab World. To
            penetrate it makes trying to
            join the Mafia look like a walk
            in the park. How would you do it,
            Scott?
                 (pause)
            We're dying. We're at war. And
            we have no intelligence. How
            Would you do it? How would you
            infiltrate their clan structure?
            Where is the interface?
                 (pause)
            It's at the whorehouse. That's
            where they go to get frisky, and
            that's where we listen to them.
                      (MORE)

                                                          95.


                      BURCH (CONT'D)
            For the few, priceless hints
            that we get from that fucking
            sandpile.
                 (pause)
            Had the girl been there, we would
            have moved heaven and earth -
            you know we would, and, we would
            have got her out. She was not
            there. She got drugged up and
            fell off a boat, and drowned.
            She's dead.
                 (of the funeral)
            That man,
                 (Burch gestures at the
                 photograph-on-the-
                 easel, of George Gaines,
                 the Secret Service man,
                 which stands by the
                 head of the grave)
            That man a sworn office of the
            Secret Service, went to get laid,
            and she died. And you are risking
            the lives of men and women in
            the field, because you won't
            take orders. How are you better
            than him? Yes. You had best look
            sheepish. What the fuck have you
            got to say?

                      SCOTT
            No excuse, sir.

                      BURCH
            You're goddam right.
                 (pause)
            Now: where's this new kid who
            got you all bothered. Where's
            your partner?

                      SCOTT
            ...I'll call him off.

                      BURCH
            The fuck you will. You've got
            nothing to say to him. He's gone
            to the ground. Where is he...?

ANGLE. Over the Honor Guard, packing up, we see Scott hand a
scrap of paper to Burch, who makes one or two more points,
to which Scott nods, submissively. Burch walks off. Camera
follows the Honor Guard, down the path, toward Scott, who,
passing, nods at them.

                                                             96.


HOLD on Scott. As he watches the widow, at the gravesite,
being walked away to a limo by the pastor. He feels someone
behind him and turns.

ANGLE, SCOTT'S POV. A man in a raincoat, standing furtively,
half-hidden by a tree, some distance off from the funeral,
weeping. He holds a program for the funeral.

ANGLE on the man in the raincoat, the funeral beyond him. He
is obviously distraught, a rather slight young man in his
thirties. He looks at Scott for a moment, and then turns away.

ANGLE. On Scott. As he turns back to watching the end of the
funeral. As the gravediggers begin their work. He sighs. And
moves to a bench and sits. Looking at the gravediggers.

DISSOLVE.

EXT. DUSK. GRAVEYARD.

Scott, still sitting on the bench. The gravediggers,
finishing their work, begin to walk off, joking with one
another. Scott stands, and turns, about to start out of the
cemetery. He stops for a moment.

ANGLE, HIS POV. The man in the raincoat, who is standing
where last seen, looking at the burial. Walks toward the
mound of earth, pauses for a moment, and then walks off.

EXT. BUS STOP. DESERTED, SEMI-INDUSTRIAL AREA, ACROSS FROM
THE CEMETERY. DAY.

The raincoat man is standing waiting for a bus, at the bus
stop, outside a working man's tavern.

ANGLE, on Scott, looking at the man, still weeping. Scott
walks up to the man. Each holds a copy of the program from
the funeral. The man looks down at the program, and then up
to Scott.

                      SCOTT
                 (beat)
            Terrible thing.
                 (the man nods)
            Did you know him?

The man nods. Beat. He turns back to Scott, looking for
sympathy. Anguished.

                      MAN
            Did you know him...?
                 (Scott nods. Pause. Portentiously:)
            Where did you know him from?

                                                             97.


                      SCOTT
                 (pause)
            ...you know.

                      MAN
                 (pause. Nods)
            He wasn't in the accounting
            office. You knew that...

                      SCOTT
            Yes. I Did.

The man begins weeping heavily. Scott puts his arm around him.

                      MAN
            I didn't think, he told anyone
            what he did. Because...because...
                 (he looks for sympathy)
            I...

                      SCOTT
            A few of us knew.
                 (pause)


The man takes out a small photo in a leather case - we see
it is a smiling photo of the Secret Service Agent, Gaines.

                      MAN
            And all he cared    about was doing
            his duty...that's    all...that's
            all... He used to    tell me...
                 (the man is    now overcome)


                      SCOTT
            I'm so sorry.

                      MAN
            He was supposed to see me that
            night...After his
            "shift"...We...His wife...

Scott nods his understanding.

                      SCOTT
            Did she know? His wife. Did she
            know?

                      MAN
            How could she? How could
            she...she didn't know him...
                 (pause)
            Oh, the poor children...

                                                          98.


The man begins shaking, and Scott embraces him to comfort him.

ANGLE, INT. THE WORKING MAN'S BAR. DAY.

Scott and the man, at the end of the bar. A few construction
types enter. As Scott bends his head next to the man,
speaking low.

                      MAN
            ...he was going to come to me
            that night...after...

                      SCOTT
            ...after his shift.

                      MAN
            ...his shift - yes...

ANGLE, on a Burly Man, in construction clothes, who is
standing next to them.

                      BURLY MAN
            ...excuse me...

                      MAN
            ...after, after he'd finished
            driving him...

                         SCOTT
            ...him...?

                      BURLY MAN
                 (as he puts a hand on Scott)
            I said...

                      SCOTT
                 (as he turns to the
                 man, who is backing
                 his way out of the bar)
            ...driving him..? Did you say
            "him"?
                 (he reaches out to the
                 effeminate man)


                      BURLY MAN
            Yeah. It's a man's world, pal -
            but you're in the wrong bar.

He turns Scott around, and pushes Scott deeper into the room,
away from the other man, who is now going out of the door.
Scott moves toward him and the Burly Man tries to stop him.

                                                             99.


Scott strikes him several times, and starts toward the door,
where, as he exits the bar, he sees the effeminate man, on
the bus, and pulling away.

Scott starts to move toward the bus. There is a hand on his
shoulder, and a second man from the bar is whirling Scott to
face him. Scott shakes him off and starts after the bus. The
second man restrains him.

                      SECOND MAN
            ...what the fuck did you do to
            my friend...?

In the B.G. We see the first man rise from the sidewalk, and
move toward Scott. Scott struggles to follow the bus, when
the second man assaults him. Scott is now fighting the two
men, who manoeuvre him toward an alley.

As Scott's back is to the alley we see a Third Man emerge
from the shadows, and throw a garrotte around Scott's neck.

Scott headbutts this man, who hauls Scott off his feet.
Scott belts him again, and stomps on his instep. And turns
into him. He elbows this man as the other two men advance
toward him, in the alleyway. The garrotte man falls.

Scott kicks the garrotte man in the temple. And draws his
pistol. Beat.

The men in the mouth of the alleyway retreat.

ANGLE. On the street. We see them get into a van which has
just pulled up.

ANGLE on Scott. Standing. Shivering. As he looks around the
alleyway. He moves back to the fallen garrotte man.

ANGLE. Scott standing over the man. He sees something and
bends down.

ANGLE HIS POV. In the man's backpocket is a program from the
funeral.

ANGLE, Scott standing, looking at the program. We hear the
phone ringing. Scott puts the phone to his ear.

                      SCOTT
            ...where are you...? No. Tell me
            later. Look: LOOK: Forget the
            boat house. Look:
                 (pause)
            Yes, tell me in...tel...look:
            tell me when...GET OUT OF THERE.
                      (MORE)

                                                            100.


                      SCOTT (CONT'D)
            GET OUT OF THERE RIGHT NOW. TELL
            ME WHEN YOU SEE ME. MEET ME
            "WHERE...WHERE THE GUY MADE THE
            PHONECALL" - ONE HALF-HOUR...

Scott stops speaking, and looks down at something.

ANGLE, his POV. Across the street. We see an unmarked sedan
pull up and two men get out of the car. And begin to look
around. One sees Scott, and motions to the other one, and
they both start in his direction. They stop, for a moment,
as if confused.

ANGLE, their POV. The street corner, empty of Scott.

EXT. BOSTON STREET. DAY.

Copley Square. Scott. Coming into the square.

ANGLE, the open-air phone stanchion we saw in the earlier
sequence. It is festooned, as before, with ads for escort
services and phone sex.

ANGLE, on Scott, getting, hurriedly, out of a taxi cab, on
the outskirts of the square.

ANGLE, his POV, scanning the square for Anton. Scott looks
at his watch, and he looks up.

ANGLE HIS POV. The figure of Anton, walking from the far
side of the square, toward the phone booth.

ANGLE, on Anton, as he looks around him, and then proceeds
toward the phone booth.

As Scott watches, a van pulls into the plaza, and heads
toward Anton. Anton sees the van, and retreats, toward the
streetside, where we see, the van has herded him toward
another car. Three men get out of the car, one slugs Anton,
and he is whisked into the car, and the car pulls away.

ANGLE, on Scott, on the far side of the square, looking on,
aghast.

ANGLE Anton, in the backseat of the car, pointing back, as
the car disappears.

ANGLE. CU. Scott, looking at Anton's gesture, and following,
looking in the direction in which he was pointing.

ANGLE Scott's POV. The telephone kiosk. Scott walks into his
POV, to the kiosk. He looks down at the pile of trash on the
shelf.

                                                         101.


He looks up at the various pornographic ads pasted around
the interior. He sees that, stuck in one of them is the
"Rogers Rangers" card, which Anton showed him earlier. He
pulls it out of the ad to which it is stuck. He looks down
at it inquisitively. We read in an insert: "Rule #11: Don't
ever march home the same way.

Take a different route, so you won't be ambushed." He then
sees that there is something else behind the ad. He tears
the ad off the kiosk partition, and he is rewarded, as a
folded envelope falls out from behind the ad. He picks up
the envelope. We see that it is the old yellowed envelope
from the beach house. It is printed "Hanson Marine -
Everything For The Boat", and we see, on it, the drawing of
the old power boat. We see Scott feel the envelope, shake it,
tear off the end, and pour something out into his hand. We
see his face, and then pan down to see the object in the
envelope was the red crescent earring seen in all photographs
of Laura Newton.

EXT. BOATHOUSE, ESSEX. DUSK.

A wind is blowing from the sea. Scott turns up the collar of
his jacket. We see the house in the BG and Scott, walking
along the patio, the sea beyond him. We see him stop and
kneel, to the piling, from which he took the matchbook. He
sifts through the sand and gravel at the foot of the piling.
The wind blows up the dust, and Scott stands, it is evident
he has got a speck in his eye, and he tries to extract it,
blinking, and squinting. He turns his head.

ANGLE, HIS POV. Beyond the property line. Beyond the hedges
and on what is obviously the next lot, an old, ramshackle
dwelling, the small white toolshed.

ANGLE, Scott, looking at the toolshed, and gauging its
proximity to the Essex House. He begins to walk toward it.

ANGLE. Scott. At the small white toolshed. He stoops, and we
see he has picked up the shell, ejected by Anton's rifle. He
stands, he takes out a small spotter's scope.

ANGLE. HIS POV. His shoulder, rubbing against the pollen-
covered window in the small white shed, has uncovered a bit
of a sign.

ANGLE. Scott, looking at the sign in the window. He rubs the
pollen off, and we see emerge, on the inside of the window,
drawn in the dust, the Picasso sign %-).

ANGLE XCU Scott.

                      SCOTT
            ...ohmigod...

                                                            102.


INT. SLEAZY HOTEL ROOM. NIGHT

Scott, wearing just skivvies, is asleep on the bed, an empty
pint bottle of booze on the night stand. We hear the
television on low, showing talking heads narrating the
funeral of Laura Newton.

"Our Redhead, America's Sweetheart", et cetera. We see a
photo of her in her signature red crescent earrings. Next to
Scott, on the night table, the envelope, holding the same
red crescent earring.

ANGLE, the line of light under the door to the hallway is
occupied by a pair of feet.

ANGLE. A hand, dangling off the bed toward the floor. Below
it, on the floor, the creased 'Rogers Rangers' card, and
several days worth of newspapers.

ANGLE XCU Scott, on the bed. Unshaven. We see his eyes come
open.

ANGLE on Scott's hand, as it snakes quietly past the Rangers
card, on which we read: "Rule #15: Don't sleep past dawn -
Dawn's when the French and Indians attack", and comes up
with an automatic pistol.

ANGLE the door, as we see the door handle move slightly.

ANGLE on Scott, as he jerks open the door, his pistol at his
side.

ANGLE HIS POV. In the doorway beyond, we see a Bellboy,
holding a small paper bag, looking shocked.

Scott shoves the Bellboy back away from the door, and
glances, both ways, down the hall.

                      SCOTT
            What the hell are you doing?

                      BELLBOY
                 (showing the package)
            I...I brought you...

                      SCOTT
            Why're you screwing with the
            door...?

                       BELLBOY
            I...I...

Scott drags him into the room.

                                                         103.


                      SCOTT
            Why're you screwing with the
            door...?

Scott frisks him roughly. The terrified Bellboy shows a "Do
Not Disturb" sign, which he holds.

                      BELLBOY
            I took the...I took the sign
            off...
                 (pause)
            You had the sign on the door.
            F'they saw me...f'they saw me,
            knocking on a door, the sign
            on...they'd...
                 (Scott relaxes somewhat.
                 The Bellboy proffers
                 the package)
            An, I...I figured, you needed...
                 (he hands the package
                 to Scott, who takes
                 out a pint bottle of booze)
            You told me you wanted this at
            Ten...

                      SCOTT
            ...yeah. Thanks.

                      BELLBOY
                 (begins to calm down a bit)
            ...I don't know why you...

                      SCOTT
            You're right, I'm wrong...I'm wrong.

He begins to look through his pockets. As the Bellboy stands,
looking at the television.

ANGLE on Scott, the television beyond him. As he goes
through the pockets of his jeans. He then goes through the
pockets of his jacket, and throws various objects on the bed.
Some coins, some scraps of paper. A book of matches, some
crumpled cigarettes. He hands some bills to the Bellboy.

                      SCOTT
            There you go, Pal. Hold on...

                       BELLBOY
                  (pause)
            Sure. I just...I just wanted to
            help.

                                                            104.


ANGLE, on Scott. As he rummages through the pile on the bed.
The TV shows photos of Laura Newton, wearing her red
crescent earrings.

Scott picks up a cigarette and the book of matches on the bed.

Part of the pile shows a tabloid paper - a photo of   Laura,
an insert of her father weeping at the funeral, and   the
caption "Goodbye, Baby". He bends down and picks up   the
Rogers Rangers card. And looks at it. He shakes his   head. As
we see the Bellboy leave the room. Beat.

INT. DARK, PANELLED CONFESSIONAL. NIGHT.

XCU on Scott, as he thinks for a moment, then speaks.

                      SCOTT
            It's been...quite a while since
            my last confession. That...that
            "transpired". On the rear face
            of a hill, in a mortar attack.
                 (pause)
            And I confessed that I was
            frightened.
                 (pause)
            And I have to confess, I'm
            frightened now.
                 (pause. He smiles weakly)
            'Nother "irregular Confession".

He raises a shotglass to his lips, and drinks. He makes a
"another one" gesture. Pause.

                      SCOTT
            ...I'm about as frightened as
            I'm comfortable being.
                 (pause)
            And that's why...I involved you.
                 (pause)
            Which, I suppose, was shameful.

ANGLE, as a waiter comes, with a fresh drink. We see that we
are in a very dark, quiet, smoky, panelled bar. The waiter
leaves, and reveals, beyond him, Jackie Black, the female
Sergeant we met at the training facility scenes. The waiter
looks at her, inquiring silently, if she wants anything. She
shakes her head.

                                                            105.


                      JACKIE BLACK
            Now: you did me the honor to
            Call me. Now: you tell me how I
            might help.
                 (pause)
            There in't nobody here, but two
            people in Green.
                 (pause)


Scott, looks around, he takes up a tabloid newspaper, which
has been resting on the seat of the booth. We see it is a
"funeral" edition, concerning the death of Laura Newton.

We see the large, color photo of Laura, her red hair, and,
in an insert, her father, at the gravesite, hiding his face.
The caption reads "Goodbye, Baby". Scott leans over, and
whispers to Black, his deepest secret.

                      SCOTT
                 (pointing at the paper)
            ...this girl's alive...

                      JACKIE BLACK
            Then, you'd better go get her.

EXT. SANITORIUM. DAY.

Scott, shaven, neat, and determined, standing at a bus stop.
Reading a newspaper. Behind him, a large iron fence.

ANGLE INS. The newspaper shows "The Tragic Death of Laura
Newton", and photos of the accident. And a photo of a
distraught woman in sunglasses, being held up by two friends.

ANGLE on Scott. As he looks across the street. Surreptitiously.

ANGLE HIS POV. A plainclothes car, with two people in it,
looking vaguely in his direction.

ANGLE on the bus, as it pulls into the stop. We see various
people start onto the bus. At the last moment Scott, at the
back of the line, sheers away.

ANGLE, INT. THE PLAINCLOTHES CAR. The bus pulling away from
the bus stop, the chainlink fence beyond it, and, beyond
that, a vaguely institutional-looking Colonial building.

INT. SANITORIUM. DAY.

A nurses station, Scott moving through the area, just asking
directions of an older woman, obviously a semi-invalid.

                                                            106.


ANGLE INT. SANITORIUM. The woman is Mrs. Newton. She walks
with a companion, she wears sunglasses, and starts out of
the sanitorium. As Scott walks up, some yards behind her,
following her out onto a roofed porch. The woman moves to
the far end of the porch, obviously weeping. Scott enters
the porch, and stands for a moment. Beat.

                      WOMAN (V.O.)
            ...terrible thing, grief...

Scott turns to her, to see a lovely woman in her late
fifties, sitting on a lounge chair, a robe over her legs,
indicating the weeping woman.

Scott nods, and takes something from his pocket. He starts
toward the weeping woman, but the other woman holds him with
her voice.

                      WOMAN
            ...you want to comfort them, but
            you don't know how.
                 (pause)
            I always think it's better to
            Leave Them Alone...

Scott nods his acceptance of her wisdom, and begins to start
toward the woman.

                      SCOTT
                 (of Mrs. Newton, and
                 the woman, talking to her)
            A relative?

                       WOMAN
            A psychic.
                 (pause)


                      SCOTT
            Well.
                 (pause)
            Can we blame her...?
                 (he gestures, meaning,
                 we get comfort where
                 we can find it)


                      WOMAN
            That's right.

Scott begins to move toward Mrs. Newton. The woman on the
lounge chair sits up.

                                                         107.


                      WOMAN
            ...who are you...?

                      SCOTT
                 (moving off)
            United States Secret Service.

The woman moves her blanket to reveal a pistol which she holds.

                      WOMAN
            Guess again, 'cause I'm the
            Secret Service, and you follow
            my directions or I will shoot
            you dead. Spread your hands to
            your sides, please...
                 (Scott spreads his
                 hands to his sides)
            Open them...

He opens his hands to show the red crescent earring. We see
the demeanor of the woman in back of him change, as she sees
the earring. She comes up to Scott, and he turns around. She
looks up, asking, mutely, what it means.

INT. SMALL SANITORIUM ROOM. DAY.

                      DONNY
                 (sotto, unable to stop
                 her invective)
            ...the motherfuckers pulled the
            Detail off of her...He was in
            town. Her father was in town,
            they pulled the Secret Service
            Detail off her, to take him
            tomcatting. He's been doing it
            for years. That's what they do.
            They turn the Secret Service
            into a bunch of pimps. He took
            her protection, she got snatched...

                      SCOTT
            He'd let her die?

A female Agent knocks at the door and sticks her head in and
Donny gestures "rotate".

                      FEMALE AGENT
            ...leaving the post...

Donny gestures that she has heard. The Agent leaves and the
door is closed.

                                                         108.


                      DONNY
                 (meaning, "this is my surmise")
            The start of a campaign: Your
            daughter got kidnapped because
            you were out getting laid?

                      SCOTT
            Her father would let her die...?

                      DONNY
            Who knows if he knows. His
            'people' would let her die in a
            heartbeat.

                      SCOTT
            ...her mother...?

                      DONNY
                 (pause. She takes up
                 the earring and she
                 begins to weep. She
                 looks beseechingly at Scott)
            I'm her mother...

She takes out a small, tattered, cheap earring box.

ANGLE INS. We see the empty place for holding two earrings,
and a small arcade photo of a five-year-old Laura Newton,
and this woman, Donny, fifteen years younger. They are
hugging. Scott turns over the photo to read, in a childish
scrawl, "Donny, you can keep the box, cause I'll never take
them off". Donny starts to weep.

                      SCOTT
            I need some money.
                 (Donny looks up at him questioningly)
            I'm going to get the girl back.

                      DONNY
            What can I do?

                      SCOTT
            I need money. I need a lot of money.

                      DONNY
                 (of Mrs. Newton)
            I've been signing her checks for
            years.

                                                         109.


                       SCOTT
            Alright...
                 (he scribbles a figure
                 on a napkin)
            Can you go this high, that's
            what I need...

                        DONNY
                 (as   she looks down at
                 the   figure on the paper)
            ...I...I   don't...is there
            anywhere   else you...

ANGLE. Both look to the side.

ANGLE, their POV. One of the Secret Service Agents, looking
askance at Scott. Does a double-take. And begins to raise
his cuff mike to his lips to speak.

ANGLE, on Donny, as she sees this, and turns around.

ANGLE, her POV. The empty room. Scott vanished.

INT. NEW YORK CITY OFFICE BUILDING. DAY.

A very beautiful young woman in a business suit, in an
elevator. The doors open and Scott, dressed in a suit, gets
in. He turns to face the front. They ride up in silence.

The doors open on a mezzanine. There are several men at the
end of the mezzanine. Scott starts to get out, and the girl
tries to stop him. He shoves her roughly back into the
elevator. Several of the men come toward Scott, and a large,
portly businessman in his forties (AVI) calls them off.
Scott comes forward.

                      AVI
            Didn't they tell you not to come?

                       SCOTT
            Well, I guess I wasn't paying
            attention.
                 (pause)


                       AVI
            Five years ago they told me you
            were dead.

                      SCOTT
            You want to gossip, or you want
            to do business...?

Avi motions Scott to come with him.

                                                          110.


ANGLE, Avi's hitters. One starts to take out a phone - Avi
waves him to stop - HOLD on the hitters.

ANGLE, Avi and Scott, as they sit, near the edge of the
mezzanine.

                      AVI
            Bobby; this is an American girl...?

                      SCOTT
            If that were so?

                      AVI
            If that were so, why don't your
            people go and fetch her...?

What if I'm speaking for them...?

Avi nods, meaning "yeah, sure".

                      AVI
            ...they send a hitter to
            negotiate...?
                 (pause)
            My question is: have you forgot
            your catechism...?

                      SCOTT
            And what's the answer?

                      AVI
            The answer is Go Home.

                      SCOTT
            Yeah, that's a good one.

                      AVI
            ...you're at the Big Table here.

                      SCOTT
            I know where I am.

                      AVI
            Well, then, you better talk to
            me using the Decimal System.

                      SCOTT
            Your intel. Two men. Infil, exfil,
            hardware, and com.

                      AVI
            And com to what? I cannot give you.

                                                         111.


                      SCOTT
            Well, you could, when you where
            in the Boy Scouts.

                      AVI
            Yes, but I am not in the Boy
            Scouts anymore. You heard the
            private sector?

                      SCOTT
            Yeah.

                      AVI
            Well. That's where you found me.
            And here's what it costs.

He writes a number on a sheet of paper.

                      SCOTT
                 (looks at the paper)
            ...you're out of your mind.

                      AVI
            No, you're out of your fucking
            mind, and you're out of your
            league, and my advice to
            you:...before some mercantile
            soul shops you.
                 (pause. In disgust, he
                 picks up the paper,
                 crosses out what we
                 wrote, and puts in a
                 new number)
            ...for this job, that's what it
            costs...

                      SCOTT
            ...that's what it costs...?

                      AVI
            That's what it costs you.
                 (pause)
            Go home, Bobby.

EXT. PALATIAL ESTATE. DAY.

We see a woman getting into a Range Rover, in the vast
gravel drive outside of an estate.

A man comes out of the house, with a cup of coffee, hurrying
out to kiss his wife goodbye. He does so. She drives off.

                                                           112.


He finishes the cup of coffee, puts it down outside his door,
closes the door, and looks quickly at his watch, and hurries
to his Jaguar, which he puts in gear, and it starts down the
drive.

We see it is the Businessman from the whorehouse.

ANGLE on another car, coming down the drive, which smashes
into the Jaguar.

ANGLE on Scott, who gets hurriedly out of the car. He goes
out to the Jag, and drags the stunned man from his car, and
toward the house.

ANGLE INT. A SUMPTUOUS STUDY, PALATIAL ESTATE. DAY.
Beautiful Greek and Roman artifacts line the walls, on
lighted shelves. Scott drags the stunned and abraided
Businessman into the study. Scott throws him into a chair.

                      SCOTT
            Remember me...?

ANGLE Scott, as he takes out the Businessman's card, and
looks at it.

                      SCOTT
            ...well, I guess you do have
            friends in High Places...I mean
            here you are home, n'all...
                 (he picks up now one,
                 now another piece of
                 exquisite statuary,
                 and smashes it to the ground)
            And now we're gonna see if you
            also got all that money that you
            spoke of.
                 (he takes out a
                 videotape box)
            This here's a Short Subject, if
            you know what I mean. Of you in
            Carnal Congress with an Underage
            Girl. A PROSTITUE, A MINOR, AND
            SOMEBODY'S DAUGHTER...
                 (he holds up another videotape)
            There's another...you know how
            cheap it is to make a copy...?

                      BUSINESSMAN
            ...what do you want?

                      SCOTT
            I want what you promised me...

                                                         113.


                      BUSINESSMAN
                 (as if reluctant to
                 impart the information)
            ...I've, I've already made a
            deal with...

                      SCOTT
            Yeah, but you haven't made a
            deal with me...So, today is Your
            Lucky Day, cause you get to Do,
            what Most Men only Dream of: You
            get to make Another Human Being
            Happy.

He brings over a telephone, and gives it to the Businessman.
Scott finds himself behind a large desk.

He looks down at photos of the smiling Businessman, in
various poses, with two young girls, obviously his daughters.

                      SCOTT
                 (softly)
            You had your fun, now pay for it,
            Jim. Get your bank on the phone.
            We're going to transfer some money.

The Businessman pauses, then picks up the phone.

                      SCOTT
                 (to himself)
            ..."how about that".

                      BUSINESSMAN
            ...do you know how much trouble
            you're in...?

                      SCOTT
            Yes. And that's the difference
            between you and me.

EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT STREET. DAY.

Scott, getting out of his car, rounds a corner. We see a car
coming down this street, rather quickly. Scott retreats into
a doorway.

ANGLE, HIS POV. The car blinks its lights three times.

ANGLE EXT. THE STREET. We see the car slow almost to a stop,
Scott emerges from his doorway. As the car's rear door is
opened, Scott gets in.

                                                 114.


INT. WAREHOUSE OFFICE. DAY.

Avi and Scott, at a small table.

                       AVI
            Maskala is a suburban villa, in
            Dubai. The Friends of your Friend,
                 (he gestures at a photo
                 of Assani)
            Operate there, if you will, a
            "halfway house". For the young
            women they have induced, coerced
            or drugged into spending their
            short lives. As the whores of
            Arabian tourists. Of late the
            girls have been, in the main,
            from the former Sov-Bloc. Now
            and again, a North American Girl,
            if she is exceedingly
            lovely,...blonde, usually
            blonde...
                 (he passes the photos
                 of very beautiful young
                 girls across the table,
                 to Scott)
            Will, unfortunately, find her
            way to Dubai. They travel drugged,
            they are -
                 (he searches for the word)
            - "tidied up", and sold. For
            some reason, most of them are
            sold to Yemen.
                 (pause)
            The girls are generally held, in
            Dubai, until the end of the month.
                 (he checks his watch
                 and looks significantly
                 at it)
            When the Merrymakers fly in to
            examine them. And take their
            purchases home.

                      SCOTT
            ...and then?

                       AVI
                  (shrugs)
            That is "and then".
                  (pause)
            This is a floor plan of the
            building where the girls are
            held, this is the security
            arrangements, this is the watch
            plan.
                       (MORE)

                                                         115.


                      AVI (CONT'D)
                 (he checks his watch
                 and raises his eyebrows)
            The girls are taken from the
            house in Maskala, to the Royale
            Hotel, I presume you will hit
            them in transit...?

Scott opens another envelope which Avi has passed him. As he
looks at the documents he pours out.

                      SCOTT
                 (reads)
            ..."Jameson Construction"...They
            know we're there...?

                      AVI
            I hope not.
                 (he shows documents to Scott)
            The conex container for the exfil,
            also Jameson Construction.
                 (he gestures at the
                 materials on the table)
            A passport for the Young Girl...
                 (he shrugs)
            Between fifteen and twenty-five,
            they all look alike.

                      SCOTT
                 (as he looks at the passport)
            Is that your experience...?

                      AVI
            Yes. It is. Nonetheless, we tried
            to match it to a Current Photo...

ANGLE, on Scott, as he looks, questioningly at Avi. Avi
takes a photo from his desk and passes it to Scott. It shows,
through a long lens, blurry and grainy, a photo of what is
obviously the platinum-haired Laura Newton, sitting on a bed,
in a barred room.

                      AVI
            ...she was there twelve hours ago.

                      SCOTT
            Who took the photo?

                      AVI
                 (shrugs)
            How would I know...?
                 (pause)

                                                          116.


                      SCOTT
            What does the bonus cost?

                       AVI
                 (shrugs)
            A gesture of Friendship. But. We
            thought: if you see some of the
            Yemenins -
                 (he shows Scott candid
                 photos of several
                 middle-aged, bearded
                 middle-eastern looking men)
            Any of these, in
            particular...would you say Hello
            to them?

Scott scoops up the documents, and stands.

                      SCOTT
            Who else have you done a favor
            for, Avi?

Avi shakes his head, and wags his finger, as if to say, "No,
in all sincerity..."

                      AVI
            Bobby: the world runs on manners.

Beat. Scott takes an envelope, and hands it to Avi, who
opens it. He opens his mouth to speak.

                      SCOTT
            The last third on exfil, in
            Geneva. Me and the Girl. As agreed.

                      AVI
            That's not what I was going to say.

                      SCOTT
            What were you going to say...?
                 (pause)
            ...the Last Third in Geneva...
                 (he exits)


EXT. ROOFTOP, DUBAI. DUSK.

Scott, on a rooftop, behind a raised elevator housing. Scott
takes out a pair of binoculars, and Scott leans around the
elevator housing.

ANGLE HIS POV. Across the way, the window, and the ornate
scrollwork bars, in which we, earlier, saw the photo takes
on Laura Newton.

                                                            117.


ANGLE on Scott, as he comes back behind cover, and nods to
himself, picking up his yellow bag.

ANGLE EXT. DUBAI STREET. Scott, walking down the street,
beyond him a building with an ornate scrollwork barred gate
over its courtyard door. In the courtyard beyond, two
Mercedes 600's.

As Scott walks past the trelliswork it begins to open. A
delivery truck is ushered through the gate, by an armed
guard. Scott stops, to let the truck pass.

ANGLE HIS POV. As he turns his head to the side.

ANGLE HIS POV. Walking from one outbuilding, across the
courtyard, beyond the gate, accompanied by a minder, is
Laura Newton. She is obviously drugged, disoriented, and is
held up by the guard. He gets into a conversation with a
woman, dressed as a matron, who comes out of the building
they have just vacated. And she stands, for an instant,
untended.

ANGLE on Scott, the gate open, as the gate guard ushers
through the delivery van, and Laura Newton stands several
yards away.

ANGLE XCU, Laura Newton, as she looks in his direction, and
her eyes begin to focus, as if trying to make sense of what
she is seeing.

ANGLE, her minder, who reacts to a change in her attitude,
and looks at her, and, then, follows the direction of her
gaze to the gate.

ANGLE HIS POV. The delivery truck coming through the gate,
as the gate closes behind it. The street beyond it, empty.

ANGLE INT. THE COURTYARD. As the delivery truck pulls in,
and Laura, escorted by her guard, is taken back into the
main house. She turns to look back, groggily, wonderingly,
at the street, and is pushed into the door. As she does so,
we see the delivery truck pull up to the spot she just
vacated, and the delivery man gets out and opens a rear door,
on which we see scrawled, in the dirt, the "Picasso" symbol.

ANGLE EXT. DUBAI STREET CORNER. Scott turns the corner, and
gets into a car, driven by Jones, which comes to the curb.

ANGLE INT. THE CAR. In the backseat, Scott, another man
sitting next to him, SMITH, dressed as a construction worker.
The man starts to speak. And Scott shushes him, takes out a
notebook and a pencil, and begins to make notes.

                                                         118.


EXT. CAR, DUBAI. NIGHT.

A deserted streetcorner. Various shuttered posh shops. Scott
walking across the street.

ANGLE CU on Scott, as he paces, as he walks.

                      SCOTT
            ...fourteen, fifteen, sixteen.

The camera takes him to the middle of the street. A right-
hand turn, a tight corner. He looks to his left.

ANGLE HIS POV. Beyond him, we see, several streets off, the
sign of the "Royale" hotel.

Scott beckons, and the man, Smith, comes out of the shadows.
He and Scott walk to a small passageway, at the corner.

Camera takes them through the passageway, where we see Jones,
standing by his car, in an alley.

                       SCOTT
            It's good.
                 (to Jones)
            It's very good.
                 (Jones nods his thanks)
            The charge takes the car out...
                 (to Smith)
            We got the flashbangs fore and
            aft, You hit the driver, follow
            down the driver's side, the car
            ain't going nowhere, the muscle
            gets out, I cap em, I go with
            the girl.
                 (he points to Jones.
                 He points to the car.
                 Jones nods. To Smith)
            You exfil on your own, we're on
            to the airport.

ANGLE, tight on Scott, and Jones.

                       SCOTT
            At the airport. When we hit the
            Conex. When you Seal Us In...you
            walk away.

                      JONES
            I understand.

                                                            119.


                      SCOTT
            I cannot have heat on it. Now: I
            know: that you want to protect
            the package. But: you have to
            walk away. And que sera, sera.

                      JONES
            I won't look back.

INT. WAREHOUSE ROOM. NIGHT.

Scott, at a desk, looking over his plans. A photo of Laura
Newton on his desk. Beyond him Smith and Jones are cleaning
and assembling weapons. Scott takes out his switchblade and
begins to hone it. Scott looks into the mechanism of the
knife. Peers intently, turns it over and raps it on the
table. We see a small seed fall out. Smith turns to the
sound, and looks inquisitively at Scott.

                      SCOTT
                 (as he picks the seed
                 up, answering Smith's
                 unspoken question)
            ...it's an appleseed.

Smith nods as if to say,"If you say so".

Scott reaches over to a box of Q-Tips, which sits on the
table along with other cleansing paraphernalia, and dips one
in the solvent bottle, and begins to clean the interior of
his switchblade.

ANGLE XCU on Scott, as he cleans the interior of his knife.
His face freezes...Scott leans over, and gestures at a
tweezers as part of Smith's cleaning kit. Smith nods "okay".

ANGLE INSERT. The interior of the knife. A small, wafer thin
electronic device adhering to the interior.

ANGLE on Scott. As he turns his back on the group. We see,
in an insert. He holds the electronic device up for scrutiny,
in the tweezers. He walks toward the windows of the warehouse.

                      SMITH
                 (as he cleans his
                 firearms, generally,
                 as if speaking of the universe)
            "Johnny Appleseed", eh?

                      SCOTT
            ...yeah, I'm just a Man of Peace...

We hear a car driving up, outside the warehouse. He looks
out of the window.

                                                            120.


ANGLE, HIS POV. Just seen, the nose of a small SUV, around
the corner, three men, getting out of the car.

ANGLE INT. WAREHOUSE DAY. Scott walks into a corridor of the
warehouse. He looks down an industrial staircase, and sees
the door at the bottom begin to open, stealthily.

ANGLE, camera takes Scott to a small, filthy bathroom. He
opens the door.

ANGLE, at the bottom of the stairs, Stoddard, with two
henchmen, heavily armed, look up.

ANGLE THEIR POV. Scott walking into the bathroom.

ANGLE, a floor of the warehouse. Stoddard, and his
accomplices, coming up the stairs to the floor, which holds
Scott. There are several closed doors. One of the men
consults a small hand-held 'GPS' unit, and points at one of
the doors. The men take up position around this door.
Stoddard nods, and they open fire through the door.

ANGLE, INT. THE BATHROOM. The men kick down the door, to
find the small cubicle-like room empty. One of them looks
around, and sees, and removes the small wafer-thin electronic
device from the top of the cistern. He shows it to Stoddard,
who throws it down in disgust. As he, followed by his men,
exit the room.

ANGLE EXT. DUBAI STREET. NIGHT. We see the small SUV parked
around the corner from the warehouse, a black clad driver,
sitting in the car, watching the warehouse.

The door is wrenched open, and we see Scott, the small
yellow duffle over his shoulder, drag the driver from the
car, and clout him to the ground. Scott gets into the car,
which begins to drive off.

INT. "MASKALA HOUSE" (THE HOUSE WITH THE ORNATE SCROLLWORK).
DUBAI. NIGHT.

ANGLE, Laura Newton, drugged, listless, sitting on the bed
in the small room. We hear a large explosion, and Laura gets
up, and moves toward the door of her room. She hears another
explosion, and shouts coming from outside her door. She is
reaching for the handle of the door, when the door opens,
and one of her Bodyguards opens the door, and addresses her.

                      BODYGUARD
            ...stay in your room, and...

He turns as another explosion is heard, coming from the
interior of the house. As he turns we hear glass breaking,
and see Scott entering through the window behind Laura.

                                                             121.


The Bodyguard turns, and Scott raises a silenced    pistol, and
shoots the Bodyguard twice. The Bodyguard falls,    Scott moves
to him, and drags him inside the room. He raises    his pistol
gesturing "shush" to Laura, and moves her toward    the window.

                         LAURA
            ...who...?

He uses the rope outside   the   window to improvise a sling,
for Laura, and drapes it   over   her head, and under her arms.
Scott picks her up, and   holds   her for a moment. She starts
to speak. And he answers   her   question.

                      SCOTT
            Stay by me.

He hesitates for a moment. We hear another explosion, he
nods, as if to say "That's what we're waiting for", and
passes her out of the window, and begins lowering her to the
ground.

ANGLE EXT. THE BUILDING. Laura, on the rope, reaching the
ground.

ANGLE INT. THE ROOM. Scott, as he turns to the sound of the
door opening, two men come through the door, and he shoots them.

ANGLE EXT. THE BUILDING. Scott puts Laura into the SUV and
gets behind the driver's seat. He puts the car in gear, and
it begins to drive off.

ANGLE INT. THE CAR. Laura turns to face him.

                      LAURA
            ...they said they were going to
            take care of me...

                      SCOTT
            I'm going to take care of you.
            You hold on, now.
                 (as Scott drives he
                 reloads his weapons)


                      LAURA
                 (lazily)
            Who are you?

                      SCOTT
            ...you remember, Baby, we went
            to high school together...
                 (pause)
            You dropped your earring.

                                                            122.


She shakes her head. Drugged. Trying to make sense of the
proceedings.

                      SCOTT
            You're Picasso, right...? That's
            who you are...

He draws the Picasso sign on the windshield, she looks at it,
having trouble focusing.

                      LAURA
            ...they're going to send me to a
            Party.

                       SCOTT
            No, Baby, you're going Home.
                  (pause)
            You're just taking the long way
            home.

ANGLE EXT. THE CAR. Moving through the streets. The airport
just becoming visible in the background.

INT. BARE ROOM. DUBAI. NIGHT.

Laura, asleep, at a small cardtable. Out of the window we
see an expanse of desert and scrub. Her head is down. Scott
enters the room, he moves a chair in front of the door,
moves to Laura, and manhandles her to a small cot, and
closes the shutters to the window.

                      SCOTT
            ...I told you to stay on the bed.

We see her wake and look around, trying to place herself.

ANGLE on Scott, as he takes out a notebook and begins to
make notes in it.

                      SCOTT
            ...you're going travelling.

                      LAURA
            ...what...?

                      SCOTT
            ...we're going to take a little
            trip.

She takes out a crumpled pack of cigarettes, and extracts
the last one. She takes out a match.

                      SCOTT
            ...put that away.

                                                            123.


                      LAURA
            ...I need a smoke.

                      SCOTT
            Y'can't smoke it. American
            tobacco. Smell. Carry. In the
            desert air.

He looks down his list, and nods. He takes a bandana from
his pocket and hands it to her.

                      SCOTT
            Put that on. Over your head.

                      LAURA
            Whatsamatter, you don't like
            Blondes...?

                      SCOTT
            Whole world likes Blondes. That's
            why you're here. Put the bandana on.

                      LAURA
                 (as she tries to light
                 the cigarette)
            I need a smoke.
                 (He takes it away from
                 her, and crumbles it.)
            ...gimme the fucken smoke.

He shushes her, and moves to the window.

ANGLE, EXT. The window. The first gleam of dawn. And, far
off, a Muezzin is heard chanting morning prayers. Laura
moves toward him, unbuttoning her blouse.

                      LAURA
            I could make you give me the smoke.

He slaps her lightly in the face.

                      SCOTT
            Keep it together.
                 (he takes a small
                 hypodermic kit)
            Keep it together, or I'm gonna
            give you a shot and carry you out.

She reacts violently to the sight of the needle. Beat. Then,
she sits on the bed and cries self-pityingly.

                      LAURA
            Nobody Cares about me...

                                                         124.


Hold. On Scott. And we take him back to a small shelf near
the door. He takes down what we see is an ashtray, overfull
with yellow-brown cigarette butts. He takes the ashtray to
the small table, takes out his knife, and begins shredding
the butts, and gathering the tobacco into a pile.

                       SCOTT
             ...that's right...

                       LAURA
             ...I'm just a whore...They
             wouldn't even come get me...

                       SCOTT
             They sent me...

Scott looks at the pile of tobacco. He extracts the "Rogers
Rangers" card from his pocket and looks at it. We read, in
an insert: "Rule #13: Every night, you'll be told where to
Meet, if Surrounded by Superior Force".

ANGLE, on Scott, as he very precisely peels the card into
two thin halves, and rolls one of the halves into a
cigarette, using the reclaimed tobacco from the ashtray. He
takes the cigarette to Laura. As a peace offering. She takes
it. Beat.

                       LAURA
             Did my father send you?

                       SCOTT
                  (as he lights her cigarette)
             ...that's right.

                       LAURA
                  (derisively)
             One man.

                        SCOTT
             One riot, one Ranger, you ever
             hear that?

ANGLE, on Scott, as he hears a car outside the window. He
draws a pistol and moves to the window, and looks down. He
gestures Laura to be quiet.

ANGLE EXT. The window. In the small, deserted street. A car
pulls up. A man gets out, and looks around. Beat. Another
man, and a woman, and two small children come out of the low
house and get into the car, which drives away.

                                                           125.


                      LAURA
            Leonides, the King of Sparta,
            when a neighboring state would
            beg for Military Aid. Would send
            One Man.

                      SCOTT
            ...well, there you go.

                      LAURA
            ...you ever hear that?

                      SCOTT
            No. I think we went to different
            schools.

He looks at her. Beat. She hands him the cigarette. And he
takes a drag, and passes it back. He checks his watch.

                      SCOTT
            ...put the bandana on.

                       LAURA
                 (softly)
            Did you hear the one about the
            king who turned his daughter
            into Gold?

                      SCOTT
            Yeah - I heard that one.

Beat. She turns away, and cries.

                      LAURA
            ...I don't want to go home.

                      SCOTT
            I didn't ask you.

EXT. DUBAI AIRPORT. DAY.

A long view of the airport.

ANGLE, a small delivery van we saw earlier. Parked in an
industrial area.

ANGLE INT THE VAN. Laura, dozing in the passengers seat.
Scott, sitting in the driver's seat, alert, watching.

ANGLE HIS POV. Seen beyond the corner of an industrial
building, beyond a chainlink fence, the airport.

ANGLE INT. THE CAR. Laura wakes with a start, and looks around.

                                                           126.


                      LAURA
            I don't know where we are...

                      SCOTT
            You just keep it together.

ANGLE Scott as he looks up to the sound of a plane.

ANGLE HIS POV. Directly over their heads, a small bizjet, on
final, about to touch down.

ANGLE, the chainlink fence. Scott and Laura at the fence
protecting the airport. Scott moves aside the pre-cut
section of fence, and gestures him through.

ANGLE, inside the fence. Laura and Scott moving to the
protection of a small hangar.

ANGLE, beyond them, we see the bizjet come to a halt, on the
tarmac, and turn. We see blazoned, on its side, "Global News".

ANGLE, on Scott and Laura, now inside the small hangar.
Scott moves to a small locker and extracts a set of
coveralls, and a cap, and takes them to Laura.

                      SCOTT
                 (of the coveralls)
            You put this on.

                      LAURA
                 (groggily)
            ...what...?

                      SCOTT
            You...

A pause. He turns to the sound of a car.

ANGLE HIS POV. A car, on the tarmac. It comes to a stop by a
private plane. Beyond this private plane, we see the "Global
News" bizjet, being directed to a stop.

ANGLE, on Scott, as he watches the tarmac.

ANGLE HIS POV. Stoddard and several of his men, get out of
the car which has stopped by the private plane. A man in
fatigues emerges from the plane, and hands Stoddard a piece
of paper. Stoddard begins giving this man directions.

ANGLE INT. THE CARGO HANGAR. Scott and Laura, who now has on
the mechanics coveralls.

                                                         127.


ANGLE Scott, as he looks out of the hangar door. To his
right, the plane with Stoddard and his men, to his left, the
"Global News" bizjet, its hatchway staircase, just descending.

ANGLE on Scott, as he looks at his watch. He turns to Laura.

                      SCOTT
            A little walk-in-the-park.
                 (he points her to the
                 News jet)
            See there...?

ANGLE EXT. THE NEWS BIZJET. Where a man in a safari jacket,
and a woman emerge from the plane, and glare at the sun. We
see this man consult his watch.

ANGLE, on Scott and Laura, as he walks her out of the hangar,
and towards the news bizjet. In the B.G. We see Stoddard,
and his men, at their plane. Another car pulls up to
Stoddard, disgorging a man, who goes to conference with
Stoddard.

ANGLE, these two men.

                      SECOND MAN
                 (giving his report)
            ...all of the passenger terminals,
            and all access-points to the
            Cargo and General Aviation...

                      LAURA
                 (groggily, as in a dream)
            No, you know what my mistake was...?

                      SCOTT
                 (as he looks around)
            ...what was that...?

He stops and picks up a pair of "paddles" from their
position, leaning against the nose wheel of a plane. They
walk on. In the BG we see Stoddard and his crew, searching.

                      SCOTT
            ...what was your mistake...?

                      LAURA
                 (from a distance, as
                 she begins to laugh,
                 as at a great private
                 joke; she stops walking)
            ...you think we bring our
            troubles on ourselves...?

                                                            128.


                      SCOTT
            I'm certain of it.

She starts laughing, getting hysterical.

                      SCOTT
            No, no...come on baby...come on,
            come on girl: just walk to the
            plane: Just Get On the
            Plane...WALK TO THE PLANE...

She starts to break free and Scott manoeuvres her into a
small hangar area. She is struggling mightily. Scott has his
hand over her mouth.

ANGLE. We see their feet moving through a pool of oil on the
concrete floor - we see she loses her footing. We see Scott
tighten his grip on her, and is furiously trying to calm her.

                       SCOTT
            Shussh, baby... shussh...
            shussh... it's going to be
            alright...

We see him work a small hypodermic kit from the pocket of
his jacket. We see Laura see it, and her eyes grow wide.

                      SCOTT
            This's going to make Everything
            Allright...

Laura reacts to the hypodermic, which Scott is bringing
toward her. And screams.

                        LAURA
            No!

EXT. THE HANGAR AREA.

We see Stoddard, and his men, about to get into their Jeep,
stop, and turn at the sound.

ANGLE INT. The Hangar Area. Signs all over marked in Arabic
and English - "Petrol - No Smoking!!"

As Scott lunges after Laura, the door, behind her bursts
open, and Stoddard and an accomplice enter, placing Laura,
in the midst of the hangar, between Stoddard and Scott. Who
stands in front of a large tanker labelled "Aviation Gasoline".

                                                            129.


                      STODDARD
            Leave her Alone.
                 (to his men)
            Don't shoot him, don't shoot,
            you'll blow the thing sky high...

                         SCOTT
            Laura...

                      STODDARD
            Thank God we Found you. You know
            me. I work for Mister Burch.
            I've met you...

ANGLE on Laura, standing between the two men. She is
completely confused. She looks from one to another.

                      LAURA
                 (drugged and groggy)
            He said that he came to get me...
                 (she shakes her head
                 in disbelief. Then she
                 starts to walk a step
                 toward Scott, then
                 turns, and proceeds
                 toward Stoddard.)


                      STODDARD
            That's right, Laura...Walk away
            from him. Walk to the Plane...He
            can't hurt you now. Walk to the
            plane...

He points at his bizjet, outside, on the tarmac. Laura walks,
unsteadily, in the direction pointed, and we see a female
attendant, in a vaguely military getup, get out of the plane,
and begin to walk toward Laura.

                         SCOTT
                    (screams)
            No...

He starts toward Laura. And Stoddard and his two men
interpose themselves between Scott and Laura, who is
approaching the plane. Stoddard's two men approach Scott.
One draws a knife.

ANGLE on Scott, who hangs his head, wearily. He looks down
at his empty hands.

ANGLE on the man with the knife, approaching him.

                                                           130.


ANGLE on Scott, straightening himself, as if submitting to
the inevitable, as the man with the knife draws closer. He
makes a thrust, and covers. Scott steps toward him and spits
at him, full in the face. The man with the knife recoils for
a moment, and Scott disarms him, throws him viciously to the
concrete floor, and stomps on him. Scott bends to pick up
the knife the man has dropped, and turns to face the other
man. As he does so, he slips on what we see is a large pool
of oil on the floor. He goes down heavily. And the second
man steps into him as he falls, drawing his pistol.

                      STODDARD
            DON'T SHOOT, DON'T SHOOT, DON'T
            SHOOT HIM IN HERE...

The man uses the pistol to cuff Scott, who is attempting to
rise to his knees, behind the ear. Scott falls.

                      STODDARD
            Cuff 'im...

The man handcuffs Scott behind his back.

ANGLE on Scott shaking his head to clear it, as he now
struggles to his knees.

ANGLE, his POV. Laura Newton, walking toward the bizjet.

                      STODDARD
                 (to Scott)
            Yes...well...

                      SCOTT
            Let the girl go home.
                 (pause)


                      STODDARD
                 (to his henchmen)
            ...wait till she lifts off, take
            him outside and shoot him.

                      SCOTT
                 (as he speaks he moves,
                 slightly, continuously,
                 to get a better view
                 of the girl)
            ...why can't the Girl Go Home?

                      STODDARD (CU)
            Because she's dead.
                 (pause)
            You had to know the Secret
            Knowledge. Didn't you?

                                                         131.


                      SCOTT
            What is the Secret Knowledge?

                      STODDARD
            The Secret Knowledge is: There
            Is No Secret Knowledge.
                 (turns over his
                 shoulder, to look at
                 Laura, walking toward
                 the plane)
            You went Beyond What Was
            Permitted. And the Gods Are Angry.

ANGLE. On the tarmac. Laura, walking toward the plane, the
petroleum storage hangar behind her. We see a vaguely
military uniformed woman fall into step beside her and take
her arm. Laura looks at her. We see Laura full face, and
just the shoulder of the woman escorting her. Beyond them we
hear the engine of the bizjet start up.

                      LAURA
            ...I'm so tired.

                      WOMAN
            ...I'm going to ask you to do
            Just the One More Thing...

Laura looks at her questioningly.

                      WOMAN
            I'm going to ask you, now, to
            walk away from this plane, and
            come with me.

ANGLE, to show that the stewardess, who descended from the
bizjet (the vaguely military clad young woman we saw earlier)
is still on station outside of the bizjet, and that the
woman who is walking and talking with Laura is Jackie Black,
the young female sergeant we met earlier. Laura looks at her
uncomprehendingly. Laura begins shaking her head pathetically,
and protesting, drawing away from Jackie Black.

                      LAURA
            No...leave me alone. No - I don't
            know you...

ANGLE, INT. The Petroleum Hangar. Day.

                                                            132.


                      STODDARD
                 (to his men, as he,
                 Stoddard, casts a
                 glance outside, and
                 then back)
            Alright, take him outside...
                 (the henchman hoists
                 Scott to his feet)


ANGLE, on Laura and Jackie Black. Standing immobile. Laura
looks down at something. She then looks up, her face transfixed.

ANGLE, on Jackie Black's hands, she holds the cheap jewelry
box we saw earlier, and, in it. The photo of Laura and Donny,
and the legend: "Donny you can keep this box, cause I will
never take them off."

ANGLE XCU, on Laura, as she looks at Jackie, who now moves
Laura away from the bizjet, and towards the assemblage of
newspeople, who are on the tarmac, around the "global news" jet.

ANGLE, EXT. The Global News Jet. A female reporter,
gossiping, with some of her crew, looks over in the
direction of Laura and Jackie, and does a double-take.

                      FEMALE REPORTER
            Oh, my God...

ANGLE, on Stoddard, his man, and Scott. As they leave the
hangar. Stoddard looks around.

ANGLE, his POV. Inside the hangar, the fallen man, that
Scott has killed. Stoddard goes back inside, to drag this
man away. He looks up. And, as he does so, he sees Laura,
walking with Jackie Black, toward the Global News Plane.

                      STODDARD
                 (yells)
            Wait...!

ANGLE, on Jackie Black and Laura, walking toward the plane,
where we see the crew hurriedly setting up a camera.

ANGLE, on Stoddard, as he draws his pistol, and fires toward
Laura and Jackie. We see Jackie move to shield Laura, and
then, struck by a bullet, she goes down.

                      JACKIE BLACK
                 (to Laura)
            Keep walking...

ANGLE, on Scott, in the grip of Stoddard's henchman.

                                                         133.


                      HENCHMAN
                 (to Stoddard)
            ...do you want me to...?

In the moment he is distracted. Scott breaks the man's grip,
and his arm. He knees the man, and kicks him to the ground.

ANGLE, INT. The Global Jet. The news crew reacts to the shot.
Beyond them we see Jackie, fallen to the tarmac, and Laura,
is walking toward the newspeople.

                      FEMALE REPORTER
            Gimme an uplink Gimme an uplink...
            GET IT ON THE SAT. Now Now Now...

Inside the jet we see various monitors, and one switches
from an innocuous travelogue, to the scene at the airport,
and the caption "Live". We see the shot is taken from inside
the plane. We see Laura stumbling toward the bizjet, and see
the female reporter run out of the plane, and move her to
safety inside the cabin.

                      FEMALE REPORTER
                 (to the unseen cameraman)
            On her. On her, get it on the
            girl...Get us Out of Here...

The camera shifts to the image of Laura Newton, going out
live. Behind her we hear the crew shooting commands, and see
the door to the Global jet close, as the jet begins to taxi.

ANGLE, INT. The Petroleum Hangar. We see Stoddard, reloading
his pistol. In the BG we see Scott step through his
handcuffs, that is, bring them in front of his body. He
takes a pistol from the henchman, who is writing on the
floor. He raises the pistol and shoots the henchman. He
turns on Stoddard.

                      SCOTT
            The girl ain't dead, baby, you're
            dead. You see: that's the
            difference.

He walks toward Stoddard,who is fumbling, trying to reload
his pistol.

                      STODDARD
            WAIT: WAIT. The girl's home. You
            brought her home. Now, listen to
            me, because I am going to tell
            you...now, you wanted to be
            "inside"...I am going to take
            you as far inside as you can go:
            Z'at what you want...? Is that
            what you want?

                                                            134.


                       SCOTT
            No, I just wanted to bring the
            girl back.

He shoots Stoddard, who falls.

ANGLE, INT. The Bizjet, as it taxis. Laura Newton turns her
face to the sound of the shot.

ANGLE, her POV. Jackie Black, on the tarmac, Scott, kneeling
to the fallen Stoddard, and then running out of the hangar
toward her.

ANGLE, on Scott, running, as we see he has the key he has
taken from Stoddard, and is releasing his handcuffs.

ANGLE Jackie Black, bleeding, as Scott kneels to her, and
cradles her. Scott looks down. Black is weakening, and
obviously expiring.

                      JACKIE BLACK
            ...is she safe?

                      SCOTT
            That's right, she's safe.

                      JACKIE BLACK
                 (weakly, almost whispering)
            ...well, then...

ANGLE on Scott, cradling her. Weeping, as he smoothes her hair.

                      SCOTT
            ...that's right, Baby...


FADE OUT.

					THE STING

	FADE IN:

	A white on black TITLE appears in the lower left hand corner
	of the screen:

	AUGUST, 1936

								FADE OUT.

	FADE IN:

	EXT. A SLUM AREA OF JOLIET - DAY

	It's a bleak, windy morning, the kind that clears the
	streets of all but the winos (who carry their own heaters),
	and the point-men for juvenile gangs.  We pick up a solitary
	figure, Joe Mottola, coming down the street and entering
	what appears to be an abandoned tenement.  He pauses a
	second to dust his white-winged alligator shoes on the back
	of his pants leg.  Sharply dressed and surrounded by the
	aura of one who is making money for the first time and
	broadcasting it on all bands, he seems an incongruity in
	this part of town.

	We follow him up a flight of rickety stairs to a second
	floor flat.  He knocks on the door, is admitted by a cautious
	doorman.

	INT. NUMBERS SPOT - DAY

	Suddenly we are plunged into a room of chattering, clamoring
	people.  This is a spot for the numbers racket, a place
	immune from legal interference, where any sucker can bet on
	a number between 1 and 1000 in the hope of getting the 600
	to 1 payoff that goes to those few who guess right.  The
	bettors are queued up in several lines before a long table,
	where they place their bets and are given receipts in return.
	Others wait at a cashier's window to pick up previous
	earnings or to ask for credit.

	Mottola moves through the crowd to a back room where betting
	slips are being sorted and money counted under the watchful
	and somewhat impatient gaze of a Supervisor, an older man
	named Mr. Granger.  The Yankee-White Sox game is heard on
	the radio in the background.

	Mottola, noticing that his entrance has aroused little
	interest, saunters over to the Phone Girl and gives her a
	little pinch on the cheek.  The girl slaps his hand away,
	obviously having been through this before.

					PHONE GIRL
			Beat it, Mottola.

	Granger glances up and exchanges a token nod with Mottola,
	who plops down in a folding chair next to the radio.  The
	phone rings.

					PHONE GIRL
			8720...Yes, hold on a second.
				(calling over to the Supervisor)
			Mr. Granger, Chicago on the line.


	Granger is a little apprehensive about talking to Chicago,
	but takes the phone anyway.

					GRANGER
			Yeh?

								CUT TO:

	INT. A WATERFRONT PROCESSING PLANT - CHICAGO - DAY

	A flabby, bald man named Combs is on the other end of the
	line.  Visible beyond the door and interior window of his
	office is a large room, cluttered with tables, typewriters,
	clerks and adding machines.  This room is the clearinghouse
	for all the transaction of the numbers game.  All the
	betting slips and income from the spots are brought in here
	and processed.

					COMBS
			Granger, this is Combs.  Why
			haven't we heard from ya?  Everybody
			else is in.

					GRANGER
			We had a few problems with the Law
			this morning.  The Mayor promised
			the Jaycees to get tough on the
			rackets again, so he shut everybody
			down for a couple hours to make it
			look good.  Nothing serious, it
			just put us a little behind for the
			day.

					COMBS
			You been making your payoffs,
			haven't ya?

					GRANGER
			Hell yes.  He does this every year.
			There's nothing to worry about.

					COMBS
			Okay, finish your count and get it
			up here as soon as you can.  I
			don't wanta be here all night.

					GRANGER
			Believe me, the Man's gonna be real
			happy.  Looks like we cleared over
			ten grand this week.

					COMBS
				(not impressed)
			We cleared 22 here.

					GRANGER
			Well, hell, you got the whole
			Chicago south side.  How do ya
			expect the eight lousy spots I've
			got to compete with that?

					COMBS
				(reading off a sheet
				of paper on his desk)
			They did 14 grand in Evanston, 16.5
			is Gary, and 20 in Cicero.  Looks
			like you're bringing up the rear,
			Granger.

	INT. NUMBERS SPOT - DAY

	Granger burns inside.  One of the girls who's been sorting
	and counting hands him a slip of paper.

					GRANGER
			I just got the count.  We'll put
			the take on the 4:15.

					COMBS
			We'll be waitin'.

	Combs hangs up, smiling to himself, proud of the way he gave
	the needle to Granger.

								CUT TO:

	INT. NUMBERS SPOT - DAY

	Granger storming over to a safe and jerking open the door.

					GRANGER
				(snapping)
			Mottola.

	Mottola hustles out of his chair.

					GRANGER
				(handing him a bundle
				of bills)
			Take this up to the city on the
			4:15.  They'll be waitin' for it at
			the clearing house.  And don't stop
			for no drinks.  You can get a cab
			down the street.

	Mottola takes the money and slips it into his inside coat
	pocket with all the dramatic flair of the true flunky.  No
	one would ever guess that he was just an overdressed
	messenger boy.

	EXT. OF THE TENEMENT AGAIN

	Mottola emerges from a side entrance into a narrow alley.
	He walks briskly down to the end and turns left into a large
	alleyway; this one connecting two streets.  The alley is
	deserted save for one scruffy, slovenly dressed young
	stranger coming toward him from the opposite direction.  The
	man carries a battered suitcase and seems to be in a hurry.

	Suddenly, Mottola hears shouting coming from somewhere
	behind him.  He turns around to see a small, weathered
	looking thief come racing around the corner and down the
	alley toward him, frantically pursued by a gray-haired black
	man.  Limping noticeably, the black man manages a few cries
	for help and then stumbles and falls.  The stranger yells at
	Mottola to cover his side of the alley, and then readies
	himself for the arrival of the thief.  Mottola just stands
	there, not the least interested in the exercise of justice.
	Just as the thief is about to run on by, the stranger throws
	his suitcase at the little man's legs, sending him sprawling
	and separating him from the wallet he's been carrying in his
	left hand.

	The stranger makes a dash for the wallet and kicks it back
	to where Mottola is standing.  Almost by reflex, Mottola
	picks it up.  The thief scrambles to his feet and starts
	back toward his new-found enemy, brandishing a knife.  Both
	the stranger and Mottola brace themselves for an attack.
	The thief, realizing that there are two people to fight,
	begins to think better of it.  He is not a young man, nor
	particularly strong.

					THIEF
				(shaking his fist at
				the stranger)
			You fuckin' nigger-lover.  I'll get
			you for this someday, sucker egg.

	Mottola and the stranger exchange glances of relief as the
	thief flees out onto the street and disappears.

	The black man, meanwhile, has struggled to his feet and is
	staggering toward them.  He collapses against the alley wall
	after a few steps.  The stranger rushes over to him, followed
	somewhat absently by Mottola.

					BLACK MAN
			The wallet.  You gotta go after him.
			He's got all the money.

					STRANGER
			Don't worry, we got the wallet.
			What happened?  He get ya with the
			knife?

	The stranger opens the Black Man's coat to reveal a bloody
	wound at the top of his leg.

					BLACK MAN
				(trying to move)
			Give it to me!  Please.  I gotta
			know it's all there!

					STRANGER
			You just sit tight, old man.  We're
			gonna have to get you to a doctor.
				(starting to leave)
			I'll call a cop.

					BLACK MAN
			No, no cops!

	Mottola has given him his wallet, which the black man now
	opens, disclosing a fat bundle of bills tied by a rubber
	band.  Mottola and the stranger are amazed by the amount of
	money.

					STRANGER
				(a little uneasy)
			You wanted by the law or somethin'?

					BLACK MAN
			Naw, it's okay.

					STRANGER
			You're crazy carryin' that kinda
			money in this neighborhood.  No
			wonder you got hit.

					BLACK MAN
				(trying to get to his feet)
			Thanks.  I'm obliged to ya, but I
			gotta get goin'.
				(his leg gives way
				under him)

					STRANGER
			You ain't goin' nowhere on that leg.

					BLACK MAN
			I gotta!  Look, I run some slots
			down in West Bend for a mob here.
			I got a little behind on my payoffs
			so they figure I been holdin' out
			on 'em.  They gave me to 4:00 to
			come up with the cash.  I don't get
			it there I'm dead.

					STRANGER
			It don't look good, gramps, it's
			ten of now.

					BLACK MAN
			I got a hundred bucks for you and
			your friend if you deliver the
			money for me.

					STRANGER
				(hesitates)
			I dunno.  That little mug that got
			ya is mad enough at me already --
			what if he's out there waitin'
			around a corner with some friends.

					BLACK MAN
			He won't know you're carryin' it.
			C'mon, you gotta help me out.

					STRANGER
				(makes up his mind)
			Sorry, pal.  I'll fix you up, call
			you a doc, but I ain't gonna walk
			into a bunch of knives for ya.

					BLACK MAN
				(desperate to Mottola)
			How bout you?  I'll give you the
			whole hundred!

					STRANGER
			What makes you think you can trust
			him?  He didn't do shit.

					MOTTOLA
			Hey, butt out, chicken liver.  I
			gave him back his wallet, didn't I?
				(to black man)
			How far is this place?

					BLACK MAN
			1811 Mason.  Put it in Box 3C.  You
			won't have no trouble.  There's
			five thousand dollars there and
			here's a hundred for you.

					MOTTOLA
				(taking the bundle of
				bills from the black
				man, plus the $100 bill)
			All right.  I'll make your drop for
			you, old man.  And don't worry, you
			can trust me.

	Mottola puts the bills in his inside coat pocket, right next
	to the numbers money.  The stranger, who has now finished
	bandaging, watches him do it.

					STRANGER
			If that punk and his pals decide to
			search ya, you'll never fool 'em
			carryin' it there.

					BLACK MAN
				(suddenly afraid again)
			What do we do?

					STRANGER
			You got a bag or somethin?

					BLACK MAN
			No.

					STRANGER
			How 'bout a handkerchief?

					BLACK MAN
			Here.

	The stranger goes into the right coat pocket and pulls out a
	wrinkled handkerchief.

					STRANGER
			Let me have the money.

	Mottola takes out the Black Man's five grand and hands it to
	the Stranger.  He puts it in the handkerchief.

					STRANGER
			You better stick that other in here
			too, if you wanta keep it.
	


					BLACK MAN
				(pleading)
			Just hurry, will ya.

	Mottola pulls out the numbers money and puts it in the
	handkerchief too.  The stranger ties it all up.

					STRANGER
				(demonstrating by
				slipping the bundle
				down into crotch)
			All right.  Carry it down in your
			pants here.
				(pulling it back out
				and tucking it in
				Mottola's pants)
			Ain't no hard guy in the world
			gonna frisk ya there.

					MOTTOLA
			Thanks.
				(to the black man)
			So long, partner.  Don't worry,
			everything's gonna be all right.

	The Black Man nods gratefully, but there's still a trace of
	worry on his face.  Mottola trots off down the alley and out
	onto the street, glancing around cautiously for signs of
	trouble.  He walks hurriedly down the sidewalk toward the
	cab stand in the distance.  Suddenly the little man with the
	knife appears out of a doorway about 15 yards behind him.
	Mottola notices him and quickens his pace, finally breaking
	into a dead run.

	We follow him as he dashes headlong down the street, opening
	a big lead on the guy with the knife.  He reaches the taxi
	zone.  He hops in a cab and slams the door.

	INT. TAXI - DAY

	He jumps in, closes the door, and breathes a sigh of relief.

					CABBIE
			Where to?

					MOTTOLA
			Which way is Mason?

					CABBIE
			About 20 blocks south.

					MOTTOLA
			Okay, go north.  The Joliet
			Station -- Fast.
	


Mottola settles back in his seat and starts to laugh.

					CABBIE
			What's so funny?

					MOTTOLA
			I just made the world's easiest
			five grand.

	He takes the bundle out from inside his pants in order to
	gaze upon his new-found fortune.  He unties the handkerchief.
	It's full of toilet paper.  Mottola looks like he's just
	been shot.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. ALLEY - DAY - THE STRANGER AND BLACK MAN

	hightailing it down the street, two newly solvent con
	artists on the lam.  It's hard to run they're laughing so
	hard.  The stranger chucks his suitcase in a trash can and
	pulls the real handkerchief out of his pants.

					BLACK MAN
			Jesus, what a bundle.  Did you know
			he was that loaded?

					STRANGER
			Hell no, I just cut into him.  I
			woulda settled for pawning one of
			them shoes.

	As they split off, music begins, and we go into a

	TITLES SEQUENCE

	Done to a driving Chicago blues, the sequence is designed to
	establish somewhat the milieu of the stranger, known to
	friends and enemies alike as Hooker.  We see the following:

	EXT. PAWNSHOP - LOOKING INSIDE - DAY

	Hooker is getting a radio and well-worn suit out of hook.
	It's like seeing old friends again.  All pantomime.

	INT. HOOKER'S ROOM - DAY

	A shabby little place he rents above a cigar store.  We pick
	him up in a jerry-built outdoor shower, which he's rigged up
	on the fire escape.  The rinse water drips down through the
	landing into the grimy alley below.

					HOOKER
				(singing)
			'With plenty of money and you-oo-
			oo,
			Oh baby, what I wouldn't do-oo-
			oo...'

	ON THE STREET AGAIN

	jauntily carrying a magnum of champagne and some flowers,
	obviously on his way to see someone special.

	IN A BURLESQUE HOUSE

	Hooker stands in the wings holding the flowers and champagne,
	watching his date for the evening, a 6'3" stripper named
	Crystal, do her routine.

	Crystal finishes up and comes off the stage.

					CRYSTAL
				(tired)
			Hi, Hooker, you gettin' married or
			somethin'?

					HOOKER
			Come into a little dough.  You
			wanna get outa here tonight?

					CRYSTAL
			Can't.  I got a 10 o'clock show.  I
			need the five bucks.

					HOOKER
			I'll spend fifty on ya.

	Crystal looks at him a second and starts to giggle.  We're
	pretty sure she's gonna get outa here tonight.

	COMING INTO A POOR MAN'S GAMBLING JOINT

	Little more than a reconverted brick basement, the place
	contains three shoddy, homemade roulette tables.  Hooker,
	accompanied now by Crystal, nods a greeting to the doorman
	and proceeds to a table where there are already several
	other people laying their bets for the next spin.  Hooker
	knows the wheel man, an old-timer named Jimmy.

					JIMMY
				(glad to see him)
			Hooker!

					HOOKER
			How ya doin', Jimmy.
	


					JIMMY
				(collecting bets and
				paying off the winners)
			Ain't seen you in months, boy.
			Thought maybe you took a fall.

					HOOKER
			Naw, just a little hard times,
			that's all.  It's all over now.

					JIMMY
			You gonna have a go here?
				(pointing to the
				betting board)
			How 'bout a ten spot on the line
			here.  The 4-9 been lookin' good
			today.  Lotsa action on 28th Street
			down there, too.  Pay ya 10-1.

	As Jimmy finishes his spiel, he starts the wheel spinning
	and drops in the ball.  Betting is allowed to continue until
	the ball drops from the outer ring into the center.

					HOOKER
				(taking out his wallet)
			Three grand on the black.

	Jimmy is stunned.  The others at the table, used to dollar
	bets, look at Hooker like he's some kind of foreign dignitary.

					JIMMY
				(worried)
			You sure you wanna start off that
			big?  Bet like that could put a
			real dent in us.

					HOOKER
			I feel lucky tonight.

					JIMMY
			Aw, come on, Hooker, why don't you
			just...

					HOOKER
			Three grand on the black, Jimmy.

	Jimmy wants to argue some more, but the ball is getting
	ready to drop into the center.  We see Jimmy quickly press a
	hidden lever under the table with his foot.  The ball falls
	and settles into red 27 with a motion that is not quite
	right.  The others at the table fail to notice, but Hooker
	is not fooled.  He stares venomously at Jimmy, who knows
	that Hooker is on to him.

					JIMMY
			Sorry, Hooker.
				(making an attempt at
				levity, in order to explain)
			Good thing that ball came up red.
			Guy could get in trouble around
			here, losin' a bet that big.

	Jimmy reaches for Hooker's money.  Hooker stops him by
	putting his hand on it.

					HOOKER
			Spin it again.

	Jimmy doesn't know what the hell to do.  He gives Hooker a
	little head motion to indicate a small window high up in one
	of the walls.  Behind it, we see a pair of eyes.  Suddenly,
	Hooker understands why Jimmy had to cheat him, but it
	doesn't change his demand.

					HOOKER
			Spin it anyway, Jimmy.

	Jimmy is beside himself.  If he doesn't spin again, Hooker
	may expose him.  If he does spin, and loses, his management
	will fire him.  He pleads to Hooker with his eyes, but it's
	no use.  Jimmy spins the wheel and reluctantly drops in the
	ball.  This time there is no foot on the lever, and it
	settles into black 15.  Hooker stares at the ball a second
	and then looks up at his terrified friend.

					HOOKER
			Don't worry, pal.  I knew it was my
			night.

	Hooker pushes the money over to Jimmy and walks out of the
	room.  He's lost $3,000, but he's still working on a lucky
	night.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. GAMBLING JOINT

	Hooker and Crystal out on the street.

					CRYSTAL
				(irritated)
			Thanks for the evening, Hooker.  I
			can still make the 10 o'clock.  If
			you wanna spend 50 bucks on me
			again, mail it.

	She walks off down the street.

					HOOKER
				(going into his
				pocket for more money)
			Hey wait a minute.
				(he comes up with 30)
			Aw, the hell with ya.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. THE WATERFRONT PROCESSING PLANT - LATE AFTERNOON

	A late model Ford roars up and screeches to a stop in front
	of the plant.  Out bursts a carefully-groomed, tight-lipped
	young man named Greer, who hustles into the plant.  We
	follow him through a maze of machinery to the service
	elevator and up to the third floor where we find ourselves
	in the clearinghouse room we saw earlier.

	INT. PLANT - AFTERNOON - LATE

	The working day is over now, and everyone has gone, except
	for Combs, who sits somberly in his office.

					GREER
			They found Mottola.  He was drunk
			in a dive in Joliet.  Never got on
			the train.

					COMBS
				(aggravated)
			I don't wanta hear about his day,
			Greer.  What happened to the money?

					GREER
			He lost it to a coupla con artists
			on his way outa the spot.

					COMBS
			How much?

					GREER
			Twelve thousand.

	Combs sits in quiet thought for a second.  Finally:

					COMBS
			All right.  Better get on the phone
			to New York.  See what the big mick
			wants to do about it.
				(pause)
			I gotta pretty good idea, though.

								CUT TO:

	INT. AN EXCLUSIVE NEW YORK GAMBLING CLUB - LATE AFTERNOON

	An agitated young man, Floyd, weaves his way through the
	craps and roulette tables, and hustles up a staircase to a
	second floor room with a drawing of a snarling tiger on the
	door.  Below the tiger, the word "FARO" appears.  There is a
	large man, of thuggish demeanor, guarding the door, but
	Floyd gives him a small hand signal and walks right by him.

								CUT TO:

	INSIDE THE FARO ROOM

	In the center is a beautifully-carved wooden table, on which
	sit a faro board and a dealing box, tended by a stone-faced
	Dealer, who calls the progress of the game in a continuous
	abacus-like device that keeps track of the cards which have
	already been played.  On the opposite side of the table,
	completely absorbed in the rhythmic appearance of the cards
	from the dealing box, sits Doyle Lonnegan.  Although is
	clothes and accessories are those of a wealthy man, there is
	a coarseness to both his movement and speech which bespeak
	lower class origins, for which he now has nothing but
	contempt.

	Floyd enters the room and approaches him cautiously, trying
	hard to make as little noise as possible.

					FLOYD
			Doyle, can I see you a minute?

					LONNEGAN
				(not looking up from
				the table)
			I'm busy, Floyd.

					FLOYD
			It's important.  We had a little
			trouble in Chicago today.  One of
			our runners got hit for 12 grand.

					LONNEGAN
				(calmly)
			Which one?

					FLOYD
			Mottola.

					LONNEGAN
			You sure he didn't just pocket it?
	


					FLOYD
			No, we checked his story with a
			tipster.  He was cleaned by two
			grifters on 47th.

					LONNEGAN
			They workin' for anybody?

					FLOYD
			I don't know.  Could be.  We're
			runnin' that down now.

					LONNEGAN
			All right, mark Mottola up a little
			and put him on a bus.  Nothin'
			fancy, just enough to keep him from
			coming back.  Get some local people
			to take care of the other two.
				(impassively)
			We gotta discourage this kinda thing.

								CUT TO:

	INT. AN OLD BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

	Hooker, still in his suit, but looking a little worse for
	wear, knocks on the door of one of the apartments.  A young
	black woman, Louise, answers the door, holding a baby.

					HOOKER
			Howdy, Louise.

					LOUISE
				(admiring Hooker in
				his suit)
			Goddamn, Johnny Hooker, you're a
			sharp hunky in them linens.  If you
			wasn't so pale, I'da sworn you had
			class.

	Hooker steps inside and walks right into a big hug from an
	older black woman, Alva.  Alva has a hat on, obviously just
	about to go out.  Beyond her we see the Eirie kid and the
	Black Man (known from here on as Luther Coleman) playing a
	game of mah jong on the dining table with a man whose back
	is to us.  An 11-year-old boy is listening to the radio.

					COLEMAN
			Turn that down, Leroy.

					ALVA
			Oh, Johnny, Luther said you was
			somethin' to see today.

					HOOKER
			I'll never be as good as that mark,
			Alva.

					ALVA
			Well, we gonna hear all about it
			when we get back from church.
			Leroy, get your jacket on, boy.

	Leroy goes to get his jacket.  Louise is finished putting
	the baby to bed.

					HOOKER
			You goin' to church now?

					ALVA
			They been havin' late bingo down
			there.  I'm gonna call on the Lord
			for a little cash, while he's still
			payin' off.  Luther, you look in on
			that child from time to time, will
			ya?

	Luther nods that he will.  Alva, Leroy and Louise leave for
	church as Hooker strolls over and tosses two packets on the
	table.  Luther doesn't pick his up, but the other man does.
	We now see that he is the thief in the opening sequence.  He
	is called the Eirie kid and he is delighted at his share.

					EIRIE KID
			Hey, Luther told me he was carrying
			a wad, but I didn't figure this much.

					HOOKER
			Which way did he do, Eirie?

					EIRIE KID
			Straight north.  He was gonna take
			it all and run.

					HOOKER
				(laughs)
			The bastard.  He can blow his nose
			all the way.

	They laugh again, but Luther doesn't share their enthusiasm.
	He watches Hooker who becomes uncomfortable under his gaze.

					COLEMAN
			You're late.  Where you been?

					HOOKER
				(flopping into a chair)
			I had some appointments.

					COLEMAN
				(not fooled)
			How much did ya lose?

					HOOKER
				(after a pause)
			All of it.

					COLEMAN
				(pissed)
			In one goddamn night?  What are ya
			sprayin' money around like that for?
			You coulda been nailed.

					HOOKER
			I checked the place out.  There
			weren't no dicks in there.

					COLEMAN
			You're a con man, and you blew it
			like a pimp.  I didn't teach ya to
			be no pimp.

					HOOKER
			What's eatin' you?  I've blown
			money before.

					COLEMAN
			No class grifter woulda' done it,
			that's all.

					HOOKER
			You think my play is bad?

					COLEMAN
			I think it's the best...

	Hooker sinks back, embarrassed that he misread Coleman's
	intentions.

					COLEMAN
			...It's the only reason I ain't
			quit before now.

					HOOKER
				(bewildered)
			What?

					COLEMAN
			I'm gettin' too slow for this
			racket.  I done the best I'm gonna
			do.  You hang on too long, you
			start embarrassin' yourself.

					HOOKER
			What are you talkin' about?  We
			just took off the biggest score
			we've ever had.  We can do anything
			we want now.

					COLEMAN
			It's nothin' compared to what you
			could be makin' on the Big Con.
			You're wastin' your time workin'
			street marks.

					HOOKER
			Hey look.  You think I'm gonna run
			out on ya or somethin'?  Just cause
			we hit it big.  Luther, I owe you
			everything.  If you hadn't taught
			me con, I wouldn't know nothin'.

					COLEMAN
				(a little embarrassed)
			Aw hell, you sound like some
			goddamn sucker.  You know everything
			I know.  You got nothin' more to
			learn from me.

					HOOKER
			But you played the Big Con.  You
			said it was nothin'.  A game for
			flakes and mama's boys.

					COLEMAN
			And I'm tellin' ya now, you're a
			fool if you don't get into it.  A
			bigger fool than I was.
				(pause, holding up
				the money)
			I been lookin' for this one all my
			life, Johnny.  Now I got a chance
			to step out at the top.

	Hooker knows it's no use.

					HOOKER
				(after a long silence)
			What the hell you gonna do with
			yourself?

					COLEMAN
			Aw, I got a brother down in K.C.,
			runs a freight outlet.  I can go
			halfsies with 'em!  It ain't too
			exciting, but it's mostly legal.

	Hooker just nods.

					COLEMAN
			Straighten up, kid.  I wouldn't
			turn ya out if ya weren't ready.
				(flipping Hooker a
				piece of paper)
			I got a guy named Henry Gondorff I
			want you to look up.  There ain't a
			better insideman alive.  He'll
			teach ya everything ya gotta know.

					HOOKER
			You'll take a cut of what I make,
			won't ya?

					COLEMAN
			I'm out, Johnny.

					HOOKER
			If that's the way you want it.

					COLEMAN
			That's the way I want it.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. A DIMLY LIT STREET - NIGHT

	It's late at night now.  Hooker and Eirie wander along the
	street together, not really ready to go home, but with no
	other ideas either.  Hooker, obviously preoccupied, idly
	strikes a match on a street lamp as he passes and lets it
	burn out.  He does this several times.

					HOOKER
			How do you like that Coleman, huh?
			After three years.

					EIRIE KID
			Aw come on, it was the only thing
			to do.  He knew he was holdin' ya
			back.

					HOOKER
			We were partners.  If it weren't
			for Luther I'd still be hustlin'
			pinball down at Gianelli's.  I
			don't need anything more than I got.

					HOOKER
			You ain't gonna have nothin' if you
			don't lay off them games of chance.
			There's a depression on ya know.

					HOOKER
			There's always a depression on.

					EIRIE KID
			If you saved a little, you wouldn't
			have to grift so much.

					HOOKER
			I like griftin'.

					EIRIE KID
			You could buy yourself some things.
			Clothes, or a nice car...

					HOOKER
			I don't look any good in clothes
			and I don't know how to drive.
			What else ya got to sell, Eirie?

					EIRIE KID
			Forget it.

	They walk on a few more feet, when suddenly a police car
	pulls up alongside them and two men jump out.  The first, a
	uniformed policeman, grabs Eirie around the neck.

	Hooker makes a break for it, but the second Figure, a burly
	detective named Snyder, tackles him in the middle of the
	street, drags him back into the alley and plasters him up
	against a brick wall.  The two have met before.

					HOOKER
			Hi there, Snyder.  Things a little
			slow down at the Bunco Department
			tonight, eh?  Somebody lose the
			dominoes?

					SNYDER
			You scored blood money today,
			Hooker.  You need a friend.

					HOOKER
				(knocking Snyder's
				hand away)
			Aw, find yourself a shoplifter to
			roll.

	Snyder gives Hooker a swift knee in the thigh and follows it
	with an elbow across the head.  Hooker flies into a row of
	boxes and garbage cans.

					HOOKER
				(getting up slowly)
			You got the wrong guy, pal.  I been
			home with the flu all day.
				(rising to a fuller height)
			You can stake out my toilet if you
			want.

	Bang.  Snyder, infuriated by Hooker's irreverence, slams him
	to the ground again.  The policeman is no longer holding
	Eirie but is almost daring him to make a move.  Eirie wants
	to go to Hooker's aid, but he knows the policeman will beat
	him to a pulp.

					SNYDER
				(pulling Hooker out
				of the heap and
				smashing him against
				the wall again)
			I'll tell ya what you did, smart
			boy.  You tied into a loaded mark
			on 47th across from Maxies.  You
			and Coleman played the switch for
			him and blew him off to a cab on
			49th.  If he hadn't been a numbers
			runner for Doyle Lonnegan, it
			woulda been perfect.

					HOOKER
				(startled by the information)
			You're crazy.  I'm not stupid
			enough to play for rackets money.

					SNYDER
			Not intentionally maybe, but that
			don't make no difference to Lonnegan.
			He'll swat you like any fly.

					HOOKER
			I'll square it with the fixer.

					SNYDER
			Nobody can buy you a prayer, if I
			put the finger on ya.

	Snyder lets go.  Hooker sinks back against the wall.  He
	says nothing; he's waiting for the price.

					SNYDER
			I figure your end of the score was
			at least 3 gees.  I want 2 no
			matter what it was.
	


					HOOKER
				(lying)
			My end was only one.

					SNYDER
				(not taking the fake)
			Then you'll have to come up with
			another grand somewhere.

	Hooker is beat and he knows it.

					HOOKER
			All right.

	He reaches into his coat, pulls out a stack of bills and
	counts out $2000 to Snyder.  Eirie looks on in amazement; he
	didn't think Hooker had it.

					SNYDER
				(pocketing the money
				and motioning his
				partner to put his
				gun away)
			You're a smart egg, Hooker.  No use
			dyin' for 2 grand.

	Snyder and his policeman friend get in their car and start
	down the street.  Hooker and Eirie walk nonchalantly in the
	other direction.

					EIRIE KID
			I thought you blew all your money.

					HOOKER
			I did.  That stuff I gave him was
			counterfeit.  They'll pinch him the
			first place he tries to spend it.

	Snyder and his partner disappear around a corner.  Hooker
	suddenly takes off like a shot.

	INT. DRUGSTORE - NIGHT

	He runs into a drugstore and goes to the phone booth.
	There's already a woman in it.  Hooker rips open the door
	and throws her out.  Hurriedly, he begins to dial.

					EIRIE KID
				(standing outside the booth)
			What the hell you gonna do when
			Snyder rushes his finger right to
			Lonnegan?  You're committin'
			suicide, kid.

					HOOKER
				(waiting for the ring)
			Aw Christ, it doesn't make no
			difference now.  If Snyder knows
			about it so does everybody else.
			He never gets anything first...Damn,
			there's no answer at Luther's.

					EIRIE KID
			Listen to me, Hooker.  What ever
			you do, don't go back to your place
			tonight, don't go anyplace you
			usually go, ya hear me?  Get outa
			town or somethin', but...

	Hooker, still getting no answer, slams the phone down and
	blasts out of the booth.

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT

	Eirie chases him frantically, calling him to come back, but
	he's giving away too many years and there's no stopping
	Hooker at this point.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT - SHOTS OF HOOKER

	Pumping down the street.

	EXT. LUTHER'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

	Hooker races into Luther's brownstone, charges up to the
	third floor.

	INT. LUTHER'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

	Hooker runs up through a small group of people on the stairs.
	He bursts into Luther's room, the door of which is already
	open.  The room shows signs of a struggle, a turned-over
	chair, a broken lamp, but there is no Coleman.  Hooker goes
	slowly to the window.  He looks down into the courtyard and
	then suddenly sprints back out the door.  As we hear him
	scrambling down the stairs, the camera dollies to the window
	and looks out.

	EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT

	There on the concrete below, face down, is the body of
	Luther Coleman.  Hooker races out to it and kneels down.

					HOOKER
				(shaking the body)
			C'mon Luther, get up.  You gotta
			get up, Luther.

	In the distance, sirens are heard.  Heads are out of the
	windows and some people are starting to gather in the
	courtyard.

					HOOKER (CONT'D)
			Goddamn you, Luther, will you get
			up?
				(pounding on the body)
			I'm not waitin' for you, Luther.
			I'm not waitin' anymore.  Get up,
			you son of a bitch.  Goddamn you,
			Luther, goddamn.

	The sirens are close now, and Hooker tears himself away from
	Luther and runs.  The others gather to look at the body.

								FADE OUT.

	FADE IN:

	THE SET-UP

								FADE OUT.

	FADE IN:

	INT. THE TRAIN STATION - DAY

	We open on Hooker sleeping in some remote corner of the
	station, covered with newspapers for warmth, and barely
	distinguishable from the clutter of junk surrounding him.  A
	station security officer, on his morning sweep, wanders by
	and delivers a terrific blow to the soles of Hooker's feet
	with a nightstick.  Hooker jolts awake with a cry of pain,
	as the officer diffidently moves on toward another sleeping
	victim.

	Tired and sore from his night in the station, Hooker
	struggles to his feet and attempts to take stock of the
	situation.  He tries to smooth the wrinkles out of his suit,
	but it's futile.  A quick check of his wallet finds it as
	empty as he'd remembered it.

								CUT TO:

	THE STATION - GIFT SHOP - DAY

	Hooker walks in and goes to the toy section.  He looks
	through several small novelties, till he finds what he's
	looking for -- a little tin replica of a policeman's badge.
	He looks around for station detectives, and seeing none,
	slips the badge into his pocket.

								CUT TO:

	THE STATION - WASHROOM - DAY

	Hooker rinses out his mouth, towels off his face and slicks
	his hair back with water.  It's a drop in the bucket, but it
	seems to revitalize him a little.

								CUT TO:

	STATION - HALLWAY - DAY

	We see Hooker removing a sign from a door, but the angle
	prohibits us from reading it.

	INT. STATION - DAY

	He drops the sign in a waste can and walks out into the
	crowded passenger lobby.  After scanning the area carefully
	for a minute, he goes up to a conservative young business
	man, who's busy reading the schedule board.

					HOOKER
				(flashing open his
				wallet to reveal the
				little tin badge and
				then closing it again quickly)
			Excuse me, sir.  Treasury Dept...
			I'd like to ask you a few questions.

					MAN
				(flustered)
			What for?  I haven't done anything.

					HOOKER
			We don't doubt that, but there's a
			counterfeiting operation passing
			bad money in the station.  Have you
			made any purchases here today?

					MAN
				(reluctantly)
			Yes, a ticket to Chicago.
	


					HOOKER
			Then I'm afraid we'll have to
			impound your money until we're sure
			that it's all good.  Can I see your
			wallet and your ticket, please?

					MAN
				(handing them over)
			But I got a train to make.

					HOOKER
				(taking out the money
				and returning the wallet)
			It'll only take 20 minutes or so.
			You can pick it up at the window
			down the hall.

					MAN
			But what about all these other
			people?

					HOOKER
				(blowing up)
			We'll get 'em!  Give us a chance.
			I'm not the only agent in here, ya
			know.  We go around advertising
			ourselves, how many counterfeiters
			do you think we'd catch, huh?
				(pointing to his suit)
			You think I'm wearin' this rag here
			'cause I like it?  Christ, everybody
			thinks life's a holiday or somethin'
			when you got a badge.
				(pouring it on)
			I been here since three this
			morning, Charlie, and I never knew
			there was so much ugliness in
			people.  You try to help 'em and
			they spit on you.  I shoulda let ya
			go and gotten yourself arrested for
			passin' false notes.

	The Businessman is totally shamed.

					MAN
			I'm sorry, really I am, but my
			train leaves in ten minutes.

					HOOKER
			All right, I'll give ya a break.
				(pointing to a hall)
			Down that hall there, there's an
			unmarked door on the left.  Go on
			in there and wait at the window.
			I'll take this...
				(he holds up the money)
			...in the back and run it through
			right away.  We'll have you outta
			there in a couple minutes.

					MAN
			Thank you.  You don't know how much
			I appreciate this.

					HOOKER
				(with a little wave)
			Think nothin' of it.

	The man goes off down the hall, more than grateful to be
	given a break like this.  Hooker heads for the "back".  We
	follow the Man down the hall to the unmarked door.  He
	strides on through to find himself face to face with a wall
	of busily flushing urinals.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. STATION - DAY - HOOKER

	Boarding the 8:10 for Chicago.

								CUT TO:

	INT. STATION - DAY

	The Man wandering up and down the hall, wondering how he
	could have missed that room.

	EXT. CHICAGO STREET - DAY

	The street runs along side an elevated train track.  We pick
	up Hooker coming down the street, eating a hot dog he bought
	with the money he just earned in the train station.

	He appears to be looking for an address, referring every now
	and then to the piece of paper Luther gave him the night
	before.  Finally he stops in front of an old three-story
	building which contains a carousel on the bottom 2 floors
	and what appear to be apartments on the third floor.  He
	peers inside the big, sliding glass doors and seeing no sign
	of life, goes around to the side to look for a way in.

	A 35 year-old woman, Billie, appears in her bathrobe on the
	second floor landing and descends the stairs to get the
	morning paper.  She's eating an apple.  Although she has
	just gotten up and looks it, she has the presence of one who
	is probably quite striking at other hours.  The sight of
	Hooker fazes her not at all.

					HOOKER
			Excuse me, I'm looking for a guy
			named Henry Gondorff.  You know him?

					BILLIE
				(starting back up the stairs)
			No.

					HOOKER
			Luther Coleman sent me.

	Billie stops and comes back down the stairs.  It's the first
	time she's stopped chewing.

					BILLIE
				(checking him out)
			You Hooker?

					HOOKER
			Yeh.

					BILLIE
			Why didn't you say so.  I thought
			maybe you was a copper or somethin'.

	She goes to a side door and unlocks it.

					BILLIE
			It's the room in the back.  He
			wasn't expecting you so soon though.

	Hooker's not quite sure what that means, but there's
	something about Billie that makes him know that you don't ask.

	INT. CAROUSEL - DAY

	Hooker walks past the now motionless carousel to the room in
	the back and knocks on the door.  No answer.  He gives the
	door a little push and it swings open.

	INT. GONDORFF'S ROOM - DAY

	The room inside if small and cluttered, consisting of a bed,
	a sink, and a bathroom, all covered by a layer of books,
	dirty clothes and beer bottles.  Draped over a chair, fully
	dressed, but completely passed out is the one and only Henry
	Gondorff.

					HOOKER
				(to himself)
			The great Henry Gondorff.

								CUT TO:

	INT. A SHOWER - DAY

	Water blasting out of the fixture.  We see Gondorff, still
	fully clothed, sitting in the bottom of the shower, the
	spray streaming off his face.  An imposing figure, with deep
	set eyes and full beard, he just sits there stoically,
	looking like a soggy lumberjack.  Hooker, sitting on the
	floor between the toilet and the sink, watches listlessly.
	Finally --

					GONDORFF
			Turn the goddamn thing off, will ya.

					HOOKER
			You sober?

					GONDORFF
			I can talk, can't I?

	Hooker makes no move to get up.  Gondorff struggles to his
	knees, turns off the water, and slumps back against the wall.
	The two men just look past each other a second.  Down in the
	bottom.

					GONDORFF
			Glad to meet ya, kid.  You're a
			real horse's ass.

					HOOKER
			Yeh, Luther said you could teach me
			something.  I already know how to
			drink.

	Gondorff wipes his face with his hand.  His mood softens a
	little.

					GONDORFF
				(quietly)
			I'm sorry about Luther.  He was the
			best street worker I ever saw.

					HOOKER
			He had you down as a big-timer.
			What happened?

					GONDORFF
			Aw, I conned a Senator from Florida
			on a stocks deal.  A real lop-ear.
			He thought he was gonna take over
			General Electric.  Some Chantoozie
			woke him up, though, and he put the
			feds on me.

					HOOKER
			You mean you blew it.

					GONDORFF
				(pause)
			Luther didn't tell me you had a big
			mouth.

					HOOKER
			He didn't tell me you was a fuck-
			up, either.
				(Gondorff looks at
				him coldly)
			You played the Big Con since then.

					GONDORFF
			No, I lammed it around for a while
			while things cooled off.  Philly,
			Denver, Baltimore, nuthin' towns.

	Hooker's disappointment is obvious.

					GONDORFF
			But don't kid yourself, friend, I
			still know how.

	Hooker nods, unconvinced.

					GONDORFF
				(getting up from the
				floor and emptying
				the water out of his pockets)
			You gonna stay for breakfast, or do
			you already know how to eat?

					HOOKER
				(tired)
			I picked something up on the way.

					GONDORFF
				(sensing something)
			Lonnegan after you, too?

					HOOKER
			I don't know.  Haven't seen anybody.

					GONDORFF
			You never do, kid.

	We go to Hooker.  He hadn't thought of that.

	EXT. A BEAUTIFUL OLD COLONIAL COUNTRY CLUB - LONG ISLAND -
	DAY

	Lonnegan, in plus fours and argyles sits on a bench as other
	members of his foursome tee off.  Floyd comes up to him.

					FLOYD
			We got word from Chicago.  They got
			one of the grifters last night.
			The nigger.

					LONNEGAN
			What about the other one?

					FLOYD
			They're still looking for him.

					LONNEGAN
			Who's got the contract?

					FLOYD
			Combs gave it to Reilly and Cole.

					LONNEGAN
			Hackers.

					FLOYD
			They staked out the other guy's
			place last night, but he never
			showed.  They figure maybe he
			skipped town.  You wanna follow 'em
			up?

	Lonnegan regards Floyd patiently and then pats the bench
	beside him.  Floyd sits gingerly.

					LONNEGAN
			You see the guy in the red sweater
			over there?

	We cut to one of Lonnegan's foursome, a short, squat little
	Irishman in a red sweater.  He was a good-time, friendly
	manner and a winning Irish smile.  We like him immediately.

					LONNEGAN
			Name's Danny McCoy.  No Neck McCoy
			we called him.  Runs a few
			protection rackets for Carnello
			while he's waiting for something
			bigger to come along.  Me and Danny
			been friends since we were six.
			Take a good look at that face,
			Floyd, cause if he ever finds out
			we let one lousy grifter beat us,
			you'll have to kill him and every
			other hood in Chicago who'd like to
			do the same thing.  You understand
			what I'm sayin'?

					FLOYD
			Yes sir.

					LONNEGAN
			Good lad.

	Lonnegan is called to the tee by one of his foursome.  He
	exchanges a friendly smile with McCoy and belts the ball
	down the fairway.

								CUT TO:

	INT. THE CAROUSEL AGAIN - DAY

	Gondorff, dried off now and in a new set of clothes, is
	pulling up the shades of the large facing windows of the
	carousel building.  The morning light pours in, illuminating
	fully for the first time the ornate merry-go-round and its
	massive oaken horses.  Hooker watches him go about his
	business.  Billie calls down from the mezzanine which
	surrounds the carousel.

					BILLIE
			You feeling all right this morning,
			Henry?

					GONDORFF
			Fine, Billie.

					BILLIE
			You mind opening the round a little
			early today?  We got some business
			coming in before hours.

	Gondorff waves okay.

					GONDORFF
				(to Hooker)
			Great little countess, that Billie.
			Runs a good house up there, too.
			One of the few left that Luciano
			doesn't own.

	Gondorff walks around on the carousel, checking straps,
	bearing and poles.  Hooker follows him.

					HOOKER
				(getting impatient)
			Gondorff, you gonna teach me the
			Big Con or not?

					GONDORFF
				(on his back, checking
				underneath one of the horses)
			You didn't act much like you wanted
			to learn it.

					HOOKER
			I wanna play for Lonnegan.

					GONDORFF
				(getting up)
			You know anything about him?

					HOOKER
				(exploding)
			Yeh, he croaked Luther.  What else
			do I gotta know.

	Gondorff just sits tight and waits for him to cool off.

					HOOKER
				(waving Gondorff off,
				embarrassed at his
				own outburst)
			Aw right, he runs the numbers outta
			the south side.

					GONDORFF
				(going over to start
				the machinery)
			And a packing company, a chain of
			Savings and Loans and half the
			politicians in Chicago and New York.
			There ain't a fix in the world
			gonna cool him out if he blows on ya.

					HOOKER
			I'll take him anyway.

					GONDORFF
				(whirling on him)
			Why?

					HOOKER
				(like steel)
			'Cause I don't know enough about
			killin' to kill him.

	It's the right answer. Gondorff didn't know it himself until
	now.

					GONDORFF
			You can't do it alone, ya know.  It
			takes a mob of guys like you and
			enough money to make 'em look good.

					HOOKER
			We'll get by without 'em.

					GONDORFF
			This isn't like playin' winos on
			the street.  You gotta do more than
			outrun the guy.

					HOOKER
				(incensed)
			I never played for winos.

					GONDORFF
				(going right on,
				ignoring Hooker's remark)
			You gotta keep Lonnegan's con, even
			after you spent his money.  And no
			matter how much you take from his,
			he'll get more.

					HOOKER
			You're sacred of 'em, aren't ya?

					GONDORFF
			Right down to my socks, turkey.  If
			I'da been half as scared a that
			lop-ear, I wouldn't a fallen asleep
			on 'em.  Lonnegan might kill me,
			but at least he won't bore me to
			death.

					HOOKER
			Then you'll do it?

					GONDORFF
			If I can find a mob that'll risk it.
			But no matter what happens, I don't
			want you comin' back to me halfway
			through and sayin' it's not enough...
			cause it's all you got.

	Hooker nods.  Gondorff switches on the carousel and steps
	back to admire his handiwork.  The carousel makes a grinding
	sound, does a few lurches and stops cold.

								CUT TO:

	Music begins and we are into a short:

	MONTAGE SEQUENCE

	Detailing the arrival of the others three members of
	Gondorff's "mob." Throughout, Gondorff wears the fedora hat
	which is his trademark.  We begin with --

	A tall, good-looking man, Kid Twist, making his way through
	the railway station.  Impeccably dressed and carrying a
	small suitcase, he combs the terrain carefully with his eyes.
	Finally he catches a glimpse of the thing he's been looking
	for.  It's Gondorff, standing by a newsstand.  Gondorff
	makes a quick snubbing motion on his nose as if flicking off
	a gnat.  This is known among con men as the "office." Twist
	returns the sign with a barely discernible smile as he walks
	on by.  Con men rarely acknowledge each other openly in
	public, but it's obvious that these two are glad to see each
	other.

								CUT TO:

	INT. BARBER SHOP - DAY

	Hooker in, having his hair cut and his nails manicured.
	Gondorff gives instructions to the barber.

								CUT TO:

	INT. HABERDASHERY - DAY

	Hooker is modeling a new suit in front of a mirror.  He
	doesn't look too pleased, but Gondorff peels out a bankroll
	anyway.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. HOTEL - DAY

	A pair of white spats stepping off a bus.  We follow them
	into a:

	INT. HOTEL LOBBY

	Where we tilt up to reveal J.J. Singleton, the most
	flamboyant of the bunch.  On his way to the check-in desk,
	he silently exchanges the "office" with Gondorff, who is
	sitting on a lounge reading the paper.

								CUT TO:

	INT. APARTMENT - DAY

	Hooker being shown into a small apartment room by an old
	woman.  It consists of a bed, a table and a sink.  Hooker
	nods his acceptance to the woman and gives her a bill.  He
	takes another look around the room and decides to go out
	somewhere, but first he wedges a small piece of paper
	between the door and the jamb, about an inch off the floor.

								CUT TO:

	INT. A BIG METROPOLITAN BANK - DAY

	We hold on a slight, bespectacled teller, Eddie Niles, in
	the process of counting a large deposit.  Niles is all
	business; if he's ever smiled, no one knows about it.  He
	glances up for a second and sees Gondorff "officing" him
	from across the bank.  Without a word he shoves the money
	he's been counting back into the hands of a startled
	customer, abruptly closes up his window, flips his
	identification tag on the manager's desk and walks out of
	the bank.

								CUT TO:

	INT. AN UPSTAIRS ROOM OF THE CAROUSEL BUILDING - NIGHT

	This room has obviously been relegated to the status of the
	storage room.  It contains the water heater, mops and
	brooms, old bed springs, etc.  In the middle of the room a
	space has been cleared for a table, around which are seated
	Hooker, Gondorff, Niles, Singleton and Twist.  Gondorff is
	in his T-shirt, but still wears his hat.  Kid Twist is in a
	suit as usual.  The room is illuminated by a single bare
	bulb hanging from the ceiling.

					TWIST
				(showing Hooker
				photographs of three men)
			These are Combs' favorite torpedoes.
			Riley and Cole.

	We recognize Riley and Cole as the two guys who got into
	Mottola's cab.

					TWIST
			They do most of the small jobs, but
			Lonnegan might not wanna use 'em on
			you 'cause they're kinda messy.  No
			class.

	We go to Hooker.  He's real grateful.  Billie, wearing an
	evening dress, enters the room and begins gathering up the
	empty beer mugs on the table.

					TWIST
			We got reason to believe Riley was
			the guy who hit Luther.  But if you
			see either one of these two, find
			yourself a crowd, or take 'em
			someplace you know you can handle
			'em.

					GONDORFF
			But most of all let us know.  If
			they got a hit on you, we gotta
			fold up the con.  You're too
			exposed.  You got that?

	Hooker nods, but we know he hasn't really got that.

					HOOKER
			You sure it'll be one of these two?

					TWIST
			No.  They're just the only ones we
			know of.

	Billie has finished  gathering the mugs, and leaves the room
	with them.  We follow her down the hall and into the:

	RECEIVING ROOM OF HER BROTHEL

	Carousel music filters up from the arcade below.  The room
	has a bar along one wall and the rest of the space is taken
	up by tables and couches.  It's a comfortable place, but not
	opulent.  Some of the girls sit patiently on the couches,
	others play canasta at the tables.  Most of the men are at
	the bar, fortifying themselves for the task at hand.  Billie
	comes over to the bar.

					BILLIE
				(to the bartender)
			Set me up five more beers, will ya
			Danny.

	As Danny goes to fill the mugs, Billie's eyes fix on a man
	at the end of the bar.

	We move to reveal Snyder, intently scanning the room, as if
	he'd lost a dancing partner in the crush.  Not finding what
	he wants, he comes down the bar to Billie.

					SNYDER
			You the owner here?

					BILLIE
			That's right.

					SNYDER
				(flipping out his badge)
			Lieutenant Snyder.  Bunco.

					BILLIE
			Joliet badge, Snyder.  Don't cut
			much up here.

					SNYDER
				(trying to ignore her remark)
			I'm lookin' for a guy on the lam
			from a counterfeiting rap.  Thought
			he mighta come in here.

					BILLIE
			Don't think so.  I know everybody
			in the place and I always bounce
			the lamsters.

					SNYDER
			All right if I look around your
			lobby?

					BILLIE
			No, but you're welcome to a free
			beer before you go.

	Billie grabs a bottle of beer, pours some in a shot glass
	and pushes it over to Snyder.  He ignores the gesture.

					SNYDER
				(with controlled force)
			I don't really need your permission.

	We go to Billie.  She knew that when he came in.

								CUT TO:

	THE STORAGE ROOM AGAIN

	The discussion continues.  Hooker, a bit out of his depth
	here, listens and stays silent.

					SINGLETON
			Lonnegan's a fast egg, Henry.  He's
			not gonna sit still for a standard
			play.

					GONDORFF
			Everybody'll sit still for somethin'.
			What did ya find out about the
			train, Eddie?

					NILES
			He's been taking the 8:10 Century
			Limited outa New York on Friday and
			getting in here early Saturday
			morning.  He usually stays a day to
			check on his policy operations, and
			then flies back.

					GONDORFF
			Wonder why he doesn't fly both ways.

					NILES
			The porters say he runs a braced
			card game in one of the cars.  $100
			minimum, straight poker.  Last time
			he pulled in here ten grand heavier
			than he left New York.

					GONDORFF
			Fancies himself a gambler, huh?

					TWIST
			Lotta plungers ride that train just
			to play him.

					GONDORFF
				(breaking into a smile)
			See J.J., he's slowly down already.

								CUT TO:

	THE RECEIVING ROOM AGAIN

	Snyder has completed his inspection of the "lobby" and found
	nothing.  Danny, meanwhile, has set up the five beers on a
	tray.

					SNYDER
			Which way are the rooms?

					BILLIE
			Who told ya this guy was in here?

					SNYDER
			Nobody.  I just know what kinda
			women he likes.  I'm gonna check
			all the joyhouses till I find him.

					BILLIE
			Maybe I could help ya if ya told me
			his name.

					SNYDER
			I think I'll keep that to myself.
			Which way are the rooms?

					BILLIE
			Right through there.  But I wouldn't
			go in there if I were you.
				(picks up the tray)


					SNYDER
				(snidely)
			What are ya gonna do, call the cops?

					BILLIE
			I don't have to.  You'll be bustin'
			in on the Chief of Police just up
			the hall.
				(she exits with the drinks)


	Snyder is stopped cold.  He calls after her.

					SNYDER
			Keep your nose clean, lady.  He
			can't spend all his time here.

								CUT TO:

	THE STORAGE ROOM AGAIN

	Billie comes over to Gondorff and whispers in his ear, while
	the others talk.  His eyes flick momentarily to Hooker.

					SINGLETON
			I think we ought to play him on the
			Rag.  It's the tightest game we
			got, and it's not all over the
			papers yet.

					NILES
			No good, J.J.  You're not gonna con
			stocks to a banker.  Lonnegan's too
			smart for that.
	


					TWIST
			What are you going to do, con the
			payoff to a gambler?

					SNYDER
			Twist is right.  It won't work.

	Gondorff has nodded to Billie and now rejoins the
	conversation.  She serves the others beer.

					GONDORFF
			We'll use the wire.  Never known a
			gambler who wouldn't like to beat
			the ponies.

					NILES
			The wire is ten years outa date.

					GONDORFF
			That's why he won't know it.

					SINGLETON
			I'm not sure I know it.

					GONDORFF
			We'll give him the hook on the
			train, and play him here.  You
			think I can get in that poker game,
			Eddie?

					NILES
			All you gotta do is show up with
			some money and look like a fool.

					GONDORFF
			I also gotta win.

	He looks at Hooker.  There is a challenge in their book.
	Gondorff smiles broadly, then casually, to them all.

					GONDORFF
			By the way, any of you guys been
			passing off any green goods lately?

	We go around the table.  No reply.

					GONDORFF
			Billie, if that Dick comes in
			again, stall him till I can get a
			look at him.  And let me pay ya for
			these beers.

					BILLIE
			What are you talking about?  It's
			on the house.

					GONDORFF
				(pulling out a $5 bill)
			Naw, I want ya to have this.

	He hitches up Billie's skirt, and puts the bill in her garter.

					GONDORFF
			Don't look at it till ya go to bed
			though or it'll turn to paper.

	Billie smiles and leaves the room.

	INT. HALLWAY

	She walks halfway down the hall and stops.  She can't wait.
	Lifting up her skirt, she finds that the five has indeed
	turned to paper.  As she breaks into laughter and continues
	on down the hall, we:

								FADE OUT.

	FADE IN:

	THE HOOK

								FADE OUT.

	FADE IN:

	EXT. A SUNKEN ALLEY - DAY

	Actually little more than a service area between two
	apartment buildings.  Niles, Kid Twist, and a middle-aged
	black man, named Benny Garfield, enter the alley with an old
	man and follow him down a stairwell to a subterranean
	basement.  A faded sign above the door says Stenner's
	Billiards.  We follow them inside to a:

	INT. A LARGE BARREN ROOM - DAY

	An office comes off it at one end.  Judging from the
	fluorescent lights overhead and the scattered cue racks
	which still hang tenuously on the walls, the place, indeed,
	used to be a pool hall.  Niles and Garfield go all the way
	to the back, while Twist stays near the front with the old
	man.

					NILES
			Looks all right.  It's big enough
			and off the street.

					GARFIELD
			I don't know.  This is kinda short
			notice.  I'm not sure we can get it
			all done by Saturday.

					NILES
			Got to.  Gondorff's ridin' the mark
			in from New York on the Century.

	Garfield thinks it over a little.  He's taking another look
	at the place.  We go to Twist and the old man by the door.

					TWIST
			We'll take it.
				(pointing through the door)
			You manage the building at the end
			of the alley?

					OLD MAN
				(with pride)
			For fifteen years.

					TWIST
			I'll need a room over there that
			faces this way.  How much a week?

					OLD MAN
			Only rents by the month.  Two
			hundred and fifty for the two of
			them.

					TWIST
				(pulling out his wallet)
			This is the last time I expect to
			see you down here.

					OLD MAN
				(watching the bills
				being counted into
				his hand)
			Never heard of the place.

	We go back to Niles and Garfield.

					GARFIELD
			Been a while since I stocked a wire
			store.  Not many mobs playing that
			anymore.

					NILES
			All we need is the bookie setup for
			now.  We'll worry about the
			telegraph office later.

					GARFIELD
			All right, I'll rent ya everything
			I got in the warehouse for two
			grand.  That'll give ya phones,
			cages, blackboards and ticker gear.
			You supply the guys to move 'em.
			If you want a counter and bar,
			that's another grand.  I don't know
			where the hell I'm gonna get 'em
			though.

					NILES
			C'mon, you can do better than that.
			We ain't no heel grifters.

					GARFIELD
			You want the stuff tomorrow or
			don't ya?  It's gonna take hours
			just to clean it up.
				(pause)
			Besides, Gondorff's still a hot
			item.  Where am I gonna be if he
			gets hit?

					NILES
			Just give us what ya can, Benny.
			We'll send a truck down.

	Twist has rejoined them by now.

					TWIST
				(to Garfield)
			You wanna work flat rate or
			percentage?

					GARFIELD
			Who's the mark?

					TWIST
			Doyle Lonnegan.

					GARFIELD
			Flat rate.

								CUT TO:

	INT. A NEW YORK TRAIN STATION - DAY

	We pick up Doyle Lonnegan, accompanied by two bodyguards and
	Floyd, making his way through the station.  He stops at a
	cigar counter to buy some cigarettes, and we reveal Gondorff
	and Hooker sitting on their suitcases on the other side of
	the room.

					GONDORFF
				(eyes fixed on Lonnegan)
			Guy in the blue pinstripe and grey
			fedora.

	Hooker looks and finally spots him in the crowd.  We go back
	to Lonnegan, as he moves off from the cigar counter, toward
	his train.  Hooker watches him with the intensity of one
	gazing on a religious object.

					HOOKER
			He's not as tough as he'd like to
			think.

					GONDORFF
				(picking up his suitcase)
			Neither are we.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. TRAIN

	Lonnegan and his retainers getting on the train.  Two cars
	down the line, we see Hooker and Gondorff boarding also.  On
	his way in, Gordorff takes the conductor aside.

					GONDORFF
			I hear there's a friendly poker
			game on this train tonight.  You
			know anything about that?

					CONDUCTOR
			A little.

					GONDORFF
			You think you could get me in that
			game?

					CONDUCTOR
			I don't know.  There's usually a
			waiting list.

	Gondorff flashes a $50 bill.

					CONDUCTOR
				(loosening up a bit)
			That'll get you first alternate, sir.

	Gondorff pulls out another fifty.
	


					CONDUCTOR
				(taking the money)
			I'll see what I can do.

								CUT TO:

	INT. A BASEMENT BAR - EARLY EVENING

	Kid Twist enters and threads his way through the maze of
	tables to a door at the back of the building.  A large bull
	of a man is stationed there, obviously to discourage those
	who don't have credentials to enter.  Twist is not such a man.

					TWIST
				(going right on through)
			How ya doin', Lacey.

					LACEY
				(innocently pleased
				for one so menacing)
			Good to see ya again, Twist.

	INT. ANOTHER ROOM - EARLY EVENING

	Inside is another room, this one much better lit than the
	outer one.  There are only three tables in here, around
	which are seated the elite of the Con World.  Twist is
	enthusiastically greeted by Duke Boudreau, a large, rotund
	man whose stylish dress and authoritative manner mark him as
	a powerful figure in this group.

					BOUDREAU
			Twist!  When did you get back in
			town?

					TWIST
			Coupla days ago.  I'm workin' a big
			one with Gondorff on the North Side.

	The two men sit down together, apart from the others.

					TWIST
			Listen Duke, we're setting up a
			wire store.  I need a twenty man
			boost right away.

					BOUDREAU
			I got twenty or so in here tonight.
			Take your pick.

					TWIST
			These guys have gotta be the quill,
			Duky.  We can't afford to rank the
			joint.

					BOUDREAU
				(to one of his assistants)
			Get me the sheet, Jake.  Let's see
			who's in town.

								CUT TO:

	THE OUTER PART OF THE BAR AGAIN

	A silhouetted figure appears in the entrance doorway.  The
	word "chill" races from table to table and the place falls
	still.  The bartender pushes a button behind the bar and a
	buzzer goes off in the back room.  Boudreau gets up from his
	table and opens a small viewing port in the door.

	The silhouetted figure is now walking slowly past the silent
	tables.  It's Snyder and he's checking out every face in the
	place.

					BOUDREAU
			Twist, you know this guy?

					TWIST
				(taking a look
				through the viewing port)
			No.  Never saw him before.  He's a
			dick, though.

	Snyder walks all the way to the back, and then retraces his
	route.  About halfway back, he stops at one of the tables,
	recognizing a grifter he knows.  It's the Eirie Kid.

					EIRIE KID
			Hello, Snyder.  What are you doin'
			up here?

					SNYDER
			I'm on vacation.  You seen your
			friend lately?

					EIRIE KID
			Yeh, he packed it in and enrolled
			in detective school.

	Snyder, in no mood for jokes, grabs Eirie by the hair and
	slams his face into the table.  Eirie just stays there; he
	knows it doesn't pay to assault a detective.  Twist is
	watching all this intently from the viewing port.

					SNYDER
			You see him, you tell him to pay
			his debts before I get him.

	Eirie raises his head slowly, but says nothing.  There is a
	slight trickle of blood from his nose.  Snyder turns and
	walks slowly out of the bar.  When he is a safe distance
	down the street, the chatter and drinking resume.

								CUT TO:

	THE INSIDE ROOM AGAIN

	Twist gives an all clear signal and returns to the table
	where he and Boudreau were talking.  Boudreau reads from a
	list of names.  Twist listens with a certain preoccupation.
	He's still thinking about the little confrontation he just
	witnessed.

					BOUDREAU
			Paltrow, Sterling, Furey, and the
			Big Alabama are in from New Orleans.
			Fiskin and the Boone Kid from
			Denver, and Phillips, Barnett and
			Limehouse Chappie from New York.
			Those and the guys outside should
			give ya 30 or so to choose from.

					TWIST
			Good, have 'em down at Stenner's
			old Pool Hall before 3:00.  We're
			gonna run through the route tonight.

					BOUDREAU
			Okay, Twist, but you know if this
			blows up, I can't do ya no good
			downtown.  Gondorff is Federal.

					TWIST
			Don't worry about it, pal.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. SPEEDING PASSENGER TRAIN - NIGHT

	Ripping through an open stretch between New York and Chicago.

								CUT TO:

	INT. TRAIN - NIGHT

	Singleton is walking down a passageway and stops at a door
	and goes in.

	INT. GONDORFF'S COMPARTMENT - NIGHT

	Gondorff is rapidly shuffling cards to four empty places.
	He is alone.  He looks up as Singleton enters.

					SINGLETON
			You in?

					GONDORFF
			Yeh, I think so.  I gave the kay-
			ducer a C-note.  You find out the
			deck?

					SINGLETON
			He usually plays with a Royal or a
			Cadenza.
				(handing him two
				sealed decks)
			I got you one of each.  He likes to
			cold deck low, 8's or 9's.

					GONDORFF
			Nice work, J.J.

	Singleton slips out as Gondorff unpeels the packs.

	INT. TRAIN - NIGHT

	We pick up Lonnegan coming out of his compartment, flanked
	by only one bodyguard and Floyd.  He starts through the
	passenger section toward the compartment where the poker
	game will be held.  Suddenly a drunken woman comes staggering
	around the corner and bumps into him.

	They grapple a moment and Lonnegan pushes her away in disgust.

					WOMAN
				(sloppy drunk)
			Keep your mitts off me, ya big lug.
			If I'da wanted you handlin' me I
			woulda asked ya.

	Lonnegan ignores her and proceeds down the passageway.  As
	the woman proceeds in the other direction between passengers,
	we see it is Billie.  She drops something on a seat beside a
	passenger.  A hand reaches to pick it up.  It is Lonnegan's
	wallet and it is Hooker who picks it up.

	Hooker waits a moment, then stands and goes in the direction
	Lonnegan has taken.  He passes by the open door to the card
	room, hesitating only slightly to hear the greetings
	exchanged inside before the door is shut.  Then he continues
	on into the next car.  He turns into Gondorff's compartment.

								CUT TO:

	INT. GONDORFF'S COMPARTMENT - NIGHT

	Gondorff is still practicing.  He looks up as Hooker enters
	and tosses him the wallet.

					HOOKER
			She got him clean.  He hasn't
			missed it.

	Gondorff nods, takes the money out, counts it.

					GONDORFF
			Fifteen grand.  Looks like he's
			expecting a big night.

	He takes out his own wallet and puts the money in it, and
	tosses the empty wallet back to Hooker, and resumes his
	shuffling and dealing.  Hooker sits back silently and
	watches him.

					HOOKER
			He's waitin' for you in the card
			room.

					GONDORFF
			Let him wait.

	As he deals, on the second pass he attempts to cut from the
	bottom, muffs it completely and sprays half the deck on the
	table.  Hooker regards him steadily as he gathers them back
	up.  Gondorff finally meets his gaze.

					GONDORFF
			You just worry about your end, kid.

					HOOKER
			If we ever get to it.

								CUT TO:

	INT. THE POKER ROOM - NIGHT

	A specially outfitted compartment with a table and chairs in
	the middle and leather cushions around the outside for
	kibitzers.  Lonnegan and 3 other players are already there
	and seated.  They're getting slightly impatient.

					LONNEGAN
				(to the Conductor)
			Where the hell is this guy?

					CONDUCTOR
			I don't know.  He said he'd be here.

								CUT TO:

	GONDORFF'S CABIN AGAIN

	Gondorff is standing in front of the mirror dressing.  He
	grabs up a clean white shirt and rumples it up in his hands.
	He then picks up a half-full bottle of bourbon.  Hooker
	gives him a disapproving look.  Gondorff smiles and pats
	some on his face.

								CUT TO:

	THE POKER ROOM AGAIN

	Everybody's itchy now.

					LONNEGAN
			All right, let's start without him.
			Mr. Clemens, give me the cards.

	The Conductor hands him a sealed deck.  As he begins to open
	it, Gordoff comes into the room, coatless, rumpled, unshaven
	and looking slightly tipsy.  The others at the table, all
	men of high school or financial standing, are somewhat put
	off.

					GONDORFF
			Sorry I'm late boys.  I was takin'
			a crap.

	This bit of grossness does little to improve his image.

					CONDUCTOR
				(making the
				introductions;
				referring first to Gondorff)
			Mr. Shaw is a bookmaker from
			Chicago.  Mr. Shaw, meet Mr.
			Clayton from Pittsburgh, Mr.
			Jameson, Chicago, Mr. Lonnegan, New
			York and Mr. Lombard, Philadelphia.

	Gondorff nods and takes a seat, none too gracefully.

					CONDUCTOR
			Straight poker, gentlemen.  100
			dollar minimum, table stakes.  We
			assume you're good for your debts.

					LONNEGAN
				(shuffling the cards)
			Mr. Shaw, we usually require a tie
			at this table.  If you don't have
			one, we can get ya one.

					GONDORFF
			Yeh, that'd be real nice of ya, Mr.
			Lonneman.

					LONNEGAN
				(irritated)
			Lonnegan.

	He begins to deal, obviously not pleased that his evening
	seems to be peopled with drunks.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. THE SUNKEN ALLEY - NIGHT

	A truck is now parked at the end of the alley, and several
	workmen are busy unloading it.  One group carries a large
	blackboard; others have boxes of glasses, ash tray stands,
	furniture, etc.  Take several cuts.

								CUT TO:

	INSIDE THE ONCE-VACANT POOL HALL

	Now a blaze of activity.  We take several cuts of workmen
	papering the walls, tacking down carpet, putting in new
	light fixtures, painting signs, all under the supervision of
	Niles.  From now on, we will refer to the pool hall as the
	store.

	Back in the office, Kid Twist is "interviewing" one by one,
	a group of con men lined up outside the office door.  A
	gray-haired old buzzard, Curly Jackson, approaches the table
	which is serving Twist as a desk.  Curly is practically in
	rags and has several days growth on his face.  He wears a
	little beret which he takes off to address Twist.

					CURLY
			Name's Curly Jackson.  I worked for
			Gad Bryan outa Baltimore.

					TWIST
			You ever played the Wire, Curly?

					CURLY
			Used to rope for it long ago.  I
			can shill, mark board, anything you
			want.  I don't run with riffraff
			and I only drink on weekends.
				(affecting an English accent)
			Me specialty is an Englishman.

	Twist is taken with the man, despite his appearance.

					TWIST
			All right, Curly, you're in.  We
			got a rack of suits over there.
			Get yourself a nice tweed one.

					CURLY
				(exiting)
			That's all right.  I got all my own
			stuff.

								CUT TO:

	THE CARD GAME AGAIN

	Gondorff and Lonnegan have most of the chips.  Lonnegan is
	slightly ahead.  Gondorff has made a token attempt to wear
	the provided tie, having tied it in a knot around his neck,
	but not having bothered to put it under his collar.  He has
	a shot glass and a bottle next to him, from which he has
	been drinking heavily.  He and Lonnegan are the only ones
	left in this hand.

					LONNEGAN
				(throwing chips in)
			Raise 500.

					GONDORFF
				(likewise)
			See ya and raise three.

					LONNEGAN
				(more chips)
			See and raise five.

					GONDORFF
			Five and call.

	Lonnegan lays down his hand, a solid two pair.  Gondoroff
	turns out three tens.  Lonnegan is beat.

					GONDORFF
			Tough luck, Lonnihan, but that's
			what you get for playin' with your
			head up your ass.  Couple more like
			that and we can all go to bed
			early, huh boys.

	Lonnegan burns, and the "boys" have no comment.

								CUT TO:

	INT. THE STORE - NIGHT

	The work is still progressing.  We see two workmen installing
	a ticket tape machine in a secluded area of the store.

					GARFIELD
			We bought ya a tap into Moe
			Anenberg's wire.  He's got eyes at
			every track in the country.  You'll
			get race results, odds, scratches,
			pole positions, everything; and
			just as fast as Western Union gets
			'em.

					NILES
			Does J.J. know how to use this thing?

					GARFIELD
			All he's gotta do is read.

	We go to Kid Twist, still conducting interviews in the
	office.  A young, rather sullen man, Buck Duff, steps to the
	table.

					DUFF
			Buck Duff.  I was in Maxwell's
			boost in Troy.

					TWIST
			You the Duff that didn't come up
			with his end when Little Jeff was
			sent up?

					DUFF
			Wasn't no problem a mine.

					TWIST
			He was a con man, wasn't he?

					DUFF
			He was a tear-off rat.  He got what
			he deserved.  No sense helpin' pay
			his bills.

					TWIST
				(like ice)
			Shove off, Duff.

	Duff stands there a second and then slouches away from the
	table.  He stops however, by the door.  The next man up is
	the Eirie Kid.  Twist knows he's seen him somewhere before.

					EIRIE KID
				(nervous as hell)
			Names's Joe Eirie.

	Twist waits for more, but it's not coming.

					TWIST
			You played for any particular mobs?

					EIRIE KID
			No.

					TWIST
			You know the Wire at all?

					EIRIE KID
			No...I never played no Big Con
			before.  But Luther Coleman was a
			friend a mine.  I thought maybe
			there was something I could do.

					TWIST
				(pointing to Eirie
				slightly swollen nose)
			You get that nose in Duke Boudreau's
			tonight?

	Eirie nods a reluctant "yes."

					TWIST
			You got moxie, Eirie.  Get yourself
			a suit.

	Eirie is so happy, he can barely blurt out a thank you.
	Buck Duff, enraged that Twist would hire a total amateur,
	turns in disgust and strides vengefully out of the store.

								CUT TO:

	THE CARD GAME AGAIN

	The room is dense with smoke now, and the players are
	feeling the heat.  Gondorff has his white shirt open,
	revealing a stained T-shirt underneath.  The bottle next to
	him is almost empty.  He sneezes and wipes his nose with the
	tie Lonnegan gave him.

	The chips are now about equally divided between Gondorff and
	Lonnegan.  The others are losing badly.

					GONDORFF
			Raise 300.

					LONNEGAN
			Pass.

					JAMESON
				(throwing in his last
				few chips)
			Raise 200.

					GONDORFF
			Two and call.

	Jameson lays down two pair.  Gondorff has a flush.  Gondorff
	rakes in the chips, which now put him ahead of Lonnegan.

					JAMESON
			Well, I'm out.

					GONDORFF
			Don't worry about it, pal.  Lemongan
			here wouldn'ta let you in the game
			if you weren't a chump.

					LONNEGAN
				(getting to his feet)
			I've had enough of your lip, Shaw.

	Gondorff grabs the whiskey bottle next to him, breaks it
	against the table and waves the jagged end in Lonnegan's face.

					GONDORFF
				(barely able to stand up)
			Just take it easy there, Larrabee.

	Jameson and the conductor step in between.

					JAMESON
			Let's take a break for a couple
			minutes and cool off.

	Lonnegan storms out of the room, followed by Floyd and
	Bodyguard.

	INT. SMOKING ROOM

	We pick up Lonnegan coming down the passageway to enter the
	smoking room.

					LONNEGAN
				(to his assistant)
			I've had it with that bum, Floyd.
			Stack me a cooler.

					FLOYD
				(trying to settle him down)
			You've only been playin three
			hours, Doyle.

					LONNEGAN
				(not to be pacified)
			I don't care.  Load me a deck.  Set
			it up for threes and nines.  I'll
			cut it in on his deal.

					FLOYD
				(taking a deck and
				beginning to sort it)
			What do ya want the others to get?

					LONNEGAN
			Nothin'.  They gotta be outa there
			early.  I'm gonna bust that bastard
			in one play.

								CUT TO:

	INT. THE POKER ROOM AGAIN - NIGHT

	A pair of hands shuffling.  We pull back to reveal that
	they're Gondorff's.  He passes the deck to Lonnegan to be
	cut and turns to pen a new whiskey bottle.  Lonnegan takes
	the deck and in one lightning motion substitutes a new deck,
	while making it look like he's cutting the old one.

	Gondorff picks up the deck and begins to deal.  As the hand
	is picked up, we see that Gondorff has four threes, Lonnegan
	four nines, and everybody else has nothing.

					CLAYTON
				(opening the bidding)
			Fold.

					LONNEGAN
			250.

					GONDORFF
			Raise 1,000.

					LONNEGAN
			Raise 500.

	Gondorff looks at Lonnegan very carefully for a second.
	Lonnegan meets his stare.

					GONDORFF
				(slowly)
			Raise 2,000.

	The spectators shift a little.  It's the biggest bet of the
	night.

					LONNEGAN
			See and raise 1,000.

					GONDORFF
				(taking it to him)
			Raise 5,000.

	Lonnegan fingers his remaining chips.  He knows he's won,
	but he wants to bleed it for every bit of suspense.

					LONNEGAN
				(going for broke)
			See, and raise the rest.

	Lonnegan pushes in the rest of his chips.  Gondorff, who is
	only required to match Lonnegan's total, throws in all his
	too.  It's a showdown.

					GONDORFF
			Call.

	Lonnegan puts down his four nines.  Gondorff just stares at
	them a second, lets out a deep sigh and lays down four jacks.
	Lonnegan is aghast.  This just can't be.  He glances at
	Floyd, who can do nothing but sit there with his mouth open.

					GONDORFF
				(raking in the chips)
			Well that's all for me tonight,
			boys.  I'm gonna leave ya some cab
			fare.

	The other players look at each other in disgust, and reach
	for their wallets, all of which are well stocked.

					GONDORFF
				(to Lonnegan)
			You owe me 15 grand, pal.

	Lonnegan, with a stare that could kill, reaches for his
	wallet.  Suddenly the stare goes soft.  He tries a few more
	pockets.  No soap.

					LONNEGAN
				(getting up to get it)
			I guess I left it in my room.

					GONDORFF
				(blowing up)
			What!  Don't give me that crap you
			little weenie.  How do I know you
			ain't gonna take a powder.
				(waving his wallter,
				which is full of
				Lonnegan's money)
			You come to a game like this, you
			bring your money.

	Lonnegan, having had all he can take, goes for Gondorff, but
	is restrained by the conductor.

					GONDORFF
			All right, buddy, I'm gonna send a
			boy by your room in five minutes,
			and you better have that jack, or
			it's gonna be all over Chicago that
			your name ain't worth a dime.

	Gondorff stalks out of the room.  We pick him up coming down
	the passageway to his compartment.

	INT. GONDORFF'S COMPARTMENT

	The drunkenness has vanished.  We follow him into his cabin,
	where Hooker is waiting anxiously.

					HOOKER
			How'd ya do?

					GONDORFF
				(modestly)
			Well we got some workin' money
			anyway.

	Gondorff tosses his winnings on the table.

					GONDORFF
				(big smile)
			Okay, kid, you're on.  But I gotta
			tell ya, its a hard act to follow.

								CUT TO:

	INT. LONNEGAN'S CABIN - NIGHT

	Lonnegan sits in a chair smoking, obviously still upset.
	Floyd paces in front of him.

					FLOYD
			I know I give him four threes.  We
			can't let him get away with that.

					LONNEGAN
			What am I supposed to do?  Call him
			for cheating better than me?

	There's a knock at the door.  Floyd goes and opens it.  It's
	Hooker.

					HOOKER
			My name's Carver.  Mr. Shaw sent me.

	Floyd motions him in without a word.

					LONNEGAN
			Your boss is quite a card player,
			Carver.  How does he do it?

					HOOKER
				(very matter-of-factly)
			He cheats.

	Lonnegan says nothing.  He doesn't like smart asses.  He
	looks Hooker over a second, as if considering whether to
	have him wasted or not.

					LONNEGAN
				(reaching into his
				coat pocket)
			He'll have to take a check.
				(pulling out a check)
			I couldn't find my wallet.

					HOOKER
			Yeh, he knows that.

					LONNEGAN
				(startled)
			What do you mean?

					HOOKER
				(pulling out
				Lonnegan's wallet and
				tossing it to him)
			He hired a dame to take it from ya.

	Lonnegan just holds the wallet.  He can't believe it.
	


					HOOKER
			You were set up, Lonnegan.  Shaw's
			been planning to beat your game for
			months.  He was just waiting for
			you to cheat him so he could clip ya.

					LONNEGAN
				(the heat rising)
			I could have you put under this
			train for this, errand boy.

					HOOKER
				(cool as hell)
			So could Shaw.

					LONNEGAN
			Then why the rat?

					HOOKER
			Cause I'm tired of bein' his nigger.
				(pause)
			I want you to help me break him.

	Lonnegan looks at Hooker long and hard, as if the intensity
	of his gaze could separate truth from fiction.  Lonnegan
	hadn't expected this, but now that it's here, it better be
	on the level.  The silence is suddenly broken by the noise
	of the train braking into the station.

					LONNEGAN
				(to Hooker)
			C'mon, I'll give ya a lift home.

	Hooker hesitates, not sure whether to accept or not.

					LONNEGAN
			What's the matter?  You gotta get
			back to Shaw?

					HOOKER
			Naw, he picked up some jane in the
			bar.  Can't see him till morning
			anyway.

					LONNEGAN
			All right, then.

								CUT TO:

	INT. LONNEGAN'S CAR - NIGHT

	Driving through the city, the driver and Floyd in front,
	Hooker and Lonnegan in back.

	Hooker glances out the window from time to time, just to
	make sure they're really going to his place.

					LONNEGAN
			Why me?  Shaw probably has lotsa
			enemies to choose from.

					HOOKER
			I need somebody respectable...but
			not completely legit.  What I'm
			gonna do isn't very legal.

					LONNEGAN
				(insulted)
			I'm a banker, friend.  That's legit
			in this state.

					HOOKER
			All you gotta do is place a bet for
			me at Shaw's place.  I'll supply
			all the money and the information.

	Lonnegan is listening, but you'd never know it.

					HOOKER
			If you help me out, I'll pay ya
			back the money you owe Shaw, myself.

					LONNEGAN
			That's worth fifteen grand to ya?

					HOOKER
			Maybe a couple million.

	We go to Lonnegan.  He's still not talking, but that last
	phrase has registered.

	EXT. HOOKER'S PLACE

	The car pulls up in front of Hooker's place.

					LONNEGAN
			You're dreamin', kid.

					HOOKER
				(getting out)
			660 Marshall Street.  Tomorrow at
			12:30, if you're interested.

					LONNEGAN
				(diffidently)
			If I'm not there by quarter of, I'm
			not coming.

	Hooker nods and walks up the steps to his apartment building.
	Lonnegan's car speeds away from the curb and on out of sight.
	Hooker breathes a sigh of relief.  He's passed his first
	test; or has he?  We follow him up the stairs to his room.

	INT. HOOKER'S APARTMENT

	He's just about to unlock the door, when he notices the
	little piece of paper he left in the door is on the floor.
	Without the slightest hesitation, Hooker leaps over the
	bannister and races back down the stairs.  Two gunmen, Riley
	and Cole, burst out of his room and fire at him over the
	railing, but he's already too far down.  Riley and Cole give
	chase.

								CUT TO:

	THE FRONT OF THE BUILDING

	Riley and Cole barrel out of the building and onto the
	sidewalk.  There is an empty bus stopped at a light, but
	they find no sign of Hooker.  As the light changes, we cut
	to the other side of the bus, where we see Hooker crouched
	on the rear wheel housing, hanging on to a vent.  He's a
	little shaken, but most of all, he's still alive.  We hold
	on him, as the bus moves off.

					GONDORFF (V.O.)
			Everything go all right?

					HOOKER (V.O.)
				(lying)
			Yeh, it was easy.

								CUT TO:

	INT. THE STORE - NIGHT

	Hooker and Gondorff are sitting alone in the back office
	while the work goes on outside.  Their conversation continues.

					GONDORFF
			No signs of trouble?

					HOOKER
			What do ya mean?

					GONDORFF
			You know, somebody tailin' ya.  A
			torpedo or somethin'.

					HOOKER
				(wanting to get off
				the subject)
			No, not a thing.

	Gondorff has his doubts, but lets them ride.

								CUT TO:

	OTHER PARTS OF THE STORE

	We concentrate on some of the fine details, i.e. Garfield
	explaining how the ticker will read out to Singleton and
	Billie; Curly Jackson showing a younger con man how to mark
	the odds board properly.

					GONDORFF (V.O.)
			How 'bout Lonnegan?

					HOOKER (V.O.)
			I gave him the breakdown just like
			ya told me to.

					GONDORFF (V.O.)
			And?

					HOOKER (V.O.)
			He threatened to kill me.

					GONDORFF (V.O.)
			Hell, they don't do that and you
			know you're not gettin' through to
			'em.

	We concentrate on Niles, who's making up the "boodles" or
	fake bankrollls.  He puts a real $100 bill on the bottom,
	then two inches of cut green paper on top, and then another
	$100 bill on top of that, so that it looks like he has a
	whole stack of $100 bills.  The bundle is then bound with a
	sealed label, like those used in banks, that says $10,000.
	We see that he has already made several of these bundles.

					HOOKER (V.O.)
			Then he drove me home.  He tried to
			put himself away as legit, so I
			went right into the pitch.

					GONDORFF (V.O.)
			Did he hold you up on anything?
	


					HOOKER (V.O.)
			Naw, he just sat there and listened.
			I don't know if he bought it or not.

								CUT TO:

	INT. THE STORE

	Twist in the middle of the room giving a route to the Eirie
	Kid.  He shows him where to get his drink at the bar, where
	to sit and finally how to leap up and throw his racing form
	down in disgust.

					GONDORFF (V.O.)
			That's all right.  Once they start
			listening, they're in trouble.
			Just don't give him more than he
			asks for.  If you rattle his
			imagination a little, he'll come up
			with all the right answers himself.
			But all he's gotta do is catch you
			in one lie and you're dead.

								CUT TO:

	HOOKER AND GONDORFF IN THE STORE OFFICE AGAIN

	They both look tired.

					HOOKER
			You think he'll show?

					GONDORFF
			Did he say he wouldn't?

					HOOKER
			No.

					GONDORFF
				(softly)
			He'll show.

								FADE OUT.

	FADE IN:

	THE TALE

								FADE OUT.

	FADE IN:

	WE OPEN ON A WIDE SHOT OF THE ALLEY OUTSIDE THE STORE

	At first it appears to be deserted, but we move to reveal a
	figure in an upper window of the apartment building which
	forms one side of the alley.  It's Kid Twist.  His eyes roam
	the street, for what, we do not yet know.

								CUT TO:

	INT. AN OLD DRUGSTORE ACROSS FROM THE ALLEY - DAY

	Probably prosperous at one time, it has since declined, its
	large fountain and eating area bow host to two bums and
	Hooker, who sits alone in a rear booth near the telephone.
	Dressed in a tuxedo, he nurses a cup of coffee, and anxiously
	alternates his glances between the clock and the empty
	street outside.  It's 12:52.

								CUT TO:

	INT. THE STORE - DAY

	The place is full of people, although we avoid long shot so
	as not to give away the room as a whole yet.  Instead, we
	concentrate on the tense, waiting faces of some of the more
	familiar people:

	Gondorff and Niles in tuxedos behind a barred cashier's area.
	Gondorff mutilates a piece of gum in his mouth.  Niles just
	stares out into space cracking his knuckles.

					GONDORFF
			Eddie, cut that out, will ya.

	The boardmarker walking nervously back and forth in front of
	his odds board, checking every letter and number.  He stops
	to cross a T on one of the horses' names.  It was already
	crossed, but he does it again anyway.

	Billie and Singleton, in an area hidden from the rest of the
	room, watching the print-out on the ticker machine.  The
	clicking of the ticker is the only sound we hear in the store.

	Curly Jackson in front of a mirror, pasting a fake Van Dyke
	on his chin to go with his tweed suit and monocle.

	A couple of Billie's girls adjusting their waitress outfits
	and primping their hair.  Each has a tray full of drinks
	beside her.

	The Eirie Kid silently retracing his "route" to make sure he
	has it down.

	Despite the crowd, there is no talking and little movement,
	save for the constant swirling of smoke from several cigars
	and cigarettes.  The group is like a theatre company waiting
	to go on opening night.

								CUT TO:

	THE DRUGSTORE AGAIN

	It's 12:56 and Hooker is worried.  He looks up to see two
	large men, obviously racket goons, come in the front door,
	and take a seat facing him in the next booth.  They stare at
	him impassively, waving the waitress away when she comes to
	take their order.  Hooker knows they're Lonnegan's men, but
	is somewhat unsettled by the fact that Lonnegan is not with
	them.  Suddenly, a voice.

					VOICE
			Carver?

	Hooker turns around to find that Lonnegan is seated in the
	booth directly behind him.  His bodyguard is in the one
	behind that.

					LONNEGAN
			You should always look to the back
			too, kid.

					HOOKER
				(sliding out of his
				booth and into Lonnegan's)
			I was afraid you weren't gonna come.
			We haven't got much time.

					LONNEGAN
				(curtly)
			Get on with it then.

					HOOKER
				(pointing to telephone)
			Sometime after 1:00 a guy's gonna
			call here and give you the name of
			a horse.
				(pulling out a wad of bills)
			All you do is take this two grand
			across the street to Shaw's place
			and bet it on that pony.  There's
			nothin' to it, but don't take too
			much time.  We only have 3 or 4
			minutes after you get the call.

					LONNEGAN
			You're not gonna break him with a
			$2,000 bet.

					HOOKER
			This is just a test.  The big one
			comes later.  Be careful with that
			though, it's all I got.

					LONNEGAN
			And you were gonna pay me back?

					HOOKER
			I am after this race.

	Lonnegan says nothing.  He's not sure he likes a man who's
	stupid enough to bet his last dollar on a horse race.

					HOOKER
			I gotta get back before Shaw misses
			me.  Good luck.

	EXT. STREET

	Hooker hustles out across the street and into the alley.

	INT. DRUGSTORE

	Lonnegan watches him through the window and then settles
	back in his seat to wait for the phone.

	OUTSIDE STORE

	As Hooker descends the stairwell into the store, he gives
	Kid Twist the office.  Twist turns away from the window and
	looks at his watch.  12:58.

								CUT TO:

	DRUGSTORE

	Lonnegan waiting by the phone, idly pinging a knife on the
	salt shaker.  It's 1:40.  A man enters the store and walks
	over to use the phone.

					LONNEGAN
			We're waitin' for a call.

	The man looks at Lonnegan a second, and then at his four
	goons.  He decides maybe he'll make the call later.

								CUT TO:

	INT. THE STORE

	Kid Twist again.  Billie enters the room with a piece of
	paper.  Kid Twist looks at it a second and then picks up the
	pohne and begins to dial.

	INT. DRUGSTORE

	Lonnegan again.  He's getting impatient now and lights a
	cigarette, and then the phone rings.  He answers it quickly
	and we hear:

					TWIST
			Bluenote at 6 to 1 on the nose.

	The receiver clicks down at the other end.  Lonnegan hangs
	up and goes out the door, followed by his entourage.

	EXT. STREET

	We follow him across the street and into the alley, where he
	signals one of the bodyguards to check the place out.  Kid
	Twist pushes a button on his window sill, and a buzzer goes
	off inside the store.  The previously inert figures there
	spring to life.

	Lonnegan's bodyguard descends the stairwell and knocks at
	the door, where he is greeted by Hooker in the capacity of
	host.  He looks the place over and motions an okay to
	Lonnegan.

	INT. THE STORE

	As Lonnegan enters, we see the room for the first time in
	its entirety.  Overnight it has been transformed into a
	swank private club, with bar, cigarette girls, upholstered
	furniture and chandeliers.

					SINGLETON
			Look at that.  He's got four apes
			with him.

					GONDORFF
			That's what I like about these
			guys, J.J... They always got
			protection against things we'd
			never do to 'em.

	Everywhere there is activity.  A bank of telephones buzzes
	incessantly.  Sheet writers scurry from phone to phone,
	taking bets of tremendous size from prominent people.

					SHEET WRITER
			Yes, Mr. Ruth, 20,000 on Dancing
			Cloud.

	We reveal that the phones are controlled by a master switch,
	which one of the recruited con men operates from behind a
	partition.

	The boardmaker, wearing headphones suspended from a sliding
	wire, hurriedly chalks up races and odds on a huge blackboard.
	From the loudspeakers we hear the words "last flash." The
	odds on Bluenote settle down to 8 to 1.

	Lonnegan makes his way through the throng toward the betting
	line.  His bodyguards fan out to various positions in the
	room.  The betting crowd itself (known as the "boost")
	consists of close to twenty people, none of whom, of course
	are what they're pretending to be.  There are brokers with
	pasty faces, sportsmen, tanned and casual, and financiers
	with goatees and highly tailored clothes.  Large amounts of
	money are changing hands at the betting window.  Boodles are
	in sight everywhere.

	Lonnegan slips into the betting line, feeling somewhat
	estranged from the general merriment around him.  There are
	two men in line ahead of him.  The first, Curly Jackson,
	slaps down several bundles of cash in front of Niles, who's
	the cashier, and places a $20,000 bet on War Eagle.  Gondorff
	appears at the cashier's window and catches sight of Lonnegan.

					GONDORFF
			Never get enough, huh pal?  I'd
			think you'd get tired of losin',
			Honnigan.

					LONNEGAN
				(piercingly)
			The name is Lonnegan.

					GONDORFF
				(to Niles)
			Make sure you see cash from this
			guy, Eddie.  He's got the name for
			bettin' money he don't have.

	The man in front of Lonnegan puts $5,000 on Dancing Cloud.
	He makes the bet on credit.  Lonnegan steps to the window.

					LONNEGAN
			Two-thousand on Bluenote.

					NILES
				(writing out a ticket)
			Is that all?

					LONNEGAN
				(pissed)
			That's all.

	Bluenote's race is now up on the board.  The race caller
	comes on the loudspeaker.

					CALLER
			Ladies and Gentlemen.  This is
			Arnold Rowe, your caller for the
			second race at Belmont in New York.
			A mile and 1/8.  Four year olds and
			up.  And they're off!

	We see that the caller is Singleton, and that he's calling
	the race from a concealed booth next to the cashier's cage.

					CALLER
			Around the first turn it's a War
			Eagle first by a length, Jail Bate
			second by one and a half, Dancing
			Cloud third by a half on the
			outside, followed by Lucky Lady,
			Mojo, Wits' End and Bluenote.

	Lonnegan goes to the bar, orders a drink, and settles down
	at one of the tables.  It happens to be the one the Eirie
	Kid is at.  Gondorff and Niles watch it from the cashier's
	cage.

					GONDORFF
				(worried)
			That's not where we want him to sit.

	Eirie tries to ignore Lonnegan at first, but realizes he
	better make some conversation.

					EIRIE KID
			C'mon War Eagle.
				(to Lonnegan)
			That Dancing Cloud's a hell of a
			finisher.  War Eagle's gonna have
			to open up a little more on 'em.

					LONNEGAN
			You know anything about a horse
			named Bluenote?

					EIRIE KID
			Naw, he's never done much.  Probably
			in here just to round out the field.
			War Eagle's where you wanna have
			your money.

	Eirie excuses himself and heads for the bar.

					CALLER
			Into the clubhouse turn, it's War
			Eagle by two lengths, Dancing Cloud
			has moved up to second by a half,
			Lucky Lady is third by three
			followed by Jail Bait, Mojo,
			Bluenote and Wits' End.

	The heretofore chaotic energy of the parlor is now focused
	on the race.  Several of the patrons begin to yell for their
	horses.  Lonnegan remains seated.  He seems bored with it
	all.  Hooker comes over to clear some empty glasses from his
	table.

					LONNEGAN
				(out of the corner of
				his mouth)
			You really picked a winner, kid.

					HOOKER
			Give 'em a little time.

					CALLER
			Into the backstretch it's War Eagle
			still by a length, Dancing Cloud
			closing on the inside, is second by
			two, Lucky Lady is third by one and
			a half, followed by Bluenote, Jail
			Bait, Wits' End and Mojo.

	Lonnegan perks up just a little.  Bluenote, at least, has
	moved up.  The rest of the people in the place are really
	rooting now.  Few of them remain seated.

	Hooker arrives at the bar, with the glasses he cleared from
	Lonnegan's table.  Eirie is already there, fortifying
	himself with a scotch.

					HOOKER
			You're doin' great, Eirie.  He
			loves ya.

	Eirie nods, somewhat unconvinced, and heads bak to the table.

					CALLER
			Into the far turn, it's Dancing
			Cloud now by half a length, War
			Eagle is second by two, Bluenote is
			third by a half and moving fast on
			the outside.  Lucky Lady is fourth
			by four lengths, followed by Jail
			Bait, Wits' End and Mojo.

	Lonnegan is getting more intent now.

					CALLER
			Coming down the stretch, it's
			Dancing Cloud by one length, War
			Eagle and Bluenote are neck and
			neck by two.  Now it's Dancing
			Cloud, Bluenote and War Eagle.
				(shouting now)
			Dancing Cloud and Bluenote head to
			head...

	The place is going crazy.  Even Singleton is standing up to
	get the necessary excitement in his voice.

					CALLER
			Dancing Cloud, Bluenote.  Dancing
			Cloud, Bluenote.  It's Bluenote by
			a nose.  Dancing Cloud is second by
			two, War Eagle third by three and a
			half.  Time for a mile and 1/8,
			2:01 and 6/10 seconds.

	Most of the patrons collapse into their chairs like spent
	lovers.  Eirie slams his racing form to the floor.  Nobody
	had Bluenote.

					CURLY
				(tearing up his ticket)
			Bloody awful.  Who in blazes is
			Bluenote?

					LONNEGAN
				(to Eirie, very self-satisfied)
			War Eagle's where you want to have
			your money, huh?

	Eirie doesn't reply.  He can't believe Bluenote won.
	Lonnegan looks to Hooker.  Hooker gives him a wink.  For
	the first time, Lonnegan permits a smile.

								CUT TO:

	LONNEGAN AT THE CASHIER'S WINDOW

	Niles is counting out $16,000 to him (all of which Gondorff
	won the night before).  Gondorff looks somewhat perturbed.
	Lonnegan picks up the money and tauntingly waves it at him.

					GONDORFF
				(getting his name
				right this time)
			Don't bother to come back with a
			piker's bet like that again,
			Lonnegan.  We got a $5,000 minimum
			here.
				(to Hooker)
			Show this bum out.

	Hooker hesitates a second.

					GONDORFF
			Go on, ya goddamn ninny.

	Gondorff gives Hooker a hard shove in the back with his
	foot, sending him into a table and sprawling to the floor.

					GONDORFF
				(indicating Lonnegan's
				bodyguards)
			And tell him not to bring his
			garbage men in here no more.  This
			is a class joint.

	Hooker, pretending to be humiliated, gets to his feet and
	escorts Lonnegan to the door.  Lonnegan stops, gives Gondorff
	a derisive smile, and walks out.  Once he's gone, the
	general clatter and hubbub in the room cease, like it had
	been turned off by a faucet.  Most of the boost sit down and
	relax.  Curly Jackson rips off his Van Dyke.  It's been
	itching him.

					GONDORFF
			He's gaffed, kid.  He should start
			coming to you now.

								CUT TO:

	INT. COMB'S OFFICE AT THE CLEARINGHOUSE - DAY

	Combs sits passively on the edge of his desk glancing across
	the room every now and then at Riley, who is slumped uneasily
	in a folding chair, looking like a defendant at the
	Inquisition.  Both remain silent, like two men in a waiting
	room.  Suddenly, what they've been waiting for arrives.
	Lonnegan comes into the office, flanked by his bodyguards.
	Skipping the usual pleasantries, he walks right over to Riley.

					LONNEGAN
			All right, Riley.  What the hell
			happened?

					RILEY
				(not looking at him)
			We missed him.

					LONNEGAN
			You weren't hired to miss him.

					RILEY
			There wasn't any way he coulda
			known we was in there.  We made a
			clean pick on the lock and didn't
			leave no footprints in the hall.
			Somebody musta wised him up.

					LONNEGAN
			Yeh, and what does Cole say about
			that?

					RILEY
			I don't know.  He took it hard.

					LONNEGAN
			All right, get outa here.  You're
			outta work.

	Riley gets up and drags himself out the door like a whipped
	dog.

					LONNEGAN
			We'll put Salino on it.  I need
			somebody careful.

					COMBS
			Salino?  Why waste our best people
			on a small-time job like this?  It
			ain't no heavy gee we're after.
			The guy's a five and dime grifter.

					LONNEGAN
			Then why ain't he dead?

					COMBS
			They didn't think he'd be so cagey,
			that's all.  They'll get him next
			time.

					LONNEGAN
			Use Salino.  It'll take a little
			longer, but there won't be any
			holes in it.

	Combs gives up.  The second time's the charm.

					LONNEGAN
			And tell Cole I wanta see him when
			he gets in.

					COMBS
			He's not comin' in.  Not to get
			bounced off a job anyway.

					LONNEGAN
			He had his chance and all he did
			was shoot up a rooming house.  Made
			a lotte noise and woke up a few
			cops, but didn't hit nothin'.

	Combs keeps his mouth shut.  There's no way to talk to
	Lonnegan when  he's like this.

					LONNEGAN
				(cooling a little)
			This is Salino's job now, Vince.
			If Cole wants to muscle in on it,
			that's his business.  But he's
			breakin' the rules and when Salino
			finds out about it, I can't feel
			sorry for what's gonna happen to him.

								CUT TO:

	INT. LONNEGAN'S HOTEL - DAY

	The finest the period had to offer.  We pick up Hooker
	coming down the hall to Lonnegan's suite.  He is admitted by
	the Bodyguard.  Lonnegan, wearing a smoking jacket, is
	seated at a table counting a pile of money.  There are two
	other assistants standing behind him.  They don't look
	friendly.

					HOOKER
			Well, what did I tell ya?

					LONNEGAN
			You're a lucky man, all right.

					HOOKER
			Lucky, hell.  I could do it every
			day.

					LONNEGAN
			Why don't ya then.

					HOOKER
			'Cause it's better to do it all at
			once.
				(leaning close)
			We're puttin' down 400 grand next
			week.  At 5-1 we make 2 million.
			Twenty per cent of that is yours if
			ya stick with us.

					LONNEGAN
			You got a system, Carver?
	


					HOOKER
			You stayin' in or not?

					LONNEGAN
			I'm in.

					HOOKER
				(drawing up a chair,
				barely able to
				contain his enthusiasm)
			It's foolproof.  We got a partner
			downtown runs the central office of
			the Western Union.  Race results
			from all over the country come in
			there and go right across his desk
			on their way to the bookies.  All
			he does in hold them up a couple
			minutes until he can call us and
			get a bet down on the winner.  Then
			he releases the results to the
			bookies and we clean up on a race
			that's already been run.  It can't
			miss, unless the Western Union
			Dicks get onto it.

	Lonnegan is amazed.  He sits back a second, then comes
	forward again and pushes a pile of bills over to Hooker.
	Hooker smiles and begins to count the money.

					LONNEGAN
			You got the 400 grand yet?

					HOOKER
			Not yet, but...
				(stopping suddenly)
			Hey, there's only a grand here.

					LONNEGAN
				(more like a command)
			I think we oughta place another bet
			tomorrow.

					HOOKER
				(getting angry)
			What is this?  That's my money.
			You tryin' to muscle me?

					LONNEGAN
				(controlled)
			If your system's as foolproof as
			you say, you'll get even more.

	Hooker's in a jam and he knows it.

					HOOKER
				(after a pause)
			I gotta talk to me partner first.
			We can't afford to expose our game
			too much.

					LONNEGAN
			Let me talk to him.

					HOOKER
				(flatly)
			No.

					LONNEGAN
			You want your money back?  Try and
			get it in a court of law.
				(softening a bit)
			C'mon, don't be a sorehead.  I'll
			make it worth your while.  Migth
			even help ya finance the big play
			if this one works out.

	Hooker says nothing for a minute, and then reluctantly nods
	his head.

					HOOKER
			Four o'clock tomorrow.  Pick me up
			at Dewey Lyle's.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. LONNEGAN'S HOTEL - DAY

	We pick up Hooker coming out of the hotel and going off down
	the street.  As he does so, we pull back all the way across
	the street and through the interior of a parked car to
	reveal the silhouette of a man seated at the wheel.  We move
	to his right hand, which rests on the steering column.  It's
	covered by a black glove and the middle finger is missing.
	His trigger finger, however, taps lightly on the wheel.

								CUT TO:

	INT. AN INDOOR TELEPHONE BOOTH - DAY

	One of the old, wooden kind -- accordian doors with glass
	panes in the upper half.  Hooker dials rapidly.

					HOOKER
			Twist?  I told him the tale.  He
			wants to see ya.

					TWIST
			All right, when?

					HOOKER
			Tomorrow, after 4:00.  Stay inside,
			I'll come in and get ya.  And be
			hard on him for a while; he's
			talking money.

					TWIST
			Okay, Tootsie.

	Hooker blows a mock kiss through the phone and hangs up.  He
	turns to leave the booth, when suddenly he sees something
	that stops him cold.  There looking through the glass is the
	smirking face of Detective Synder.  Hooker is immobilized.

	Snyder puts his hand inside his coat and slowly draws out
	his gun.  He points it right at Hooker's face and then
	violently smashes all the glass in the upper half of the
	door with the barrel.  Fragments of glass spray into the
	booth, a couple of which imbed themselves in Hooker's cheek.

	Hooker quickly whips open the door, trapping Snyder's hand
	in the accordian and jarring loose his gun.  Hooker sprints
	out of the booth as Snyder scrambles for his pistol and
	gives pursuit.

	EXT. ALLEYS AND SIDESTREETS - NIGHT - THE TWO MEN

	We follow the two men up alleys and sidestreets as they race
	through the dregs of the city, two panting shadows moving
	through places that only get light at night.  The wind blows
	drops of blood off Hooker's cheek as he runs.  Snyder still
	has his gun, but would rather inflict pain than death.

	CONDEMNED BUILDING

	Hooker makes for a condemned building and scrambles up the
	stairs, steps giving way under him as he goes.

	INT. BUILDING

	On the fourth floor, he ducks into a room and quickly locks
	the door.

	We pan the room to reveal that the whole back side of the
	building is gone.  Hooker runs toward the ledge and leaps
	through the air, landing on the fire escape of an adjacent
	building, some 15 feet away.  He kicks in a window and goes
	off down the hall.  We cut back to

	Snyder furiously kicking in the locked door.  He finally
	crashes through, only to find an empty room and a beautiful
	panorama of the city and its nearest Hooverville.

								CUT TO:

	LONG SHOT - HOOKER

	Winding his way through the slum area of town, dashing along
	backstreets, over fences and through vacant lots, making
	good his escape.  From our angle, he looks like a rat in a
	maze.

					GONDORFF (V.O.)
			Why didn't you tell me about Snyder
			before?

					HOOKER (V.O.)
			I thought I'd lost him.

								CUT TO:

	INT. GONDORFF'S ROOM AT THE CAROUSEL BUILDING - DAY

	Hooker sits sullenly at the table.  Billie stands over him
	putting some ointment on his face to close the cuts.
	Gondorff looks on.  Their discussion continues.

					GONDORFF
			Well you found him again and we're
			gonna have to do somethin' about it.
			What else haven't ya been tellin' me?

					HOOKER
			Nothin'.  I told ya everything
			there is.

					GONDORFF
			Then why'd ya move outa your room?

					HOOKER
			It was too noisy.

					GONDORFF
			You can't play your friends like
			marks, Hooker.

	Hooker doesn't reply.  He knows Gondorff's on to him.

					GONDORFF
			You know how easy it'd be for one
			of Lonnegan's guys to nail you?

					HOOKER
			All we need is a couple days, Henry.
			A couple days and we'll get Lonnegan
			down and stomp on 'em.

					GONDORFF
			You just won't learn, will ya.
			Hell, you come in here, I teach you
			stuff maybe five guys in this world
			know, stuff most grifters couldn't
			do even if they knew it, and all
			you wanna do is run down a bullet.
				(pause)
			You're just like all them new jerks.
			Lotsa nerve and no brains.  And ten
			years from now when me and the
			others are through and you dumb
			guys are all dead there won't be
			one gee left who knows the Big Con
			was anything more than a way to
			make a livin'.

					HOOKER
			A couple days; that's all I'm
			askin'.  I can stay clear that long.

					GONDORFF
				(trying to be angry
				and failing)
			Christ, they'll probably miss you
			and hit me.

								FADE OUT.

	FADE IN:

	THE WIRE

								FADE OUT.

	FADE IN:

	INT. A SLEEPY DINER - LATE AFTERNOON

	Located across the street from Hooker's apartment building.
	Hooker sits down alone in a booth, with a plate of ham and
	eggs he's hardly touched.

	The two cuts on his face have pretty much stopped bleeding.
	A big fan above the counter area drones away lethargically,
	it's air stream insufficient to either cool the place or
	drive out the smell of onions and grease.

	A waitress, Loretta, emerges from the kitchen and ambles
	slowly over to Hooker's table.  Slim and raven-haired, she
	manifests an indifference bred from years spent delivering
	things to people who are rarely grateful for what she brings.
	Only a light scar on her left cheek hints at another side.
	


					LORETTA
			You done?

					HOOKER
			Yeh, I guess I shoulda had the meat
			loaf.

					LORETTA
				(deadpan)
			It isn't any better.

					HOOKER
			Where's June today?

					LORETTA
				(figuring up the bill)
			She don't work here no more.  I'm
			fillin' in for a couple days...
			till I can get a train outa here.

					HOOKER
			Where you goin'?

					LORETTA
				(putting the check
				down and walking away)
			I don't know.  Depends what train I
			get on.

	Hooker looks for some sign that she's putting him on.  He
	doesn't get it.  He takes out some money, drops it on the
	table and walks out.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. A WESTERN UNION OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON

	A truck with the words CLAYTON BROS., CUSTOM PAINTING AND
	DECORATING stenciled on the side, is parked out front.  Two
	men, wearing overalls and painter's caps, walk into the
	office to the reception counter, we see that they are Twist
	and Singleton.

					TWIST
				(to the receptionist)
			Excuse me.  We're here to paint Mr.
			Harmon's office.

					RECEPTIONIST
				(obviously not
				expecting them)
			Mr. Harmon's office?  Hold on just
			a second.
	


She goes to get Mr. Harmon.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. THE SLEEZY DINER - LATE AFTERNOON

	Hooker is standing on the curb outside the diner, obviously
	waiting for somebody.  Lonnegan's car pulls up and Hooker
	hops in the back.

					LONNEGAN
			What happened to your face?

					HOOKER
			Had a little fight with a raggle
			down on 13th.  She got me with her
			ring.

	Lonnegan laughs.

								CUT TO:

	INT. THE WESTERN UNION OFFICE AGAIN - LATE AFTERNOON

	Mr. Harmon is looking over the authorization papers that
	Twist and Singleton have given him.  He can't find anything
	wrong with it.

					HARMON
			Brigham signed it all right.  I
			can't understand why he didn't tell
			me.

					SINGLETON
			Ah, he's like all them supervisors.
			They think they're too good for
			regular people.  He says he was in
			here a while ago and the place was
			a mess.

	Harmon looks around, hoping it's not true.

					TWIST
			We'll try and hurry so we don't
			keep you out of your office too long.

					HARMON
			Why can't I work with you in there?

					SINGLETON
			Look pal, we gotta cover the floor,
			the furniture, everything, so we
			don't spill on nothing.  Now if you
			wanta sit in there with a tarp over
			your head, you're welcome to it.

					HARMON
			All right, how long will you be?

					TWIST
			Hour or two at the most.  We do
			good work.

	Harmon is resigned.  Twist and Singleton pick up their gear
	and march into the office.  Once inside, we notice that the
	office has an exit door which opens to an outside alley.
	Twist immediately removes his overalls, revealing the suit
	and tie he's wearing underneath.  He takes out a picture of
	himself, a woman and three small children, and puts it on
	Harmon's desk, replacing a similiar picture of Harmon's
	family.  Singleton, meanwhile, has spread a few tarps and
	begins to paint the walls.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. THE WESTERN UNION OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON

	Lonnegan's car pulls up and stops across the street.

					HOOKER
			We'll go to the side door.

	We follow Hooker and Lonnegan across the street to the side
	entrance which opens into:

	INT. HARMON'S OFFICE

	Hooker knocks and Twist, of course, answers.

					HOOKER
			Les, I got Mr. Lonnegan with me.
			He wants to see you a second.

					TWIST
				(irritated)
			What the hell's the matter with you.
			We coulda met at a club or somethin'.

					HOOKER
			I thought it might be good for him
			to see the setup.

					TWIST
				(hushed)
			Well we can't talk in here.  They're
			having the place painted.

	Twist walks over to the intercom on his desk.  He leaves the
	door open so that Lonnegan can get a good look at the
	office, Twist's picture in it, the painter, etc... Lonnegan's
	not missing any of it.

					TWIST
				(talking into the intercom)
			Miss Barnes, I'm going home a
			little early today.  Tell anyone
			that calls that they can reach me
			here in the morning.  Thank you.

								CUT TO:

	INT. FRONT OFFICE

	Harmon's secretary at the other end of the intercom.  Mr.
	Harmon is with her.  They look at each other a second and
	Harmon decides he better see what's happening in his office.
	He opens the door to find it empty except for a pile of
	painting equipment and one haphazardly painted wall.

								CUT TO:

	INT. A DILAPIDATED CHINESE RESTAURANT - EVENING

	Dark and somewhat foreboding, its peeling dragons and shoddy
	lanterns compete for space with the many slot machines and
	arcade games that line the walls.  Hooker, Lonnegan and
	Twist sit at one of the more secluded tables.  They are not
	eating.

					TWIST
			Can't do it.  There're telegraph
			inspectors all over the place.  I
			got 750 grand coming in from the
			coast, and I'm not gonna blow it
			for a lousy 14 gees.  We'll get
			somebody else to do our betting.

					LONNEGAN
			I could come up with 750 grand in a
			day if I had a reason to.

					TWIST
			But who says you will.  I got a guy
			I can depend on.  He's liquidating
			everything he has for this.  You
			wouldn't even give Carver his money
			back.

					LONNEGAN
			I need more proof, that's all.
			Anybody can get lucky once.

					TWIST
				(stubbornly)
			On a 6-1 shot?  The hell with ya.
			We'll keep the deal we got.

					LONNEGAN
			If it works again tomorrow, I'll
			have a half million in cash here by
			noon the next day.  We split 60-40.

					TWIST
				(feebly, beginning to break)
			We were getting 50 from our guy.

					LONNEGAN
			With 20% coming off the top for me
			laying your bet.  Either way you
			end up with 40.

	Twist hesitates.

					LONNEGAN
			A week's a long time, friend.
			Anything can happen.  All of it bad.

					HOOKER
			He's right, Les.

					TWIST
			Yeh, and what if we play tomorrow
			and he doesn't come up with the
			money.  We risk our whole operation
			for nothing.  I'll say when we make
			our bets.

					LONNEGAN
			Not if you want me to keep makin'
			'em for ya.
	


					HOOKER
			And what do we know about your guy.
			He says a week, but who knows if
			it's a month?  Lonnegan here's a
			banker.  He can get that dough with
			no questions asked.

	Twist says nothing for a minute, then:

					TWIST
			All right.  Be at the booth at 1:00.
			I'll give you all three places this
			time, Lonnegan.  That better be
			proof enough.

	Hooker and Lonnegan smile at each other like life-long
	friends.  They get up to leave, and we frame the shot with a
	coffee cup large in the foreground.  As they go out the
	door, a black-gloved hand with four fingers enters the frame
	and puts a nickel down next to the cup.

								FADE OUT.

	FADE IN:

	THE SHUT-OUT

								FADE OUT.

	FADE IN:

	INT. A DOWNTOWN DINETTE - MORNING

	Snyder finishes a donut and a cup of coffee, puts down a
	dime for the lot and exits.  We follow him down the street:

	EXT. STREET

	To a corner newsstand, where he stops to buy a morning paper.
	As he peruses it, he's approached by two large, clean-cut
	men in white skimmers.

					MAN
			Are you Lieutenant William Snyder?

					SNYDER
			I don't know, what's up?

					MAN
			F.B.I... The Captain'd like a few
			words with ya.  Ya got a couple
			minutes?

					SNYDER
				(completely floored)
			Yeh, sure.

	The two men show him to a waiting car.

								CUT TO:

	INT. AN ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY

	Snyder stands in the middle of a dusty old machine room,
	surrounded by four or five Federal Agents.  Visible around
	the room are several folding cots and portable lockers.  The
	agents have obviously been quartered here temporarily.  They
	all wear white skimmers, save for one, a portly man, Captain
	Polk, who paces the room smoking.  There is something long-
	suffering about him, as if he wondered how he ever got in a
	service that thought white skimmers were classy.

					SNYDER
			What is this?  I got work to do.

					POLK
			Sit down and shut up, will ya.  Try
			not to live up to all my
			expectations.
				(not in the mood to
				screw around)
			We were told you know a hustle
			artist named Johnny Hooker.

	Snyder doesn't answer.

					POLK
			Do ya know him or don't ya?

					SNYDER
			Yeh, but I don't know where he is.

					POLK
			Well we do.  He's chummin' around
			with a Big C named Henry Gondorff.
			Ring any bells?

					SNYDER
			Sure.  Every bunco man in the
			country knows Gondorff.

					POLK
			There's word he's gonna run a con
			on the North Side here.  We got a
			year-old Florida warrant on him,
			but it's a thin beef, and he can
			beat it in court unless we catch
			him cold.  All we want you to do is
			pick up Hooker for us.

					SNYDER
			Why don't you pick him up yourself?

					POLK
			Cause the stoolies are used to
			street dicks jumpin' him.  If word
			gets around that Feds are in on it
			too, Gondorff'll fold up the whole
			thing.

					SNYDER
			Wouldn't that be too bad.  You'd
			hafta move outa this nice office ya
			got.

					POLK
				(enraged)
			Don't crack wise to me, flatfoot.
			I spent a lotta time in dumps like
			this, eatin' Gondorff's dust while
			the bunco squad gets rich tippin'
			him off.  But it's not gonna happen
			this time.  We're not even gonna
			let the police know we're here.  If
			you keep your mouth shut and do a
			job, there'll be a promotion in it
			for ya.  And you better take it,
			cause I can make ya work for us
			without it.

					SNYDER
			What the hell good is Hooker to ya?

					POLK
			He's gonna set up Gondorff for us.

					SNYDER
			He'll never do it.

					POLK
				(self-satisfied)
			I think he will.

								CUT TO:

	INT. DRUGSTORE - DAY

	Lonnegan sits by the phone, watching the clock and sipping a
	cup of coffee.

								CUT TO:

	INT. THE STORE - DAY

	Specifically, the small room from which Singleton does his
	race broadcasts.  Singleton, himself, is hunched over the
	ticker machine, reading the print-out.  Billie sits at the
	microphone table with a pencil and pad, ready to write.

					SINGLETON
			Visitation is still up by two at
			the three-quarters.  Single Action
			second, Fasanella third.

					BILLIE
			What's the line on Visitation?

					SINGLETON
				(checking further up
				on the print-out sheet)
			7 to 2.  That ain't bad.

					BILLIE
			He'll probably fall down.

	Gondorff appears at the doorway.

					GONDORFF
			How ya doin'?

					SINGLETON
				(eyes still glued to
				the ticker)
			Nothin' yet.  I got a good one on
			the lead at Hialeah, but he's fadin'.

					BILLIE
			Best we had was Cat's Eye in the
			second at Del Mar, and he was only
			5-2.  Not many longshots comin' in
			today.

					SINGLETON
				(excited)
			Billie.  You ready?

	Billie prepares to write on her pad.

					BILLIE
			Yeh, go ahead.

					SINGLETON
			At the finish, it's Single Action
			by two, Fasanella second, Visitation
			third.
				(reading up the sheet again)
			Line on Single Action... 3 to 2.
			Hell with it, that's no good.

	Billie crumples up the piece of paper she's been writing on
	and chucks it in a wastecan.

					GONDORFF
			We don't need big odds on this one,
			J.J.  Take anything you get at 3-1
			or better.

	Gondorff leaves the room, as Singleton turns back to his
	vigil at the ticker.

					SINGLETON
				(a little weary)
			Okay, the Fairfield Stakes at Santa
			Anita.  Mile and a quarter for 3
			year olds and up.

								CUT TO:

	THE FLOOR AREA OF THE STORE

	Everyone is in his place as before.  Today, however, Curly
	Jackson is playing the part of the aging sport.

	Well scrubbed and clean shaven, he cuts a dashing figure in
	his blue blazer and white pants.  We go to Gondorff in the
	cashier's cage.  He's talking to Niles, who's busy handing
	out fake bankrolls to members of the boost.

					GONDORFF
			He's gonna hit ya with 20 grand,
			Eddie.  How much cash we got?

					NILES
			Not enough to cover a bet that big.

					GONDORFF
			Get a couple extra guys in the
			line, then.  We'll give him the
			shut-out.

	Niles nods.

								CUT TO:

	INT. DRUGSTORE - DAY

	Lonnegan is still waiting.  He takes the 20 grand out of his
	coat pocket and thumbs through it, just to make sure it's
	all there.

								CUT TO:

	INT. THE STORE - DAY

	Singleton and Billie at the ticker again.  Billie looks a
	little sleepy.  Singleton is obviously involved with the
	progress of a race.

					SINGLETON
			Okay, Billie, here we go.

	Billie snaps to and prepares to write as Singleton reads.

					SINGLETON
			At the wire it's Wrecking Crew the
			winner by five, Grand Theft second,
			Wingless third.
				(reading up)
			Wrecking Crew was...4 to 1.
				(ripping the sheet
				out of the ticker)
			That's our boy.

	Billie and Singleton hustle out of the room.

	EXT. ALLEY

	We follow Billie through the store and across the alley to
	the building from which Twist keeps his lookout.

								CUT BACK TO:

	INT. THE STORE

	Gondorff, holding the ticker sheet Singleton has given him,
	emerges from the office and starts giving instructions to
	the boost.

					GONDORFF
			All right, Furey, your horse is
			Wingless.  Paltrow, the Big Alabama
			and Phillips'll take Grand Theft.
			Rodgers and Eirie have Wrecking
			Crew.  Jackson -- His Dandy,
			Cowan -- Change of Heart, Fiskin
			and Chappie -- Made to Order.
				(pointing to the
				Eirie Kid)
			Eirie, he gets a bang outa seein'
			you lose, so we oughta use that on
			'em.  If you play the birds of a
			feather routine we worked on, it
			should steam him up pretty good.
			You think you can handle that?

					EIRIE KID
				(a little nervous)
			Yeh, sure.

					GONDORFF
			O.K., you guys in line take your
			time, and I wanta see lotsa joy on
			Wrecking Crew.

								CUT TO:

	INT. TWIST'S ROOM - DAY

	Billie enters and gives Twist the piece of paper she wrote
	the race results on.  He picks up the phone and starts to
	dial.

								CUT TO:

	INT. DRUGSTORE - DAY

	The phone rings and Lonnegan answers it.

					VOICE
			Wrecking Crew at 4-1, Grand Theft
			to place, Made to Order to show.

	Lonnegan smiles and hangs up the phone.

								CUT TO:

	INT. THE STORE - DAY

	Lonnegan's in line at the betting window.  There are four
	people in front of him this time, and they are moving rather
	slowly.  The "Last Flash" call is heard on the speakers.

					LONNEGAN
				(getting impatient)
			C'mon, let's hurry up there.

	The man at the head of the line turns around and gives
	Lonnegan a chilling look, as if he were beneath contempt.
	He puts down $25,000 on Grand Theft.  The next man in line
	plunges down $30,000 on Wrecking Crew.

	Just as Lonnegan is about to step to the window, Gondorff
	gives a quick signal to Singleton.  The speakers come on.

					CALLER
			Ladies and Gentlemen, this is
			Arnold Rowe, your caller for the
			$100,000 Fairfield Stakes at
			Hollywood Park in Los Angeles.  A
			mile and 3/8 for three year olds
			and up.  And they're off!

					LONNEGAN
				(counting out his money)
			Twenty-thousand on Wrecking Crew.

					NILES
			I'm sorry, sir.  We can't take bets
			after the race is started.

	He points to a sign above the window, which says exactly
	that.  Lonnegan grabs up his money in disgust.

					GONDORFF
			Don't take it so hard, pal.  You
			probably woulda lost it.

	Lonnegan wanders over to the bar in a funk.

					CALLER
			And around the first turn it's
			Wrecking Crew by a half length,
			Grand Theft second by one, His
			Dandy is third by one half, followed
			by Change of Heart, Back Flip, Made
			to Order and High Ground.

	The assembled patrons are once again thoroughly involved in
	the race.  Eirie comes up to Lonnegan at the bar.

					EIRIE KID
			Who you got?

					LONNEGAN
				(half-heartedly)
			Wrecking Crew.

					EIRIE KID
			Me too.  Maybe it's our day.

	Lonnegan nods and wanders away.  Hooker comes over to him.

					HOOKER
			What happened?

					LONNEGAN
			I didn't get the bet down in time.

					HOOKER
				(pissed)
			Oh, Jesus.

								CUT TO:

	INT. STORE OFFICE

	Gondorff and Niles, back in the office.

			Looks like he's sulking.

			If we're lucky, this'll bring him
			back stronger than ever.

								CUT TO:

	THE FLOOR

					CALLER
			Coming for home, it's Wrecking Crew
			by six lengths, Made to Order is

			Order and Grand Theft.  Wrecking
			Crew wins it by five lengths, Grand
			Theft is second by a nose, Made to
			Order is third by two.  Time for
			one and 3/8 mile, 2:11 and 4/10
			seconds.

	Eirie explodes in a joyous frenzy.  He grabs Lonnegan by the
	shoulders and shakes him.

					EIRIE KID
			We won!  We won!  You hear that!  I
			won 30,000!  You hear that!

	Yeh, Lonnegan heard that.  Lonnegan shakes loose, grabs his
	coat and heads for the door.

	EXT. ALLEY - DAY

	He finds Hooker waiting for him outside.

					LONNEGAN
			Tell your friend I'll have the
			money here by post-time tomorrow.
			We'll take the first race where the
			odds are 4-1 or better.  And make
			sure I can get to that window this
			time.

					HOOKER
			How am I gonna do that?

					LONNEGAN
				(coarsely)
			I don't know, figure something out.

	Lonnegan storms across the street to his waiting car and
	drives off.  Hooker relaxes into a smile.  He's already
	figured something out.

								CUT TO:

	INT. SLEEZY DINER ACROSS FROM HOOKER'S APT. BLDG. - EVENING

	Hooker sits at the counter finishing a plate of meat loaf.
	Loretta is down at the cash register, leaning on the counter,
	looking idly out into space.  Hooker glances over at her
	every once in a while to see if she might be interested in
	striking up a little conversation.  She's not.  He finishes
	his meal and comes down to the register to pay his bill.

					HOOKER
			Meat loaf, apple pie and a cup of
			coffee.

					LORETTA
				(ringing it up)
			Sixty-five.

	Hooker gives her a dollar.  She goes to the register for
	change.

					HOOKER
			What time you get off work here?

					LORETTA
			2:00 A.M.

					HOOKER
			You doin' anything tonight?

					LORETTA
				(handing him his change)
			Yeh, sleepin'.

	Hooker figures that's enough of that.  He pockets his change
	and starts out the door, when suddenly he stops short.

	EXT. STREET

	Across the street in a doorway is the silhouette of a man.
	It's Cole.  He's pretending not to look at the diner, but
	Hooker isn't fooled.

	INT. DINER

	He goes back to Loretta at the register.

					HOOKER
			You got a back door to this place?

					LORETTA
			No.  What's wrong with the front?

					HOOKER
				(urgently now)
			Look, I don't have time to fuck
			around.  There's somebody out there
			I don't need to see.  You got a
			fire escape or anything?

					LORETTA
			No.

					HOOKER
			All right, do me a favor.  Go into
			the bathroom, open the window and
			wait for me there.

					LORETTA
			What the hell for?

					HOOKER
			Just do what I tell ya and
			everything'll be jake.

	Cracks of concern begin to appear in Loretta's marble.

					LORETTA
			What does this guy want?

					HOOKER
				(evenly)
			He'd like to kill me.

	Loretta just looks at him a second.  Realizing that this is
	no joke, she turns and walks slowly but steadily to the
	bathroom.  Hooker waits until she's out of sight.

	EXT. STREET

	Hooker goes to the front door and steps outside.  Cole looks
	up at the sound of the door.  Hooker makes a big show of
	spotting him, and runs back into the diner.  Cole, his cover
	blown, draws his gun and races across the street in pursuit.
	Arriving just in time to see --

	INT. DINER

	Hooker go into the bathroom, he charges in after him, only
	to find the place empty.  He goes quickly from stall to
	stall, on the chance that Hooker might be hiding in one of
	them.

	He comes to one that's closed, and seeing a pair of woman's
	legs under the door, rejects that, and moves on to the next
	one.

	We cut inside the stall to reveal Loretta sitting on the
	toilet with her skirt hiked up.  Right behind her, crouched
	on the back of the seat, is Hooker.

	Cole has finished his rapid inspection now, and having found
	nothing, looks around for Hooker's probable escape route.
	He sees the open window and climbs out to find himself in a
	small air shaft, from which he knows Hooker could not escape.
	Hooker, seizing the time, bursts out of the stall and runs
	back out through the diner.  Cole sees him, but too late to
	get off a shot.  He climbs back in the window and gives chase.

	EXT. STREET

	We pick up Hooker barreling down the street with Cole a
	hundred yards or so behind.  Hooker makes a sharp cut into
	an alley, and we see immediately that it's a hopeless dead
	end.  Inexplicably, he makes no attempt to run back out.

	Cole draws up and cuts into the alley, anticipating the kill
	which should be easy now.  He prepares to sight down his
	victim, when suddenly he realizes there is no victim in
	sight.  Hooker, miraculously, has vanished.  Cole scans the
	alley frantically for some trace of him.  There are no
	windows or doors at the street level.  Not even a drain pipe.
	Just brick wall.  It's impossible.  Hooker has disappeared
	into thin air.

	Cole slams his gun into his shoulder holster with a curse,
	and starts back out of the alley, when all of a sudden he
	stops in utter terror.  His mouth drops open and he chokes
	out the words:

					COLE
			Salino, hey look.  I didn't mean to
			move in on...

	Before anything else can come out, two bullets rip into his
	chest.  He falls to the concrete, coming to rest on a
	manhole cover, which we notice is slightly ajar.  We:

								CUT TO:

	THE SEWER PIPES

	Beneath the manhole.  We see Hooker making his way through
	the slop, having gained another reprieve, but unaware that
	with two down, there is still one to go.

								CUT TO:

	INT. HOOKER'S APARTMENT BUILDING - EVENING

	Hooker comes in the front entrance and goes to the elevator,
	one of the old-fashioned kind with the iron grid on the
	inside.  He's still a little rattled and waiting for the
	elevator is making him restless.  It finally arrives, and he
	steps inside, closing the grid behind him.  As he starts to
	push the button for his floor, he realizes for the first
	time that he's not alone.  He looks to the corner to find
	Snyder, holding a gun on him.  This time there's not much
	doubt that he'll use it if necessary.

								CUT TO:

	INT. THE ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - EVENING

	Snyder brings Hooker into the crate room where Capt. Polk
	and the other Agents are waiting.  Polk, as usual, has his
	coat off, revealing his shoulder holster.

					POLK
			Hello, Mr. Hooker.  Captain Polk,
			F.B.I...
				(shoving a chair over
				to him)
			Have a seat.

	Hooker remains standing.

					POLK
				(ignoring it, drinking
				from a cup)
			You want a drink or something?

					HOOKER
			No.

					POLK
			We want to talk to ya about Henry
			Gondorff.

					HOOKER
			Don't think I know him.

					POLK
			Well give yourself a couple seconds,
			crumb.  You wouldn't wanna lie to
			me.  Lt. Snyder here says you done
			a lotta griftin' in this town.

					HOOKER
			Lt. Snyder doesn't know shit.

	Capt. Polk almost laughs, but he checks it.

					HOOKER
			You got nothin' on me.

					POLK
			We'll get it, and if we can't,
			we'll just make it up.  Grand
			larceny, extortion.
				(with special emphasis)
			Counterfeiting, anything you want.

	Hooker says nothing, but it's not from defiance now.  He's
	beginning to get the picture.

					POLK
			Look, I got nothin' against you,
			but you're in trouble here.  All
			you gotta do is tell us when
			Gondorff's gonna play his chump.
			We come in at the sting, make the
			pinch, and you walk out free as a
			bird.  No questions, no court
			appearance, nothing.

					HOOKER
			No.
	


					POLK
			You've already done time twice, and
			judges don't like three time losers.
			You wanna sit in the can for forty
			years, startin' tonight?

					HOOKER
			I'll make parole.

					POLK
			Like hell.  You won't even get a
			review till you're seventy.  And if
			the board starts to go soft, we'll
			let ya out in the yard some night
			with a hard-nose young bull who'll
			put fifty slugs in your face and
			ask what you were doin' there later.

	Hooker wants to come back with something, but can't find it.

					POLK
			Don't be a sap, kid.  You could
			save us a little trouble.  But
			Henry Gondorff is through whether
			you help us or not.  There's
			nothin' left to do now but save
			yourself.

	Hooker's thoroughly whipped.  He sits down for the first time.

					HOOKER
				(softly)
			Will you wait until the chump is
			played?

					POLK
			Hell yes.  We don't care about the
			mark.  He deserves what he gets.

					HOOKER
				(with heat)
			I mean completely played.  Until
			he's beat and the score is taken.
			You come in before we beat him and
			I'll kill him.  You'll have a tough
			time explaining that, won't ya.

					POLK
			All right, Hooker, but you take it
			on the lam, and we'll shoot you
			down on sight.

					HOOKER
				(barely audible)
			Just as long as I get to finish the
			play.

								CUT TO:

	INT. GONDORFF'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Gondorff and Hooker are playing gin rummy and drinking.
	Gondorff makes little comments as he plays, but Hooker is
	quiet and withdrawn.  The carousel is not in operation and a
	heavy silence hangs over the place.

					GONDORFF
			What's the matter, kid?  You're not
			sayin' much.

					HOOKER
			Just a little nervous, that's all.

					GONDORFF
			Luther always told me to bite my
			toenails when I get nervous.  You
			see yourself doin' that and you
			realize it ain't worth it.

	Hooker smiles feebly.

	Billie appears at the door.

					BILLIE
			Things are a little slow tonight,
			Henry.  I wanna open the round for
			the girls.

	Gondorff takes out a set of keys and tosses them to her.
	She leaves to go start the merry-go-round.  Gondorff settles
	back into the game.

					GONDORFF
			Take it easy, you won't lose him
			now.  We had him 10 years ago when
			he decided to be somebody.  Believe
			me, I've seen enough to know.

					HOOKER
				(softly)
			How many guys you conned in your
			life, Henry?

					GONDORFF
			Two or three hundred I guess.
			Sometimes played two a day when I
			was in Shea's mob.  We had it down
			to a business.
				(pause)
			'Course Chicago was a right town
			then.  The fix was in.  The dicks
			took their end without a beef.  All
			the Wall Street boys wanted to make
			investments for us.  Even had marks
			looking us up, thinkin' they could
			beat the game.
				(pause)
			Yeh, kid, it really stunk.  No
			sense in bein' a grifter if it's
			the same as bein' a citizen.

	Gondorff chucks his cards on the table.  He's through for
	the night.

					GONDORFF
			I better do some packin'.  I'm
			gonna be a hot number again after
			tomorrow.

					HOOKER
			Then why you doin' it?

					GONDORFF
			Seems worthwhile, doesn't it?
			Maybe it's just for the cave-in on
			Lonnegan's face when we put in the
			sting.

	That's good enough.  Hooker gets up to leave.

					HOOKER
			Henry.

					HOOKER
			Yeh.

					HOOKER
				(apologetically)
			I appreciate your stickin' your
			neck out.  I wouldn't have asked ya
			if it weren't for Luther.

					GONDORFF
			Ain't nothin' gonna make up for
			Luther, kid.
				(pause)
			Revenge is for suckers.  I been
			griftin' 30 years and never got any.

	Hooker just nods and walks out the door.

	INT. CAROUSEL

	We follow him past the Carousel which is now full of giggling
	prostitutes in various stages of undress.  Their childish
	frolicking is charming from a group usually so jaded, but
	it's lost on Hooker tonight.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. A CITY STREET - NIGHT

	It's late now and the street is deserted save for an
	occasional derelict or streetwalker on her way home from a
	night's work.  We pick up Hooker coming down the street
	toward his apartment building.  He walks slowly, almost
	reluctantly, as if he didn't care whether he ever got there
	or not.

	As he nears his building, he notices Loretta coming out of
	the diner across the street.  He stops and watches as she
	looks up and disappears into an adjacent building that
	advertises rooms for rent.  After a few seconds, we see a
	light come on in one of its second story windows.

	Hooker just stands there a second, debating with himself,
	trying to figure out a reason for doing what he's going to
	do anyway.  We follow him across the street to Loretta's
	building and:

	INT. LORRETA'S

	He goes up the stairs to the room where the light came on.
	He passes a couple of derelicts on the way.  He knocks twice
	and Loretta answers in her bathrobe.  She is more than a
	little startled to see him.

					LORETTA
			Looks like he missed ya.

					HOOKER
			Yeh, this time anyway.

	Loretta notices an old busybody peeping out at them from her
	room across the hall.

					LORETTA
			Good night, Mrs. Hillard.

	Mrs. Hillard quickly closes her door.

					HOOKER
				(shuffling a little)
			I, ah...thought you might wanna
			come out for a while.  Maybe have a
			drink or somethin'.

					LORETTA
			You move right along, don't ya.

					HOOKER
				(with more innocence
				than confidence)
			I don't mean nothin' by it.  I just
			don't know many regular girls,
			that's all.

					LORETTA
			And you expect me to come over,
			just like that.

					HOOKER
			If I expected somethin', I wouldn't
			be still standin' out here in the
			hall.

	Loretta looks at him carefully.  She knows it's not a line.

					LORETTA
				(with less resistance now)
			I don't even know you.

					HOOKER
				(slowly)
			You know me.  I'm just like you...
			It's two in the morning and I don't
			know nobody.

	The two just stand there in silence a second.  There's
	nothing more to say.  She stands back and lets him in.

								CUT TO:

	INT. GONDORFF'S ROOM - NIGHT

	A record spinning lazily on an old phonograph.  We hear
	Robert Johnson's "Come On In My Kitchen." Gondorff is
	sitting up in bed, with his hat on, lost in thought.  Billie
	is curled up asleep next to him.  There's a packed suitcase
	next to the bed.  Billie wakes up and turns over a second.
	


					BILLIE
			C'mon, Henry, knock off.  You've
			done everything you can.

	Gondorff nods his agreement like a zombie and goes right on
	thinking.

								CUT TO:

	LORRETA'S ROOM

	Hooker and Loretta are asleep against each other, their
	bodies illuminated every few seconds by the light from a
	neon sign across the street.  We dolly to the window and
	move in on another window in the building next door.  There's
	no light on in it, but we can discern the basic outline of a
	face behind the curtains, which are slightly parted to
	afford a view of Hooker's room by a black-gloved hand.

				"I said come on in my kitchen
			Cause it's gonna be rainin' outdoors."

	Music ends.

								FADE OUT.

	FADE IN:

	THE STING

								FADE OUT.

	FADE IN:

	We open on Hooker in bed, the morning sun streaming in on
	his face.  He awakens slowly, looks at the ceiling for a
	second and, remembering last night, turns to the side to
	find that Loretta is no longer there.  Still drowsy, he gets
	out of bed and looks around the room for a note or some
	evidence of her continued presence.  He opens an empty
	closet, then opens empty drawers.  Finding nothing, he
	suddenly hits on another possibility, and looks in his
	wallet.  The money is still there.  Almost disappointed, he
	slumps down in a chair, as the harsh reality of what will
	happen this day floods back in on him.  Music begins and we:

								CUT TO:

	INT. AN UNKNOWN LOCATION - DAY

	We see the black-gloved hand opening a small wooden box.
	Wrapped inside is a shiny black revolver, at this point in
	two pieces.  The hand reaches in and takes them out.

								CUT TO:

	INT. THE SLEEZY DINER - DAY

	Hooker is poking at a plate of waffles and sausage.  The
	waitress on duty is not Loretta and Hooker has noticed.

								CUT TO:

	INT. GONDORFF'S ROOM - DAY

	Gondorff is standing in front of the bathroom mirror,
	putting on his tuxedo.  He goes to his dresser, pulls out a
	very small gun and tucks it in his cummerbund.

								CUT TO:

	THE GUNNMAN'S ROOM AGAIN

	The hand swirls a pipe cleaner inside the barrel of the
	revolver and picks some lint out of the chamber.  He then
	screws the barrel onto the body.  This is all seen in closeup.

								CUT TO:

	HOOKER'S ROOM AGAIN

	Hooker now has his tuxedo on.  He takes two small rubber
	bladders out of a drawer and puts them in his pocket.

								CUT TO:

	INT. LONNEGAN'S SUITE - DAY

	Lonnegan paces nervously around the room, looking at the
	clock.  Obviously waiting for something, he's getting
	extremely impatient.

								CUT TO:

	THE GUNNMAN'S ROOM AGAIN

	We watch the hand carefully loading bullets into the chamber
	of the revolver.

								CUT TO:

	INT. THE CAROUSEL BUILDING - DAY

	Gondorff emerges from his room carrying his suitcase.  He
	stops and looks up at the mezzanine where Billie is standing.
	They smile sadly at each other and give a simple wave,
	having done this too many times to get sentimental about it
	now.  Gondorff walks out of the building.

								CUT TO:

	HOOKER'S ROOM AGAIN

	Hooker is busily stuffing all his possessions in a paper
	bag, lumping clothes with food, records and toilet articles.

								CUT TO:

	LONNEGAN'S SUITE AGAIN

	Lonnegan goes to the door to admit Floyd and two assistants,
	one of whom carries a large brief case.  Lonnegan takes the
	brief case to a table and opens it.  Inside is a half
	million dollars in cash.

								CUT TO:

	INT. THE GUNNMAN'S ROOM AGAIN

	We see the hand putting a silencer on the revolver.  The
	gunman puts the revolver up to his eye to check the alignment
	and for the first time we see the face that goes with the
	hand.  It is fully as menacing as we had imagined: Broad,
	flat nose, thick cracked lips, narrow eyes and cauliflower
	ears.

								CUT TO:

	HOOKER'S ROOM AGAIN

	Hooker is on the phone now.

	INT. WAREHOUSE

	We see that he's talking to Captain Polk.  Snyder listens
	also.

	HOOKER'S ROOM

	Hooker finishes the conversation, hangs up and goes to take
	one last look at himself in the mirror.  Finding everything
	in order, he grabs up his sack of possessions and leaves the
	room.

	EXT. HOOKER'S APARTMENT

	We pick him up emerging from the building, and follow him
	around the corner to a secluded alley which he generally
	takes on his way to the store.  As he walks along, he
	notices Loretta coming toward him from the other end.  She's
	wearing a coat, obviously on her way somewhere.  As she
	comes closer, we move to reveal the gunman appearing suddenly
	in the alley behind and to the right of Hooker.

	EXT. ALLEYWAY

	The gunman quickly takes out his revolver, braces it in the
	crook of his hand, and takes careful aim.  Loretta sees him.
	The gunman fires.  Loretta falls dead on the asphalt.

	Hooker spins around in confusion.  The gunman moves quickly
	toward him.  Hooker starts to back up but the gunman stops
	when he gets to Loretta.  He kicks her over to reveal a gun
	under her body.

					GUNMAN
			She was gonna kill ya, kid.

	Hooker is stunned.  He can't believe it.

					GUNMAN
				(dragging the body
				over behind a trash can)
			Her name's Loretta Salino.
			Lonnegan's people set her up in the
			diner.  C'mon, let's get outa here.

	Hooker wants to stay and try to figure it all out, but the
	gunman drags him away.

								CUT TO:

	INT. THE ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY

	Polk, Snyder and several federal agents are busy putting on
	their shoulder holsters, and checking their weapons.

					POLK
				(to Snyder)
			Whoever Gondorff's playin' for is
			bound to be a wheel.  As soon as
			we're inside, I want you to get the
			guy outa there as fast as possible,
			before the reporters show up.  We
			can't afford to embarrass any big
			shots.

	Snyder nods.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. LONNEGAN'S HOTEL - DAY

	Lonnegan, carrying the brief case personally, is seen
	getting into his limousine.  Four assistants get in with him.

								CUT TO:

	INT. THE STORE - DAY

	Gondorff enters the store carrying his suitcase.  Several of
	the boost are already there.  Gondorff clasps his hands to
	generate a little enthusiasm.  He's obviously up for this one.

								CUT TO:

	INT. TAXI CAB - DAY

	Hooker sits in the back seat with the gunman right next to
	him.  He's still very uneasy with this man.

					HOOKER
			She coulda killed me last night.

					GUNMAN
			Too many people coulda seen ya go
			in her room.  She was a professional.
			Used to work in the Dutch Schultz
			gang.

					HOOKER
			Who are you?

					GUNMAN
			Gondorff asked me to look after ya.

					HOOKER
			How do I know you're tellin' the
			truth.

					GUNMAN
			Don't have much choice, do ya?

	We go to Hooker.  No, he doesn't.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. THE ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY

	We pick up Polk, Snyder and the other federal agents coming
	out of the warehouse in their white skimmers, and piling
	into cars.

								CUT TO:

	THE STORE AGAIN

	Niles is busily spreading "boodles" all over the cashier's
	area.  Singleton checks his microphone.  It works fine.  He
	checks it again.

								CUT TO:

	LONNEGAN IN HIS LIMOUSINE

	He holds the brief case in his lap, his fingers tapping
	lightly on it.

								CUT TO:

	THE STORE AGAIN

	Hooker and the gunman enter and go over to Gondorff, who
	breaks into a wide smile.  Hooker returns it halfheartedly,
	still ill at ease about what has happened.

								CUT TO:

	THE F.B.I. CARS ON THEIR WAY

	There are four or five driving in a column.  Snyder and Polk
	ride together in the back of the lead car.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. THE DRUGSTORE - DAY

	Lonnegan's limousine pulls up outside, and the bodyguards
	pile out.

								CUT TO:

	THE STORE AGAIN

	Gondorff, Hooker and the others waiting, the tension
	expressed in their faces.

	INT. THE DRUGSTORE - DAY

	Lonnegan sits tensely in the usual booth.  He keeps both
	hands firmly planted on the brief case.  The phone rings and
	Lonnegan goes to it.  Music ends.

					VOICE
			Place it on Syphon at 8-1.

	Lonnegan hangs up with the look of the financial killer.
	Eight to one odds is more than even he could have hoped for.

	EXT. STREET

	We follow Lonnegan across the street and into the store.
	The bodyguards remain outside.
	


INT. THE STORE

	The store is buzzing with activity.  Money and booze are
	everywhere.  The sheet writer and the boardmarker can hardly
	keep up with the action.  Lonnegan walks quickly to the
	betting line and finds to his relief that there's only one
	man ahead of him.  The man puts $25,000 on King's Image.

	Lonnegan steps to the window, swings up the brief case, and
	opens it for Niles to see.

					LONNEGAN
				(straight-faced)
			Five hundred grand on Syphon.

	Niles is struck dumb.  He's never seen that much money before.

					NILES
				(playing the flustered
				clerk)
			Hold on, I'll have to get the
			manager.

	Niles goes and returns with Gondorff.

					GONDORFF
			What's the problem?

					NILES
				(pointing to the
				brief case)
			He wants to put a half million on
			Syphon.

	Gondorff looks at the money a second and then looks up at
	Lonnegan like he's gotta be crazy.

					GONDORFF
				(uneasily)
			I can't lay that off in time.  We
			lose a bet that big, it could break
			us.

					LONNEGAN
				(challenging)
			If ya win it could make ya, too.

					GONDORFF
				(to Niles)
			What are the odds on Syphon?

					NILES
			Eight to one.

	Gondorff looks at Lonnegan long and hard.

					GONDORFF
			A half mill on an eight to one shot.
			You're dumber than I thought,
			Lonnegan.

					LONNEGAN
			You're more gutless than I thought.

	The words "Last Flash" are heard on the speaker.  Gondorff
	looks at Lonnegan with utter contempt.  He turns to Niles.

					GONDORFF
				(chopped)
			Take it.

	Niles hurriedly writes out a slip for 500,000 dollars.
	Lonnegan, allowing himself a sly smile, picks it up and
	retires to a nearby table.  He flashes a little okay sign to
	Hooker who acknowledges it with a nod.

					CALLER
			Ladies and gentlemen, this is
			Arnold Rowe, your caller for the
			San Antonio Handicap at Pimlico in
			Baltimore -- A mile and 1/16 for
			three-year-olds.  And they're off.

	Lonnegan takes a deep breath and leans forward in his chair,
	the larceny boiling in his veins.  Hooker looks to Gondorff.
	Gondorff gives him the "office." Hooker has to smile.

					CALLER
			And around the first turn it's
			King's Image by a neck, Syphon is
			second by one, Key to the Vault
			third by one half, followed by Mr.
			Moonlight, Red Ridge, Moneyman and
			No Charge.

	Unexpectedly, Kid Twist bursts in through the entrance.
	Barely able to control his enthusiasm, he hurries over to
	Lonnegan's table and sits down next to him.

					TWIST
			Sorry, but I just couldn't wait.
			Did everything go all right?
	


					LONNEGAN
				(motioning for him to
				keep his voice down)
			Take it easy.  Everything's all
			right.  I put it on Syphon, on the
			nose.

					TWIST
				(in utter horror)
			On the nose!  I said place.  Place
			it on Syphon.  That horse is going
			to run second.

	Lonnegan looks like he's just been stabbed.  He vaults over
	the table to the teller's window and grabs Niles.

					LONNEGAN
			You give me my goddamn money back!
			You hear me?  There's been a mistake!

					NILES
			I'm sorry, sir.  The betting's
			closed.

	Lonnegan begins to shake him violently.

					LONNEGAN
			You give me my money back.  There's
			been a mistake, do you hear me?

	Gondorff leaps to Niles' aid when suddenly there is a crash
	at the entrance door, and Polk, Snyder and eight federal
	agents burst into the room, guns drawn.  The place falls
	silent except for the loudspeaker, the members of the boost
	afraid to move.  Gondorff and Niles look at each other
	wondering how this could have possibly happened.

					POLK
				(motioning to Hooker)
			All right, Hooker, you can go.

	Hooker's eyes go to Gondorff, who looks back at him in utter
	disbelief, the betrayal raging in his features.  Hooker,
	unable to meet his gaze, lowers his head and starts to walk
	out.  Almost unnoticed, there's a flash of movement at
	Gondorff's belt.  A small gun.  A shot.  Hooker clutches his
	back and falls dead on the floor, the blood spurting from
	his mouth.  Polk, reacting instantly, pours four shots into
	Gondorff, who goes down in a heap.  Pandemonium breaks loose.
	The members of the boost race for the door.  Lonnegan is
	totally stunned.  First he lost his money and now he's
	involved in a murder.  Snyder rushes over to him.

					SNYDER
			C'mon.  We gotta get you outa here.

	EXT. STREET

	Snyder drags him through the crowd and out onto the street
	where an F.B.I. car is waiting.  His bodyguards have long
	since fled at the sight of the F.B.I. men.

					LONNEGAN
			My money's back there.

					SNYDER
			We'll worry about that later.

	Snyder gets in beside Lonnegan, and the car speeds away.

								CUT TO:

	INSIDE THE STORE AGAIN

	The pandemonium has now ceased.  Those who could escape
	have; the rest are lined up against the wall in frisking
	position.  Gondorff and Hooker lie on the floor dead.  The
	loudspeaker drones on.  Singleton is still calling the race
	from his booth, apparently oblivious to what's happened.

					CALLER
			And the winner is King's Image by
			four lengths, Syphon is second, by
			two, Moneyman third by two and one
			half.  Time for 1 and 1/16 miles,
			1:21 and 2/10 seconds.

	Polk walks slowly over to Hooker's body and bends down.

					POLK
			He's gone.

	Hooker opens his eyes and slowly drags himself up off the
	floor, spitting out a little rubber bladder, filled with
	blood, that he's had in his mouth.  Gondorff does likewise.
	Niles, Twist, Singleton and the rest of the boost begin to
	laugh and shake hands, as do the Federal Agents.

					GONDORFF
				(to Polk)
			Nice con, Hickey.  I thought you
			were Feds myself, when you first
			came in.

					HICKEY
			No problem, Henry.  Snyder went for
			it all the way.
				(laughing)
			You shoulda seen the rag he lit
			under Lonnegan.

	Gondorff turns to the others.

					GONDORFF
			Okay, let's take this place apart
			and get outa here.  You can get
			your splits from Eddie at Boudreau's
			tonight.

	Gondorff walks over to Hooker, who's wiping the blood off
	his face and hands.

					GONDORFF
			You beat him, kid.

					HOOKER
				(softly)
			You were right, Henry.  It's not
			enough... But it's close.

					GONDORFF
			You wanta wait for your share?

					HOOKER
			Naw, I'd just blow it.

	Gondorff nods, and walks slowly to behind the bar.  He comes
	out with his suitcase in one hand and Hooker's paper bag in
	another.  He throws the paper bag to Hooker, who stops by
	the door.  Eirie Kid is standing there.  Hooker gives the
	"office" to Eirie, who beams and gives it back.

	EXT. ALLEY AND STREET

	Then Hooker and Gondorff leave.  We hold on them, two
	ragtail grifters again as they walk off down the street and
	disappear around the corner.

								FADE OUT.

				Second Draft Screenplay

					THE STING

	FADE IN:

	A white on black TITLE appears in the lower left hand corner
	of the screen:

	AUGUST, 1936

								FADE OUT.

	FADE IN:

	EXT. A SLUM AREA OF JOLIET - DAY

	It's a bleak, windy morning, the kind that clears the
	streets of all but the winos (who carry their own heaters),
	and the point-men for juvenile gangs.  We pick up a solitary
	figure, Joe Mottola, coming down the street and entering
	what appears to be an abandoned tenement.  He pauses a
	second to dust his white-winged alligator shoes on the back
	of his pants leg.  Sharply dressed and surrounded by the
	aura of one who is making money for the first time and
	broadcasting it on all bands, he seems an incongruity in
	this part of town.

	We follow him up a flight of rickety stairs to a second
	floor flat.  He knocks on the door, is admitted by a cautious
	doorman.

	INT. NUMBERS SPOT - DAY

	Suddenly we are plunged into a room of chattering, clamoring
	people.  This is a spot for the numbers racket, a place
	immune from legal interference, where any sucker can bet on
	a number between 1 and 1000 in the hope of getting the 600
	to 1 payoff that goes to those few who guess right.  The
	bettors are queued up in several lines before a long table,
	where they place their bets and are given receipts in return.
	Others wait at a cashier's window to pick up previous
	earnings or to ask for credit.

	Mottola moves through the crowd to a back room where betting
	slips are being sorted and money counted under the watchful
	and somewhat impatient gaze of a Supervisor, an older man
	named Mr. Granger.  The Yankee-White Sox game is heard on
	the radio in the background.

	Mottola, noticing that his entrance has aroused little
	interest, saunters over to the Phone Girl and gives her a
	little pinch on the cheek.  The girl slaps his hand away,
	obviously having been through this before.

					PHONE GIRL
			Beat it, Mottola.

	Granger glances up and exchanges a token nod with Mottola,
	who plops down in a folding chair next to the radio.  The
	phone rings.

					PHONE GIRL
			8720...Yes, hold on a second.
				(calling over to the Supervisor)
			Mr. Granger, Chicago on the line.


	Granger is a little apprehensive about talking to Chicago,
	but takes the phone anyway.

					GRANGER
			Yeh?

								CUT TO:

	INT. A WATERFRONT PROCESSING PLANT - CHICAGO - DAY

	A flabby, bald man named Combs is on the other end of the
	line.  Visible beyond the door and interior window of his
	office is a large room, cluttered with tables, typewriters,
	clerks and adding machines.  This room is the clearinghouse
	for all the transaction of the numbers game.  All the
	betting slips and income from the spots are brought in here
	and processed.

					COMBS
			Granger, this is Combs.  Why
			haven't we heard from ya?  Everybody
			else is in.

					GRANGER
			We had a few problems with the Law
			this morning.  The Mayor promised
			the Jaycees to get tough on the
			rackets again, so he shut everybody
			down for a couple hours to make it
			look good.  Nothing serious, it
			just put us a little behind for the
			day.

					COMBS
			You been making your payoffs,
			haven't ya?

					GRANGER
			Hell yes.  He does this every year.
			There's nothing to worry about.

					COMBS
			Okay, finish your count and get it
			up here as soon as you can.  I
			don't wanta be here all night.

					GRANGER
			Believe me, the Man's gonna be real
			happy.  Looks like we cleared over
			ten grand this week.

					COMBS
				(not impressed)
			We cleared 22 here.

					GRANGER
			Well, hell, you got the whole
			Chicago south side.  How do ya
			expect the eight lousy spots I've
			got to compete with that?

					COMBS
				(reading off a sheet
				of paper on his desk)
			They did 14 grand in Evanston, 16.5
			is Gary, and 20 in Cicero.  Looks
			like you're bringing up the rear,
			Granger.

	INT. NUMBERS SPOT - DAY

	Granger burns inside.  One of the girls who's been sorting
	and counting hands him a slip of paper.

					GRANGER
			I just got the count.  We'll put
			the take on the 4:15.

					COMBS
			We'll be waitin'.

	Combs hangs up, smiling to himself, proud of the way he gave
	the needle to Granger.

								CUT TO:

	INT. NUMBERS SPOT - DAY

	Granger storming over to a safe and jerking open the door.

					GRANGER
				(snapping)
			Mottola.

	Mottola hustles out of his chair.

					GRANGER
				(handing him a bundle
				of bills)
			Take this up to the city on the
			4:15.  They'll be waitin' for it at
			the clearing house.  And don't stop
			for no drinks.  You can get a cab
			down the street.

	Mottola takes the money and slips it into his inside coat
	pocket with all the dramatic flair of the true flunky.  No
	one would ever guess that he was just an overdressed
	messenger boy.

	EXT. OF THE TENEMENT AGAIN

	Mottola emerges from a side entrance into a narrow alley.
	He walks briskly down to the end and turns left into a large
	alleyway; this one connecting two streets.  The alley is
	deserted save for one scruffy, slovenly dressed young
	stranger coming toward him from the opposite direction.  The
	man carries a battered suitcase and seems to be in a hurry.

	Suddenly, Mottola hears shouting coming from somewhere
	behind him.  He turns around to see a small, weathered
	looking thief come racing around the corner and down the
	alley toward him, frantically pursued by a gray-haired black
	man.  Limping noticeably, the black man manages a few cries
	for help and then stumbles and falls.  The stranger yells at
	Mottola to cover his side of the alley, and then readies
	himself for the arrival of the thief.  Mottola just stands
	there, not the least interested in the exercise of justice.
	Just as the thief is about to run on by, the stranger throws
	his suitcase at the little man's legs, sending him sprawling
	and separating him from the wallet he's been carrying in his
	left hand.

	The stranger makes a dash for the wallet and kicks it back
	to where Mottola is standing.  Almost by reflex, Mottola
	picks it up.  The thief scrambles to his feet and starts
	back toward his new-found enemy, brandishing a knife.  Both
	the stranger and Mottola brace themselves for an attack.
	The thief, realizing that there are two people to fight,
	begins to think better of it.  He is not a young man, nor
	particularly strong.

					THIEF
				(shaking his fist at
				the stranger)
			You fuckin' nigger-lover.  I'll get
			you for this someday, sucker egg.

	Mottola and the stranger exchange glances of relief as the
	thief flees out onto the street and disappears.

	The black man, meanwhile, has struggled to his feet and is
	staggering toward them.  He collapses against the alley wall
	after a few steps.  The stranger rushes over to him, followed
	somewhat absently by Mottola.

					BLACK MAN
			The wallet.  You gotta go after him.
			He's got all the money.

					STRANGER
			Don't worry, we got the wallet.
			What happened?  He get ya with the
			knife?

	The stranger opens the Black Man's coat to reveal a bloody
	wound at the top of his leg.

					BLACK MAN
				(trying to move)
			Give it to me!  Please.  I gotta
			know it's all there!

					STRANGER
			You just sit tight, old man.  We're
			gonna have to get you to a doctor.
				(starting to leave)
			I'll call a cop.

					BLACK MAN
			No, no cops!

	Mottola has given him his wallet, which the black man now
	opens, disclosing a fat bundle of bills tied by a rubber
	band.  Mottola and the stranger are amazed by the amount of
	money.

					STRANGER
				(a little uneasy)
			You wanted by the law or somethin'?

					BLACK MAN
			Naw, it's okay.

					STRANGER
			You're crazy carryin' that kinda
			money in this neighborhood.  No
			wonder you got hit.

					BLACK MAN
				(trying to get to his feet)
			Thanks.  I'm obliged to ya, but I
			gotta get goin'.
				(his leg gives way
				under him)

					STRANGER
			You ain't goin' nowhere on that leg.

					BLACK MAN
			I gotta!  Look, I run some slots
			down in West Bend for a mob here.
			I got a little behind on my payoffs
			so they figure I been holdin' out
			on 'em.  They gave me to 4:00 to
			come up with the cash.  I don't get
			it there I'm dead.

					STRANGER
			It don't look good, gramps, it's
			ten of now.

					BLACK MAN
			I got a hundred bucks for you and
			your friend if you deliver the
			money for me.

					STRANGER
				(hesitates)
			I dunno.  That little mug that got
			ya is mad enough at me already --
			what if he's out there waitin'
			around a corner with some friends.

					BLACK MAN
			He won't know you're carryin' it.
			C'mon, you gotta help me out.

					STRANGER
				(makes up his mind)
			Sorry, pal.  I'll fix you up, call
			you a doc, but I ain't gonna walk
			into a bunch of knives for ya.

					BLACK MAN
				(desperate to Mottola)
			How bout you?  I'll give you the
			whole hundred!

					STRANGER
			What makes you think you can trust
			him?  He didn't do shit.

					MOTTOLA
			Hey, butt out, chicken liver.  I
			gave him back his wallet, didn't I?
				(to black man)
			How far is this place?

					BLACK MAN
			1811 Mason.  Put it in Box 3C.  You
			won't have no trouble.  There's
			five thousand dollars there and
			here's a hundred for you.

					MOTTOLA
				(taking the bundle of
				bills from the black
				man, plus the $100 bill)
			All right.  I'll make your drop for
			you, old man.  And don't worry, you
			can trust me.

	Mottola puts the bills in his inside coat pocket, right next
	to the numbers money.  The stranger, who has now finished
	bandaging, watches him do it.

					STRANGER
			If that punk and his pals decide to
			search ya, you'll never fool 'em
			carryin' it there.

					BLACK MAN
				(suddenly afraid again)
			What do we do?

					STRANGER
			You got a bag or somethin?

					BLACK MAN
			No.

					STRANGER
			How 'bout a handkerchief?

					BLACK MAN
			Here.

	The stranger goes into the right coat pocket and pulls out a
	wrinkled handkerchief.

					STRANGER
			Let me have the money.

	Mottola takes out the Black Man's five grand and hands it to
	the Stranger.  He puts it in the handkerchief.

					STRANGER
			You better stick that other in here
			too, if you wanta keep it.
	


					BLACK MAN
				(pleading)
			Just hurry, will ya.

	Mottola pulls out the numbers money and puts it in the
	handkerchief too.  The stranger ties it all up.

					STRANGER
				(demonstrating by
				slipping the bundle
				down into crotch)
			All right.  Carry it down in your
			pants here.
				(pulling it back out
				and tucking it in
				Mottola's pants)
			Ain't no hard guy in the world
			gonna frisk ya there.

					MOTTOLA
			Thanks.
				(to the black man)
			So long, partner.  Don't worry,
			everything's gonna be all right.

	The Black Man nods gratefully, but there's still a trace of
	worry on his face.  Mottola trots off down the alley and out
	onto the street, glancing around cautiously for signs of
	trouble.  He walks hurriedly down the sidewalk toward the
	cab stand in the distance.  Suddenly the little man with the
	knife appears out of a doorway about 15 yards behind him.
	Mottola notices him and quickens his pace, finally breaking
	into a dead run.

	We follow him as he dashes headlong down the street, opening
	a big lead on the guy with the knife.  He reaches the taxi
	zone.  He hops in a cab and slams the door.

	INT. TAXI - DAY

	He jumps in, closes the door, and breathes a sigh of relief.

					CABBIE
			Where to?

					MOTTOLA
			Which way is Mason?

					CABBIE
			About 20 blocks south.

					MOTTOLA
			Okay, go north.  The Joliet
			Station -- Fast.
	


Mottola settles back in his seat and starts to laugh.

					CABBIE
			What's so funny?

					MOTTOLA
			I just made the world's easiest
			five grand.

	He takes the bundle out from inside his pants in order to
	gaze upon his new-found fortune.  He unties the handkerchief.
	It's full of toilet paper.  Mottola looks like he's just
	been shot.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. ALLEY - DAY - THE STRANGER AND BLACK MAN

	hightailing it down the street, two newly solvent con
	artists on the lam.  It's hard to run they're laughing so
	hard.  The stranger chucks his suitcase in a trash can and
	pulls the real handkerchief out of his pants.

					BLACK MAN
			Jesus, what a bundle.  Did you know
			he was that loaded?

					STRANGER
			Hell no, I just cut into him.  I
			woulda settled for pawning one of
			them shoes.

	As they split off, music begins, and we go into a

	TITLES SEQUENCE

	Done to a driving Chicago blues, the sequence is designed to
	establish somewhat the milieu of the stranger, known to
	friends and enemies alike as Hooker.  We see the following:

	EXT. PAWNSHOP - LOOKING INSIDE - DAY

	Hooker is getting a radio and well-worn suit out of hook.
	It's like seeing old friends again.  All pantomime.

	INT. HOOKER'S ROOM - DAY

	A shabby little place he rents above a cigar store.  We pick
	him up in a jerry-built outdoor shower, which he's rigged up
	on the fire escape.  The rinse water drips down through the
	landing into the grimy alley below.

					HOOKER
				(singing)
			'With plenty of money and you-oo-
			oo,
			Oh baby, what I wouldn't do-oo-
			oo...'

	ON THE STREET AGAIN

	jauntily carrying a magnum of champagne and some flowers,
	obviously on his way to see someone special.

	IN A BURLESQUE HOUSE

	Hooker stands in the wings holding the flowers and champagne,
	watching his date for the evening, a 6'3" stripper named
	Crystal, do her routine.

	Crystal finishes up and comes off the stage.

					CRYSTAL
				(tired)
			Hi, Hooker, you gettin' married or
			somethin'?

					HOOKER
			Come into a little dough.  You
			wanna get outa here tonight?

					CRYSTAL
			Can't.  I got a 10 o'clock show.  I
			need the five bucks.

					HOOKER
			I'll spend fifty on ya.

	Crystal looks at him a second and starts to giggle.  We're
	pretty sure she's gonna get outa here tonight.

	COMING INTO A POOR MAN'S GAMBLING JOINT

	Little more than a reconverted brick basement, the place
	contains three shoddy, homemade roulette tables.  Hooker,
	accompanied now by Crystal, nods a greeting to the doorman
	and proceeds to a table where there are already several
	other people laying their bets for the next spin.  Hooker
	knows the wheel man, an old-timer named Jimmy.

					JIMMY
				(glad to see him)
			Hooker!

					HOOKER
			How ya doin', Jimmy.
	


					JIMMY
				(collecting bets and
				paying off the winners)
			Ain't seen you in months, boy.
			Thought maybe you took a fall.

					HOOKER
			Naw, just a little hard times,
			that's all.  It's all over now.

					JIMMY
			You gonna have a go here?
				(pointing to the
				betting board)
			How 'bout a ten spot on the line
			here.  The 4-9 been lookin' good
			today.  Lotsa action on 28th Street
			down there, too.  Pay ya 10-1.

	As Jimmy finishes his spiel, he starts the wheel spinning
	and drops in the ball.  Betting is allowed to continue until
	the ball drops from the outer ring into the center.

					HOOKER
				(taking out his wallet)
			Three grand on the black.

	Jimmy is stunned.  The others at the table, used to dollar
	bets, look at Hooker like he's some kind of foreign dignitary.

					JIMMY
				(worried)
			You sure you wanna start off that
			big?  Bet like that could put a
			real dent in us.

					HOOKER
			I feel lucky tonight.

					JIMMY
			Aw, come on, Hooker, why don't you
			just...

					HOOKER
			Three grand on the black, Jimmy.

	Jimmy wants to argue some more, but the ball is getting
	ready to drop into the center.  We see Jimmy quickly press a
	hidden lever under the table with his foot.  The ball falls
	and settles into red 27 with a motion that is not quite
	right.  The others at the table fail to notice, but Hooker
	is not fooled.  He stares venomously at Jimmy, who knows
	that Hooker is on to him.

					JIMMY
			Sorry, Hooker.
				(making an attempt at
				levity, in order to explain)
			Good thing that ball came up red.
			Guy could get in trouble around
			here, losin' a bet that big.

	Jimmy reaches for Hooker's money.  Hooker stops him by
	putting his hand on it.

					HOOKER
			Spin it again.

	Jimmy doesn't know what the hell to do.  He gives Hooker a
	little head motion to indicate a small window high up in one
	of the walls.  Behind it, we see a pair of eyes.  Suddenly,
	Hooker understands why Jimmy had to cheat him, but it
	doesn't change his demand.

					HOOKER
			Spin it anyway, Jimmy.

	Jimmy is beside himself.  If he doesn't spin again, Hooker
	may expose him.  If he does spin, and loses, his management
	will fire him.  He pleads to Hooker with his eyes, but it's
	no use.  Jimmy spins the wheel and reluctantly drops in the
	ball.  This time there is no foot on the lever, and it
	settles into black 15.  Hooker stares at the ball a second
	and then looks up at his terrified friend.

					HOOKER
			Don't worry, pal.  I knew it was my
			night.

	Hooker pushes the money over to Jimmy and walks out of the
	room.  He's lost $3,000, but he's still working on a lucky
	night.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. GAMBLING JOINT

	Hooker and Crystal out on the street.

					CRYSTAL
				(irritated)
			Thanks for the evening, Hooker.  I
			can still make the 10 o'clock.  If
			you wanna spend 50 bucks on me
			again, mail it.

	She walks off down the street.

					HOOKER
				(going into his
				pocket for more money)
			Hey wait a minute.
				(he comes up with 30)
			Aw, the hell with ya.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. THE WATERFRONT PROCESSING PLANT - LATE AFTERNOON

	A late model Ford roars up and screeches to a stop in front
	of the plant.  Out bursts a carefully-groomed, tight-lipped
	young man named Greer, who hustles into the plant.  We
	follow him through a maze of machinery to the service
	elevator and up to the third floor where we find ourselves
	in the clearinghouse room we saw earlier.

	INT. PLANT - AFTERNOON - LATE

	The working day is over now, and everyone has gone, except
	for Combs, who sits somberly in his office.

					GREER
			They found Mottola.  He was drunk
			in a dive in Joliet.  Never got on
			the train.

					COMBS
				(aggravated)
			I don't wanta hear about his day,
			Greer.  What happened to the money?

					GREER
			He lost it to a coupla con artists
			on his way outa the spot.

					COMBS
			How much?

					GREER
			Twelve thousand.

	Combs sits in quiet thought for a second.  Finally:

					COMBS
			All right.  Better get on the phone
			to New York.  See what the big mick
			wants to do about it.
				(pause)
			I gotta pretty good idea, though.

								CUT TO:

	INT. AN EXCLUSIVE NEW YORK GAMBLING CLUB - LATE AFTERNOON

	An agitated young man, Floyd, weaves his way through the
	craps and roulette tables, and hustles up a staircase to a
	second floor room with a drawing of a snarling tiger on the
	door.  Below the tiger, the word "FARO" appears.  There is a
	large man, of thuggish demeanor, guarding the door, but
	Floyd gives him a small hand signal and walks right by him.

								CUT TO:

	INSIDE THE FARO ROOM

	In the center is a beautifully-carved wooden table, on which
	sit a faro board and a dealing box, tended by a stone-faced
	Dealer, who calls the progress of the game in a continuous
	abacus-like device that keeps track of the cards which have
	already been played.  On the opposite side of the table,
	completely absorbed in the rhythmic appearance of the cards
	from the dealing box, sits Doyle Lonnegan.  Although is
	clothes and accessories are those of a wealthy man, there is
	a coarseness to both his movement and speech which bespeak
	lower class origins, for which he now has nothing but
	contempt.

	Floyd enters the room and approaches him cautiously, trying
	hard to make as little noise as possible.

					FLOYD
			Doyle, can I see you a minute?

					LONNEGAN
				(not looking up from
				the table)
			I'm busy, Floyd.

					FLOYD
			It's important.  We had a little
			trouble in Chicago today.  One of
			our runners got hit for 12 grand.

					LONNEGAN
				(calmly)
			Which one?

					FLOYD
			Mottola.

					LONNEGAN
			You sure he didn't just pocket it?
	


					FLOYD
			No, we checked his story with a
			tipster.  He was cleaned by two
			grifters on 47th.

					LONNEGAN
			They workin' for anybody?

					FLOYD
			I don't know.  Could be.  We're
			runnin' that down now.

					LONNEGAN
			All right, mark Mottola up a little
			and put him on a bus.  Nothin'
			fancy, just enough to keep him from
			coming back.  Get some local people
			to take care of the other two.
				(impassively)
			We gotta discourage this kinda thing.

								CUT TO:

	INT. AN OLD BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

	Hooker, still in his suit, but looking a little worse for
	wear, knocks on the door of one of the apartments.  A young
	black woman, Louise, answers the door, holding a baby.

					HOOKER
			Howdy, Louise.

					LOUISE
				(admiring Hooker in
				his suit)
			Goddamn, Johnny Hooker, you're a
			sharp hunky in them linens.  If you
			wasn't so pale, I'da sworn you had
			class.

	Hooker steps inside and walks right into a big hug from an
	older black woman, Alva.  Alva has a hat on, obviously just
	about to go out.  Beyond her we see the Eirie kid and the
	Black Man (known from here on as Luther Coleman) playing a
	game of mah jong on the dining table with a man whose back
	is to us.  An 11-year-old boy is listening to the radio.

					COLEMAN
			Turn that down, Leroy.

					ALVA
			Oh, Johnny, Luther said you was
			somethin' to see today.

					HOOKER
			I'll never be as good as that mark,
			Alva.

					ALVA
			Well, we gonna hear all about it
			when we get back from church.
			Leroy, get your jacket on, boy.

	Leroy goes to get his jacket.  Louise is finished putting
	the baby to bed.

					HOOKER
			You goin' to church now?

					ALVA
			They been havin' late bingo down
			there.  I'm gonna call on the Lord
			for a little cash, while he's still
			payin' off.  Luther, you look in on
			that child from time to time, will
			ya?

	Luther nods that he will.  Alva, Leroy and Louise leave for
	church as Hooker strolls over and tosses two packets on the
	table.  Luther doesn't pick his up, but the other man does.
	We now see that he is the thief in the opening sequence.  He
	is called the Eirie kid and he is delighted at his share.

					EIRIE KID
			Hey, Luther told me he was carrying
			a wad, but I didn't figure this much.

					HOOKER
			Which way did he do, Eirie?

					EIRIE KID
			Straight north.  He was gonna take
			it all and run.

					HOOKER
				(laughs)
			The bastard.  He can blow his nose
			all the way.

	They laugh again, but Luther doesn't share their enthusiasm.
	He watches Hooker who becomes uncomfortable under his gaze.

					COLEMAN
			You're late.  Where you been?

					HOOKER
				(flopping into a chair)
			I had some appointments.

					COLEMAN
				(not fooled)
			How much did ya lose?

					HOOKER
				(after a pause)
			All of it.

					COLEMAN
				(pissed)
			In one goddamn night?  What are ya
			sprayin' money around like that for?
			You coulda been nailed.

					HOOKER
			I checked the place out.  There
			weren't no dicks in there.

					COLEMAN
			You're a con man, and you blew it
			like a pimp.  I didn't teach ya to
			be no pimp.

					HOOKER
			What's eatin' you?  I've blown
			money before.

					COLEMAN
			No class grifter woulda' done it,
			that's all.

					HOOKER
			You think my play is bad?

					COLEMAN
			I think it's the best...

	Hooker sinks back, embarrassed that he misread Coleman's
	intentions.

					COLEMAN
			...It's the only reason I ain't
			quit before now.

					HOOKER
				(bewildered)
			What?

					COLEMAN
			I'm gettin' too slow for this
			racket.  I done the best I'm gonna
			do.  You hang on too long, you
			start embarrassin' yourself.

					HOOKER
			What are you talkin' about?  We
			just took off the biggest score
			we've ever had.  We can do anything
			we want now.

					COLEMAN
			It's nothin' compared to what you
			could be makin' on the Big Con.
			You're wastin' your time workin'
			street marks.

					HOOKER
			Hey look.  You think I'm gonna run
			out on ya or somethin'?  Just cause
			we hit it big.  Luther, I owe you
			everything.  If you hadn't taught
			me con, I wouldn't know nothin'.

					COLEMAN
				(a little embarrassed)
			Aw hell, you sound like some
			goddamn sucker.  You know everything
			I know.  You got nothin' more to
			learn from me.

					HOOKER
			But you played the Big Con.  You
			said it was nothin'.  A game for
			flakes and mama's boys.

					COLEMAN
			And I'm tellin' ya now, you're a
			fool if you don't get into it.  A
			bigger fool than I was.
				(pause, holding up
				the money)
			I been lookin' for this one all my
			life, Johnny.  Now I got a chance
			to step out at the top.

	Hooker knows it's no use.

					HOOKER
				(after a long silence)
			What the hell you gonna do with
			yourself?

					COLEMAN
			Aw, I got a brother down in K.C.,
			runs a freight outlet.  I can go
			halfsies with 'em!  It ain't too
			exciting, but it's mostly legal.

	Hooker just nods.

					COLEMAN
			Straighten up, kid.  I wouldn't
			turn ya out if ya weren't ready.
				(flipping Hooker a
				piece of paper)
			I got a guy named Henry Gondorff I
			want you to look up.  There ain't a
			better insideman alive.  He'll
			teach ya everything ya gotta know.

					HOOKER
			You'll take a cut of what I make,
			won't ya?

					COLEMAN
			I'm out, Johnny.

					HOOKER
			If that's the way you want it.

					COLEMAN
			That's the way I want it.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. A DIMLY LIT STREET - NIGHT

	It's late at night now.  Hooker and Eirie wander along the
	street together, not really ready to go home, but with no
	other ideas either.  Hooker, obviously preoccupied, idly
	strikes a match on a street lamp as he passes and lets it
	burn out.  He does this several times.

					HOOKER
			How do you like that Coleman, huh?
			After three years.

					EIRIE KID
			Aw come on, it was the only thing
			to do.  He knew he was holdin' ya
			back.

					HOOKER
			We were partners.  If it weren't
			for Luther I'd still be hustlin'
			pinball down at Gianelli's.  I
			don't need anything more than I got.

					HOOKER
			You ain't gonna have nothin' if you
			don't lay off them games of chance.
			There's a depression on ya know.

					HOOKER
			There's always a depression on.

					EIRIE KID
			If you saved a little, you wouldn't
			have to grift so much.

					HOOKER
			I like griftin'.

					EIRIE KID
			You could buy yourself some things.
			Clothes, or a nice car...

					HOOKER
			I don't look any good in clothes
			and I don't know how to drive.
			What else ya got to sell, Eirie?

					EIRIE KID
			Forget it.

	They walk on a few more feet, when suddenly a police car
	pulls up alongside them and two men jump out.  The first, a
	uniformed policeman, grabs Eirie around the neck.

	Hooker makes a break for it, but the second Figure, a burly
	detective named Snyder, tackles him in the middle of the
	street, drags him back into the alley and plasters him up
	against a brick wall.  The two have met before.

					HOOKER
			Hi there, Snyder.  Things a little
			slow down at the Bunco Department
			tonight, eh?  Somebody lose the
			dominoes?

					SNYDER
			You scored blood money today,
			Hooker.  You need a friend.

					HOOKER
				(knocking Snyder's
				hand away)
			Aw, find yourself a shoplifter to
			roll.

	Snyder gives Hooker a swift knee in the thigh and follows it
	with an elbow across the head.  Hooker flies into a row of
	boxes and garbage cans.

					HOOKER
				(getting up slowly)
			You got the wrong guy, pal.  I been
			home with the flu all day.
				(rising to a fuller height)
			You can stake out my toilet if you
			want.

	Bang.  Snyder, infuriated by Hooker's irreverence, slams him
	to the ground again.  The policeman is no longer holding
	Eirie but is almost daring him to make a move.  Eirie wants
	to go to Hooker's aid, but he knows the policeman will beat
	him to a pulp.

					SNYDER
				(pulling Hooker out
				of the heap and
				smashing him against
				the wall again)
			I'll tell ya what you did, smart
			boy.  You tied into a loaded mark
			on 47th across from Maxies.  You
			and Coleman played the switch for
			him and blew him off to a cab on
			49th.  If he hadn't been a numbers
			runner for Doyle Lonnegan, it
			woulda been perfect.

					HOOKER
				(startled by the information)
			You're crazy.  I'm not stupid
			enough to play for rackets money.

					SNYDER
			Not intentionally maybe, but that
			don't make no difference to Lonnegan.
			He'll swat you like any fly.

					HOOKER
			I'll square it with the fixer.

					SNYDER
			Nobody can buy you a prayer, if I
			put the finger on ya.

	Snyder lets go.  Hooker sinks back against the wall.  He
	says nothing; he's waiting for the price.

					SNYDER
			I figure your end of the score was
			at least 3 gees.  I want 2 no
			matter what it was.
	


					HOOKER
				(lying)
			My end was only one.

					SNYDER
				(not taking the fake)
			Then you'll have to come up with
			another grand somewhere.

	Hooker is beat and he knows it.

					HOOKER
			All right.

	He reaches into his coat, pulls out a stack of bills and
	counts out $2000 to Snyder.  Eirie looks on in amazement; he
	didn't think Hooker had it.

					SNYDER
				(pocketing the money
				and motioning his
				partner to put his
				gun away)
			You're a smart egg, Hooker.  No use
			dyin' for 2 grand.

	Snyder and his policeman friend get in their car and start
	down the street.  Hooker and Eirie walk nonchalantly in the
	other direction.

					EIRIE KID
			I thought you blew all your money.

					HOOKER
			I did.  That stuff I gave him was
			counterfeit.  They'll pinch him the
			first place he tries to spend it.

	Snyder and his partner disappear around a corner.  Hooker
	suddenly takes off like a shot.

	INT. DRUGSTORE - NIGHT

	He runs into a drugstore and goes to the phone booth.
	There's already a woman in it.  Hooker rips open the door
	and throws her out.  Hurriedly, he begins to dial.

					EIRIE KID
				(standing outside the booth)
			What the hell you gonna do when
			Snyder rushes his finger right to
			Lonnegan?  You're committin'
			suicide, kid.

					HOOKER
				(waiting for the ring)
			Aw Christ, it doesn't make no
			difference now.  If Snyder knows
			about it so does everybody else.
			He never gets anything first...Damn,
			there's no answer at Luther's.

					EIRIE KID
			Listen to me, Hooker.  What ever
			you do, don't go back to your place
			tonight, don't go anyplace you
			usually go, ya hear me?  Get outa
			town or somethin', but...

	Hooker, still getting no answer, slams the phone down and
	blasts out of the booth.

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT

	Eirie chases him frantically, calling him to come back, but
	he's giving away too many years and there's no stopping
	Hooker at this point.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT - SHOTS OF HOOKER

	Pumping down the street.

	EXT. LUTHER'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

	Hooker races into Luther's brownstone, charges up to the
	third floor.

	INT. LUTHER'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

	Hooker runs up through a small group of people on the stairs.
	He bursts into Luther's room, the door of which is already
	open.  The room shows signs of a struggle, a turned-over
	chair, a broken lamp, but there is no Coleman.  Hooker goes
	slowly to the window.  He looks down into the courtyard and
	then suddenly sprints back out the door.  As we hear him
	scrambling down the stairs, the camera dollies to the window
	and looks out.

	EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT

	There on the concrete below, face down, is the body of
	Luther Coleman.  Hooker races out to it and kneels down.

					HOOKER
				(shaking the body)
			C'mon Luther, get up.  You gotta
			get up, Luther.

	In the distance, sirens are heard.  Heads are out of the
	windows and some people are starting to gather in the
	courtyard.

					HOOKER (CONT'D)
			Goddamn you, Luther, will you get
			up?
				(pounding on the body)
			I'm not waitin' for you, Luther.
			I'm not waitin' anymore.  Get up,
			you son of a bitch.  Goddamn you,
			Luther, goddamn.

	The sirens are close now, and Hooker tears himself away from
	Luther and runs.  The others gather to look at the body.

								FADE OUT.

	FADE IN:

	THE SET-UP

								FADE OUT.

	FADE IN:

	INT. THE TRAIN STATION - DAY

	We open on Hooker sleeping in some remote corner of the
	station, covered with newspapers for warmth, and barely
	distinguishable from the clutter of junk surrounding him.  A
	station security officer, on his morning sweep, wanders by
	and delivers a terrific blow to the soles of Hooker's feet
	with a nightstick.  Hooker jolts awake with a cry of pain,
	as the officer diffidently moves on toward another sleeping
	victim.

	Tired and sore from his night in the station, Hooker
	struggles to his feet and attempts to take stock of the
	situation.  He tries to smooth the wrinkles out of his suit,
	but it's futile.  A quick check of his wallet finds it as
	empty as he'd remembered it.

								CUT TO:

	THE STATION - GIFT SHOP - DAY

	Hooker walks in and goes to the toy section.  He looks
	through several small novelties, till he finds what he's
	looking for -- a little tin replica of a policeman's badge.
	He looks around for station detectives, and seeing none,
	slips the badge into his pocket.

								CUT TO:

	THE STATION - WASHROOM - DAY

	Hooker rinses out his mouth, towels off his face and slicks
	his hair back with water.  It's a drop in the bucket, but it
	seems to revitalize him a little.

								CUT TO:

	STATION - HALLWAY - DAY

	We see Hooker removing a sign from a door, but the angle
	prohibits us from reading it.

	INT. STATION - DAY

	He drops the sign in a waste can and walks out into the
	crowded passenger lobby.  After scanning the area carefully
	for a minute, he goes up to a conservative young business
	man, who's busy reading the schedule board.

					HOOKER
				(flashing open his
				wallet to reveal the
				little tin badge and
				then closing it again quickly)
			Excuse me, sir.  Treasury Dept...
			I'd like to ask you a few questions.

					MAN
				(flustered)
			What for?  I haven't done anything.

					HOOKER
			We don't doubt that, but there's a
			counterfeiting operation passing
			bad money in the station.  Have you
			made any purchases here today?

					MAN
				(reluctantly)
			Yes, a ticket to Chicago.
	


					HOOKER
			Then I'm afraid we'll have to
			impound your money until we're sure
			that it's all good.  Can I see your
			wallet and your ticket, please?

					MAN
				(handing them over)
			But I got a train to make.

					HOOKER
				(taking out the money
				and returning the wallet)
			It'll only take 20 minutes or so.
			You can pick it up at the window
			down the hall.

					MAN
			But what about all these other
			people?

					HOOKER
				(blowing up)
			We'll get 'em!  Give us a chance.
			I'm not the only agent in here, ya
			know.  We go around advertising
			ourselves, how many counterfeiters
			do you think we'd catch, huh?
				(pointing to his suit)
			You think I'm wearin' this rag here
			'cause I like it?  Christ, everybody
			thinks life's a holiday or somethin'
			when you got a badge.
				(pouring it on)
			I been here since three this
			morning, Charlie, and I never knew
			there was so much ugliness in
			people.  You try to help 'em and
			they spit on you.  I shoulda let ya
			go and gotten yourself arrested for
			passin' false notes.

	The Businessman is totally shamed.

					MAN
			I'm sorry, really I am, but my
			train leaves in ten minutes.

					HOOKER
			All right, I'll give ya a break.
				(pointing to a hall)
			Down that hall there, there's an
			unmarked door on the left.  Go on
			in there and wait at the window.
			I'll take this...
				(he holds up the money)
			...in the back and run it through
			right away.  We'll have you outta
			there in a couple minutes.

					MAN
			Thank you.  You don't know how much
			I appreciate this.

					HOOKER
				(with a little wave)
			Think nothin' of it.

	The man goes off down the hall, more than grateful to be
	given a break like this.  Hooker heads for the "back".  We
	follow the Man down the hall to the unmarked door.  He
	strides on through to find himself face to face with a wall
	of busily flushing urinals.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. STATION - DAY - HOOKER

	Boarding the 8:10 for Chicago.

								CUT TO:

	INT. STATION - DAY

	The Man wandering up and down the hall, wondering how he
	could have missed that room.

	EXT. CHICAGO STREET - DAY

	The street runs along side an elevated train track.  We pick
	up Hooker coming down the street, eating a hot dog he bought
	with the money he just earned in the train station.

	He appears to be looking for an address, referring every now
	and then to the piece of paper Luther gave him the night
	before.  Finally he stops in front of an old three-story
	building which contains a carousel on the bottom 2 floors
	and what appear to be apartments on the third floor.  He
	peers inside the big, sliding glass doors and seeing no sign
	of life, goes around to the side to look for a way in.

	A 35 year-old woman, Billie, appears in her bathrobe on the
	second floor landing and descends the stairs to get the
	morning paper.  She's eating an apple.  Although she has
	just gotten up and looks it, she has the presence of one who
	is probably quite striking at other hours.  The sight of
	Hooker fazes her not at all.

					HOOKER
			Excuse me, I'm looking for a guy
			named Henry Gondorff.  You know him?

					BILLIE
				(starting back up the stairs)
			No.

					HOOKER
			Luther Coleman sent me.

	Billie stops and comes back down the stairs.  It's the first
	time she's stopped chewing.

					BILLIE
				(checking him out)
			You Hooker?

					HOOKER
			Yeh.

					BILLIE
			Why didn't you say so.  I thought
			maybe you was a copper or somethin'.

	She goes to a side door and unlocks it.

					BILLIE
			It's the room in the back.  He
			wasn't expecting you so soon though.

	Hooker's not quite sure what that means, but there's
	something about Billie that makes him know that you don't ask.

	INT. CAROUSEL - DAY

	Hooker walks past the now motionless carousel to the room in
	the back and knocks on the door.  No answer.  He gives the
	door a little push and it swings open.

	INT. GONDORFF'S ROOM - DAY

	The room inside if small and cluttered, consisting of a bed,
	a sink, and a bathroom, all covered by a layer of books,
	dirty clothes and beer bottles.  Draped over a chair, fully
	dressed, but completely passed out is the one and only Henry
	Gondorff.

					HOOKER
				(to himself)
			The great Henry Gondorff.

								CUT TO:

	INT. A SHOWER - DAY

	Water blasting out of the fixture.  We see Gondorff, still
	fully clothed, sitting in the bottom of the shower, the
	spray streaming off his face.  An imposing figure, with deep
	set eyes and full beard, he just sits there stoically,
	looking like a soggy lumberjack.  Hooker, sitting on the
	floor between the toilet and the sink, watches listlessly.
	Finally --

					GONDORFF
			Turn the goddamn thing off, will ya.

					HOOKER
			You sober?

					GONDORFF
			I can talk, can't I?

	Hooker makes no move to get up.  Gondorff struggles to his
	knees, turns off the water, and slumps back against the wall.
	The two men just look past each other a second.  Down in the
	bottom.

					GONDORFF
			Glad to meet ya, kid.  You're a
			real horse's ass.

					HOOKER
			Yeh, Luther said you could teach me
			something.  I already know how to
			drink.

	Gondorff wipes his face with his hand.  His mood softens a
	little.

					GONDORFF
				(quietly)
			I'm sorry about Luther.  He was the
			best street worker I ever saw.

					HOOKER
			He had you down as a big-timer.
			What happened?

					GONDORFF
			Aw, I conned a Senator from Florida
			on a stocks deal.  A real lop-ear.
			He thought he was gonna take over
			General Electric.  Some Chantoozie
			woke him up, though, and he put the
			feds on me.

					HOOKER
			You mean you blew it.

					GONDORFF
				(pause)
			Luther didn't tell me you had a big
			mouth.

					HOOKER
			He didn't tell me you was a fuck-
			up, either.
				(Gondorff looks at
				him coldly)
			You played the Big Con since then.

					GONDORFF
			No, I lammed it around for a while
			while things cooled off.  Philly,
			Denver, Baltimore, nuthin' towns.

	Hooker's disappointment is obvious.

					GONDORFF
			But don't kid yourself, friend, I
			still know how.

	Hooker nods, unconvinced.

					GONDORFF
				(getting up from the
				floor and emptying
				the water out of his pockets)
			You gonna stay for breakfast, or do
			you already know how to eat?

					HOOKER
				(tired)
			I picked something up on the way.

					GONDORFF
				(sensing something)
			Lonnegan after you, too?

					HOOKER
			I don't know.  Haven't seen anybody.

					GONDORFF
			You never do, kid.

	We go to Hooker.  He hadn't thought of that.

	EXT. A BEAUTIFUL OLD COLONIAL COUNTRY CLUB - LONG ISLAND -
	DAY

	Lonnegan, in plus fours and argyles sits on a bench as other
	members of his foursome tee off.  Floyd comes up to him.

					FLOYD
			We got word from Chicago.  They got
			one of the grifters last night.
			The nigger.

					LONNEGAN
			What about the other one?

					FLOYD
			They're still looking for him.

					LONNEGAN
			Who's got the contract?

					FLOYD
			Combs gave it to Reilly and Cole.

					LONNEGAN
			Hackers.

					FLOYD
			They staked out the other guy's
			place last night, but he never
			showed.  They figure maybe he
			skipped town.  You wanna follow 'em
			up?

	Lonnegan regards Floyd patiently and then pats the bench
	beside him.  Floyd sits gingerly.

					LONNEGAN
			You see the guy in the red sweater
			over there?

	We cut to one of Lonnegan's foursome, a short, squat little
	Irishman in a red sweater.  He was a good-time, friendly
	manner and a winning Irish smile.  We like him immediately.

					LONNEGAN
			Name's Danny McCoy.  No Neck McCoy
			we called him.  Runs a few
			protection rackets for Carnello
			while he's waiting for something
			bigger to come along.  Me and Danny
			been friends since we were six.
			Take a good look at that face,
			Floyd, cause if he ever finds out
			we let one lousy grifter beat us,
			you'll have to kill him and every
			other hood in Chicago who'd like to
			do the same thing.  You understand
			what I'm sayin'?

					FLOYD
			Yes sir.

					LONNEGAN
			Good lad.

	Lonnegan is called to the tee by one of his foursome.  He
	exchanges a friendly smile with McCoy and belts the ball
	down the fairway.

								CUT TO:

	INT. THE CAROUSEL AGAIN - DAY

	Gondorff, dried off now and in a new set of clothes, is
	pulling up the shades of the large facing windows of the
	carousel building.  The morning light pours in, illuminating
	fully for the first time the ornate merry-go-round and its
	massive oaken horses.  Hooker watches him go about his
	business.  Billie calls down from the mezzanine which
	surrounds the carousel.

					BILLIE
			You feeling all right this morning,
			Henry?

					GONDORFF
			Fine, Billie.

					BILLIE
			You mind opening the round a little
			early today?  We got some business
			coming in before hours.

	Gondorff waves okay.

					GONDORFF
				(to Hooker)
			Great little countess, that Billie.
			Runs a good house up there, too.
			One of the few left that Luciano
			doesn't own.

	Gondorff walks around on the carousel, checking straps,
	bearing and poles.  Hooker follows him.

					HOOKER
				(getting impatient)
			Gondorff, you gonna teach me the
			Big Con or not?

					GONDORFF
				(on his back, checking
				underneath one of the horses)
			You didn't act much like you wanted
			to learn it.

					HOOKER
			I wanna play for Lonnegan.

					GONDORFF
				(getting up)
			You know anything about him?

					HOOKER
				(exploding)
			Yeh, he croaked Luther.  What else
			do I gotta know.

	Gondorff just sits tight and waits for him to cool off.

					HOOKER
				(waving Gondorff off,
				embarrassed at his
				own outburst)
			Aw right, he runs the numbers outta
			the south side.

					GONDORFF
				(going over to start
				the machinery)
			And a packing company, a chain of
			Savings and Loans and half the
			politicians in Chicago and New York.
			There ain't a fix in the world
			gonna cool him out if he blows on ya.

					HOOKER
			I'll take him anyway.

					GONDORFF
				(whirling on him)
			Why?

					HOOKER
				(like steel)
			'Cause I don't know enough about
			killin' to kill him.

	It's the right answer. Gondorff didn't know it himself until
	now.

					GONDORFF
			You can't do it alone, ya know.  It
			takes a mob of guys like you and
			enough money to make 'em look good.

					HOOKER
			We'll get by without 'em.

					GONDORFF
			This isn't like playin' winos on
			the street.  You gotta do more than
			outrun the guy.

					HOOKER
				(incensed)
			I never played for winos.

					GONDORFF
				(going right on,
				ignoring Hooker's remark)
			You gotta keep Lonnegan's con, even
			after you spent his money.  And no
			matter how much you take from his,
			he'll get more.

					HOOKER
			You're sacred of 'em, aren't ya?

					GONDORFF
			Right down to my socks, turkey.  If
			I'da been half as scared a that
			lop-ear, I wouldn't a fallen asleep
			on 'em.  Lonnegan might kill me,
			but at least he won't bore me to
			death.

					HOOKER
			Then you'll do it?

					GONDORFF
			If I can find a mob that'll risk it.
			But no matter what happens, I don't
			want you comin' back to me halfway
			through and sayin' it's not enough...
			cause it's all you got.

	Hooker nods.  Gondorff switches on the carousel and steps
	back to admire his handiwork.  The carousel makes a grinding
	sound, does a few lurches and stops cold.

								CUT TO:

	Music begins and we are into a short:

	MONTAGE SEQUENCE

	Detailing the arrival of the others three members of
	Gondorff's "mob." Throughout, Gondorff wears the fedora hat
	which is his trademark.  We begin with --

	A tall, good-looking man, Kid Twist, making his way through
	the railway station.  Impeccably dressed and carrying a
	small suitcase, he combs the terrain carefully with his eyes.
	Finally he catches a glimpse of the thing he's been looking
	for.  It's Gondorff, standing by a newsstand.  Gondorff
	makes a quick snubbing motion on his nose as if flicking off
	a gnat.  This is known among con men as the "office." Twist
	returns the sign with a barely discernible smile as he walks
	on by.  Con men rarely acknowledge each other openly in
	public, but it's obvious that these two are glad to see each
	other.

	INT. HOTEL LOBBY

	Where we tilt up to reveal J.J. Singleton, the most
	flamboyant of the bunch.  On his way to the check-in desk,
	he silently exchanges the "office" with Gondorff, who is
	sitting on a lounge reading the paper.

								CUT TO:

	INT. APARTMENT - DAY

	Hooker being shown into a small apartment room by an old
	woman.  It consists of a bed, a table and a sink.  Hooker
	nods his acceptance to the woman and gives her a bill.  He
	takes another look around the room and decides to go out
	somewhere, but first he wedges a small piece of paper
	between the door and the jamb, about an inch off the floor.

								CUT TO:

	INT. A BIG METROPOLITAN BANK - DAY

	We hold on a slight, bespectacled teller, Eddie Niles, in
	the process of counting a large deposit.  Niles is all
	business; if he's ever smiled, no one knows about it.  He
	glances up for a second and sees Gondorff "officing" him
	from across the bank.  Without a word he shoves the money
	he's been counting back into the hands of a startled
	customer, abruptly closes up his window, flips his
	identification tag on the manager's desk and walks out of
	the bank.

								CUT TO:

	INT. AN UPSTAIRS ROOM OF THE CAROUSEL BUILDING - NIGHT

	This room has obviously been relegated to the status of the
	storage room.  It contains the water heater, mops and
	brooms, old bed springs, etc.  In the middle of the room a
	space has been cleared for a table, around which are seated
	Hooker, Gondorff, Niles, Singleton and Twist.  Gondorff is
	in his T-shirt, but still wears his hat.  Kid Twist is in a
	suit as usual.  The room is illuminated by a single bare
	bulb hanging from the ceiling.

					TWIST
				(showing Hooker
				photographs of three men)
			These are Combs' favorite torpedoes.
			Riley and Cole.

	We recognize Riley and Cole as the two guys who got into
	Mottola's cab.

					TWIST
			They do most of the small jobs, but
			Lonnegan might not wanna use 'em on
			you 'cause they're kinda messy.  No
			class.

	We go to Hooker.  He's real grateful.  Billie, wearing an
	evening dress, enters the room and begins gathering up the
	empty beer mugs on the table.

					TWIST
			We got reason to believe Riley was
			the guy who hit Luther.  But if you
			see either one of these two, find
			yourself a crowd, or take 'em
			someplace you know you can handle
			'em.

					GONDORFF
			But most of all let us know.  If
			they got a hit on you, we gotta
			fold up the con.  You're too
			exposed.  You got that?

	Hooker nods, but we know he hasn't really got that.

					HOOKER
			You sure it'll be one of these two?

					TWIST
			No.  They're just the only ones we
			know of.

	Billie has finished  gathering the mugs, and leaves the room
	with them.  We follow her down the hall and into the:

	RECEIVING ROOM OF HER BROTHEL

	Carousel music filters up from the arcade below.  The room
	has a bar along one wall and the rest of the space is taken
	up by tables and couches.  It's a comfortable place, but not
	opulent.  Some of the girls sit patiently on the couches,
	others play canasta at the tables.  Most of the men are at
	the bar, fortifying themselves for the task at hand.  Billie
	comes over to the bar.

					BILLIE
				(to the bartender)
			Set me up five more beers, will ya
			Danny.

	As Danny goes to fill the mugs, Billie's eyes fix on a man
	at the end of the bar.

	We move to reveal Snyder, intently scanning the room, as if
	he'd lost a dancing partner in the crush.  Not finding what
	he wants, he comes down the bar to Billie.

					SNYDER
			You the owner here?

					BILLIE
			That's right.

					SNYDER
				(flipping out his badge)
			Lieutenant Snyder.  Bunco.

					BILLIE
			Joliet badge, Snyder.  Don't cut
			much up here.

					SNYDER
				(trying to ignore her remark)
			I'm lookin' for a guy on the lam
			from a counterfeiting rap.  Thought
			he mighta come in here.

					BILLIE
			Don't think so.  I know everybody
			in the place and I always bounce
			the lamsters.

					SNYDER
			All right if I look around your
			lobby?

					BILLIE
			No, but you're welcome to a free
			beer before you go.

	Billie grabs a bottle of beer, pours some in a shot glass
	and pushes it over to Snyder.  He ignores the gesture.

					SNYDER
				(with controlled force)
			I don't really need your permission.

	We go to Billie.  She knew that when he came in.

								CUT TO:

	THE STORAGE ROOM AGAIN

	The discussion continues.  Hooker, a bit out of his depth
	here, listens and stays silent.

					SINGLETON
			Lonnegan's a fast egg, Henry.  He's
			not gonna sit still for a standard
			play.

					GONDORFF
			Everybody'll sit still for somethin'.
			What did ya find out about the
			train, Eddie?

					NILES
			He's been taking the 8:10 Century
			Limited outa New York on Friday and
			getting in here early Saturday
			morning.  He usually stays a day to
			check on his policy operations, and
			then flies back.

					GONDORFF
			Wonder why he doesn't fly both ways.

					NILES
			The porters say he runs a braced
			card game in one of the cars.  $100
			minimum, straight poker.  Last time
			he pulled in here ten grand heavier
			than he left New York.

					GONDORFF
			Fancies himself a gambler, huh?

					TWIST
			Lotta plungers ride that train just
			to play him.

					GONDORFF
				(breaking into a smile)
			See J.J., he's slowly down already.

								CUT TO:

	THE RECEIVING ROOM AGAIN

	Snyder has completed his inspection of the "lobby" and found
	nothing.  Danny, meanwhile, has set up the five beers on a
	tray.

					SNYDER
			Which way are the rooms?

					BILLIE
			Who told ya this guy was in here?

					SNYDER
			Nobody.  I just know what kinda
			women he likes.  I'm gonna check
			all the joyhouses till I find him.

					BILLIE
			Maybe I could help ya if ya told me
			his name.

					SNYDER
			I think I'll keep that to myself.
			Which way are the rooms?

					BILLIE
			Right through there.  But I wouldn't
			go in there if I were you.
				(picks up the tray)


					SNYDER
				(snidely)
			What are ya gonna do, call the cops?

					BILLIE
			I don't have to.  You'll be bustin'
			in on the Chief of Police just up
			the hall.
				(she exits with the drinks)


	Snyder is stopped cold.  He calls after her.

					SNYDER
			Keep your nose clean, lady.  He
			can't spend all his time here.

								CUT TO:

	THE STORAGE ROOM AGAIN

	Billie comes over to Gondorff and whispers in his ear, while
	the others talk.  His eyes flick momentarily to Hooker.

					SINGLETON
			I think we ought to play him on the
			Rag.  It's the tightest game we
			got, and it's not all over the
			papers yet.

					NILES
			No good, J.J.  You're not gonna con
			stocks to a banker.  Lonnegan's too
			smart for that.
	


					TWIST
			What are you going to do, con the
			payoff to a gambler?

					SNYDER
			Twist is right.  It won't work.

	Gondorff has nodded to Billie and now rejoins the
	conversation.  She serves the others beer.

					GONDORFF
			We'll use the wire.  Never known a
			gambler who wouldn't like to beat
			the ponies.

					NILES
			The wire is ten years outa date.

					GONDORFF
			That's why he won't know it.

					SINGLETON
			I'm not sure I know it.

					GONDORFF
			We'll give him the hook on the
			train, and play him here.  You
			think I can get in that poker game,
			Eddie?

					NILES
			All you gotta do is show up with
			some money and look like a fool.

					GONDORFF
			I also gotta win.

	He looks at Hooker.  There is a challenge in their book.
	Gondorff smiles broadly, then casually, to them all.

					GONDORFF
			By the way, any of you guys been
			passing off any green goods lately?

	We go around the table.  No reply.

					GONDORFF
			Billie, if that Dick comes in
			again, stall him till I can get a
			look at him.  And let me pay ya for
			these beers.

					BILLIE
			What are you talking about?  It's
			on the house.

					GONDORFF
				(pulling out a $5 bill)
			Naw, I want ya to have this.

	He hitches up Billie's skirt, and puts the bill in her garter.

					GONDORFF
			Don't look at it till ya go to bed
			though or it'll turn to paper.

	Billie smiles and leaves the room.

	INT. HALLWAY

	She walks halfway down the hall and stops.  She can't wait.
	Lifting up her skirt, she finds that the five has indeed
	turned to paper.  As she breaks into laughter and continues
	on down the hall, we:

								FADE OUT.

	FADE IN:

	THE HOOK

								FADE OUT.

	FADE IN:

	EXT. A SUNKEN ALLEY - DAY

	Actually little more than a service area between two
	apartment buildings.  Niles, Kid Twist, and a middle-aged
	black man, named Benny Garfield, enter the alley with an old
	man and follow him down a stairwell to a subterranean
	basement.  A faded sign above the door says Stenner's
	Billiards.  We follow them inside to a:

	INT. A LARGE BARREN ROOM - DAY

	An office comes off it at one end.  Judging from the
	fluorescent lights overhead and the scattered cue racks
	which still hang tenuously on the walls, the place, indeed,
	used to be a pool hall.  Niles and Garfield go all the way
	to the back, while Twist stays near the front with the old
	man.

					NILES
			Looks all right.  It's big enough
			and off the street.

					GARFIELD
			I don't know.  This is kinda short
			notice.  I'm not sure we can get it
			all done by Saturday.

					NILES
			Got to.  Gondorff's ridin' the mark
			in from New York on the Century.

	Garfield thinks it over a little.  He's taking another look
	at the place.  We go to Twist and the old man by the door.

					TWIST
			We'll take it.
				(pointing through the door)
			You manage the building at the end
			of the alley?

					OLD MAN
				(with pride)
			For fifteen years.

					TWIST
			I'll need a room over there that
			faces this way.  How much a week?

					OLD MAN
			Only rents by the month.  Two
			hundred and fifty for the two of
			them.

					TWIST
				(pulling out his wallet)
			This is the last time I expect to
			see you down here.

					OLD MAN
				(watching the bills
				being counted into
				his hand)
			Never heard of the place.

	We go back to Niles and Garfield.

					GARFIELD
			Been a while since I stocked a wire
			store.  Not many mobs playing that
			anymore.

					NILES
			All we need is the bookie setup for
			now.  We'll worry about the
			telegraph office later.

					GARFIELD
			All right, I'll rent ya everything
			I got in the warehouse for two
			grand.  That'll give ya phones,
			cages, blackboards and ticker gear.
			You supply the guys to move 'em.
			If you want a counter and bar,
			that's another grand.  I don't know
			where the hell I'm gonna get 'em
			though.

					NILES
			C'mon, you can do better than that.
			We ain't no heel grifters.

					GARFIELD
			You want the stuff tomorrow or
			don't ya?  It's gonna take hours
			just to clean it up.
				(pause)
			Besides, Gondorff's still a hot
			item.  Where am I gonna be if he
			gets hit?

					NILES
			Just give us what ya can, Benny.
			We'll send a truck down.

	Twist has rejoined them by now.

					TWIST
				(to Garfield)
			You wanna work flat rate or
			percentage?

					GARFIELD
			Who's the mark?

					TWIST
			Doyle Lonnegan.

					GARFIELD
			Flat rate.

								CUT TO:

	INT. A NEW YORK TRAIN STATION - DAY

	We pick up Doyle Lonnegan, accompanied by two bodyguards and
	Floyd, making his way through the station.  He stops at a
	cigar counter to buy some cigarettes, and we reveal Gondorff
	and Hooker sitting on their suitcases on the other side of
	the room.

					GONDORFF
				(eyes fixed on Lonnegan)
			Guy in the blue pinstripe and grey
			fedora.

	Hooker looks and finally spots him in the crowd.  We go back
	to Lonnegan, as he moves off from the cigar counter, toward
	his train.  Hooker watches him with the intensity of one
	gazing on a religious object.

					HOOKER
			He's not as tough as he'd like to
			think.

					GONDORFF
				(picking up his suitcase)
			Neither are we.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. TRAIN

	Lonnegan and his retainers getting on the train.  Two cars
	down the line, we see Hooker and Gondorff boarding also.  On
	his way in, Gordorff takes the conductor aside.

					GONDORFF
			I hear there's a friendly poker
			game on this train tonight.  You
			know anything about that?

					CONDUCTOR
			A little.

					GONDORFF
			You think you could get me in that
			game?

					CONDUCTOR
			I don't know.  There's usually a
			waiting list.

	Gondorff flashes a $50 bill.

					CONDUCTOR
				(loosening up a bit)
			That'll get you first alternate, sir.

	Gondorff pulls out another fifty.
	


					CONDUCTOR
				(taking the money)
			I'll see what I can do.

								CUT TO:

	INT. A BASEMENT BAR - EARLY EVENING

	Kid Twist enters and threads his way through the maze of
	tables to a door at the back of the building.  A large bull
	of a man is stationed there, obviously to discourage those
	who don't have credentials to enter.  Twist is not such a man.

					TWIST
				(going right on through)
			How ya doin', Lacey.

					LACEY
				(innocently pleased
				for one so menacing)
			Good to see ya again, Twist.

	INT. ANOTHER ROOM - EARLY EVENING

	Inside is another room, this one much better lit than the
	outer one.  There are only three tables in here, around
	which are seated the elite of the Con World.  Twist is
	enthusiastically greeted by Duke Boudreau, a large, rotund
	man whose stylish dress and authoritative manner mark him as
	a powerful figure in this group.

					BOUDREAU
			Twist!  When did you get back in
			town?

					TWIST
			Coupla days ago.  I'm workin' a big
			one with Gondorff on the North Side.

	The two men sit down together, apart from the others.

					TWIST
			Listen Duke, we're setting up a
			wire store.  I need a twenty man
			boost right away.

					BOUDREAU
			I got twenty or so in here tonight.
			Take your pick.

					TWIST
			These guys have gotta be the quill,
			Duky.  We can't afford to rank the
			joint.

					BOUDREAU
				(to one of his assistants)
			Get me the sheet, Jake.  Let's see
			who's in town.

								CUT TO:

	THE OUTER PART OF THE BAR AGAIN

	A silhouetted figure appears in the entrance doorway.  The
	word "chill" races from table to table and the place falls
	still.  The bartender pushes a button behind the bar and a
	buzzer goes off in the back room.  Boudreau gets up from his
	table and opens a small viewing port in the door.

	The silhouetted figure is now walking slowly past the silent
	tables.  It's Snyder and he's checking out every face in the
	place.

					BOUDREAU
			Twist, you know this guy?

					TWIST
				(taking a look
				through the viewing port)
			No.  Never saw him before.  He's a
			dick, though.

	Snyder walks all the way to the back, and then retraces his
	route.  About halfway back, he stops at one of the tables,
	recognizing a grifter he knows.  It's the Eirie Kid.

					EIRIE KID
			Hello, Snyder.  What are you doin'
			up here?

					SNYDER
			I'm on vacation.  You seen your
			friend lately?

					EIRIE KID
			Yeh, he packed it in and enrolled
			in detective school.

	Snyder, in no mood for jokes, grabs Eirie by the hair and
	slams his face into the table.  Eirie just stays there; he
	knows it doesn't pay to assault a detective.  Twist is
	watching all this intently from the viewing port.

					SNYDER
			You see him, you tell him to pay
			his debts before I get him.

	Eirie raises his head slowly, but says nothing.  There is a
	slight trickle of blood from his nose.  Snyder turns and
	walks slowly out of the bar.  When he is a safe distance
	down the street, the chatter and drinking resume.

								CUT TO:

	THE INSIDE ROOM AGAIN

	Twist gives an all clear signal and returns to the table
	where he and Boudreau were talking.  Boudreau reads from a
	list of names.  Twist listens with a certain preoccupation.
	He's still thinking about the little confrontation he just
	witnessed.

					BOUDREAU
			Paltrow, Sterling, Furey, and the
			Big Alabama are in from New Orleans.
			Fiskin and the Boone Kid from
			Denver, and Phillips, Barnett and
			Limehouse Chappie from New York.
			Those and the guys outside should
			give ya 30 or so to choose from.

					TWIST
			Good, have 'em down at Stenner's
			old Pool Hall before 3:00.  We're
			gonna run through the route tonight.

					BOUDREAU
			Okay, Twist, but you know if this
			blows up, I can't do ya no good
			downtown.  Gondorff is Federal.

					TWIST
			Don't worry about it, pal.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. SPEEDING PASSENGER TRAIN - NIGHT

	Ripping through an open stretch between New York and Chicago.

								CUT TO:

	INT. TRAIN - NIGHT

	Singleton is walking down a passageway and stops at a door
	and goes in.

	INT. GONDORFF'S COMPARTMENT - NIGHT

	Gondorff is rapidly shuffling cards to four empty places.
	He is alone.  He looks up as Singleton enters.

					SINGLETON
			You in?

					GONDORFF
			Yeh, I think so.  I gave the kay-
			ducer a C-note.  You find out the
			deck?

					SINGLETON
			He usually plays with a Royal or a
			Cadenza.
				(handing him two
				sealed decks)
			I got you one of each.  He likes to
			cold deck low, 8's or 9's.

					GONDORFF
			Nice work, J.J.

	Singleton slips out as Gondorff unpeels the packs.

	INT. TRAIN - NIGHT

	We pick up Lonnegan coming out of his compartment, flanked
	by only one bodyguard and Floyd.  He starts through the
	passenger section toward the compartment where the poker
	game will be held.  Suddenly a drunken woman comes staggering
	around the corner and bumps into him.

	They grapple a moment and Lonnegan pushes her away in disgust.

					WOMAN
				(sloppy drunk)
			Keep your mitts off me, ya big lug.
			If I'da wanted you handlin' me I
			woulda asked ya.

	Lonnegan ignores her and proceeds down the passageway.  As
	the woman proceeds in the other direction between passengers,
	we see it is Billie.  She drops something on a seat beside a
	passenger.  A hand reaches to pick it up.  It is Lonnegan's
	wallet and it is Hooker who picks it up.

	Hooker waits a moment, then stands and goes in the direction
	Lonnegan has taken.  He passes by the open door to the card
	room, hesitating only slightly to hear the greetings
	exchanged inside before the door is shut.  Then he continues
	on into the next car.  He turns into Gondorff's compartment.

								CUT TO:

	INT. GONDORFF'S COMPARTMENT - NIGHT

	Gondorff is still practicing.  He looks up as Hooker enters
	and tosses him the wallet.

					HOOKER
			She got him clean.  He hasn't
			missed it.

	Gondorff nods, takes the money out, counts it.

					GONDORFF
			Fifteen grand.  Looks like he's
			expecting a big night.

	He takes out his own wallet and puts the money in it, and
	tosses the empty wallet back to Hooker, and resumes his
	shuffling and dealing.  Hooker sits back silently and
	watches him.

					HOOKER
			He's waitin' for you in the card
			room.

					GONDORFF
			Let him wait.

	As he deals, on the second pass he attempts to cut from the
	bottom, muffs it completely and sprays half the deck on the
	table.  Hooker regards him steadily as he gathers them back
	up.  Gondorff finally meets his gaze.

					GONDORFF
			You just worry about your end, kid.

					HOOKER
			If we ever get to it.

								CUT TO:

	INT. THE POKER ROOM - NIGHT

	A specially outfitted compartment with a table and chairs in
	the middle and leather cushions around the outside for
	kibitzers.  Lonnegan and 3 other players are already there
	and seated.  They're getting slightly impatient.

					LONNEGAN
				(to the Conductor)
			Where the hell is this guy?

					CONDUCTOR
			I don't know.  He said he'd be here.

								CUT TO:

	GONDORFF'S CABIN AGAIN

	Gondorff is standing in front of the mirror dressing.  He
	grabs up a clean white shirt and rumples it up in his hands.
	He then picks up a half-full bottle of bourbon.  Hooker
	gives him a disapproving look.  Gondorff smiles and pats
	some on his face.

								CUT TO:

	THE POKER ROOM AGAIN

	Everybody's itchy now.

					LONNEGAN
			All right, let's start without him.
			Mr. Clemens, give me the cards.

	The Conductor hands him a sealed deck.  As he begins to open
	it, Gordoff comes into the room, coatless, rumpled, unshaven
	and looking slightly tipsy.  The others at the table, all
	men of high school or financial standing, are somewhat put
	off.

					GONDORFF
			Sorry I'm late boys.  I was takin'
			a crap.

	This bit of grossness does little to improve his image.

					CONDUCTOR
				(making the
				introductions;
				referring first to Gondorff)
			Mr. Shaw is a bookmaker from
			Chicago.  Mr. Shaw, meet Mr.
			Clayton from Pittsburgh, Mr.
			Jameson, Chicago, Mr. Lonnegan, New
			York and Mr. Lombard, Philadelphia.

	Gondorff nods and takes a seat, none too gracefully.

					CONDUCTOR
			Straight poker, gentlemen.  100
			dollar minimum, table stakes.  We
			assume you're good for your debts.

					LONNEGAN
				(shuffling the cards)
			Mr. Shaw, we usually require a tie
			at this table.  If you don't have
			one, we can get ya one.

					GONDORFF
			Yeh, that'd be real nice of ya, Mr.
			Lonneman.

					LONNEGAN
				(irritated)
			Lonnegan.

	He begins to deal, obviously not pleased that his evening
	seems to be peopled with drunks.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. THE SUNKEN ALLEY - NIGHT

	A truck is now parked at the end of the alley, and several
	workmen are busy unloading it.  One group carries a large
	blackboard; others have boxes of glasses, ash tray stands,
	furniture, etc.  Take several cuts.

								CUT TO:

	INSIDE THE ONCE-VACANT POOL HALL

	Now a blaze of activity.  We take several cuts of workmen
	papering the walls, tacking down carpet, putting in new
	light fixtures, painting signs, all under the supervision of
	Niles.  From now on, we will refer to the pool hall as the
	store.

	Back in the office, Kid Twist is "interviewing" one by one,
	a group of con men lined up outside the office door.  A
	gray-haired old buzzard, Curly Jackson, approaches the table
	which is serving Twist as a desk.  Curly is practically in
	rags and has several days growth on his face.  He wears a
	little beret which he takes off to address Twist.

					CURLY
			Name's Curly Jackson.  I worked for
			Gad Bryan outa Baltimore.

					TWIST
			You ever played the Wire, Curly?

					CURLY
			Used to rope for it long ago.  I
			can shill, mark board, anything you
			want.  I don't run with riffraff
			and I only drink on weekends.
				(affecting an English accent)
			Me specialty is an Englishman.

	Twist is taken with the man, despite his appearance.

					TWIST
			All right, Curly, you're in.  We
			got a rack of suits over there.
			Get yourself a nice tweed one.

					CURLY
				(exiting)
			That's all right.  I got all my own
			stuff.

								CUT TO:

	THE CARD GAME AGAIN

	Gondorff and Lonnegan have most of the chips.  Lonnegan is
	slightly ahead.  Gondorff has made a token attempt to wear
	the provided tie, having tied it in a knot around his neck,
	but not having bothered to put it under his collar.  He has
	a shot glass and a bottle next to him, from which he has
	been drinking heavily.  He and Lonnegan are the only ones
	left in this hand.

					LONNEGAN
				(throwing chips in)
			Raise 500.

					GONDORFF
				(likewise)
			See ya and raise three.

					LONNEGAN
				(more chips)
			See and raise five.

					GONDORFF
			Five and call.

	Lonnegan lays down his hand, a solid two pair.  Gondoroff
	turns out three tens.  Lonnegan is beat.

					GONDORFF
			Tough luck, Lonnihan, but that's
			what you get for playin' with your
			head up your ass.  Couple more like
			that and we can all go to bed
			early, huh boys.

	Lonnegan burns, and the "boys" have no comment.

								CUT TO:

	INT. THE STORE - NIGHT

	The work is still progressing.  We see two workmen installing
	a ticket tape machine in a secluded area of the store.

					GARFIELD
			We bought ya a tap into Moe
			Anenberg's wire.  He's got eyes at
			every track in the country.  You'll
			get race results, odds, scratches,
			pole positions, everything; and
			just as fast as Western Union gets
			'em.

					NILES
			Does J.J. know how to use this thing?

					GARFIELD
			All he's gotta do is read.

	We go to Kid Twist, still conducting interviews in the
	office.  A young, rather sullen man, Buck Duff, steps to the
	table.

					DUFF
			Buck Duff.  I was in Maxwell's
			boost in Troy.

					TWIST
			You the Duff that didn't come up
			with his end when Little Jeff was
			sent up?

					DUFF
			Wasn't no problem a mine.

					TWIST
			He was a con man, wasn't he?

					DUFF
			He was a tear-off rat.  He got what
			he deserved.  No sense helpin' pay
			his bills.

					TWIST
				(like ice)
			Shove off, Duff.

	Duff stands there a second and then slouches away from the
	table.  He stops however, by the door.  The next man up is
	the Eirie Kid.  Twist knows he's seen him somewhere before.

					EIRIE KID
				(nervous as hell)
			Names's Joe Eirie.

	Twist waits for more, but it's not coming.

					TWIST
			You played for any particular mobs?

					EIRIE KID
			No.

					TWIST
			You know the Wire at all?

					EIRIE KID
			No...I never played no Big Con
			before.  But Luther Coleman was a
			friend a mine.  I thought maybe
			there was something I could do.

					TWIST
				(pointing to Eirie
				slightly swollen nose)
			You get that nose in Duke Boudreau's
			tonight?

	Eirie nods a reluctant "yes."

					TWIST
			You got moxie, Eirie.  Get yourself
			a suit.

	Eirie is so happy, he can barely blurt out a thank you.
	Buck Duff, enraged that Twist would hire a total amateur,
	turns in disgust and strides vengefully out of the store.

								CUT TO:

	THE CARD GAME AGAIN

	The room is dense with smoke now, and the players are
	feeling the heat.  Gondorff has his white shirt open,
	revealing a stained T-shirt underneath.  The bottle next to
	him is almost empty.  He sneezes and wipes his nose with the
	tie Lonnegan gave him.

	The chips are now about equally divided between Gondorff and
	Lonnegan.  The others are losing badly.

					GONDORFF
			Raise 300.

					LONNEGAN
			Pass.

					JAMESON
				(throwing in his last
				few chips)
			Raise 200.

					GONDORFF
			Two and call.

	Jameson lays down two pair.  Gondorff has a flush.  Gondorff
	rakes in the chips, which now put him ahead of Lonnegan.

					JAMESON
			Well, I'm out.

					GONDORFF
			Don't worry about it, pal.  Lemongan
			here wouldn'ta let you in the game
			if you weren't a chump.

					LONNEGAN
				(getting to his feet)
			I've had enough of your lip, Shaw.

	Gondorff grabs the whiskey bottle next to him, breaks it
	against the table and waves the jagged end in Lonnegan's face.

					GONDORFF
				(barely able to stand up)
			Just take it easy there, Larrabee.

	Jameson and the conductor step in between.

					JAMESON
			Let's take a break for a couple
			minutes and cool off.

	Lonnegan storms out of the room, followed by Floyd and
	Bodyguard.

	INT. SMOKING ROOM

	We pick up Lonnegan coming down the passageway to enter the
	smoking room.

					LONNEGAN
				(to his assistant)
			I've had it with that bum, Floyd.
			Stack me a cooler.

					FLOYD
				(trying to settle him down)
			You've only been playin three
			hours, Doyle.

					LONNEGAN
				(not to be pacified)
			I don't care.  Load me a deck.  Set
			it up for threes and nines.  I'll
			cut it in on his deal.

					FLOYD
				(taking a deck and
				beginning to sort it)
			What do ya want the others to get?

					LONNEGAN
			Nothin'.  They gotta be outa there
			early.  I'm gonna bust that bastard
			in one play.

								CUT TO:

	INT. THE POKER ROOM AGAIN - NIGHT

	A pair of hands shuffling.  We pull back to reveal that
	they're Gondorff's.  He passes the deck to Lonnegan to be
	cut and turns to pen a new whiskey bottle.  Lonnegan takes
	the deck and in one lightning motion substitutes a new deck,
	while making it look like he's cutting the old one.

	Gondorff picks up the deck and begins to deal.  As the hand
	is picked up, we see that Gondorff has four threes, Lonnegan
	four nines, and everybody else has nothing.

					CLAYTON
				(opening the bidding)
			Fold.

					LONNEGAN
			250.

					GONDORFF
			Raise 1,000.

					LONNEGAN
			Raise 500.

	Gondorff looks at Lonnegan very carefully for a second.
	Lonnegan meets his stare.

					GONDORFF
				(slowly)
			Raise 2,000.

	The spectators shift a little.  It's the biggest bet of the
	night.

					LONNEGAN
			See and raise 1,000.

					GONDORFF
				(taking it to him)
			Raise 5,000.

	Lonnegan fingers his remaining chips.  He knows he's won,
	but he wants to bleed it for every bit of suspense.

					LONNEGAN
				(going for broke)
			See, and raise the rest.

	Lonnegan pushes in the rest of his chips.  Gondorff, who is
	only required to match Lonnegan's total, throws in all his
	too.  It's a showdown.

					GONDORFF
			Call.

	Lonnegan puts down his four nines.  Gondorff just stares at
	them a second, lets out a deep sigh and lays down four jacks.
	Lonnegan is aghast.  This just can't be.  He glances at
	Floyd, who can do nothing but sit there with his mouth open.

					GONDORFF
				(raking in the chips)
			Well that's all for me tonight,
			boys.  I'm gonna leave ya some cab
			fare.

	The other players look at each other in disgust, and reach
	for their wallets, all of which are well stocked.

					GONDORFF
				(to Lonnegan)
			You owe me 15 grand, pal.

	Lonnegan, with a stare that could kill, reaches for his
	wallet.  Suddenly the stare goes soft.  He tries a few more
	pockets.  No soap.

					LONNEGAN
				(getting up to get it)
			I guess I left it in my room.

					GONDORFF
				(blowing up)
			What!  Don't give me that crap you
			little weenie.  How do I know you
			ain't gonna take a powder.
				(waving his wallter,
				which is full of
				Lonnegan's money)
			You come to a game like this, you
			bring your money.

	Lonnegan, having had all he can take, goes for Gondorff, but
	is restrained by the conductor.

					GONDORFF
			All right, buddy, I'm gonna send a
			boy by your room in five minutes,
			and you better have that jack, or
			it's gonna be all over Chicago that
			your name ain't worth a dime.

	Gondorff stalks out of the room.  We pick him up coming down
	the passageway to his compartment.

	INT. GONDORFF'S COMPARTMENT

	The drunkenness has vanished.  We follow him into his cabin,
	where Hooker is waiting anxiously.

					HOOKER
			How'd ya do?

					GONDORFF
				(modestly)
			Well we got some workin' money
			anyway.

	Gondorff tosses his winnings on the table.

					GONDORFF
				(big smile)
			Okay, kid, you're on.  But I gotta
			tell ya, its a hard act to follow.

								CUT TO:

	INT. LONNEGAN'S CABIN - NIGHT

	Lonnegan sits in a chair smoking, obviously still upset.
	Floyd paces in front of him.

					FLOYD
			I know I give him four threes.  We
			can't let him get away with that.

					LONNEGAN
			What am I supposed to do?  Call him
			for cheating better than me?

	There's a knock at the door.  Floyd goes and opens it.  It's
	Hooker.

					HOOKER
			My name's Carver.  Mr. Shaw sent me.

	Floyd motions him in without a word.

					LONNEGAN
			Your boss is quite a card player,
			Carver.  How does he do it?

					HOOKER
				(very matter-of-factly)
			He cheats.

	Lonnegan says nothing.  He doesn't like smart asses.  He
	looks Hooker over a second, as if considering whether to
	have him wasted or not.

					LONNEGAN
				(reaching into his
				coat pocket)
			He'll have to take a check.
				(pulling out a check)
			I couldn't find my wallet.

					HOOKER
			Yeh, he knows that.

					LONNEGAN
				(startled)
			What do you mean?

					HOOKER
				(pulling out
				Lonnegan's wallet and
				tossing it to him)
			He hired a dame to take it from ya.

	Lonnegan just holds the wallet.  He can't believe it.
	


					HOOKER
			You were set up, Lonnegan.  Shaw's
			been planning to beat your game for
			months.  He was just waiting for
			you to cheat him so he could clip ya.

					LONNEGAN
				(the heat rising)
			I could have you put under this
			train for this, errand boy.

					HOOKER
				(cool as hell)
			So could Shaw.

					LONNEGAN
			Then why the rat?

					HOOKER
			Cause I'm tired of bein' his nigger.
				(pause)
			I want you to help me break him.

	Lonnegan looks at Hooker long and hard, as if the intensity
	of his gaze could separate truth from fiction.  Lonnegan
	hadn't expected this, but now that it's here, it better be
	on the level.  The silence is suddenly broken by the noise
	of the train braking into the station.

					LONNEGAN
				(to Hooker)
			C'mon, I'll give ya a lift home.

	Hooker hesitates, not sure whether to accept or not.

					LONNEGAN
			What's the matter?  You gotta get
			back to Shaw?

					HOOKER
			Naw, he picked up some jane in the
			bar.  Can't see him till morning
			anyway.

					LONNEGAN
			All right, then.

								CUT TO:

	INT. LONNEGAN'S CAR - NIGHT

	Driving through the city, the driver and Floyd in front,
	Hooker and Lonnegan in back.

	Hooker glances out the window from time to time, just to
	make sure they're really going to his place.

					LONNEGAN
			Why me?  Shaw probably has lotsa
			enemies to choose from.

					HOOKER
			I need somebody respectable...but
			not completely legit.  What I'm
			gonna do isn't very legal.

					LONNEGAN
				(insulted)
			I'm a banker, friend.  That's legit
			in this state.

					HOOKER
			All you gotta do is place a bet for
			me at Shaw's place.  I'll supply
			all the money and the information.

	Lonnegan is listening, but you'd never know it.

					HOOKER
			If you help me out, I'll pay ya
			back the money you owe Shaw, myself.

					LONNEGAN
			That's worth fifteen grand to ya?

					HOOKER
			Maybe a couple million.

	We go to Lonnegan.  He's still not talking, but that last
	phrase has registered.

	EXT. HOOKER'S PLACE

	The car pulls up in front of Hooker's place.

					LONNEGAN
			You're dreamin', kid.

					HOOKER
				(getting out)
			660 Marshall Street.  Tomorrow at
			12:30, if you're interested.

					LONNEGAN
				(diffidently)
			If I'm not there by quarter of, I'm
			not coming.

	Hooker nods and walks up the steps to his apartment building.
	Lonnegan's car speeds away from the curb and on out of sight.
	Hooker breathes a sigh of relief.  He's passed his first
	test; or has he?  We follow him up the stairs to his room.

	INT. HOOKER'S APARTMENT

	He's just about to unlock the door, when he notices the
	little piece of paper he left in the door is on the floor.
	Without the slightest hesitation, Hooker leaps over the
	bannister and races back down the stairs.  Two gunmen, Riley
	and Cole, burst out of his room and fire at him over the
	railing, but he's already too far down.  Riley and Cole give
	chase.

								CUT TO:

	THE FRONT OF THE BUILDING

	Riley and Cole barrel out of the building and onto the
	sidewalk.  There is an empty bus stopped at a light, but
	they find no sign of Hooker.  As the light changes, we cut
	to the other side of the bus, where we see Hooker crouched
	on the rear wheel housing, hanging on to a vent.  He's a
	little shaken, but most of all, he's still alive.  We hold
	on him, as the bus moves off.

					GONDORFF (V.O.)
			Everything go all right?

					HOOKER (V.O.)
				(lying)
			Yeh, it was easy.

								CUT TO:

	INT. THE STORE - NIGHT

	Hooker and Gondorff are sitting alone in the back office
	while the work goes on outside.  Their conversation continues.

					GONDORFF
			No signs of trouble?

					HOOKER
			What do ya mean?

					GONDORFF
			You know, somebody tailin' ya.  A
			torpedo or somethin'.

					HOOKER
				(wanting to get off
				the subject)
			No, not a thing.

	Gondorff has his doubts, but lets them ride.

								CUT TO:

	OTHER PARTS OF THE STORE

	We concentrate on some of the fine details, i.e. Garfield
	explaining how the ticker will read out to Singleton and
	Billie; Curly Jackson showing a younger con man how to mark
	the odds board properly.

					GONDORFF (V.O.)
			How 'bout Lonnegan?

					HOOKER (V.O.)
			I gave him the breakdown just like
			ya told me to.

					GONDORFF (V.O.)
			And?

					HOOKER (V.O.)
			He threatened to kill me.

					GONDORFF (V.O.)
			Hell, they don't do that and you
			know you're not gettin' through to
			'em.

	We concentrate on Niles, who's making up the "boodles" or
	fake bankrollls.  He puts a real $100 bill on the bottom,
	then two inches of cut green paper on top, and then another
	$100 bill on top of that, so that it looks like he has a
	whole stack of $100 bills.  The bundle is then bound with a
	sealed label, like those used in banks, that says $10,000.
	We see that he has already made several of these bundles.

					HOOKER (V.O.)
			Then he drove me home.  He tried to
			put himself away as legit, so I
			went right into the pitch.

					GONDORFF (V.O.)
			Did he hold you up on anything?
	


					HOOKER (V.O.)
			Naw, he just sat there and listened.
			I don't know if he bought it or not.

								CUT TO:

	INT. THE STORE

	Twist in the middle of the room giving a route to the Eirie
	Kid.  He shows him where to get his drink at the bar, where
	to sit and finally how to leap up and throw his racing form
	down in disgust.

					GONDORFF (V.O.)
			That's all right.  Once they start
			listening, they're in trouble.
			Just don't give him more than he
			asks for.  If you rattle his
			imagination a little, he'll come up
			with all the right answers himself.
			But all he's gotta do is catch you
			in one lie and you're dead.

								CUT TO:

	HOOKER AND GONDORFF IN THE STORE OFFICE AGAIN

	They both look tired.

					HOOKER
			You think he'll show?

					GONDORFF
			Did he say he wouldn't?

					HOOKER
			No.

					GONDORFF
				(softly)
			He'll show.

								FADE OUT.

	FADE IN:

	THE TALE

								FADE OUT.

	FADE IN:

	WE OPEN ON A WIDE SHOT OF THE ALLEY OUTSIDE THE STORE

	At first it appears to be deserted, but we move to reveal a
	figure in an upper window of the apartment building which
	forms one side of the alley.  It's Kid Twist.  His eyes roam
	the street, for what, we do not yet know.

								CUT TO:

	INT. AN OLD DRUGSTORE ACROSS FROM THE ALLEY - DAY

	Probably prosperous at one time, it has since declined, its
	large fountain and eating area bow host to two bums and
	Hooker, who sits alone in a rear booth near the telephone.
	Dressed in a tuxedo, he nurses a cup of coffee, and anxiously
	alternates his glances between the clock and the empty
	street outside.  It's 12:52.

								CUT TO:

	INT. THE STORE - DAY

	The place is full of people, although we avoid long shot so
	as not to give away the room as a whole yet.  Instead, we
	concentrate on the tense, waiting faces of some of the more
	familiar people:

	Gondorff and Niles in tuxedos behind a barred cashier's area.
	Gondorff mutilates a piece of gum in his mouth.  Niles just
	stares out into space cracking his knuckles.

					GONDORFF
			Eddie, cut that out, will ya.

	The boardmarker walking nervously back and forth in front of
	his odds board, checking every letter and number.  He stops
	to cross a T on one of the horses' names.  It was already
	crossed, but he does it again anyway.

	Billie and Singleton, in an area hidden from the rest of the
	room, watching the print-out on the ticker machine.  The
	clicking of the ticker is the only sound we hear in the store.

	Curly Jackson in front of a mirror, pasting a fake Van Dyke
	on his chin to go with his tweed suit and monocle.

	A couple of Billie's girls adjusting their waitress outfits
	and primping their hair.  Each has a tray full of drinks
	beside her.

	The Eirie Kid silently retracing his "route" to make sure he
	has it down.

	Despite the crowd, there is no talking and little movement,
	save for the constant swirling of smoke from several cigars
	and cigarettes.  The group is like a theatre company waiting
	to go on opening night.

								CUT TO:

	THE DRUGSTORE AGAIN

	It's 12:56 and Hooker is worried.  He looks up to see two
	large men, obviously racket goons, come in the front door,
	and take a seat facing him in the next booth.  They stare at
	him impassively, waving the waitress away when she comes to
	take their order.  Hooker knows they're Lonnegan's men, but
	is somewhat unsettled by the fact that Lonnegan is not with
	them.  Suddenly, a voice.

					VOICE
			Carver?

	Hooker turns around to find that Lonnegan is seated in the
	booth directly behind him.  His bodyguard is in the one
	behind that.

					LONNEGAN
			You should always look to the back
			too, kid.

					HOOKER
				(sliding out of his
				booth and into Lonnegan's)
			I was afraid you weren't gonna come.
			We haven't got much time.

					LONNEGAN
				(curtly)
			Get on with it then.

					HOOKER
				(pointing to telephone)
			Sometime after 1:00 a guy's gonna
			call here and give you the name of
			a horse.
				(pulling out a wad of bills)
			All you do is take this two grand
			across the street to Shaw's place
			and bet it on that pony.  There's
			nothin' to it, but don't take too
			much time.  We only have 3 or 4
			minutes after you get the call.

					LONNEGAN
			You're not gonna break him with a
			$2,000 bet.

					HOOKER
			This is just a test.  The big one
			comes later.  Be careful with that
			though, it's all I got.

					LONNEGAN
			And you were gonna pay me back?

					HOOKER
			I am after this race.

	Lonnegan says nothing.  He's not sure he likes a man who's
	stupid enough to bet his last dollar on a horse race.

					HOOKER
			I gotta get back before Shaw misses
			me.  Good luck.

	EXT. STREET

	Hooker hustles out across the street and into the alley.

	INT. DRUGSTORE

	Lonnegan watches him through the window and then settles
	back in his seat to wait for the phone.

	OUTSIDE STORE

	As Hooker descends the stairwell into the store, he gives
	Kid Twist the office.  Twist turns away from the window and
	looks at his watch.  12:58.

								CUT TO:

	DRUGSTORE

	Lonnegan waiting by the phone, idly pinging a knife on the
	salt shaker.  It's 1:40.  A man enters the store and walks
	over to use the phone.

					LONNEGAN
			We're waitin' for a call.

	The man looks at Lonnegan a second, and then at his four
	goons.  He decides maybe he'll make the call later.

								CUT TO:

	INT. THE STORE

	Kid Twist again.  Billie enters the room with a piece of
	paper.  Kid Twist looks at it a second and then picks up the
	pohne and begins to dial.

	INT. DRUGSTORE

	Lonnegan again.  He's getting impatient now and lights a
	cigarette, and then the phone rings.  He answers it quickly
	and we hear:

					TWIST
			Bluenote at 6 to 1 on the nose.

	The receiver clicks down at the other end.  Lonnegan hangs
	up and goes out the door, followed by his entourage.

	EXT. STREET

	We follow him across the street and into the alley, where he
	signals one of the bodyguards to check the place out.  Kid
	Twist pushes a button on his window sill, and a buzzer goes
	off inside the store.  The previously inert figures there
	spring to life.

	Lonnegan's bodyguard descends the stairwell and knocks at
	the door, where he is greeted by Hooker in the capacity of
	host.  He looks the place over and motions an okay to
	Lonnegan.

	INT. THE STORE

	As Lonnegan enters, we see the room for the first time in
	its entirety.  Overnight it has been transformed into a
	swank private club, with bar, cigarette girls, upholstered
	furniture and chandeliers.

					SINGLETON
			Look at that.  He's got four apes
			with him.

					GONDORFF
			That's what I like about these
			guys, J.J... They always got
			protection against things we'd
			never do to 'em.

	Everywhere there is activity.  A bank of telephones buzzes
	incessantly.  Sheet writers scurry from phone to phone,
	taking bets of tremendous size from prominent people.

					SHEET WRITER
			Yes, Mr. Ruth, 20,000 on Dancing
			Cloud.

	We reveal that the phones are controlled by a master switch,
	which one of the recruited con men operates from behind a
	partition.

	The boardmaker, wearing headphones suspended from a sliding
	wire, hurriedly chalks up races and odds on a huge blackboard.
	From the loudspeakers we hear the words "last flash." The
	odds on Bluenote settle down to 8 to 1.

	Lonnegan makes his way through the throng toward the betting
	line.  His bodyguards fan out to various positions in the
	room.  The betting crowd itself (known as the "boost")
	consists of close to twenty people, none of whom, of course
	are what they're pretending to be.  There are brokers with
	pasty faces, sportsmen, tanned and casual, and financiers
	with goatees and highly tailored clothes.  Large amounts of
	money are changing hands at the betting window.  Boodles are
	in sight everywhere.

	Lonnegan slips into the betting line, feeling somewhat
	estranged from the general merriment around him.  There are
	two men in line ahead of him.  The first, Curly Jackson,
	slaps down several bundles of cash in front of Niles, who's
	the cashier, and places a $20,000 bet on War Eagle.  Gondorff
	appears at the cashier's window and catches sight of Lonnegan.

					GONDORFF
			Never get enough, huh pal?  I'd
			think you'd get tired of losin',
			Honnigan.

					LONNEGAN
				(piercingly)
			The name is Lonnegan.

					GONDORFF
				(to Niles)
			Make sure you see cash from this
			guy, Eddie.  He's got the name for
			bettin' money he don't have.

	The man in front of Lonnegan puts $5,000 on Dancing Cloud.
	He makes the bet on credit.  Lonnegan steps to the window.

					LONNEGAN
			Two-thousand on Bluenote.

					NILES
				(writing out a ticket)
			Is that all?

					LONNEGAN
				(pissed)
			That's all.

	Bluenote's race is now up on the board.  The race caller
	comes on the loudspeaker.

					CALLER
			Ladies and Gentlemen.  This is
			Arnold Rowe, your caller for the
			second race at Belmont in New York.
			A mile and 1/8.  Four year olds and
			up.  And they're off!

	We see that the caller is Singleton, and that he's calling
	the race from a concealed booth next to the cashier's cage.

					CALLER
			Around the first turn it's a War
			Eagle first by a length, Jail Bate
			second by one and a half, Dancing
			Cloud third by a half on the
			outside, followed by Lucky Lady,
			Mojo, Wits' End and Bluenote.

	Lonnegan goes to the bar, orders a drink, and settles down
	at one of the tables.  It happens to be the one the Eirie
	Kid is at.  Gondorff and Niles watch it from the cashier's
	cage.

					GONDORFF
				(worried)
			That's not where we want him to sit.

	Eirie tries to ignore Lonnegan at first, but realizes he
	better make some conversation.

					EIRIE KID
			C'mon War Eagle.
				(to Lonnegan)
			That Dancing Cloud's a hell of a
			finisher.  War Eagle's gonna have
			to open up a little more on 'em.

					LONNEGAN
			You know anything about a horse
			named Bluenote?

					EIRIE KID
			Naw, he's never done much.  Probably
			in here just to round out the field.
			War Eagle's where you wanna have
			your money.

	Eirie excuses himself and heads for the bar.

					CALLER
			Into the clubhouse turn, it's War
			Eagle by two lengths, Dancing Cloud
			has moved up to second by a half,
			Lucky Lady is third by three
			followed by Jail Bait, Mojo,
			Bluenote and Wits' End.

	The heretofore chaotic energy of the parlor is now focused
	on the race.  Several of the patrons begin to yell for their
	horses.  Lonnegan remains seated.  He seems bored with it
	all.  Hooker comes over to clear some empty glasses from his
	table.

					LONNEGAN
				(out of the corner of
				his mouth)
			You really picked a winner, kid.

					HOOKER
			Give 'em a little time.

					CALLER
			Into the backstretch it's War Eagle
			still by a length, Dancing Cloud
			closing on the inside, is second by
			two, Lucky Lady is third by one and
			a half, followed by Bluenote, Jail
			Bait, Wits' End and Mojo.

	Lonnegan perks up just a little.  Bluenote, at least, has
	moved up.  The rest of the people in the place are really
	rooting now.  Few of them remain seated.

	Hooker arrives at the bar, with the glasses he cleared from
	Lonnegan's table.  Eirie is already there, fortifying
	himself with a scotch.

					HOOKER
			You're doin' great, Eirie.  He
			loves ya.

	Eirie nods, somewhat unconvinced, and heads bak to the table.

					CALLER
			Into the far turn, it's Dancing
			Cloud now by half a length, War
			Eagle is second by two, Bluenote is
			third by a half and moving fast on
			the outside.  Lucky Lady is fourth
			by four lengths, followed by Jail
			Bait, Wits' End and Mojo.

	Lonnegan is getting more intent now.

					CALLER
			Coming down the stretch, it's
			Dancing Cloud by one length, War
			Eagle and Bluenote are neck and
			neck by two.  Now it's Dancing
			Cloud, Bluenote and War Eagle.
				(shouting now)
			Dancing Cloud and Bluenote head to
			head...

	The place is going crazy.  Even Singleton is standing up to
	get the necessary excitement in his voice.

					CALLER
			Dancing Cloud, Bluenote.  Dancing
			Cloud, Bluenote.  It's Bluenote by
			a nose.  Dancing Cloud is second by
			two, War Eagle third by three and a
			half.  Time for a mile and 1/8,
			2:01 and 6/10 seconds.

	Most of the patrons collapse into their chairs like spent
	lovers.  Eirie slams his racing form to the floor.  Nobody
	had Bluenote.

					CURLY
				(tearing up his ticket)
			Bloody awful.  Who in blazes is
			Bluenote?

					LONNEGAN
				(to Eirie, very self-satisfied)
			War Eagle's where you want to have
			your money, huh?

	Eirie doesn't reply.  He can't believe Bluenote won.
	Lonnegan looks to Hooker.  Hooker gives him a wink.  For
	the first time, Lonnegan permits a smile.

								CUT TO:

	LONNEGAN AT THE CASHIER'S WINDOW

	Niles is counting out $16,000 to him (all of which Gondorff
	won the night before).  Gondorff looks somewhat perturbed.
	Lonnegan picks up the money and tauntingly waves it at him.

					GONDORFF
				(getting his name
				right this time)
			Don't bother to come back with a
			piker's bet like that again,
			Lonnegan.  We got a $5,000 minimum
			here.
				(to Hooker)
			Show this bum out.

	Hooker hesitates a second.

					GONDORFF
			Go on, ya goddamn ninny.

	Gondorff gives Hooker a hard shove in the back with his
	foot, sending him into a table and sprawling to the floor.

					GONDORFF
				(indicating Lonnegan's
				bodyguards)
			And tell him not to bring his
			garbage men in here no more.  This
			is a class joint.

	Hooker, pretending to be humiliated, gets to his feet and
	escorts Lonnegan to the door.  Lonnegan stops, gives Gondorff
	a derisive smile, and walks out.  Once he's gone, the
	general clatter and hubbub in the room cease, like it had
	been turned off by a faucet.  Most of the boost sit down and
	relax.  Curly Jackson rips off his Van Dyke.  It's been
	itching him.

					GONDORFF
			He's gaffed, kid.  He should start
			coming to you now.

								CUT TO:

	INT. COMB'S OFFICE AT THE CLEARINGHOUSE - DAY

	Combs sits passively on the edge of his desk glancing across
	the room every now and then at Riley, who is slumped uneasily
	in a folding chair, looking like a defendant at the
	Inquisition.  Both remain silent, like two men in a waiting
	room.  Suddenly, what they've been waiting for arrives.
	Lonnegan comes into the office, flanked by his bodyguards.
	Skipping the usual pleasantries, he walks right over to Riley.

					LONNEGAN
			All right, Riley.  What the hell
			happened?

					RILEY
				(not looking at him)
			We missed him.

					LONNEGAN
			You weren't hired to miss him.

					RILEY
			There wasn't any way he coulda
			known we was in there.  We made a
			clean pick on the lock and didn't
			leave no footprints in the hall.
			Somebody musta wised him up.

					LONNEGAN
			Yeh, and what does Cole say about
			that?

					RILEY
			I don't know.  He took it hard.

					LONNEGAN
			All right, get outa here.  You're
			outta work.

	Riley gets up and drags himself out the door like a whipped
	dog.

					LONNEGAN
			We'll put Salino on it.  I need
			somebody careful.

					COMBS
			Salino?  Why waste our best people
			on a small-time job like this?  It
			ain't no heavy gee we're after.
			The guy's a five and dime grifter.

					LONNEGAN
			Then why ain't he dead?

					COMBS
			They didn't think he'd be so cagey,
			that's all.  They'll get him next
			time.

					LONNEGAN
			Use Salino.  It'll take a little
			longer, but there won't be any
			holes in it.

	Combs gives up.  The second time's the charm.

					LONNEGAN
			And tell Cole I wanta see him when
			he gets in.

					COMBS
			He's not comin' in.  Not to get
			bounced off a job anyway.

					LONNEGAN
			He had his chance and all he did
			was shoot up a rooming house.  Made
			a lotte noise and woke up a few
			cops, but didn't hit nothin'.

	Combs keeps his mouth shut.  There's no way to talk to
	Lonnegan when  he's like this.

					LONNEGAN
				(cooling a little)
			This is Salino's job now, Vince.
			If Cole wants to muscle in on it,
			that's his business.  But he's
			breakin' the rules and when Salino
			finds out about it, I can't feel
			sorry for what's gonna happen to him.

								CUT TO:

	INT. LONNEGAN'S HOTEL - DAY

	The finest the period had to offer.  We pick up Hooker
	coming down the hall to Lonnegan's suite.  He is admitted by
	the Bodyguard.  Lonnegan, wearing a smoking jacket, is
	seated at a table counting a pile of money.  There are two
	other assistants standing behind him.  They don't look
	friendly.

					HOOKER
			Well, what did I tell ya?

					LONNEGAN
			You're a lucky man, all right.

					HOOKER
			Lucky, hell.  I could do it every
			day.

					LONNEGAN
			Why don't ya then.

					HOOKER
			'Cause it's better to do it all at
			once.
				(leaning close)
			We're puttin' down 400 grand next
			week.  At 5-1 we make 2 million.
			Twenty per cent of that is yours if
			ya stick with us.

					LONNEGAN
			You got a system, Carver?
	


					HOOKER
			You stayin' in or not?

					LONNEGAN
			I'm in.

					HOOKER
				(drawing up a chair,
				barely able to
				contain his enthusiasm)
			It's foolproof.  We got a partner
			downtown runs the central office of
			the Western Union.  Race results
			from all over the country come in
			there and go right across his desk
			on their way to the bookies.  All
			he does in hold them up a couple
			minutes until he can call us and
			get a bet down on the winner.  Then
			he releases the results to the
			bookies and we clean up on a race
			that's already been run.  It can't
			miss, unless the Western Union
			Dicks get onto it.

	Lonnegan is amazed.  He sits back a second, then comes
	forward again and pushes a pile of bills over to Hooker.
	Hooker smiles and begins to count the money.

					LONNEGAN
			You got the 400 grand yet?

					HOOKER
			Not yet, but...
				(stopping suddenly)
			Hey, there's only a grand here.

					LONNEGAN
				(more like a command)
			I think we oughta place another bet
			tomorrow.

					HOOKER
				(getting angry)
			What is this?  That's my money.
			You tryin' to muscle me?

					LONNEGAN
				(controlled)
			If your system's as foolproof as
			you say, you'll get even more.

	Hooker's in a jam and he knows it.

					HOOKER
				(after a pause)
			I gotta talk to me partner first.
			We can't afford to expose our game
			too much.

					LONNEGAN
			Let me talk to him.

					HOOKER
				(flatly)
			No.

					LONNEGAN
			You want your money back?  Try and
			get it in a court of law.
				(softening a bit)
			C'mon, don't be a sorehead.  I'll
			make it worth your while.  Migth
			even help ya finance the big play
			if this one works out.

	Hooker says nothing for a minute, and then reluctantly nods
	his head.

					HOOKER
			Four o'clock tomorrow.  Pick me up
			at Dewey Lyle's.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. LONNEGAN'S HOTEL - DAY

	We pick up Hooker coming out of the hotel and going off down
	the street.  As he does so, we pull back all the way across
	the street and through the interior of a parked car to
	reveal the silhouette of a man seated at the wheel.  We move
	to his right hand, which rests on the steering column.  It's
	covered by a black glove and the middle finger is missing.
	His trigger finger, however, taps lightly on the wheel.

								CUT TO:

	INT. AN INDOOR TELEPHONE BOOTH - DAY

	One of the old, wooden kind -- accordian doors with glass
	panes in the upper half.  Hooker dials rapidly.

					HOOKER
			Twist?  I told him the tale.  He
			wants to see ya.

					TWIST
			All right, when?

					HOOKER
			Tomorrow, after 4:00.  Stay inside,
			I'll come in and get ya.  And be
			hard on him for a while; he's
			talking money.

					TWIST
			Okay, Tootsie.

	Hooker blows a mock kiss through the phone and hangs up.  He
	turns to leave the booth, when suddenly he sees something
	that stops him cold.  There looking through the glass is the
	smirking face of Detective Synder.  Hooker is immobilized.

	Snyder puts his hand inside his coat and slowly draws out
	his gun.  He points it right at Hooker's face and then
	violently smashes all the glass in the upper half of the
	door with the barrel.  Fragments of glass spray into the
	booth, a couple of which imbed themselves in Hooker's cheek.

	Hooker quickly whips open the door, trapping Snyder's hand
	in the accordian and jarring loose his gun.  Hooker sprints
	out of the booth as Snyder scrambles for his pistol and
	gives pursuit.

	EXT. ALLEYS AND SIDESTREETS - NIGHT - THE TWO MEN

	We follow the two men up alleys and sidestreets as they race
	through the dregs of the city, two panting shadows moving
	through places that only get light at night.  The wind blows
	drops of blood off Hooker's cheek as he runs.  Snyder still
	has his gun, but would rather inflict pain than death.

	CONDEMNED BUILDING

	Hooker makes for a condemned building and scrambles up the
	stairs, steps giving way under him as he goes.

	INT. BUILDING

	On the fourth floor, he ducks into a room and quickly locks
	the door.

	We pan the room to reveal that the whole back side of the
	building is gone.  Hooker runs toward the ledge and leaps
	through the air, landing on the fire escape of an adjacent
	building, some 15 feet away.  He kicks in a window and goes
	off down the hall.  We cut back to

	Snyder furiously kicking in the locked door.  He finally
	crashes through, only to find an empty room and a beautiful
	panorama of the city and its nearest Hooverville.

								CUT TO:

	LONG SHOT - HOOKER

	Winding his way through the slum area of town, dashing along
	backstreets, over fences and through vacant lots, making
	good his escape.  From our angle, he looks like a rat in a
	maze.

					GONDORFF (V.O.)
			Why didn't you tell me about Snyder
			before?

					HOOKER (V.O.)
			I thought I'd lost him.

								CUT TO:

	INT. GONDORFF'S ROOM AT THE CAROUSEL BUILDING - DAY

	Hooker sits sullenly at the table.  Billie stands over him
	putting some ointment on his face to close the cuts.
	Gondorff looks on.  Their discussion continues.

					GONDORFF
			Well you found him again and we're
			gonna have to do somethin' about it.
			What else haven't ya been tellin' me?

					HOOKER
			Nothin'.  I told ya everything
			there is.

					GONDORFF
			Then why'd ya move outa your room?

					HOOKER
			It was too noisy.

					GONDORFF
			You can't play your friends like
			marks, Hooker.

	Hooker doesn't reply.  He knows Gondorff's on to him.

					GONDORFF
			You know how easy it'd be for one
			of Lonnegan's guys to nail you?

					HOOKER
			All we need is a couple days, Henry.
			A couple days and we'll get Lonnegan
			down and stomp on 'em.

					GONDORFF
			You just won't learn, will ya.
			Hell, you come in here, I teach you
			stuff maybe five guys in this world
			know, stuff most grifters couldn't
			do even if they knew it, and all
			you wanna do is run down a bullet.
				(pause)
			You're just like all them new jerks.
			Lotsa nerve and no brains.  And ten
			years from now when me and the
			others are through and you dumb
			guys are all dead there won't be
			one gee left who knows the Big Con
			was anything more than a way to
			make a livin'.

					HOOKER
			A couple days; that's all I'm
			askin'.  I can stay clear that long.

					GONDORFF
				(trying to be angry
				and failing)
			Christ, they'll probably miss you
			and hit me.

								FADE OUT.

	FADE IN:

	THE WIRE

								FADE OUT.

	FADE IN:

	INT. A SLEEPY DINER - LATE AFTERNOON

	Located across the street from Hooker's apartment building.
	Hooker sits down alone in a booth, with a plate of ham and
	eggs he's hardly touched.

	The two cuts on his face have pretty much stopped bleeding.
	A big fan above the counter area drones away lethargically,
	it's air stream insufficient to either cool the place or
	drive out the smell of onions and grease.

	A waitress, Loretta, emerges from the kitchen and ambles
	slowly over to Hooker's table.  Slim and raven-haired, she
	manifests an indifference bred from years spent delivering
	things to people who are rarely grateful for what she brings.
	Only a light scar on her left cheek hints at another side.
	


					LORETTA
			You done?

					HOOKER
			Yeh, I guess I shoulda had the meat
			loaf.

					LORETTA
				(deadpan)
			It isn't any better.

					HOOKER
			Where's June today?

					LORETTA
				(figuring up the bill)
			She don't work here no more.  I'm
			fillin' in for a couple days...
			till I can get a train outa here.

					HOOKER
			Where you goin'?

					LORETTA
				(putting the check
				down and walking away)
			I don't know.  Depends what train I
			get on.

	Hooker looks for some sign that she's putting him on.  He
	doesn't get it.  He takes out some money, drops it on the
	table and walks out.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. A WESTERN UNION OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON

	A truck with the words CLAYTON BROS., CUSTOM PAINTING AND
	DECORATING stenciled on the side, is parked out front.  Two
	men, wearing overalls and painter's caps, walk into the
	office to the reception counter, we see that they are Twist
	and Singleton.

					TWIST
				(to the receptionist)
			Excuse me.  We're here to paint Mr.
			Harmon's office.

					RECEPTIONIST
				(obviously not
				expecting them)
			Mr. Harmon's office?  Hold on just
			a second.
	


She goes to get Mr. Harmon.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. THE SLEEZY DINER - LATE AFTERNOON

	Hooker is standing on the curb outside the diner, obviously
	waiting for somebody.  Lonnegan's car pulls up and Hooker
	hops in the back.

					LONNEGAN
			What happened to your face?

					HOOKER
			Had a little fight with a raggle
			down on 13th.  She got me with her
			ring.

	Lonnegan laughs.

								CUT TO:

	INT. THE WESTERN UNION OFFICE AGAIN - LATE AFTERNOON

	Mr. Harmon is looking over the authorization papers that
	Twist and Singleton have given him.  He can't find anything
	wrong with it.

					HARMON
			Brigham signed it all right.  I
			can't understand why he didn't tell
			me.

					SINGLETON
			Ah, he's like all them supervisors.
			They think they're too good for
			regular people.  He says he was in
			here a while ago and the place was
			a mess.

	Harmon looks around, hoping it's not true.

					TWIST
			We'll try and hurry so we don't
			keep you out of your office too long.

					HARMON
			Why can't I work with you in there?

					SINGLETON
			Look pal, we gotta cover the floor,
			the furniture, everything, so we
			don't spill on nothing.  Now if you
			wanta sit in there with a tarp over
			your head, you're welcome to it.

					HARMON
			All right, how long will you be?

					TWIST
			Hour or two at the most.  We do
			good work.

	Harmon is resigned.  Twist and Singleton pick up their gear
	and march into the office.  Once inside, we notice that the
	office has an exit door which opens to an outside alley.
	Twist immediately removes his overalls, revealing the suit
	and tie he's wearing underneath.  He takes out a picture of
	himself, a woman and three small children, and puts it on
	Harmon's desk, replacing a similiar picture of Harmon's
	family.  Singleton, meanwhile, has spread a few tarps and
	begins to paint the walls.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. THE WESTERN UNION OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON

	Lonnegan's car pulls up and stops across the street.

					HOOKER
			We'll go to the side door.

	We follow Hooker and Lonnegan across the street to the side
	entrance which opens into:

	INT. HARMON'S OFFICE

	Hooker knocks and Twist, of course, answers.

					HOOKER
			Les, I got Mr. Lonnegan with me.
			He wants to see you a second.

					TWIST
				(irritated)
			What the hell's the matter with you.
			We coulda met at a club or somethin'.

					HOOKER
			I thought it might be good for him
			to see the setup.

					TWIST
				(hushed)
			Well we can't talk in here.  They're
			having the place painted.

	Twist walks over to the intercom on his desk.  He leaves the
	door open so that Lonnegan can get a good look at the
	office, Twist's picture in it, the painter, etc... Lonnegan's
	not missing any of it.

					TWIST
				(talking into the intercom)
			Miss Barnes, I'm going home a
			little early today.  Tell anyone
			that calls that they can reach me
			here in the morning.  Thank you.

								CUT TO:

	INT. FRONT OFFICE

	Harmon's secretary at the other end of the intercom.  Mr.
	Harmon is with her.  They look at each other a second and
	Harmon decides he better see what's happening in his office.
	He opens the door to find it empty except for a pile of
	painting equipment and one haphazardly painted wall.

								CUT TO:

	INT. A DILAPIDATED CHINESE RESTAURANT - EVENING

	Dark and somewhat foreboding, its peeling dragons and shoddy
	lanterns compete for space with the many slot machines and
	arcade games that line the walls.  Hooker, Lonnegan and
	Twist sit at one of the more secluded tables.  They are not
	eating.

					TWIST
			Can't do it.  There're telegraph
			inspectors all over the place.  I
			got 750 grand coming in from the
			coast, and I'm not gonna blow it
			for a lousy 14 gees.  We'll get
			somebody else to do our betting.

					LONNEGAN
			I could come up with 750 grand in a
			day if I had a reason to.

					TWIST
			But who says you will.  I got a guy
			I can depend on.  He's liquidating
			everything he has for this.  You
			wouldn't even give Carver his money
			back.

					LONNEGAN
			I need more proof, that's all.
			Anybody can get lucky once.

					TWIST
				(stubbornly)
			On a 6-1 shot?  The hell with ya.
			We'll keep the deal we got.

					LONNEGAN
			If it works again tomorrow, I'll
			have a half million in cash here by
			noon the next day.  We split 60-40.

					TWIST
				(feebly, beginning to break)
			We were getting 50 from our guy.

					LONNEGAN
			With 20% coming off the top for me
			laying your bet.  Either way you
			end up with 40.

	Twist hesitates.

					LONNEGAN
			A week's a long time, friend.
			Anything can happen.  All of it bad.

					HOOKER
			He's right, Les.

					TWIST
			Yeh, and what if we play tomorrow
			and he doesn't come up with the
			money.  We risk our whole operation
			for nothing.  I'll say when we make
			our bets.

					LONNEGAN
			Not if you want me to keep makin'
			'em for ya.
	


					HOOKER
			And what do we know about your guy.
			He says a week, but who knows if
			it's a month?  Lonnegan here's a
			banker.  He can get that dough with
			no questions asked.

	Twist says nothing for a minute, then:

					TWIST
			All right.  Be at the booth at 1:00.
			I'll give you all three places this
			time, Lonnegan.  That better be
			proof enough.

	Hooker and Lonnegan smile at each other like life-long
	friends.  They get up to leave, and we frame the shot with a
	coffee cup large in the foreground.  As they go out the
	door, a black-gloved hand with four fingers enters the frame
	and puts a nickel down next to the cup.

	INT. A DOWNTOWN DINETTE - MORNING

	Snyder finishes a donut and a cup of coffee, puts down a
	dime for the lot and exits.  We follow him down the street:

	EXT. STREET

	To a corner newsstand, where he stops to buy a morning paper.
	As he peruses it, he's approached by two large, clean-cut
	men in white skimmers.

					MAN
			Are you Lieutenant William Snyder?

					SNYDER
			I don't know, what's up?

					MAN
			F.B.I... The Captain'd like a few
			words with ya.  Ya got a couple
			minutes?

					SNYDER
				(completely floored)
			Yeh, sure.

	The two men show him to a waiting car.

								CUT TO:

	INT. AN ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY

	Snyder stands in the middle of a dusty old machine room,
	surrounded by four or five Federal Agents.  Visible around
	the room are several folding cots and portable lockers.  The
	agents have obviously been quartered here temporarily.  They
	all wear white skimmers, save for one, a portly man, Captain
	Polk, who paces the room smoking.  There is something long-
	suffering about him, as if he wondered how he ever got in a
	service that thought white skimmers were classy.

					SNYDER
			What is this?  I got work to do.

					POLK
			Sit down and shut up, will ya.  Try
			not to live up to all my
			expectations.
				(not in the mood to
				screw around)
			We were told you know a hustle
			artist named Johnny Hooker.

	Snyder doesn't answer.

					POLK
			Do ya know him or don't ya?

					SNYDER
			Yeh, but I don't know where he is.

					POLK
			Well we do.  He's chummin' around
			with a Big C named Henry Gondorff.
			Ring any bells?

					SNYDER
			Sure.  Every bunco man in the
			country knows Gondorff.

					POLK
			There's word he's gonna run a con
			on the North Side here.  We got a
			year-old Florida warrant on him,
			but it's a thin beef, and he can
			beat it in court unless we catch
			him cold.  All we want you to do is
			pick up Hooker for us.

					SNYDER
			Why don't you pick him up yourself?

					POLK
			Cause the stoolies are used to
			street dicks jumpin' him.  If word
			gets around that Feds are in on it
			too, Gondorff'll fold up the whole
			thing.

					SNYDER
			Wouldn't that be too bad.  You'd
			hafta move outa this nice office ya
			got.

					POLK
				(enraged)
			Don't crack wise to me, flatfoot.
			I spent a lotta time in dumps like
			this, eatin' Gondorff's dust while
			the bunco squad gets rich tippin'
			him off.  But it's not gonna happen
			this time.  We're not even gonna
			let the police know we're here.  If
			you keep your mouth shut and do a
			job, there'll be a promotion in it
			for ya.  And you better take it,
			cause I can make ya work for us
			without it.

					SNYDER
			What the hell good is Hooker to ya?

					POLK
			He's gonna set up Gondorff for us.

					SNYDER
			He'll never do it.

					POLK
				(self-satisfied)
			I think he will.

								CUT TO:

	Lonnegan sits by the phone, watching the clock and sipping a
	cup of coffee.

								CUT TO:

	INT. THE STORE - DAY

	Specifically, the small room from which Singleton does his
	race broadcasts.  Singleton, himself, is hunched over the
	ticker machine, reading the print-out.  Billie sits at the
	microphone table with a pencil and pad, ready to write.

					SINGLETON
			Visitation is still up by two at

			second, Fasanella third.

					BILLIE
			What's the line on Visitation?

					SINGLETON
				(checking further up
				on the print-out sheet)
			7 to 2.  That ain't bad.

					BILLIE
			He'll probably fall down.

	Gondorff appears at the doorway.

					GONDORFF
			How ya doin'?

					SINGLETON
				(eyes still glued to

			Nothin' yet.  I got a good one on
			the lead at Hialeah, but he's fadin'.

					BILLIE
			Best we had was Cat's Eye in the
			second at Del Mar, and he was only
			5-2.  Not many longshots comin' in
			today.

					SINGLETON
				(excited)
			Billie.  You ready?

	Billie prepares to write on her pad.

					BILLIE
			Yeh, go ahead.

					SINGLETON
			At the finish, it's Single Action
			by two, Fasanella second, Visitation
			third.
				(reading up the sheet again)
			Line on Single Action... 3 to 2.
			Hell with it, that's no good.

	Billie crumples up the piece of paper she's been writing on
	and chucks it in a wastecan.

					GONDORFF
			We don't need big odds on this one,
			J.J.  Take anything you get at 3-1
			or better.

	Gondorff leaves the room, as Singleton turns back to his
	vigil at the ticker.

					SINGLETON
				(a little weary)
			Okay, the Fairfield Stakes at Santa
			Anita.  Mile and a quarter for 3
			year olds and up.

								CUT TO:

	THE FLOOR AREA OF THE STORE

	Everyone is in his place as before.  Today, however, Curly
	Jackson is playing the part of the aging sport.

	Well scrubbed and clean shaven, he cuts a dashing figure in
	his blue blazer and white pants.  We go to Gondorff in the
	cashier's cage.  He's talking to Niles, who's busy handing
	out fake bankrolls to members of the boost.

					GONDORFF
			He's gonna hit ya with 20 grand,
			Eddie.  How much cash we got?

					NILES
			Not enough to cover a bet that big.

					GONDORFF
			Get a couple extra guys in the
			line, then.  We'll give him the
			shut-out.

	Niles nods.

								CUT TO:

	INT. DRUGSTORE - DAY

	Lonnegan is still waiting.  He takes the 20 grand out of his
	coat pocket and thumbs through it, just to make sure it's
	all there.

								CUT TO:

	INT. THE STORE - DAY

	Singleton and Billie at the ticker again.  Billie looks a
	little sleepy.  Singleton is obviously involved with the
	progress of a race.

					SINGLETON
			Okay, Billie, here we go.

	Billie snaps to and prepares to write as Singleton reads.

					SINGLETON
			At the wire it's Wrecking Crew the
			winner by five, Grand Theft second,
			Wingless third.
				(reading up)
			Wrecking Crew was...4 to 1.
				(ripping the sheet
				out of the ticker)
			That's our boy.

	Billie and Singleton hustle out of the room.

	EXT. ALLEY

	We follow Billie through the store and across the alley to
	the building from which Twist keeps his lookout.

								CUT BACK TO:

	INT. THE STORE

	Gondorff, holding the ticker sheet Singleton has given him,
	emerges from the office and starts giving instructions to
	the boost.

					GONDORFF
			All right, Furey, your horse is
			Wingless.  Paltrow, the Big Alabama
			and Phillips'll take Grand Theft.
			Rodgers and Eirie have Wrecking
			Crew.  Jackson -- His Dandy,
			Cowan -- Change of Heart, Fiskin
			and Chappie -- Made to Order.
				(pointing to the
				Eirie Kid)
			Eirie, he gets a bang outa seein'
			you lose, so we oughta use that on
			'em.  If you play the birds of a
			feather routine we worked on, it
			should steam him up pretty good.
			You think you can handle that?

					EIRIE KID
				(a little nervous)
			Yeh, sure.

					GONDORFF
			O.K., you guys in line take your
			time, and I wanta see lotsa joy on
			Wrecking Crew.

								CUT TO:

	INT. TWIST'S ROOM - DAY

	Billie enters and gives Twist the piece of paper she wrote
	the race results on.  He picks up the phone and starts to
	dial.

								CUT TO:

	INT. DRUGSTORE - DAY

	The phone rings and Lonnegan answers it.

					VOICE
			Wrecking Crew at 4-1, Grand Theft
			to place, Made to Order to show.

	Lonnegan smiles and hangs up the phone.

								CUT TO:

	INT. THE STORE - DAY

	Lonnegan's in line at the betting window.  There are four
	people in front of him this time, and they are moving rather
	slowly.  The "Last Flash" call is heard on the speakers.

					LONNEGAN
				(getting impatient)
			C'mon, let's hurry up there.

	The man at the head of the line turns around and gives
	Lonnegan a chilling look, as if he were beneath contempt.
	He puts down $25,000 on Grand Theft.  The next man in line
	plunges down $30,000 on Wrecking Crew.

	Just as Lonnegan is about to step to the window, Gondorff
	gives a quick signal to Singleton.  The speakers come on.

					CALLER
			Ladies and Gentlemen, this is
			Arnold Rowe, your caller for the
			$100,000 Fairfield Stakes at
			Hollywood Park in Los Angeles.  A
			mile and 3/8 for three year olds
			and up.  And they're off!

					LONNEGAN
				(counting out his money)
			Twenty-thousand on Wrecking Crew.

					NILES
			I'm sorry, sir.  We can't take bets
			after the race is started.

	He points to a sign above the window, which says exactly
	that.  Lonnegan grabs up his money in disgust.

					GONDORFF
			Don't take it so hard, pal.  You
			probably woulda lost it.

	Lonnegan wanders over to the bar in a funk.

					CALLER
			And around the first turn it's
			Wrecking Crew by a half length,
			Grand Theft second by one, His
			Dandy is third by one half, followed
			by Change of Heart, Back Flip, Made
			to Order and High Ground.

	The assembled patrons are once again thoroughly involved in
	the race.  Eirie comes up to Lonnegan at the bar.

					EIRIE KID
			Who you got?

					LONNEGAN
				(half-heartedly)
			Wrecking Crew.

					EIRIE KID
			Me too.  Maybe it's our day.

	Lonnegan nods and wanders away.  Hooker comes over to him.

					HOOKER
			What happened?

					LONNEGAN
			I didn't get the bet down in time.

					HOOKER
				(pissed)
			Oh, Jesus.

								CUT TO:

	INT. STORE OFFICE

	Gondorff and Niles, back in the office.

					NILES
				(looking out at the floor)
			Looks like he's sulking.

					GONDORFF
			If we're lucky, this'll bring him
			back stronger than ever.

								CUT TO:

	THE FLOOR

					CALLER
			Coming for home, it's Wrecking Crew
			by six lengths, Made to Order is
			second by two and a half, High
			Ground is third by a length and
			Grand Theft is coming fast on the
			rail.  It's Wrecking Crew, Made to
			Order and Grand Theft.  Wrecking
			Crew wins it by five lengths, Grand
			Theft is second by a nose, Made to
			Order is third by two.  Time for
			one and 3/8 mile, 2:11 and 4/10
			seconds.

	Eirie explodes in a joyous frenzy.  He grabs Lonnegan by the
	shoulders and shakes him.

					EIRIE KID
			We won!  We won!  You hear that!  I
			won 30,000!  You hear that!

	Yeh, Lonnegan heard that.  Lonnegan shakes loose, grabs his
	coat and heads for the door.

	EXT. ALLEY - DAY

	He finds Hooker waiting for him outside.

					LONNEGAN
			Tell your friend I'll have the
			money here by post-time tomorrow.
			We'll take the first race where the
			odds are 4-1 or better.  And make
			sure I can get to that window this
			time.

					HOOKER
			How am I gonna do that?

					LONNEGAN
				(coarsely)
			I don't know, figure something out.

	Lonnegan storms across the street to his waiting car and
	drives off.  Hooker relaxes into a smile.  He's already
	figured something out.

								CUT TO:

	INT. SLEEZY DINER ACROSS FROM HOOKER'S APT. BLDG. - EVENING

	Hooker sits at the counter finishing a plate of meat loaf.
	Loretta is down at the cash register, leaning on the counter,
	looking idly out into space.  Hooker glances over at her
	every once in a while to see if she might be interested in
	striking up a little conversation.  She's not.  He finishes
	his meal and comes down to the register to pay his bill.

					HOOKER
			Meat loaf, apple pie and a cup of
			coffee.

					LORETTA
				(ringing it up)
			Sixty-five.

	Hooker gives her a dollar.  She goes to the register for
	change.

					HOOKER
			What time you get off work here?

					LORETTA
			2:00 A.M.

					HOOKER
			You doin' anything tonight?

					LORETTA
				(handing him his change)
			Yeh, sleepin'.

	Hooker figures that's enough of that.  He pockets his change
	and starts out the door, when suddenly he stops short.

	EXT. STREET

	Across the street in a doorway is the silhouette of a man.
	It's Cole.  He's pretending not to look at the diner, but
	Hooker isn't fooled.

	INT. DINER

	He goes back to Loretta at the register.

					HOOKER
			You got a back door to this place?

					LORETTA
			No.  What's wrong with the front?

					HOOKER
				(urgently now)
			Look, I don't have time to fuck
			around.  There's somebody out there
			I don't need to see.  You got a
			fire escape or anything?

					LORETTA
			No.

					HOOKER
			All right, do me a favor.  Go into
			the bathroom, open the window and
			wait for me there.

					LORETTA
			What the hell for?

					HOOKER
			Just do what I tell ya and
			everything'll be jake.

	Cracks of concern begin to appear in Loretta's marble.

					LORETTA
			What does this guy want?

					HOOKER
				(evenly)
			He'd like to kill me.

	Loretta just looks at him a second.  Realizing that this is
	no joke, she turns and walks slowly but steadily to the
	bathroom.  Hooker waits until she's out of sight.

	EXT. STREET

	Hooker goes to the front door and steps outside.  Cole looks
	up at the sound of the door.  Hooker makes a big show of
	spotting him, and runs back into the diner.  Cole, his cover
	blown, draws his gun and races across the street in pursuit.
	Arriving just in time to see --

	INT. DINER

	Hooker go into the bathroom, he charges in after him, only
	to find the place empty.  He goes quickly from stall to
	stall, on the chance that Hooker might be hiding in one of
	them.

	He comes to one that's closed, and seeing a pair of woman's
	legs under the door, rejects that, and moves on to the next
	one.

	We cut inside the stall to reveal Loretta sitting on the
	toilet with her skirt hiked up.  Right behind her, crouched
	on the back of the seat, is Hooker.

	Cole has finished his rapid inspection now, and having found
	nothing, looks around for Hooker's probable escape route.
	He sees the open window and climbs out to find himself in a
	small air shaft, from which he knows Hooker could not escape.
	Hooker, seizing the time, bursts out of the stall and runs
	back out through the diner.  Cole sees him, but too late to
	get off a shot.  He climbs back in the window and gives chase.

	EXT. STREET

	We pick up Hooker barreling down the street with Cole a
	hundred yards or so behind.  Hooker makes a sharp cut into
	an alley, and we see immediately that it's a hopeless dead
	end.  Inexplicably, he makes no attempt to run back out.

	Cole draws up and cuts into the alley, anticipating the kill
	which should be easy now.  He prepares to sight down his
	victim, when suddenly he realizes there is no victim in
	sight.  Hooker, miraculously, has vanished.  Cole scans the
	alley frantically for some trace of him.  There are no
	windows or doors at the street level.  Not even a drain pipe.
	Just brick wall.  It's impossible.  Hooker has disappeared
	into thin air.

	Cole slams his gun into his shoulder holster with a curse,
	and starts back out of the alley, when all of a sudden he
	stops in utter terror.  His mouth drops open and he chokes
	out the words:

					COLE
			Salino, hey look.  I didn't mean to
			move in on...

	Before anything else can come out, two bullets rip into his
	chest.  He falls to the concrete, coming to rest on a
	manhole cover, which we notice is slightly ajar.  We:

								CUT TO:

	THE SEWER PIPES

	Beneath the manhole.  We see Hooker making his way through
	the slop, having gained another reprieve, but unaware that
	with two down, there is still one to go.

								CUT TO:

	INT. HOOKER'S APARTMENT BUILDING - EVENING

	Hooker comes in the front entrance and goes to the elevator,
	one of the old-fashioned kind with the iron grid on the
	inside.  He's still a little rattled and waiting for the
	elevator is making him restless.  It finally arrives, and he
	steps inside, closing the grid behind him.  As he starts to
	push the button for his floor, he realizes for the first
	time that he's not alone.  He looks to the corner to find
	Snyder, holding a gun on him.  This time there's not much
	doubt that he'll use it if necessary.

								CUT TO:

	INT. THE ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - EVENING

	Snyder brings Hooker into the crate room where Capt. Polk
	and the other Agents are waiting.  Polk, as usual, has his
	coat off, revealing his shoulder holster.

					POLK
			Hello, Mr. Hooker.  Captain Polk,
			F.B.I...
				(shoving a chair over
				to him)
			Have a seat.

	Hooker remains standing.

					POLK
				(ignoring it, drinking
				from a cup)
			You want a drink or something?

					HOOKER
			No.

					POLK
			We want to talk to ya about Henry
			Gondorff.

					HOOKER
			Don't think I know him.

					POLK
			Well give yourself a couple seconds,
			crumb.  You wouldn't wanna lie to
			me.  Lt. Snyder here says you done
			a lotta griftin' in this town.

					HOOKER
			Lt. Snyder doesn't know shit.

	Capt. Polk almost laughs, but he checks it.

					HOOKER
			You got nothin' on me.

					POLK
			We'll get it, and if we can't,
			we'll just make it up.  Grand
			larceny, extortion.
				(with special emphasis)
			Counterfeiting, anything you want.

	Hooker says nothing, but it's not from defiance now.  He's
	beginning to get the picture.

					POLK
			Look, I got nothin' against you,
			but you're in trouble here.  All
			you gotta do is tell us when
			Gondorff's gonna play his chump.
			We come in at the sting, make the
			pinch, and you walk out free as a
			bird.  No questions, no court
			appearance, nothing.

					HOOKER
			No.
	


					POLK
			You've already done time twice, and
			judges don't like three time losers.
			You wanna sit in the can for forty
			years, startin' tonight?

					HOOKER
			I'll make parole.

					POLK
			Like hell.  You won't even get a
			review till you're seventy.  And if
			the board starts to go soft, we'll
			let ya out in the yard some night
			with a hard-nose young bull who'll
			put fifty slugs in your face and
			ask what you were doin' there later.

	Hooker wants to come back with something, but can't find it.

					POLK
			Don't be a sap, kid.  You could
			save us a little trouble.  But
			Henry Gondorff is through whether
			you help us or not.  There's
			nothin' left to do now but save
			yourself.

	Hooker's thoroughly whipped.  He sits down for the first time.

					HOOKER
				(softly)
			Will you wait until the chump is
			played?

					POLK
			Hell yes.  We don't care about the
			mark.  He deserves what he gets.

					HOOKER
				(with heat)
			I mean completely played.  Until
			he's beat and the score is taken.
			You come in before we beat him and
			I'll kill him.  You'll have a tough
			time explaining that, won't ya.

					POLK
			All right, Hooker, but you take it
			on the lam, and we'll shoot you
			down on sight.

					HOOKER
				(barely audible)
			Just as long as I get to finish the
			play.

								CUT TO:

	INT. GONDORFF'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Gondorff and Hooker are playing gin rummy and drinking.
	Gondorff makes little comments as he plays, but Hooker is
	quiet and withdrawn.  The carousel is not in operation and a
	heavy silence hangs over the place.

					GONDORFF
			What's the matter, kid?  You're not
			sayin' much.

					HOOKER
			Just a little nervous, that's all.

					GONDORFF
			Luther always told me to bite my
			toenails when I get nervous.  You
			see yourself doin' that and you
			realize it ain't worth it.

	Hooker smiles feebly.

	Billie appears at the door.

					BILLIE
			Things are a little slow tonight,
			Henry.  I wanna open the round for
			the girls.

	Gondorff takes out a set of keys and tosses them to her.
	She leaves to go start the merry-go-round.  Gondorff settles
	back into the game.

					GONDORFF
			Take it easy, you won't lose him
			now.  We had him 10 years ago when
			he decided to be somebody.  Believe
			me, I've seen enough to know.

					HOOKER
				(softly)
			How many guys you conned in your
			life, Henry?

					GONDORFF
			Two or three hundred I guess.
			Sometimes played two a day when I
			was in Shea's mob.  We had it down
			to a business.
				(pause)
			'Course Chicago was a right town
			then.  The fix was in.  The dicks
			took their end without a beef.  All
			the Wall Street boys wanted to make
			investments for us.  Even had marks
			looking us up, thinkin' they could
			beat the game.
				(pause)
			Yeh, kid, it really stunk.  No
			sense in bein' a grifter if it's
			the same as bein' a citizen.

	Gondorff chucks his cards on the table.  He's through for
	the night.

					GONDORFF
			I better do some packin'.  I'm
			gonna be a hot number again after
			tomorrow.

					HOOKER
			Then why you doin' it?

					GONDORFF
			Seems worthwhile, doesn't it?
			Maybe it's just for the cave-in on
			Lonnegan's face when we put in the
			sting.

	That's good enough.  Hooker gets up to leave.

					HOOKER
			Henry.

					HOOKER
			Yeh.

					HOOKER
				(apologetically)
			I appreciate your stickin' your
			neck out.  I wouldn't have asked ya
			if it weren't for Luther.

					GONDORFF
			Ain't nothin' gonna make up for
			Luther, kid.
				(pause)
			Revenge is for suckers.  I been
			griftin' 30 years and never got any.

	Hooker just nods and walks out the door.

	INT. CAROUSEL

	We follow him past the Carousel which is now full of giggling
	prostitutes in various stages of undress.  Their childish
	frolicking is charming from a group usually so jaded, but
	it's lost on Hooker tonight.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. A CITY STREET - NIGHT

	It's late now and the street is deserted save for an
	occasional derelict or streetwalker on her way home from a
	night's work.  We pick up Hooker coming down the street
	toward his apartment building.  He walks slowly, almost
	reluctantly, as if he didn't care whether he ever got there
	or not.

	As he nears his building, he notices Loretta coming out of
	the diner across the street.  He stops and watches as she
	looks up and disappears into an adjacent building that
	advertises rooms for rent.  After a few seconds, we see a
	light come on in one of its second story windows.

	Hooker just stands there a second, debating with himself,
	trying to figure out a reason for doing what he's going to
	do anyway.  We follow him across the street to Loretta's
	building and:

	INT. LORRETA'S

	He goes up the stairs to the room where the light came on.
	He passes a couple of derelicts on the way.  He knocks twice
	and Loretta answers in her bathrobe.  She is more than a
	little startled to see him.

					LORETTA
			Looks like he missed ya.

					HOOKER
			Yeh, this time anyway.

	Loretta notices an old busybody peeping out at them from her
	room across the hall.

					LORETTA
			Good night, Mrs. Hillard.

	Mrs. Hillard quickly closes her door.

					HOOKER
				(shuffling a little)
			I, ah...thought you might wanna
			come out for a while.  Maybe have a
			drink or somethin'.

					LORETTA
			You move right along, don't ya.

					HOOKER
				(with more innocence
				than confidence)
			I don't mean nothin' by it.  I just
			don't know many regular girls,
			that's all.

					LORETTA
			And you expect me to come over,
			just like that.

					HOOKER
			If I expected somethin', I wouldn't
			be still standin' out here in the
			hall.

	Loretta looks at him carefully.  She knows it's not a line.

					LORETTA
				(with less resistance now)
			I don't even know you.

					HOOKER
				(slowly)
			You know me.  I'm just like you...
			It's two in the morning and I don't
			know nobody.

	The two just stand there in silence a second.  There's
	nothing more to say.  She stands back and lets him in.

								CUT TO:

	INT. GONDORFF'S ROOM - NIGHT

	A record spinning lazily on an old phonograph.  We hear
	Robert Johnson's "Come On In My Kitchen." Gondorff is
	sitting up in bed, with his hat on, lost in thought.  Billie
	is curled up asleep next to him.  There's a packed suitcase
	next to the bed.  Billie wakes up and turns over a second.
	


					BILLIE
			C'mon, Henry, knock off.  You've
			done everything you can.

	Gondorff nods his agreement like a zombie and goes right on
	thinking.

								CUT TO:

	LORRETA'S ROOM

	Hooker and Loretta are asleep against each other, their
	bodies illuminated every few seconds by the light from a
	neon sign across the street.  We dolly to the window and
	move in on another window in the building next door.  There's
	no light on in it, but we can discern the basic outline of a
	face behind the curtains, which are slightly parted to
	afford a view of Hooker's room by a black-gloved hand.

				"I said come on in my kitchen
			Cause it's gonna be rainin' outdoors."

	Music ends.

								FADE OUT.

	FADE IN:

	THE STING

								FADE OUT.

	FADE IN:

	We open on Hooker in bed, the morning sun streaming in on
	his face.  He awakens slowly, looks at the ceiling for a
	second and, remembering last night, turns to the side to
	find that Loretta is no longer there.  Still drowsy, he gets
	out of bed and looks around the room for a note or some
	evidence of her continued presence.  He opens an empty
	closet, then opens empty drawers.  Finding nothing, he
	suddenly hits on another possibility, and looks in his
	wallet.  The money is still there.  Almost disappointed, he
	slumps down in a chair, as the harsh reality of what will
	happen this day floods back in on him.  Music begins and we:

								CUT TO:

	INT. AN UNKNOWN LOCATION - DAY

	We see the black-gloved hand opening a small wooden box.
	Wrapped inside is a shiny black revolver, at this point in
	two pieces.  The hand reaches in and takes them out.

								CUT TO:

	INT. THE SLEEZY DINER - DAY

	Hooker is poking at a plate of waffles and sausage.  The
	waitress on duty is not Loretta and Hooker has noticed.

								CUT TO:

	INT. GONDORFF'S ROOM - DAY

	Gondorff is standing in front of the bathroom mirror,
	putting on his tuxedo.  He goes to his dresser, pulls out a
	very small gun and tucks it in his cummerbund.

								CUT TO:

	THE GUNNMAN'S ROOM AGAIN

	The hand swirls a pipe cleaner inside the barrel of the
	revolver and picks some lint out of the chamber.  He then
	screws the barrel onto the body.  This is all seen in closeup.

								CUT TO:

	HOOKER'S ROOM AGAIN

	Hooker now has his tuxedo on.  He takes two small rubber
	bladders out of a drawer and puts them in his pocket.

								CUT TO:

	INT. LONNEGAN'S SUITE - DAY

	Lonnegan paces nervously around the room, looking at the
	clock.  Obviously waiting for something, he's getting
	extremely impatient.

								CUT TO:

	THE GUNNMAN'S ROOM AGAIN

	We watch the hand carefully loading bullets into the chamber
	of the revolver.

								CUT TO:

	INT. THE CAROUSEL BUILDING - DAY

	Gondorff emerges from his room carrying his suitcase.  He
	stops and looks up at the mezzanine where Billie is standing.
	They smile sadly at each other and give a simple wave,
	having done this too many times to get sentimental about it
	now.  Gondorff walks out of the building.

								CUT TO:

	HOOKER'S ROOM AGAIN

	Hooker is busily stuffing all his possessions in a paper
	bag, lumping clothes with food, records and toilet articles.

								CUT TO:

	LONNEGAN'S SUITE AGAIN

	Lonnegan goes to the door to admit Floyd and two assistants,
	one of whom carries a large brief case.  Lonnegan takes the
	brief case to a table and opens it.  Inside is a half
	million dollars in cash.

								CUT TO:

	INT. THE GUNNMAN'S ROOM AGAIN

	We see the hand putting a silencer on the revolver.  The
	gunman puts the revolver up to his eye to check the alignment
	and for the first time we see the face that goes with the
	hand.  It is fully as menacing as we had imagined: Broad,
	flat nose, thick cracked lips, narrow eyes and cauliflower
	ears.

								CUT TO:

	HOOKER'S ROOM AGAIN

	Hooker is on the phone now.

	INT. WAREHOUSE

	We see that he's talking to Captain Polk.  Snyder listens
	also.

	HOOKER'S ROOM

	Hooker finishes the conversation, hangs up and goes to take
	one last look at himself in the mirror.  Finding everything
	in order, he grabs up his sack of possessions and leaves the
	room.

	EXT. HOOKER'S APARTMENT

	We pick him up emerging from the building, and follow him
	around the corner to a secluded alley which he generally
	takes on his way to the store.  As he walks along, he
	notices Loretta coming toward him from the other end.  She's
	wearing a coat, obviously on her way somewhere.  As she
	comes closer, we move to reveal the gunman appearing suddenly
	in the alley behind and to the right of Hooker.

	EXT. ALLEYWAY

	The gunman quickly takes out his revolver, braces it in the
	crook of his hand, and takes careful aim.  Loretta sees him.
	The gunman fires.  Loretta falls dead on the asphalt.

	Hooker spins around in confusion.  The gunman moves quickly
	toward him.  Hooker starts to back up but the gunman stops
	when he gets to Loretta.  He kicks her over to reveal a gun
	under her body.

					GUNMAN
			She was gonna kill ya, kid.

	Hooker is stunned.  He can't believe it.

					GUNMAN
				(dragging the body
				over behind a trash can)
			Her name's Loretta Salino.
			Lonnegan's people set her up in the
			diner.  C'mon, let's get outa here.

	Hooker wants to stay and try to figure it all out, but the
	gunman drags him away.

								CUT TO:

	INT. THE ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY

	Polk, Snyder and several federal agents are busy putting on
	their shoulder holsters, and checking their weapons.

					POLK
				(to Snyder)
			Whoever Gondorff's playin' for is
			bound to be a wheel.  As soon as
			we're inside, I want you to get the
			guy outa there as fast as possible,
			before the reporters show up.  We
			can't afford to embarrass any big
			shots.

	Snyder nods.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. LONNEGAN'S HOTEL - DAY

	Lonnegan, carrying the brief case personally, is seen
	getting into his limousine.  Four assistants get in with him.

								CUT TO:

	INT. THE STORE - DAY

	Gondorff enters the store carrying his suitcase.  Several of
	the boost are already there.  Gondorff clasps his hands to
	generate a little enthusiasm.  He's obviously up for this one.

								CUT TO:

	INT. TAXI CAB - DAY

	Hooker sits in the back seat with the gunman right next to
	him.  He's still very uneasy with this man.

					HOOKER
			She coulda killed me last night.

					GUNMAN
			Too many people coulda seen ya go
			in her room.  She was a professional.
			Used to work in the Dutch Schultz
			gang.

					HOOKER
			Who are you?

					GUNMAN
			Gondorff asked me to look after ya.

					HOOKER
			How do I know you're tellin' the
			truth.

					GUNMAN
			Don't have much choice, do ya?

	We go to Hooker.  No, he doesn't.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. THE ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY

	We pick up Polk, Snyder and the other federal agents coming
	out of the warehouse in their white skimmers, and piling
	into cars.

								CUT TO:

	THE STORE AGAIN

	Niles is busily spreading "boodles" all over the cashier's
	area.  Singleton checks his microphone.  It works fine.  He
	checks it again.

								CUT TO:

	LONNEGAN IN HIS LIMOUSINE

	He holds the brief case in his lap, his fingers tapping
	lightly on it.

								CUT TO:

	THE STORE AGAIN

	Hooker and the gunman enter and go over to Gondorff, who
	breaks into a wide smile.  Hooker returns it halfheartedly,
	still ill at ease about what has happened.

								CUT TO:

	THE F.B.I. CARS ON THEIR WAY

	There are four or five driving in a column.  Snyder and Polk
	ride together in the back of the lead car.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. THE DRUGSTORE - DAY

	Lonnegan's limousine pulls up outside, and the bodyguards
	pile out.

								CUT TO:

	THE STORE AGAIN

	Gondorff, Hooker and the others waiting, the tension
	expressed in their faces.

	INT. THE DRUGSTORE - DAY

	Lonnegan sits tensely in the usual booth.  He keeps both
	hands firmly planted on the brief case.  The phone rings and
	Lonnegan goes to it.  Music ends.

					VOICE
			Place it on Syphon at 8-1.

	Lonnegan hangs up with the look of the financial killer.
	Eight to one odds is more than even he could have hoped for.

	EXT. STREET

	We follow Lonnegan across the street and into the store.
	The bodyguards remain outside.
	


INT. THE STORE

	The store is buzzing with activity.  Money and booze are
	everywhere.  The sheet writer and the boardmarker can hardly
	keep up with the action.  Lonnegan walks quickly to the
	betting line and finds to his relief that there's only one
	man ahead of him.  The man puts $25,000 on King's Image.

	Lonnegan steps to the window, swings up the brief case, and
	opens it for Niles to see.

					LONNEGAN
				(straight-faced)
			Five hundred grand on Syphon.

	Niles is struck dumb.  He's never seen that much money before.

					NILES
				(playing the flustered
				clerk)
			Hold on, I'll have to get the
			manager.

	Niles goes and returns with Gondorff.

					GONDORFF
			What's the problem?

					NILES
				(pointing to the
				brief case)
			He wants to put a half million on
			Syphon.

	Gondorff looks at the money a second and then looks up at
	Lonnegan like he's gotta be crazy.

					GONDORFF
				(uneasily)
			I can't lay that off in time.  We
			lose a bet that big, it could break
			us.

					LONNEGAN
				(challenging)
			If ya win it could make ya, too.

					GONDORFF
				(to Niles)
			What are the odds on Syphon?

					NILES
			Eight to one.

	Gondorff looks at Lonnegan long and hard.

					GONDORFF
			A half mill on an eight to one shot.
			You're dumber than I thought,
			Lonnegan.

					LONNEGAN
			You're more gutless than I thought.

	The words "Last Flash" are heard on the speaker.  Gondorff
	looks at Lonnegan with utter contempt.  He turns to Niles.

					GONDORFF
				(chopped)
			Take it.

	Niles hurriedly writes out a slip for 500,000 dollars.
	Lonnegan, allowing himself a sly smile, picks it up and
	retires to a nearby table.  He flashes a little okay sign to
	Hooker who acknowledges it with a nod.

					CALLER
			Ladies and gentlemen, this is
			Arnold Rowe, your caller for the
			San Antonio Handicap at Pimlico in
			Baltimore -- A mile and 1/16 for
			three-year-olds.  And they're off.

	Lonnegan takes a deep breath and leans forward in his chair,
	the larceny boiling in his veins.  Hooker looks to Gondorff.
	Gondorff gives him the "office." Hooker has to smile.

					CALLER
			And around the first turn it's
			King's Image by a neck, Syphon is
			second by one, Key to the Vault
			third by one half, followed by Mr.
			Moonlight, Red Ridge, Moneyman and
			No Charge.

	Unexpectedly, Kid Twist bursts in through the entrance.
	Barely able to control his enthusiasm, he hurries over to
	Lonnegan's table and sits down next to him.

					TWIST
			Sorry, but I just couldn't wait.
			Did everything go all right?
	


					LONNEGAN
				(motioning for him to
				keep his voice down)
			Take it easy.  Everything's all
			right.  I put it on Syphon, on the
			nose.

					TWIST
				(in utter horror)
			On the nose!  I said place.  Place
			it on Syphon.  That horse is going
			to run second.

	Lonnegan looks like he's just been stabbed.  He vaults over
	the table to the teller's window and grabs Niles.

					LONNEGAN
			You give me my goddamn money back!
			You hear me?  There's been a mistake!

					NILES
			I'm sorry, sir.  The betting's
			closed.

	Lonnegan begins to shake him violently.

					LONNEGAN
			You give me my money back.  There's
			been a mistake, do you hear me?

	Gondorff leaps to Niles' aid when suddenly there is a crash
	at the entrance door, and Polk, Snyder and eight federal
	agents burst into the room, guns drawn.  The place falls
	silent except for the loudspeaker, the members of the boost
	afraid to move.  Gondorff and Niles look at each other
	wondering how this could have possibly happened.

					POLK
				(motioning to Hooker)
			All right, Hooker, you can go.

	Hooker's eyes go to Gondorff, who looks back at him in utter
	disbelief, the betrayal raging in his features.  Hooker,
	unable to meet his gaze, lowers his head and starts to walk
	out.  Almost unnoticed, there's a flash of movement at
	Gondorff's belt.  A small gun.  A shot.  Hooker clutches his
	back and falls dead on the floor, the blood spurting from
	his mouth.  Polk, reacting instantly, pours four shots into
	Gondorff, who goes down in a heap.  Pandemonium breaks loose.
	The members of the boost race for the door.  Lonnegan is
	totally stunned.  First he lost his money and now he's
	involved in a murder.  Snyder rushes over to him.

					SNYDER
			C'mon.  We gotta get you outa here.

	EXT. STREET

	Snyder drags him through the crowd and out onto the street
	where an F.B.I. car is waiting.  His bodyguards have long
	since fled at the sight of the F.B.I. men.

					LONNEGAN
			My money's back there.

					SNYDER
			We'll worry about that later.

	Snyder gets in beside Lonnegan, and the car speeds away.

								CUT TO:

	INSIDE THE STORE AGAIN

	The pandemonium has now ceased.  Those who could escape
	have; the rest are lined up against the wall in frisking
	position.  Gondorff and Hooker lie on the floor dead.  The
	loudspeaker drones on.  Singleton is still calling the race
	from his booth, apparently oblivious to what's happened.

					CALLER
			And the winner is King's Image by
			four lengths, Syphon is second, by
			two, Moneyman third by two and one
			half.  Time for 1 and 1/16 miles,
			1:21 and 2/10 seconds.

	Polk walks slowly over to Hooker's body and bends down.

					POLK
			He's gone.

	Hooker opens his eyes and slowly drags himself up off the
	floor, spitting out a little rubber bladder, filled with
	blood, that he's had in his mouth.  Gondorff does likewise.
	Niles, Twist, Singleton and the rest of the boost begin to
	laugh and shake hands, as do the Federal Agents.

					GONDORFF
				(to Polk)
			Nice con, Hickey.  I thought you
			were Feds myself, when you first
			came in.

					HICKEY
			No problem, Henry.  Snyder went for
			it all the way.
				(laughing)
			You shoulda seen the rag he lit
			under Lonnegan.

	Gondorff turns to the others.

					GONDORFF
			Okay, let's take this place apart
			and get outa here.  You can get
			your splits from Eddie at Boudreau's
			tonight.

	Gondorff walks over to Hooker, who's wiping the blood off
	his face and hands.

					GONDORFF
			You beat him, kid.

					HOOKER
				(softly)
			You were right, Henry.  It's not
			enough... But it's close.

					GONDORFF
			You wanta wait for your share?

					HOOKER
			Naw, I'd just blow it.

	Gondorff nods, and walks slowly to behind the bar.  He comes
	out with his suitcase in one hand and Hooker's paper bag in
	another.  He throws the paper bag to Hooker, who stops by
	the door.  Eirie Kid is standing there.  Hooker gives the
	"office" to Eirie, who beams and gives it back.

	EXT. ALLEY AND STREET

	Then Hooker and Gondorff leave.  We hold on them, two
	ragtail grifters again as they walk off down the street and
	disappear around the corner.

								FADE OUT.

    from a story by James Cameron

    AUGUST 11, 1993

    --------------------------------------------------------------

    1:06 AM DEC 30, 1999

    Blackness.  We hear:

                             VOICE
              Ready?

                             SECOND VOICE (LENNY)
              Yeah.  Boot it.

    A burst of bright white static exploding across the
    darkness.  A high whine on the audio track gives way to
    street sounds and rapid breathing.

    AN IMAGE wavers and stabilizes: A nervous POV.  We're in a
    car, sitting in the backseat, and we're nervous, the view
    swinging around, showing the street rolling by outside the
    windows, then whipping back to the two guys in the front
    seat.

    Our POV looks down at a SMALL RECORDING DEVICE in "our"
    hands.  A red LED is flashing.  We slip the recorder into
    a coat pocket.

                             OUR VOICE
              Okay.  It's goin'.  I'm recording.

    The guy riding shotgun, LANE, is just pulling a pantyhose
    over his head, smearing his features into a pig-like mask.
    He turns, DIRECTLY TO THE LENS, pissed off.

                             LANE
              Good one, dickhead.  Thanks for
              waitin' till I get this fuckin thing
              on.  You tryin' ta I.D. me, or
              what?

    He tosses another pantyhose right at us and we catch it.
    Our POV looks down, into the pantyhose, which comes up
    over our field of view.

    We realize: this is not some ride-along verite video.

    WE ARE ONE OF THESE GUYS.  Real honest-to-God point of
    view, with no cuts, no music.  This is not film, it is
    human experience.

    The driver is a Hispanic guy named "SPAZ" DIAZ.  Lane is a
    white guy who looks very strung out.  Couple of
    crackheads.  The car is a mid-seventies barge, piebald
    with primer.

                             LANE
              Next alley... just pull in slow.
                      (turning to us)
              Hurry up will ya.  Here.

    He hands us a big stainless steel revolver.  The POV looks
    down as our shaky hands snap open the cylinder, check the
    rounds, snap it closed.

    Diaz pulls the barge into an alley.  The headlights
    illuminate overflowing dumpsters.  A Chicano busboy is
    making trash runs out the back door of a restaurant, which
    he has chocked open.  The busboy goes back inside.

                             LANE
              Let's go.

    Out of the car, quickly, our own breathing loud in our
    ears.  We even hear our own heartbeat, racing now.
    Through the door, after Lane, moving fast.

    Into the kitchen.  Fluorescent glare.  The busboy turning,
    surprised, Lane putting the shotgun in his face.  Freezing
    him.  Lane puts a finger to his lips: "quiet" in any
    language.

    Our hand puts the magnum in the THAI COOK's face.  We get
    them down on the greasy floor, Lane controlling them with
    the shotgun.  He looks at us, snaps his eyes toward the
    front room.

    We hear voices as we approach the swing door.  Go through.

    Whip pan left, then right.  Scoping the layout.  Low-rent
    THAI place.  Red wallpaper.  Closing time.  Middle-aged
    Thai OWNER, by the cash-register, counting money.  Young
    Thai WAITRESS, cleaning up.  They look up, stunned, as we
    put the gun on them.

                             OUR VOICE
                      (shouting, edgy)
              Don't move, don't talk, don't do
              nothing.

    Our POV is whipping around, from the front door to the
    owner to the kitchen where Lane is standing in the doorway
    covering the cook and busboy, back to the owner as he
    steps back from the cash-register.

    We scoop up the big wad of bills: seven, eight hundred
    bucks in tens and fives.

    Now yelling, herding the owner and the waitress into the
    kitchen, the owner trying to calm the girl in singsongy
    Thai, Lane shouting at him to shut up.

    Into the walk-in cooler.  The steel door closes on four
    scared pair of eyes.  POV looking around, seeing... a
    dish-rack.  Our hand pulls out a spoon, drops the spoon
    handle through the hole in the cooler door-latch.  Locking
    them in.

    Lane heading out the back door.  Laughing, as he looks at
    the wad of cash our hand is waving in front of him.
    We follow Lane to the car.  Snap a look down the alley one
    way, then the other.

    Shit!  Cop Black-and-White pulling into the far end of the
    alley.  Heartbeat goes triple time.  Scrambling into the
    car.

    Door not even closed and SPAZ has it in reverse, burning
    rubber as he launches back down the alley.
    SCRUNCH!  The car grinds along one wall as SPAZ steers
    wildly backward.  Sparks right next to us.  Then--
    KBOOM!  As we slam into a dumpster and push it right out
    into the street.

    The cop has his lights and siren on, and is roaring at us
    as SPAZ cranks the wheel and punches it down the street.
    He curses in English and Spanish as he weaves between
    cars.  We pull off the stocking to see better.

    The cop car surges onto the street behind us.

    Looking ahead.  A red light.  Cars stopped, blocking the
    way.  Cutting to the right, onto the sidewalk, around the
    cars, into the intersection.

    A near miss with cross traffic, then accelerating.
    Another red light ahead.

                             LANE
              Don't stop!

    Truck entering the intersection.  Everyone yelling.  SPAZ
    cuts the wheel but too late...

    Clipping the truck and spinning.
    The street outside smearing past like the view from a
    Tilt-a-whirl.

    Then KBLAM!  Hitting something, God-knows-what, and
    launching up and over, and--

    KRUNCH!  Crushing metal and an explosion of broken glass.

    It gets quiet and still.  Tinkling glass as Lane moves.
    Then SPAZ is screaming.  The car is upside down.

    Crawling out of the side window.  A frenzy now.
    Whip pan to see the cops pulling up.

    Then whipping back to the wreck.  The engine is burning.
    Flames spreading rapidly.  SPAZ inside, pinned, upside
    down, blood pumping across his face.

    Our hands pulling Lane out.  He comes up running.

    We run after him, sprinting toward the welcoming darkness
    of an alley.

    Panting breath and heartbeats and sirens and somebody
    yelling.
    Gunshots.  Looking back.  Cops next to their car, firing.
    Ahead, Lane running into shadow.

    Then a door opening, a man coming out of a metal firedoor.
    Lane grabbing him, throwing him out of the way, holding
    the door open as we dive through into--

    A stairwell.  Lane sprinting up, two steps at a time.
    Trying the door at the second floor landing.  Locked.
    Shit.

    Running up.  Dizzying whirl as we run, up and up.

    The POV is finally broken by a...

                                                 CUT TO:

    INT.  UNDERGROUND GARAGE

    But we don't know where we are yet.  We see a man in
    extreme close-up: just his eyes and mouth.  The eyes are
    closed, the eyeballs tracking under the lids, like he is
    watching a movie in there.  This is LENNY.

                             LENNY
              This is great... the doors are all
              locked.  Who are these losers,
              friends of yours?

                                                 CUT TO:

    BACK TO POV as we reach the fifth floor landing.  Lane is
    coming unglued as he finds this door locked.  We look
    down, see cops coming two floors below.  One cranks off a
    couple rounds at us and we snap back from the railing.
    Pounding up the last flight.  Finally!  The door is
    unlocked.

    Blasting through it, behind Lane, onto the roof.  Running
    all out past AC units and pipes, air vents.  Looking up:
    an LAPD helicopter orbiting close.  It flicks the xenon
    onto us and we are running in a vibrating circle of blue
    daylight.

    Running along the edge of the roof.  Looking down.  Car
    burning upside down in the street below.  The gas tank
    explodes, filling the street with orange light.  We don't
    slow.  We're running all out.

                             LENNY (V.O.)
              Wow... the gas tank is a nice touch.
              Oh, oh, end of the line boys.

    Ahead, in POV we see the edge of the roof coming up.
    Beyond it is another building, about ten feet lower and
    separated by a 20 foot alley.

    But Lane doesn't slow down.  He leaps across the void and
    makes it to the other building, landing in a sprawl.
    We reach the edge and look down.  Six stories.  No ladders
    or fire-escapes.  Whip to behind us.  Cops running across
    the roof.

                             LANE
              Come on!  Fucking jump man!

    The POV backs up from the edge and then runs toward it...
    Out into the void.  Moving... airborne... then...
    WHAM!  Right into the parapet wall.

    Slipping down.  Brick wall right in our face.  Bloody
    fingers grabbing for a rusty piece of pipe running along
    the edge.

    Looking down... feet dangling over a sixty foot drop.
    A cat walking through a patch of light in the alley below,
    oblivious.
    Breathing raspy.  Snapping a look up as the pipe gives
    way.
    A keening whine coming from us as we scramble to climb up
    but...
    Snapping a look down--
    Walls rushing past, sound of wind, and our own raspy
    scream--
    Ground rushing up--

    Split second impression of a cat, looking up, yowling and
    running out of the way as--
    Pavement fills frame.  A burst of violent red light.
    Sound like a gunshot... but no echo.

    Only silence.  And blackness.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE

    Lit by miles of fluorescent.  Empty and echoing.  Close on
    Lenny.  He has something on his head.  Something that
    looks like a mutated set of Walkman headphones, except
    they have little gecko fingers that fit along the temples
    and over the forehead.  PLAYBACK "TRODES".  Lenny whips
    off the trodes, gasping as if he got gutpunched.

                             LENNY
              Goddamnit!  You know I don't deal in
              snuff.  How many times I hafta tell
              you?!

    Lenny is with a guy everybody knows as "TICK", a pale-
    skinned creature of the night in T-shirt and leather
    jacket.  Tick is a bottomfeeder in the techno-underground
    of the near future.

                             TICK
              Don't have a fucking coronary, Lenny.

                             LENNY
              Well you could've at least warned
              me.  You know I hate the zap... when
              they die.  It just brings down your
              whole day.  Jeez, Tick.

                             TICK
              Sorry.

    LENNY NERO is low thirties.  Handsome.  Charming.  And you
    better check to see if you still have your ring after you
    shake with him.  He is wearing an expensive Italian
    jacket, and what he thinks of as a "power tie." His Rolex
    isn't real.  His greasy hair is too long and curls around
    his collar.  He needs to shave.  A little sleazy.  But he
    has energy, and heavy street smarts.

    Lenny is sitting on the hood of his '97 BMW 1035i.  Tick
    is facing him, sitting in the back of his beat-to-shit
    70's van.  There are a lot of tapes and tech stuff piled
    inside the van.  Lenny has a Haliburton case open next to
    him, like a drug dealer.  In fact the whole setup looks
    like a drug deal, but it's not.  Though it is illegal.
    The case holds Lenny's personal playback deck, his trodes,
    and a rack of the little tapes in which he deals.  They
    are about the size of DAT tapes, and hold about 30 minutes
    of sensory experience... everything a person sees, hears,
    and feels... recorded directly from the cerebral cortex at
    the moment it is happening.

                             LENNY
              How'd you get the tape?  Why didn't
              the cops put it in evidence?

                             TICK
              With all the blood I guess they
              didn't see the rig.  Guy had it
              under a wig.

                             LENNY
              Yeah, but how'd it get to you?

                             TICK
              I got ways, Lenny, I got ways.
                      (off Lenny's impatient
                       look)
              Okay, okay... I got a deal with some
              a the paramedics.  My guy pages me
              and I pick it up at the morgue.  So
              whaddya think?  This clip's gotta be
              worth at least a grand.  Right?

                             LENNY
              Tick.  Not to dash your hopes, but I
              don't deal this kind of product, you
              know that.  I'll give you four for
              it, cause I've gotta cut off the
              last bit.  And my customers want
              uncut.

                             TICK
              Fuck that!  The last part's the
              best.  You dry-dive six stories and
              blammo!  Jack right into the Big
              Black.

                             LENNY
              I don't deal black-jack clips!  It's
              policy.  I got ethics here.

                             TICK
              Yeah, when did that start?  Come on,
              man!  It's what people want to see,
              and you know it.

                             LENNY
              So lay it off to somebody else.

                             TICK
              Come on, Lenny.  I got expenses.  I
              got to get this rig fixed.  Look at
              it...

    Tick holds up a zip-lock bag containing the Walkman-sized
    stainless steel CORTICAL RESONANCE RECORDER, the record
    deck we saw earlier in the POV.  Also in the bag is the
    SQUID NET, a matrix of sensors designed to conform to the
    human head (this is different from playback trodes).  The
    whole works are covered with congealed blood.

                             TICK
              Give me six at least.  This's a good
              clip, here.  Gets you pumpin'.

                             LENNY
              Yeah, well, the first part's okay.
              Better than the usual soaps you
              bring me.

                             TICK
              Now that is cold, Lenny.  I always
              bring you choice.

    Lenny fishes around in a cardboard box at Tick's feet,
    pulling out a tape.

                             LENNY
              Sure, like this low-grade shit here,
              some girl in a fight with her
              boyfriend... it's a test-pattern.
              Nothing happens.  I'm snorin'.

                             TICK
              Hey, you're always saying, 'Bring me
              real life.  Bring me street life.
              And, like, one man's mundane and
              desperate existence is another man's
              Technicolor.'

                             LENNY
              I said that?  Look, I'll take it for
              five, and you'll make out okay,
              because in this case it's pure
              cream, you don't have to cut
              anything back to the wearer.

                             TICK
              Ha!  That's for fucking sure.

                             LENNY
              What else you got?

                                                CUT TO:

    MONTAGE/SERIES OF SHOTS

    Lenny in his BMW, driving through the LA streets.
    Streetlights and neon flare across the windshield in a
    calligraphy of light.  Lenny works the cellular, gets
    messages on his DIGITAL PAGER, weaves in and out of
    traffic -- punches the buttons on his radio, changing
    stations all the time.  Raw, nervous energy: like a kid
    who can't stay still.  It's a hard hustle in the big food
    chain.

                             LENNY
              Look, Jerr.  I'm nothing if not a
              man of my word.  I'll drop the money
              by tomorrow, next day latest.  It's
              a little crazed right now.  Yeah, on
              my mother's eyes, I swear.  Thanks,
              buddy.
                      (hangs up)
              Prick.
                      (to the car ahead
                       honking)
              What kinda move you call that?!
              Lemmings.

    Lenny turns up the radio.  SELECTED DRIVE-BY IMAGES, as
    the talk-radio provides commentary.

    Lenny's car passing under glowing Santa Clauses on the
    light-poles.  Banners proclaiming the coming "Millennium
    LA" festivities.

                             TALK-RADIO HOST
              ... it's a little after 2 am on
              December 30th, 1999... the second to
              last day of the whole darn century,
              and the phone lines are open.  Dan
              from Silverlake, you're on the air.

    Transition to a rougher section of town.  Buildings roll
    by endlessly, tagged by gangs in graphic tribal patterns.
    some are burnt-out ruins.

                             DAN FROM SILVERLAKE
              Uh, hi.

                             HOST
              So Dan, are you looking forward to
              the New Year?

    A building is burning out of control.  In the foreground,
    silhouetted, a drunk sleeps soundly on a bus-bench.

                             DAN
              Not really.  I mean what's the
              point?  Nothing changes New Years
              day.  The economy sucks, gas is over
              three bucks a gallon, fifth grade
              kids are shooting each other at
              recess... the whole thing sucks,
              right?  So what the hell are we
              celebrating?

    A shanty-camp of homeless people under a freeway overpass.
    Homes made of cardboard and carpet remnants.  Their lives
    in shopping carts.

                             HOST
              You're a glass-is-half-empty kind of
              guy, aren't you Dan?  Well I for one
              happen to think that us making it
              2000 years is worth celebrating--

    Lenny cuts him off, punching to another station, and MUSIC
    blasts.  Something fast... a rap-metal hybrid.  Anger and
    energy.

    WE CUT IN fast blitzes of images like a burst of automatic
    weapons fire: helicopters on patrol, people running in the
    streets, buildings smoldering, fists raised, shouting
    people, paramedics rushing a body into an ambulance,
    Korean store owners armed to the teeth, a body covered by
    a yellow plastic sheet, blood running down the gutter.
    Cops in riot gear, with M-16s, on patrol in a Hispanic
    neighborhood.

    BACK TO LENNY coming out of a bar with a nervous
    businessman.  We don't hear the conversation.  MUSIC OVER.
    Lenny palms a roll of bills from the guy as he slips a
    squid tape into the pocket of the businessman's suit
    jacket.  Lenny claps him on the shoulder and walks away.
    Lenny's beeper goes off and he pauses to look at the
    number.

    ON LENNY DRIVING.

    Ahead, through the windshield we see a police checkpoint.
    The cops have thrown a block across the street and are
    shinning their lights in the cars as they creep through.
    Lenny slaps his ID against the side window with one hand,
    not missing a beat in his conversation.  This is just part
    of life in LA.

                             LENNY
                      (on cellular)
              Jimbo.  I'm there, Jimmy.  Right now,
              can't you hear me knockin'?

    CUT TO LENNY working his way through a crowded club, music
    pounding.  Strobe lights.  We don't see much.  He hears
    his phone rings and pulls the tiny DIGITAL CELLULAR out of
    his breast pocket.  Sticks a finger in his other ear and
    answers.

    CUT TO LENNY, back in the BMW, on the streets.  On the
    move.

                             LENNY
              -- so you line up the talent, shoot
              the clip, get it to me by Monday.
              OK?  Client wants a guy and two
              girls, the guy wears... yeah, I
              know, thinks he's being original.
              Girls have to be young.  So don't
              use your mother like you usually do.
              Yeah, you too, pendejo.  And no big
              tits... French tits.  That's it...
              like Champagne glasses... you got
              it.  What a pro.  Page me.

    LENNY PULLS UP to the security checkpoint of a gated
    community.  The white upper-middle class hiding behind
    walls and paid security.

                             LORI
              If you read the Bible, Mark, you'd
              know that there won't be another
              thousand years.  Right now we are in
              the Last Days, as foretold in the
              book of--

                             HOST
              The Last Days?  You mean the coming
              of the Apocalypse, right?  The
              Rapture?

    Lenny fishes around in the glove compartment, flipping
    through about twenty plastic security passes for different
    parts of town, all bogus.  He finds the right one and
    flips it onto the dash.

                             LORI
              Yes, that's right.  You only have to
              look at the signs... there are wars
              and rumors of wars--

    The RENT A COP at the guardshack hits him with his light.

                             LENNY
                      (lying)
              I live here.

    The cop waves him through.  Lenny is the right color.

                             HOST
              Now just so the rest of us know how
              much time is left, when is the
              Rapture supposed to hit, exactly?
              Is it midnight New Year's Eve?

    And WE CUT to a burst of news videotape, enlarged, noisy,
    distorted... images of a great gathering in the desert,
    the faithful waiting for God's sign as the millennium
    approaches.

                             HOST
              Is that midnight LA time, or Eastern
              Standard or what?  I mean, what time
              zone is God in, anyway?

                             LORI
              I pray for you all.

    Lenny's BMW cruises past an overturned burning car.  There
    is no-one around.  He barely glances at it.  Common sight
    these days.  If it is the end of the world, Lenny's not
    going to let it break his rhythm.

                             LENNY
                      (cellular)
              I just got something in, Bobby, you
              might appreciate.  A 211 at a Thai
              joint goes south, and these three
              scuzzballs end up in a gun-and-run.
              It's a beauty, two thumbs up.
              Parental discretion advised.  I'm
              talking it's the master, not some
              stepped-on copy.  One of a kind.

    LENNY INSIDE A GLOOMY BAR.  He slides into a booth with
    NORM SKINNER, a paunchy guy with thinning hair who dresses
    too young.  A pretty, stoned-looking girl is leaning
    against Skinner.

                             LENNY
              Yo, Skinner.  The Skin Man.
                      (fingering his
                       jacket)
              Red leather.  Nice feminine touch.

                             SKINNER
                      (laughing)
              Fuck you, Nero.

                             LENNY
              Whattya got for me?

    CUT TO: POV of a woman writhing above us in ecstasy.
    Lovemaking in point-of-view.  We look down, see OUR BODY,
    a woman's body... our hands moving over the other woman's
    torso.  The image is dark, a primal impression.  Sound of
    harsh breathing, rustling sheets.

    BACK TO LENNY in the booth with Skinner.  Lenny has
    Skinner's tape running in a playback deck clipped to his
    belt, next to his pager.  He is hunched over the table,
    "sampling" the merchandise by touching a few of the trode
    pads to his temple without putting on the whole headset.
    Like a coke dealer taking a little on the fingernail.

                             LENNY
              Yeah, I can use this...
                      (to the stoned girl)
              ... but honey you gotta move your
              eyes slower next time.  It's too
              jerky.

                             SKINNER
              It was her first time, Lenny.  Cut
              her some slack.

    TIGHT SLOWMO SHOTS... ABSTRACT: SQUID tapes and money
    changing hands.  A SQUID tape sliding sensuously into a
    deck.

    TIGHT CU LENNY, through the windshield of his car.  Neon
    moving over him.

    NEWS FOOTAGE: LAPD Aerospatiales circling, their xenon
    lights turning night into day, giving the impression of a
    futuristic war zone.

    INSIDE THE COCKPIT, the infrared camera shows green-screen
    images of people in cars, in their homes... like footage
    of hyenas shot at night in total darkness.

    The impression is of a society under siege, an occupied
    nation... a watched society where the camera eye and the
    police spotlight define our reality.

                             HOST
              Go ahead, caller, you're on the air.

                             VOICE
              My name's DeWayne, and I got a New
              Year's resolution for the po-lice.
              Hey, yo Five Oh, you better get down
              with 2-K.

    CRASH Unit cops with a bunch of Salvadoran gang kids
    racked up against a storefront.  A dozen 16 year-old girls
    and guys, hands against the wall, acting bored, as the
    cops walk up and down, reading IDs.

                             HOST
              2-K?  What's that DeWayne?

    A group of cops have two black guys proned out.  Nearby a
    crowd jeers, shouting insults.  A black kid throws a beer
    bottle and one of the cops chases him into the crowd.

                             DEWAYNE
              2-K.  The big two thousand.  Comin
              tomorrow night.  Out with the old
              and in wit da new.  See for the Man,
              no new is good new, what I'm sayin.
              He like to keep it the way it is.
              But we going to take it, make it
              new, make it our own.  History gonna
              start right here, right now--

    LENNY cuts him off as his cellular call connects.

                             LENNY
              Hi, Dave, this is Lenny.
                      (pause)
              Nero.  Lenny Nero.  That's right.
              Oh, is it late?  Sorry.  It's just
              that I have something that might be
              of interest, and since I always call
              you first--
                      (pause)
              Uh, huh.  Well, what would be a good
              time?  Okay, sure.  Catch you then.

                                                CUT TO:

    A GAME ARCADE.  Light and noise as the customers drop
    quarters for synthetic thrills.  Lenny is talking to a
    nice-looking street kid in his early 20's named EDUARDO.

                             EDUARDO
              Let me get this straight... you
              gonna pay me 200 bucks to put on a
              hair net and bang some beautiful
              babe.  I don't know, I gotta think
              about this.

    Lenny smiles and pulls out a SQUID-net.  He motions
    Eduardo into the shadows.

                             LENNY
              Okay, let's get you wired up.  I
              hope this axle grease you got in
              your hair doesn't screw up the squid
              receptors.

                             EDUARDO
              What's all this squid shit?

    As Lenny works, fitting the network of sensors over
    Eduardo's head, he holds class.

                             LENNY
              Superconducting QUantum Interference
              Device.  SQUID.  Got it?  There's
              gonna be a test.

                             EDUARDO
              Hey, fuck you, man.

                             LENNY
              Easy, Eduardo, easy.  Preserve a
              sense of humor at all times.  Okay,
              the receptor rig... what I'm putting
              on your head... sends a signal to
              the recorder.
                      (Lenny holds up the
                       recorder)
              See we call it "being wired," but
              there's no wire.  You gotta keep the
              recorder close... five, six feet
              away max, like in your jacket pocket
              by the bed or wherever you're going
              to close escrow, know what I mean?

                             EDUARDO
              Yeah, right.

    Lenny fits a wig from his briefcase over Eduardo's head,
    turning him into a headbanger.  Eduardo scowls at this
    set-back to his suavete.

                             LENNY
              Some tips.  Don't dart your eyes
              around.  Don't look in the mirror or
              you'll ID yourself.  OK?  You got a
              half hour of tape, so give me some
              lead-in to the main event.  But
              don't wait too long, I don't want to
              be going out for popcorn.  And don't
              act natural.  Don't act at all.
              Just forget the thing is on.  Got
              it?

                             EDUARDO
              No problem.

                             LENNY
              A star is born.

    EXT.  TRAIN YARD - NIGHT

    A woman's feet moving along the steel rail of a train
    track at night.  The woman has no shoes, her feet bare.

    IRIS stumbles along the track, clutching one shoe
    pointlessly to her chest.  She is swearing and crying,
    runny mascara leaving two tragic streaks down her pale
    face.  Despite this we see that she is attractive, though
    her dress and make-up seem designed to convey overt
    sexiness.  Her white skin is complemented by a wild mane
    of curly red hair.

    She is in her early twenties, and the harshness of her
    life has just begun to harden her features.  She looks
    lost and without hope, in fear of her life.  Her breath
    comes in hitching sobs, and her eyes are wild.

    She runs between cold steel walls of freight cars, looking
    behind her frequently.  A police helicopter is circling.
    Its xenon beam plays over the train yard, sweeping over
    the cars.  She hunches into the shadows of a freight-car
    as the beam passes over.  Looking under the cars she sees
    an LAPD patrol car cruising down a street adjoining the
    yard, its searchlight sweeping toward her.  It moves on.

    She continues her run, moving away from the direction of
    the patrol car.  She reaches a chain-link fence.  Crying,
    she scrambles over it, cutting her hands and ripping her
    dress.  Another patrol car passes two blocks away.  She
    crouches in the tall grass until it rounds a corner out of
    sight.

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  ALLEY AND STREET - NIGHT

    Iris sprints down an alley between buildings.  Rats
    scatter into the shadows ahead of her.  She doesn't seem
    to notice.  All she cares about are the police lights, and
    the sound of the helicopter droning, circling.

    She pauses at the mouth of the alley, scanning the well-
    lit street beyond.  There are people here: downtown low-
    life street people.  A half-block away is a brightly lit
    sign marking the entrance to a Red-Line subway station.

    She walks along the sidewalk, her eyes on the sign,
    feeling exposed as she walks openly, her heart pounding.
    She is a mess, but in this section of town people barely
    glance at her.

    LOW ANGLE on her bare feet, standing out amid the shoes
    and boots of winter.

    SHE CROSSES the street, and reaches the sidewalk just as a
    black-and-white rounds the corner at the end of the block,
    behind her.

    IN THE CRUISER are TWO COPS, who are scanning the street.
    They look intense.  Revved up.  They are BURDEN SPREG, a
    massive, barrel-chested street-lifer in his mid-forties,
    and DWAYNE ENGELMAN, an aggressive hard-on in his twenties
    with a brush cut, a Nautilus body, and a face like a
    ferret.

                             ENGELMAN
              She's a hooker, vice'll have her in
              the book.  We can pick her up later.

                             SPREG
              No.  Now.

    IRIS knows the cops are behind her.  She is terrified to
    turn.  Finally she can't stand it any more.  She breaks
    into a run.  The patrol car speeds up suddenly, roaring
    after her.

    Iris sprints along in her bare feet, all-out like a track
    runner.  The black-and-white screeches to the curb next to
    her and the cops jump out.

    Iris hits the stairs down to the subway station at a full-
    tilt boogie, knocking down some poor old guy whose
    groceries go flying.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  SUBWAY STATION AND TRAIN

    Iris trips on the landing, spins sprawling across the
    filthy tile floor, and comes up running.  Panting with
    fear and exertion she clears the turnstiles like a
    hurdler.

    The cops pound down the stairs two at a time.  Spreg draws
    his 9mm.  In his eyes we see an unaccountable craziness...
    a hunter who has as much at stake somehow as the prey.

    Street people fall back as Spreg thunders through them.
    They aren't about to get in the way of this juggernaut cop
    and his boy wonder.

    The two cops reach the platform.  No Iris in sight.

    MOVING WITH THEM as they slow to a walk, scanning.  A
    couple of low-lifes standing around, waiting for trains,
    eye them warily as Spreg gets a call on his Rover.

                             DISPATCHER (V.O.)
              Do you request back-up?

                             SPREG
              Negative.  Suspect is a black male,
              age 35 to 40.  We're handling it.

    A train pulls into the station with a whoosh of air.  A
    few people board.  There is only the sound of the cops'
    footsteps as they move along the empty platform.  With a
    pneumatic hiss the train's doors begin to close.

    Suddenly Iris breaks from behind a column up ahead at a
    full sprint.  Spreg unleashes his size 13 cop shoes,
    thundering along the platform to intercept her.  Engelman
    straight-arms his pistol.

                             ENGELMAN
              FREEZE!

    Iris clears the doors just as they hiss shut.  Her
    momentum carries her clear across the car, where she slams
    into the far wall and staggers back, almost falling.  She
    gasps for breath and looks up to see...

    ... Spreg crashing against the outside of the doors she
    just came through as the train starts to move.  He tries
    to force the doors apart... can't.  He aims his gun
    through the window.

    Thinking fast Iris dives to his side of the car and
    presses herself up against the solid wall next to the
    door, where he can't see her.

    OUTSIDE, Spreg is running next to the accelerating train.
    He swings his pistol, smashing the window with the butt.

    Iris screams as Spreg lunges through the opening next to
    her like some uniformed nightmare and grabs her.  He is
    still running alongside, pulling on her.  Trying to drag
    her right out through the window.

    She struggles.  Bites his beefy hand.  He swears and lets
    go.  Then makes one last grab.  Gets his fingers into her
    long mane of hair.  Yanks on her.  She comes half out the
    window, screaming.

    Then... RIP!  The hair pulls off her head.

    Spreg drops away, behind the speeding train, holding a
    red wig.  He looks at it stupidly, then raises his pistol
    and fires at Iris.

    She jerks back through the window and drops to the floor.
    A couple of shots hit the metal outside.  We see Iris has
    short hair, platinum white.  In it are a few of the many
    pins which held the wig securely in place.  She gasps for
    air, sobbing and hugging her knees, trembling all over.

    SPREG STANDS on the platform, watching the train
    disappear, as Engelman runs up.  Spreg looks at the wig in
    his hand, disgusted.  He turns it and looks inside, at the
    cap.

    CLOSE ON THE CAP inside the wig: there is an intricate
    network of sensors in a grid over the entire underside of
    the wig.  The sensors are connected by wires, in a pattern
    like the veins of a leaf, bundling to a small, flat metal
    box, the size of a cigarette case.  It is a SQUID NET.

    Iris was wired.  Spreg just stares at the SQUID NET, eyes
    going crazy wide.

                             ENGELMAN
              Oh shit.

    EXT./ INT.  LENNY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

    IT'S 4 AM.  Lenny trudges through a heavy security gate
    into the center court of his ratty building.  The pool
    furniture is in the pool.  Gang graffiti marks the walls.
    Bars on all the windows.  One of the doors looks like
    somebody opened it with an ax.  The pool lights give the
    place an eerie, dead glow.  Can out slick Lenny really
    live in this dump?

    Through a barred window we see Lenny approaching as we
    hear the OUTGOING MESSAGE on his answering machine in the
    F.G.

    BEEP.  And...

                             IRIS (V.O.)
              Lenny, goddamn it, you got to be
              there, you got to help me, come on,
              pick up, pick up...

    Through the window we see Lenny fishing in his pocket for
    his keys.

    Iris continues to grip the phone even after she has hung

    INT.  LENNY'S APARTMENT

    LENNY doesn't stop to play back Iris' message, or any of
    the twenty others on his machine.  He just deadbolts the
    door and locks a steel bar across the door frame, then
    carries his Haliburton...

    ... toward the bedroom.  And we see the truth of his
    reality.  Lenny's crib is a shit-box.  It is a small one-
    bedroom, barely furnished.  A couple of chairs.  Swap-meet
    couch.  Cardboard boxes full of tech gear stacked in the
    corners, unidentified electronics components piled on a
    table, cables strung everywhere.  God knows what this
    stuff is.  There is aluminum foil taped to all the
    windows.  Fast food cartons, empty Coke cans, pizza boxes
    everywhere.  The bachelor apartment from hell.  High-tech
    low-life.

    He goes into the bedroom.  Mattress on the floor.  Same
    infernal interior decoration, but this room is dominated
    by racks of tapes... Squid tapes.

    Lenny pours himself a vodka from a bedside bottle, takes
    off his clothes and hangs them over a chair.  He sits on
    the bed in his underwear, looking lonely and depressed.
    This is the private Lenny: No plans.  No dreams.  Nothing
    to look forward to but another day of the hustle.

    He puts a set of playback trodes carefully on his head,
    fishes around in a shoe box among a bunch of tapes,
    squinting at the hand-written labels: they all say
    "FAITH." Only the dates are different.

    He selects one and inserts it in the deck, makes some
    minute adjustments.  Sips his vodka.  Leans back.  Closes
    his eyes.  And hits PLAY.

    PLAY BACK SEQUENCE/ POV:

    We are moving along the Venice boardwalk, following a
    YOUNG WOMAN on Rollerblades.  By our motion, it is obvious
    that we are on Rollerblades too, and not doing so well.
    The woman is laughing, turning circles around us, cracking
    up at our discomfort.
    We hear Lenny's voice complaining a mile a minute, and we
    realize the POV is his.  The girl takes our hands, skating
    backward, towing us along the boardwalk.  It is a sunny
    afternoon, and it is the usual boardwalk freak show all
    around us.

    The woman is FAITH JUSTIN, a singer.  Lenny is desperately
    in love with her.  It's not hard to see why.  She is
    beautiful, in an alive, dynamic way.  Her hair is a wild
    dark mane, and her eyes are spectacular... intense.  She
    moves with a lithe, sinuous grace.  We are staring at her
    eyes instead of concentrating on skating.

    Whammo!  The POV spins and we are sitting, looking up at
    Faith as she circles, laughing.  She skates over to help
    us up.

    CUT TO LENNY, on his bed, smiling.  He punches Fast
    Forward.

    BACK TO POV.  A kinetic blur of digital hash, then...

    We are following Faith, now holding her skates, up the
    steps to a beach apartment.  Inside it is funky and
    comfortable.

    Music from a disk player she left on.  Bob Marley singing
    "Three Little Birds".  Faith, covered with a sheen of
    sweat, sways to the music as she goes into a bedroom.  We
    follow her.

    She comes out of the small bathroom with a towel, starts
    to dry off.  Sunlight comes in the window lighting up
    Faith like she is in a spotlight.  We move up behind her
    and take the towel away, and now we see Lenny standing
    behind Faith in the mirror over the dresser.

    He puts his arms around her and they sway together to the
    music.  He runs his fingers in lazy circles over her
    sweaty belly.  Then leans down and licks the sweat off her
    shoulder, all the while watching her in the mirror.  A
    voyeur recording his voyeurism through his own eyes, so he
    can replay and relive the moment.

    Their eyes meet in the mirror.

    They both watch as Lenny slides his hand up under her
    halter and caresses her nipples.  She moans softly,
    responding.  She turns to him, and our POV shifts directly
    to her.  She is right in front of us, in TIGHT CLOSE UP.
    The intimacy is power.

                             FAITH
                      (laughs)
              Hey, you going to watch or you going
              to do?

                             LENNY
              Watch and see.

    We lean toward her, until her eyes fill frame as they
    close in a kiss.  We (Lenny) keeps ours open.  Our hands
    pull her halter over her head.  Then she pulls up on
    Lenny's T-shirt, laughing.  We see it go over our eyes,
    blocking the view for a moment.

    Then Faith kisses Lenny's bare chest.  We are looking down
    at her, looking down across our body, Lenny's body, as
    Faith kisses lower, kneeling in front of us, unbuckling
    our belt and we--

    CUT TO LENNY in the here and now.  Lost in playback memory
    bliss.  He inhales sharply behind a wave of electronically
    recorded pleasure.

    BACK TO POV.  Lenny pulls Faith up to his face, kissing
    her, then pushing her gently to the bed, where we lie down
    together in a pool of sunlight slashing across the tangled
    sheets.  She looks up, right at us...

                             FAITH
              I love your eyes, Lenny.
                      (she touches our
                       eyelids)
              I love the way they see.

    CUT TO LENNY, lost in the swirl of sensation.  He touches
    his tongue to his fingertip.

    IN POV we look down at Faith as we enter her.  She gasps
    and closes her eyes, grabbing the headboard with both
    hands.  There is only the sound of gasping breaths, the
    creaking bed frame.  She rocks with the rhythm of our
    thrusts, borne away by the intensity until she cries out.

    CUT TO LENNY, reliving the past, under the electrodes.  He
    reacts to the past orgasm.  The tape ends, Lenny slowly
    takes off the trodes.  There is a tiny tear at the corner
    of his eye.

    INT.  LENNY'S APARTMENT/SERIES OF SHOTS

    2:14 PM, DECEMBER 30

    Lenny cracks an eye as the Sony 35" blinks on in alarm
    mode: news flashes of the day before New Year's Eve...
    police preparations for the epic Millennium L.A. shebang
    downtown, the National Guard doing riot prep, etc.

    Sunlight comes like lasers through holes in the aluminum
    foil over the windows.  Lenny goes to the kitchen in his
    underwear, searches for breakfast in the fridge, which is
    empty except for a red-white-and-blue 2-stick popsicle.
    Good morning.

    The TV screen shows a murder scene with cops milling
    around, yellow plastic over three crumpled forms on the
    ground.  It cuts to a file photo of a severe-featured
    black man.

                             ANCHORWOMAN
              ... bodies of two men found early
              this morning under the Hollywood
              freeway have been identified as rap
              star Jeriko One and bandmember James
              Polton, known to fans as "Replay".
              A third body, that of a woman, has
              not yet been identified.  With his
              band, the Prophets of Rage, Jeriko
              One's outspoken political stance
              and violent lyrics have stirred
              nationwide controversy...

    CUT TO: A little later.  Lenny sucks on the popsicle while
    he puts the night's wardrobe together.  This is a ceremony
    he observes carefully.  Suit laid out on the bed, shirt
    beneath the jacket.  Lenny matches a tie to the ensemble
    -- well, maybe -- tries another -- that's the one.

                                                CUT TO:

    Lenny, behind the wheel of the BMW.  He is revved up, his
    look dialed-in.  He's on the move.  Seizing the day.

                             LENNY
                      (on cellular)
              You know I can get you anything you
              want, anytime you want it, just not
              right now.  We'll hook up at the
              club later.  Around eleven.  Yeah.

    Lenny wheels into a parking lot, finds a space, grabs his
    Haliburton and steps out, heading for the front door of
    the Coral Lounge.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  CORAL LOUNGE

    The decor is sort of Polynesian.  Goofy tropical motif
    murals on the walls.  The place has a mixed bag of
    customers, including upwardly mobile low-lifes who have
    graduated from the streets and use it as a kind of office.
    It is a crossroads for druggies, upscale hookers, junior
    entertainment suits slumming after a day in the pressure
    cooker.

    Lenny cruises through like he owns the place, greeting a
    number of the early regulars.  We get the impression he
    knows everybody, all the time, everywhere he goes.  He
    leans on the bar.

                             BARTENDER
              Hey, Lenny.

                             LENNY
              Anything without an umbrella.

    He gets backslapped by a guy in a satin racing jacket:
    Fabrizio.

                             FABRIZIO
              Lenny my man, I think you want to
              meet a friend of mine.

    Lenny follows Fabrizio's look to a guy, dressed LA power-
    casual, sitting at a booth across the room.

                             LENNY
              Looks like money to me.

    Lenny grabs his drink off the bar and follows Fabrizio
    across the room.

                             FABRIZIO
              Don't forget your friends.

                             LENNY
              10 percent, Fabri, like always.

    They slide into the booth with KEITH.

                             FABRI
              Keith, this is Lenny.  Guy I was
              telling you about.  He can get you
              anything you--

                             LENNY
                      (cutting him off)
              Just a second.  Not to be rude,
              Keith, but I got to ask, are you a
              cop?

                             KEITH
              I understand.  No, I'm not.

                             LENNY
              You understand?  Attorney!  Right?
              Am I right?

                             KEITH
              That's right.

    Lenny sizes the guy up, looks around the edge of the
    table.

                             LENNY
              Tassel shoes.  Entertainment law,
              would be my guess.
                      (off the guy's scowl)
              Relax.  I just like to guess, is
              all.  It's my job to know people and
              what they want... what's behind
              their eyes.

                             FABRIZIO
              Lenny gives people their heart's
              desire.  Ain't that right, Lenny?

                             LENNY
              That's right.  My second question I
              gotta ask, so we get our bearings
              here... have you ever jacket in?
              Have you ever wiretripped?

                             KEITH
              No.

                             LENNY
                      (a winning grin)
              A virgin brain!  Well we're going to
              start you off right.  So what do you
              know about this?  Save us some
              time...

                             KEITH
                      (shrugs)
              Just what I've read.  That the
              technology was developed for the
              Feds, to replace the body wire.  And
              now it's gone black market.  So, uh,
              do I get the deck from you?

                             LENNY
              I'll set you up, get you a deck at
              my cost... since my thing is the
              software.

                             KEITH
              Clips.

                             LENNY
              That's right.  Clips.
                      (Lenny leans in,
                       working the guy)
              Look, I want you to know what we're
              talking about here.  This isn't like
              TV only better.  This is life.  It's
              a piece of somebody's life.  Pure
              and uncut, straight from the
              cerebral cortex.  You're there.
              You're doing it, seeing it, hearing
              it... feeling it.

                             KEITH
              What kind of things exactly?

                             LENNY
              Exactly anything.  Whatever you
              want.  Whoever you want to be.
                      (handing Fabrizio a
                       twenty)
              Fabri, get us another round, would
              you.

    Fabrizio gets the hint and heads for the bar.

                             LENNY
              You want to go skiing without
              leaving your den, you can.  But I'm
              assuming a guy like you, you wanna
              go skiing you fly to Aspen.  That's
              not what you're interested in here.
              It's about the stuff you can't
              have... right?  The forbidden
              fruit.

    Keith nods, mesmerized by Lenny.

                             LENNY
              Like running into a liquor store
              with a .357 magnum in your hand,
              feeling the adrenalin pumping
              through your veins.  Or...
                      (pointing discreetly)
              ... see that guy, with the drop-dead
              Philipino girl friend?
                      (Keith looks)
              Wouldn't you like to be that guy for
              twenty minutes?  The right twenty
              minutes.  I can make it happen.  And
              you won't even tarnish your wedding
              ring.

    Keith touches his ring self-consciously, then grins.

                             KEITH
                      (hooked like a carp)
              Sounds good.

                             LENNY
              I can get you what you want.  You
              just have to talk to me.  I'm your
              priest, your shrink, your main
              connection to the switchboard of
              souls.  I'm the Magic Man, the Santa
              Claus of the Subconscious.  You say
              it, you even think it, you can have
              it.  You want a girl, you want two
              girls?  I don't know what your thing
              is or what you're curious about...
              you want a guy?  You want to be a
              girl... see what that feels like?
              You want a nun to tie you up?  It's
              all doable.

                             KEITH
                      (flushed, sweating,
                       ready)
              Talk to me about costs, here.

                             LENNY
              Listen, before we get into numbers,
              I want you to try a taste.  I got a
              deck with me.

                             KEITH
              What?  Right Here?

                             LENNY
                      (grinning)
              Step into my office.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  CORAL LOUNGE/MEN'S ROOM

    Close on Keith's face, as he sits on the sink counter
    reacting to a Squid tape.  He jerks... his mouth drops
    open... he gasps.  His hands start to move over his body,
    feeling it wonderingly.  He gasps again, tilts his head
    down, moans... and Lenny hits Pause on the Playback.
    Keith opens his eyes to a grinning Lenny.

                             LENNY
              You were just an eighteen year old
              girl taking a shower.  Are you
              beginning to see the possibilities
              here?

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  PARKING LOT/CORAL LOUNGE

    A figure moves stealthily from the shadows and approached
    Lenny's car: Iris, hair dyed black now, wearing jeans and
    a coat but still showing scars from last night's pursuit.
    She tries the door of the car: locked.  She looks toward
    the Coral Lounge, debates whether to go look for Lenny.
    Better not.

    She takes a Squid tape from her pocket, and scribbles a
    note on the label: "HELP ME.  IRIS." She drops the tape
    through a 2-inch gap in Lenny's sun roof... and it bounces
    off the seat, onto the floor.

    She looks through the windshield, totally distraught,
    trying to see where the tape landed... and sees the
    reflection of cop cruiser lights coming down the street.
    She crouches next to the BMW, trying to blot herself out.
    And when the cruiser passes, she slumps to the ground,
    crying, afraid to move.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  CORAL LOUNGE

    A man in his late 30s: longish hair, no shave since the
    weekend, army jacket bulking over a massive frame.  A
    daunting figure as he approaches the bartender.

                             MAN (MAX)
              Where is he?

    Bobby, the bartender, cocks his eye toward the restrooms.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  CORRIDOR/CORAL LOUNGE

    Lenny unlocks the men's room door and walks down the dingy
    corridor with her new customer, Keith.

                             KEITH
              Yeah, I'm interested, but can we get
              someplace a little less public?

                             LENNY
                      (grinning)
              You nervous?  Forget it.  The cops
              have more to worry about in this
              city than the squid-trade, believe
              me--

    Behind them, the door of the women's bathroom whips open
    and the guy in the army jacket grabs Lenny from behind and
    SLAMS him face-first into the wall, jamming a .45 against
    his skull.

                             MAN (MAX)
              Don't move!  That's it, assume the
              position you miserable techno-perv
              puke.

    Cop style, the man in the army jacket kicks Lenny's feet
    apart.  Starts to cuff him.

                             MAN
                      (to Keith)
              Beat it fuckwad.

    Ash-white, Keith lays a smoke trail down the hall.  On the
    main floor of the club, Fabrizio sees him splitting and
    hurries after him.

    Back in the corridor, Lenny spins around and shoves his
    attacker against the opposite wall.  The guy offers no
    resistance.  In fact, he's too weak from laughing.

                             MAN (MAX)
              Gotcha.

                             LENNY
              Damnit, Max, I was with a client!
              You think that's funny?  To mess
              with a man's livelihood?  It's not
              funny!

                             MAX
              You see the look on that preppy
              puke's face?  Fuckin' pissed in his
              Topsiders.

                             LENNY
                      (laughing a little)
              Okay.  It was funny.  But it cost me
              money.

                             MAX
              Come on, amigo, the world's full of
              marks.  And nobody knows how to work
              'em like you do, pal.  You could
              sell a goddamn rat's asshole for a
              wedding ring!  Let me buy you a
              drink.

                             LENNY
              Least you can do.

    Max Peltier, which he mispronounces "Pelcher", slings his
    arm fraternally over Lenny's shoulder.  They cross to the
    bar.  Max roars greetings to several regulars, pushing
    between strangers like an out of control tractor.

                             REGULAR
              Yo, Pelcher!  Mad Max!

                             MAX
              Fuckin' A right I'm mad!  I might
              kill every man in here.  But first
              I'm buyin' my buddy here a drink.
                      (seeing another
                       regular)
              Hey O'Neal!  You were right, your
              wife does give good head.

    Max lurches onto a barstool and hunches there like a
    misanthropic bear, pounding the bartop.

                             MAX
              Bobbyyyy!  Tequila por favor!
              Double shots.  Make it Tres
              Generaciones, huh.  Nothin' but the
              best for my good friend Lenny, the
              finest cop that ever got thrown off
              the vice squad.  Hey, nice tie.

                             LENNY
              Thanks, Max.

                             MAX
              D'you always have to dress like a
              fuckin' pimp?

                             LENNY
              This tie cost more than your entire
              wardrobe.

                             MAX
              That's not sayin' much.

                             LENNY
              It's the one thing that stands
              between me and the jungle.

    Max raises his double shooter.

                             MAX
              To the jungle!  Where outa the blue
              some shitbird can cap you in the
              back of the head and ruin your whole
              day.

    He downs it in two fierce gulps.

                             LENNY
              You were lucky, Max.

                             MAX
              Yup.  So darn lucky.  I wake up with
              a .22-short floating in my brainpan,
              and a cop pension I can't live off
              of.  Good thing I wasn't any
              luckier.  Bobby!  Another shooter
              right here!

    Bobby pours for Max.

                             MAX
              You seen Faith lately?

    Lenny reacts visibly to the name, his whole demeanor
    sagging.

                             LENNY
              Naw.  She won't call me.

                             MAX
              Just as well, Lenny.  You gotta get
              past it.  I mean sure, Faith was by
              far the most outstanding woman a guy
              like you could ever hope to get, I
              mean it's completely and deeply
              humiliating that she's gone, but
              it's over, campadre.

                             LENNY
              Thanks, Max.  I'm touched by your
              concern.

    CUT TO: Iris, working her way from the front door, staying
    on the fringe of the crowd, wary, moving toward Max and
    Lenny at the bar.

                             MAX
              I just hate to see you pining away.
              It makes me want to vomit, frankly.
                      (philosophically)
              Broken hearts are for assholes.

                             LENNY
                      (seeing Iris)
              Hey, Iris, you okay?

                             IRIS
              Lenny, I got to talk to you, it's
              serious...

                             MAX
                      (looking at her face)
              What happened, honey, some john get
              rough on you?

                             IRIS
                      (to Lenny)
              I mean talk private.  Please, I'm in
              trouble, and so is Faith.

                             MAX
                      (as Lenny reacts to
                       the name)
              There it is, the magic fuckin' word.

    Lenny takes Iris by the arm and pulls her away from the
    bar.

                             IRIS
              Can we go to your car?  There's
              something you have to see right
              away.

    He nods and steers her toward the front door of the Coral
    Lounge.

                             LENNY
              What's going on?

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  CORAL LOUNGE/PARKING LOT - NIGHT

    Lenny and Iris come out the front door.

                             IRIS
              It's a bad situation... if they get
              me I know they're going to -- OH
              SHIT!

    She bridles like a startled horse.  Lenny looks at what
    she sees: a red beam, sweeping the parking lot.  Must be
    the cops.  He turns back...

    She's gone.  What the hell?

    He looks back at the red light... and edges around the
    corner to see what the cops are up to...

    It's not a cop car.  It's a tow-truck, with Lenny's BMW on
    the hook.  Lenny runs to the TOW DRIVER, who looks like a
    biker only meaner.

                             LENNY
              Hang on, that's my car--

                             TOW DRIVER
              Not anymore.  Belongs to the bank.

                             LENNY
              Hey wait a second...

    Ignoring him, the driver has started the hydraulic lift,
    and Lenny makes the mistake of grabbing his beefy arm.
    The guy whips around, putting the muzzle of a .38 in
    Lenny's face.

                             LENNY
              Oh, yeah, that's the answer!  Two
              million years of human evolution and
              that's the best idea you can come up
              with?
                      (driver continues
                       with the hoist)
              Okay.  Look, whattya get to repo a
              car?  Two hundred?  Two fifty?  I'll
              pay you three fifty, right now.  All
              you gotta do is drop it off the hook
              and say you came by, your mark
              wasn't here.  Simple.  Make a few
              bucks.  Do a good deed.  Huh?

                             DRIVER
              You got the cash on you?

                             LENNY
              I was going to write you a check, if
              that's--

    The guy is getting into his truck.

                             LENNY
              Okay, okay, I totally respect that
              call.  I would want cash.  They'll
              take my check inside... I can see
              you're pressed for time, just give
              me two minutes... here keep my watch
              for collateral.

    He hands the guy his watch.

                             LENNY
              It's a Rolex.  Be right back.  Two
              minutes.

    Lenny gets to the front door of the Coral Lounge, turns
    just in time to see the tow-truck pulling out.  Lenny runs
    after his car, yelling, watching it recede.

                             LENNY
              Son of a bitch!

    Lenny walks back to the bar.  He sets his Haliburton up on
    the truck of a car and pops it open.  He takes out a tiny
    digital cellular phone and dials a number.  While it's
    ringing he takes another, identical Rolex knock-off out of
    the briefcase and slips it on.

    LORNETTE "MACE" MASON.  Late twenties.  Striking features.
    Hair pulled back tight to her skull.  She is driving, but
    we don't see the car, or anything but her face.

                             MACE
              Hello?  Hey Lenny, whatup?
                      (listens a beat;
                       then)
              Uh huh.  Uh huh.  Sure.  So what
              happened to your car this time?

    EXT.  CORAL LOUNGE - NIGHT

    A black limo pulls into the lot.  It is a Continental
    armored stretch, downsized from today's standards.  The
    door opens and Mace gets out.  She is compactly built,
    dressed in black slacks, a conservative black jacket,
    heavy rubber-soled shoes.  She glances around as she heads
    for the Coral Lounge entrance, the unconscious sweeping
    gaze of a security professional.

    ON Max and Lenny at the bar.

              See, if you packed your piece you
              could've made the guy see sense.

                             LENNY
              Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the
              line of a fine jacket.

                             MAX
              An ex-cop that doesn't carry.  It's
              embarrassing.  I oughta not be seen
              with you.
                      (as she slips up
                       behind them)
              Hey, Mace.  What's goin' on?

    She plants herself between Max and Lenny and takes a
    generous handful of their nachos.

                             MACE
              Greetings, gents.
                      (to Lenny)
              So let's hear this week's sad story.

                             LENNY
              They jerked my wheels, d'you believe
              it?  I mean it's outrageous, the
              computer errors the banks are making
              lately.  Have you noticed?

    Mace and Max exchange a weary look.

                             MACE
              No.  I haven't noticed because I
              make my payments.  So, Max Pelcher,
              how's the P.I. business?

                             MAX
              Sucks.
                      (attention caught by
                       TV)
              Hey, Bobby, turn that up.

    The Bartender obeys: it's more news about the Jeriko One
    killing.  There's file footage of Jeriko and his band, the
    Prophets of Rage; interview with a lot of furious fans,
    mostly black inner city kids; and a news clip of Jeriko at
    an outdoor rally, exhorting the crowd with near religious
    fervor:

                             JERIKO ONE (ON T.V.)
              The LAPD is a military force turned
              against its own people.  We live in
              a police state!  The mayor and the
              city council sit up in their offices
              with their social programs that
              don't work... they're rearranging
              deck chairs on the Titanic.  But the
              new day is coming!  Two-K is coming!
              The day of reckoning is upon us.
              History ends and begins again right
              here!  Right now!

    Max raises a glass in salute to the TV screen.

                             MAX
              To the end of all things!
                      (slugs down the shot)
              You know how I know it's the end of
              the world?  Because everything's
              been done, every kind of music's
              been tried, every government's been
              tried, every fuckin' hairstyle.
              How you gonna make it another
              thousand years, for Chrissake?

    On the TV, clip of Jeriko's speech has been replaced by an
    interview with Jeriko One's manager.  TRAN VO.  Tran is
    Vietnamese, and around Lenny's age.  He's angular, suave,
    cool as an early frost.  Dialed in.  Lenny sees his face
    on the screen like a personal nightmare.

                             MAX
              I'm telling ya, it's over.  We used
              it all up--

                             LENNY
                      (riveted to the TV)
              Shutup a second!

                             MACE
              Hey, isn't that Tran Vo?

                             MAX
              Yup.  He was Jeriko's manager.
                      (to screen)
              Bummer, Tran!  Lost your golden
              goose.  Couldn't happen to a nicer
              guy.

                             MACE
              But I mean isn't he Faith's new--
                      (she mouths the word
                       "boyfriend")

                             MAX
              Sssssh!  Not in front of Lenny.  You
              may trigger a maudlin display which
              will force us to tranquilize him.

    ON THE SCREEN, Tran is being jostled as he walks,
    answering the reporters questions in a glare of minicam
    lights.

                             REPORTER
              The LAPD have said they believe
              this is a gang-related incident.
              Can you comment on that, Mr. Vo?

                             TRAN
              We have no facts yet.  All we know
              for sure is that we have lost a
              great artist, that a great voice for
              change is now silent...

    Lenny, scowling, pushes away from the bar.  Mace goes with
    him.

                             LENNY
              Thanks for giving me a ride.  I just
              have a few stops, mostly on the west
              side--

                             MACE
              Whoa, whoa, whoa.  I said I'd
              drop you home, but I'm not taking
              you on your sleazoid rounds.  I've
              already pulled twelve hours today.

                             LENNY
                      (upbeat again)
              Come on, Mace.  This is gonna be a
              big night.  Can't you feel it?  The
              energy in the air?  There's money to
              be made, dreams to sell.

                             MACE
              Sleaze to peddle.

                             LENNY
              Just a couple of hours.  It'll be
              fun--

                             MACE
              Excuse me.  What part of NO don't
              you understand?

                             LENNY
              Mace, you're my friend.  I need you.
              Plus I'll give you 25% of what I
              make tonight.

                             MACE
              Lenny, this may be a hard concept
              for you, but friends don't have to
              pay their friends.

    Lenny starts to whine like a puppy.  Mace gives up.

                             MACE
              Jeez, you're pathetic.  Okay, I got
              a pickup at the St. James.  I'll
              take you there, you can get a cab.

                             LENNY
                      (an arm around her
                       like a buddy)

    Haliburton.

              So, what's up with you?  Another

              Way I look at it, I actually perform
              a humanitarian service.  I save

                             MACE
              Uh huh, I wanna hear this part.

                             LENNY
              Okay, take some executive... bored
              with his life, bored with his
              wife... he picks up a hooker or some
              girl at a bar.  Then he goes around
              for months, torn up worrying that
              he's got AIDS, that he'll infect his
              wife.  And maybe he really does
              catch something--

              Price he pays for being a

              Everybody needs to take a walk to
              the dark end of the street sometime,
              it's what we are.  But now the risks
              are outa line.  The streets are a
              war zone.  And sex can kill you.  So
              you slip on the trodes, you get what
              you need and it keeps you from
              jumping your tracks.

              Mr. Fumitsu, good evening sir,
              Leonard Nero, Security Express.

              up front and take some notes, if you
              don't mind.

    Fumitsu nods politely and Lenny opens the car door for
    him.  Lenny jogs around behind the car to the front
    passenger door.

                             MACE

    They are laughing uproariously and getting along like old

    working his prime turf.  She stares at him for a while,
    then looks at her watch.  Sighs.

    ... as a tall, stern figure suddenly slides into Lenny's
    path, a top cop named PALMER STRICKLAND.

                             STRICKLAND
              Nero.

                             LENNY
                      (uh-oh)
              Strickland.

                             STRICKLAND
              Commissioner Strickland.

                             LENNY
              Sure.  Whatever.  See, since you
              shitcanned my career, I don't even
              have to call you sir.  One of life's
              small pleasures.

                             STRICKLAND
              Aren't you peddling your wares a
              little far from your usual gutter?

                             LENNY
              I was invited here by a close
              friend, Mr. Fumitsu, see he's right
              over there.

    Lenny waves.  Fumitsu waves back from across the room.

                             STRICKLAND
              I don't like disappointments, Nero.
              And do you know what disappoints me
              very much?

                             LENNY
              Your sex life?

                             STRICKLAND
              Your existence.

    EXT.  HANCOCK PARK HOUSE - NIGHT

    Mace sits in her limo, talking on the cellular.

                             MACE
              Now listen to me... you have to get
              to bed young man.  I mean it.  No
              watching "Tales from the Crypt".  I
              don't care what Cecile says.  I'll
              see you in the morning, baby.
              Night, night.

    As she hangs up, she glances out the window in time to
    see...

    Lenny flying over a hedge.  He lands on the sidewalk, then
    scrambles up and brushes himself off as TWO SECURITY TYPES
    loom toward him.  He adjusts his wardrobe and walks with
    dignity (but quickly) toward the car.

                             MACE
              Are we having a bad night?

                             LENNY
                      (glancing back)
              Let's talk in the car.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT./ EXT.  MACE'S LIMO - NIGHT

    As Mace pulls out, Lenny starts fitting a pair of playback
    trodes to his head.  Mace glances at him in disgust.  He
    hits his playback button.

    Lenny's POV as he talks to Faith.  Back when things were
    good.  He's wiring her.  They are playful, like a couple
    of kids.

                             FAITH
              I feel like you're turning me into a
              VCR.

                             LENNY
              I just want to see what we're like
              together through your eyes.

    He turns OFF the record button.  STATIC.  Then TAPE
    RESTARTS.  We see the two of them standing together,
    reflected in a mirror.

    We are Faith now.

                             FAITH
              I don't feel anything.  Is it on?

                             LENNY
              Forget it's there.

                             FAITH
              Make me forget it, baby.

    He turns her to him.  They begin to make love.  Faith's
    face fills our field of view, eyes closed in dreamy
    passion.

    A sudden FLASH OF LIGHT.  Lenny opens his eyes to see...
    Mace's glowing countenance.

    She has stopped the car, torn the trodes from Lenny's head
    and tossed them out the window.  Now she's yanking him out
    of the car by his lapels.

                             LENNY
              Hey, careful on the jacket.  This is
              Armani.
                      (he looks at her)
              You angry?

                             MACE
              I've had enough of this shit.
                      (getting back into
                       the car)
              You're on foot, Lenny.

                             LENNY
              In LA?  Are you crazy?

    Mace starts to peel out, but Lenny leaps and plasters
    himself on the hood.  Mace pretends she doesn't see him.

                             LENNY
                      (as they drive along)
              Can I come in please?  I'm having a
              hard time hearing the stereo.

    Mace jams on the brakes and Lenny slides off in front of
    the car.  Now she starts to move forward...

                             LENNY
              I need my case.  It's still in the
              back.

                             MACE
              Get it.

    He quickly moves around the car and climbs in the back
    door.  Lenny grabs his Haliburton but instead of getting
    out, he leans through the divider window, next to Mace.

                             LENNY
              Listen, can we talk a little bit
              here, like two rational adults?

    Mace hits a button on the dash.  The privacy divider rises
    suddenly, pinning Lenny to the ceiling.

                             LENNY
              That would be no.

                             MACE
              I've had it.  No more wirehead shit
              in my car.  You understand?  You
              want to poach your lobes, do it
              somewhere else.

                             LENNY
              Okay, you got my attention, but this
              is cutting off the circulation to my
              head, here.  D'you mind?

    She lowers the divider, releasing him.  Lenny straightens
    his jacket and tie.  Runs a hand through his greasy hair.

                             LENNY
              I thought we were friends.

                             MACE
              No, see a friend is more than one
              person constantly doing favors for
              another.  You just suck people along
              with your schemes and your scams and
              your slick act.  Well I'm out.  I
              got a kid, I got rent, I got an ex-
              husband someplace who doesn't send
              me a dime of support... I'm just
              trying to hold on here.

                             LENNY
              So am I.  Just trying to get by.

                             MACE
              No, you're just trying to get off.

                             LENNY
              Macey... I've never seen you like
              this.

                             MACE
              Lenny, you're turning into some
              kinda squid-head low-life.  You're
              always broke, you just go from one
              score to the next.  And you're
              getting strung out... you don't even
              see it.  Getting high on your own
              supply like some crack dealer.

                             LENNY
              I know you wouldn't be saying all
              this if you didn't care about me.
              Thanks, Mace.  Really.

                             MACE
              Look, I gotta get some sleep.

                             LENNY
              You still like me, don't you?  We're
              still buddies?

    She hates it that she can't resist his pathetic charm.

                             MACE
                      (a tiny smile)
              Yeah.  I don't see a way out of it.

                             LENNY
              Macey, I know you're tired, but can
              you drop me at the Retinal Fetish?
              It's on your way.

                             MACE
              Jesus, Lenny.

                             LENNY
              Begging?  Groveling?  Any pathetic
              behavior at all?  Will that help?
              Faith's there tonight, and I've got
              to talk to her.

                             MACE
              Sure, Lenny.
                      (she puts the car in
                       gear)
              The only thing worse than a junkie
              is someone in love.

    EXT.  RETINAL FETISH - NIGHT

    As Mace pulls to a stop in the parking lot and Lenny opens
    the door.

                             LENNY
              Come on, let me buy you a drink.
              Let's drink and make up.
                      (Mace shakes her
                       head)
              Alright, I'm going to see Faith.
              That means you can watch me suffer.
              I'll be in agony, you'll feel so
              much better.  Total and thorough
              payback, whatdya say?

    Mace smiles, shaking her head in wonder at this madman.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  RETINAL FETISH

    Mace accompanies Lenny into the pounding din of the
    Retinal Fetish.  The place is a fringe hangout, a
    converted schmata factory transformed into a warren of
    dark rooms and corridors off the main dance floor.  A
    thundering labyrinth.  Steel cage-like partitions of
    chain-link give the place a harsh, concentration-camp
    atmosphere.  The music is a bass tech-thump, and the
    clientele are young and on the rough side.  Cybergrunge.

    There are many large video screens running a continuous
    montage of wild graphics and images... a flurry of
    disturbing videos: MTV baptized by William Burroughs.

    The Fetish is a street-tech hangout, a meeting place for a
    lot of digital-underground types that Lenny knows.  You
    can buy and sell what you want here: illicit hardware and
    software, as well as chemicals for the wetware (brain).

    Lenny and Mace are greeted inside by two suited guys with
    metal detectors.  They barely notice as they are scanned:
    it's routine there days.  Mace shows her gun, a Sig Saur
    9mm, and her state carry-permit.  The security guys check
    her pistol like a coat, giving her a claim check.

    Through the crowd in the lounge Lenny's eyes go
    immediately to one table.  It seems to be in a pool of
    light all it's own; or maybe this is just in Lenny's mind.
    SLOW MOTION: Lenny watches a man at the table holding
    court, with a beautiful young woman sitting next to him.

    It is TRAN VO.  He's a mover and shaker in the record
    business: he produces, he manages, he tries to keep
    everyone in his orbit.

    The woman is FAITH JUSTIN.  We recognize her from playback
    as Lenny's ex-girlfriend.  But now her hair has been dyed
    jet black and frames her face in a wild tangle.  She is
    wearing as expensive custom leather jacket over a sheer
    silk top.  She has on too much make-up, which gives her
    features a feral-doll quality.  Faith looks like what she
    is, a rock star wannabe.  But the look is red-hot.

    Tran looks around the room.  His eyes miss nothing.  And
    show nothing.  His hand -- unhurried, graceful, remarkable
    -- brushes past Faith's cheek, barely touching her.  His
    fingers pick up a strand of hair, tuck it like a treasure
    behind her ear... fingers touching her head now... a
    moment of suspended time.

    ... and she trembles.  Just a little.  For a second.

    Tran and Faith are flanked on either side by an entourage
    consisting of music types, various hangers on, and Tran's
    personal security force of four: JOEY CORTO, a whippet-
    thin skinhead; DUNCAN, a none-too-bright armbreaker in the
    classic mold; a massively built ex-jock type called WADE
    BEEMER; and a sixteen year old Asian stone fox, CINDY
    MINH, aka 'VITA', possibly the most lethal of the four.

                             LENNY
              Who's the new side of beef in Tran's
              posse?

                             MACE
              Guy named Wade Beemer.  Used to be a
              running back for the Rams in '96 and
              '97.

                             LENNY
              Rams... that's football, right?

    He can't take his eyes off Faith.  Mace scowls at the
    tableau and pulls Lenny toward the bar.

                             MACE
              Forget her.

                             LENNY
              She still loves me.

                             MACE
              She thinks you're a bucket of dog
              vomit.  Trust me on this.

                             LENNY
              She's my destiny.

                             MACE
              Destiny?  You living in a perfume
              commercial?  She's a hard-climber
              that dropped you like a used tampon
              when she got a better ride.

                             LENNY
              You'll see.

    Mace gives up, shakes her head and Lenny plunges into the
    crowd... toward Faith.  Several patrons greet him, just as
    in the Coral Lounge, but uncharacteristically, Lenny
    virtually ignores them.

    Approaching the main table now.  Ringside.  Tran sees him;
    no reaction.  Now Faith sees him: her reaction's a little
    tougher to read.  Pissed off, maybe, or just tense.

    Tran's security force has seen Lenny coming.  But they
    stay casual.

    Lenny doesn't break stride.  It's like a game of chicken
    without cars.  Beemer stands, covering Lenny with his
    shadow.  Vita looks up at Lenny with cobra eyes.  Tran
    gives him a glance; royalty amused by Lenny's presumption.

                             TRAN
              You come to peddle me some tapes,
              Lenny?  For old time's sake?  Make a
              couple bucks for the holidays?

                             LENNY
              You're not a client anymore, Tran.
              I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a
              dead dog's balls.

                             TRAN
                      (glancing at Faith,
                       back at Lenny)
              I already got everything I need from
              you.

                             FAITH
              Cut it out, Tran.

                             LENNY
              Too bad about your guy Jeriko.
              Tough break.

                             TRAN
              Show a little respect, Nero.  The
              man was an important artist.

                             LENNY
              Yeah, important for your label.
              Which no doubt is why you're in
              mourning.  Don't worry, his
              records'll sell out now he's dead.
              You'll make out.

                             TRAN
              I always do.

                             LENNY
              Faith, can I talk to you a second?

                             FAITH
              I don't think that's a good idea,
              Lenny.

                             LENNY
              I just got to talk to you for one
              second.

                             TRAN
              About what?

                             LENNY
              That would be between me and Faith,
              wouldn't it?

    Tran takes one of his beautiful hands and passes it slowly
    in the general area between his table and Lenny.

                             TRAN
              I don't feel anything between you.
              See, your trouble is you assume too
              much, Lenny.  You assume there's
              something where there's nothing.
              You assume you have a life.  But
              you're only hustling pieces of other
              lives on tape, and broken parts of
              your own.

    Faith glances at Tran, then cuts her eyes to Lenny.

                             FAITH
                      (icy)
              We have nothing to talk about,
              Lenny.

                             TRAN
              Joey, make sure Mr. Nero gets safely
              to his car.

    Joey smirks, glances at Beemer who rises like a wall.

                             LENNY
              Faith, call me, okay?

                             FAITH
              No, Lenny.

    Wade gets Lenny in a wrist-grip come along hold and starts
    him moving.  She looks at him -- slowly, gaze unwavering.
    As Beemer ushers Lenny through the crowd, Tick greets him
    coming the other way.

                             LENNY
              Tick, listen, I can't stop right
              now.  but I'll call you tomorrow
              about that thing we were talking
              about.

    He's working the room even as he's getting dragged
    outside.

                             TRAN
              Lenny the loser.  Panhandler of
              stolen dreams.

                             FAITH
              Leave him alone, Tran.

                             TRAN
              He's no concern of mine, as long as
              you don't talk to him.  Don't talk
              to anybody.  You understand?  Not
              with everything that's going on
              right now.

                             FAITH
              You're too goddamned paranoid.

                             TRAN
              Paranoia's only reality on a finer
              scale.

    EXT.  RETINAL FETISH

    Beemer deposits Lenny on the curb and goes back inside.

    A SMALL CROWD of people enters the club.  Lenny brushes
    off his jacket, falls into step at the rear of the
    entering crowd.

    INT.  RETINAL FETISH

    Lenny climbs to a landing overlooking the dance floor.
    Through chain link he sees a swirl of activity below.  And
    one face, looking up at him.  Kind of casual.  Lenny
    clocks the guy: cop instincts coming out.  Decides he
    doesn't know him.  But we do.  It's Spreg.  Lenny walks
    on, crosses to a door, and enters...

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  VJ BOOTH/RETINAL FETISH

    A tiny room overlooking the dance floor.  Crammed with
    electronic gear, at the center of which is Tex Arcana,
    whipping from one deck to another, hands flying.  He's in
    a wheelchair, which pivots nimbly, managing to high-five
    Lenny as he walks in.

                             LENNY
              So, those rascals still haven't
              grown back yet, huh?

                             TEX
                      (peering under the
                       blanket on his lap)
              Nope.  Guess not.  Any day now,
              though.

                             LENNY
                      (handing Tex a Squid)
              Present.  Something I had made.  Let
              me know what you think.

                             TEX
              Hey, alright.  Got something here
              for you, too.
                      (passes him an
                       envelope)
              It just showed up tonight, don't
              know who left it.

                             LENNY
              Fan mail from some flounder?

    Lenny looks at the envelope, which has "Nero" hand-printed
    in block letters.  Tex takes a pull from a flask as he
    takes a squid-deck out of a drawer and sticks the tape in.
    He puts on the headset and pushes PLAY.

    IN POV we are on a beach.  Early morning.  We are running
    flat out, with the wind.  Looking down... we are barefoot
    on the wet sand.  Foaming water races up the sand and
    breaks around our strong male legs.  Looking up again, to
    see our running companion... a beautiful lithe woman in
    shorts and T-shirt.  She laughs and we speed up.  An
    exquisite moment of pure life force.

    TIGHT ON TEX'S FACE... as a tear leaks from the corner of
    his eye.  He is smiling like he is listening to beautiful
    music.  We see the quiet magnificence of Lenny's gift.

    Tex opens his eyes.  Looks for Lenny to say thanks: but
    Lenny's gone.  Not a guy to hang around for thanks-yous.

    INT.  RETINAL FETISH

    As Lenny comes down the stairs from the VJ booth, tearing
    open the envelope.  An unmarked Squid tape falls into his
    hand.

    The HOUSE LIGHTS dim and the STAGE LIGHTS come up.  And
    Faith is standing there.  Like she beamed in.  She is
    wearing a revealing leather outfit, showing a lot of her
    milk-white skin.  Her black hair frames her eyes, giving
    her an intense feral look.  Faith starts to sing.
    Beautiful, unearthly, clear notes.

    SUDDENLY the band kicks down with a wall of thundering
    sound.  Faith explodes into motion.  Her body convulses
    like a 440 volt mainline is hooked up to her.  Her voice
    becomes a scream, an inchoate wail, a police siren.  The
    pain and rage of an entire, hell-bent tormented planet on
    its eve of judgment.

    Lost in the song, Faith has found herself.  She wheels
    across the stage, slashing her head up and down so that
    her hair bursts in the strobe-flashes like flak.

    A techno-erotic pagan.  A force of nature.

    Lenny is mesmerized.  He has seen this before, many times.
    But it always has the same effect on him.  He is
    transported into another world by her, a world in which
    there is only the two of them.

    TIGHT ON MACE, eyes on the stage... a big piece of the
    puzzle suddenly fits.  She's never seen Faith perform
    before.  Holy shit.

    Faith doesn't play to the audience, or engage them in any
    way.  She is merely taking what's in her head and letting
    it out.  She doesn't care if they are there or not.  Now
    shrieking into the silence after a climatic downbeat, and
    holding the note... holding it longer than you believe she
    possibly could.  Then nothing.

    When it is over she just drops the microphone and walk
    away.  Fuck you.

    INT.  RETINAL FETISH/BACKSTAGE & DRESSING ROOM

    At BACKSTAGE, Lenny wends his way through the warren of
    corridors... past dim rooms full of wire junkies and
    playback freaks, all trapped into Squid nirvana: post-
    modern opium dens.  Sinister and scary.  He glimpses
    Faith, going into her dressing room.  He hurries...

    ... but she doesn't even look around when his reflection
    appears in the cracked mirror above the crummy vanity
    table.  She is drenched with sweat.  Spent.  Chugging a
    beer.  This is the first time they have been alone
    together in real-time for months.  Pain and the memory of
    joy.

                             LENNY
              Hi, baby.  I've missed you.

                             FAITH
              I know.  Lenny, if Tran finds you
              talking to me he'll hurt you.

                             LENNY
              I'm already hurting.

    She doesn't turn.  Just watches him in the mirror.  Most
    of the scene plays this way.  It is a cold parody of their
    love-making playbacks.

                             FAITH
              You have to go.  I mean it.

                             LENNY
              Yeah, OK, whatever you say.  Just
              answer one question.  Is anything
              wrong?  Iris said you might be in
              trouble.

                             FAITH
                      (startled, turning
                       to him)
              You talked to Iris?  When?

                             LENNY
              Tonight.

                             FAITH
              Well I haven't seen her in months.
              Who knows what's going on in her
              head.  You're really running out of
              excuses to come around, aren't you?

                             LENNY
              I know you Faith.  You're afraid of
              something.  What's going on?

                             FAITH
              Let it alone, Lenny.  It'll take
              care of itself.

                             LENNY
              It's Tran, isn't it?  This guy is
              poison, Faith.  Listen to me.  He's
              got you walled in on all sides.  And
              he uses the wire too much, he gets
              off on tape, not on you.

                             FAITH
              That's a good one, coming from you.

                             LENNY
              Why don't you just split?  You don't
              love him, anybody can see that.  And
              to him you're just some kinda
              possession, like a Ferrari,
              something to show the other guys.

                             FAITH
              He has his uses too.

                             LENNY
              What?  He gonna record you on his
              label?

                             FAITH
              Maybe.

                             LENNY
              Come on, Faith!  He's just toying
              with you.  And when he gets bored,
              you'll be yesterday's papers.

    Lenny is right behind her now.  He puts his hands on her
    shoulders, tenderly.

                             LENNY
              Look, baby, I've watched you create
              yourself out of nothing.  You're
              like a goddamn cruise missile,
              targeted on making it.  And you
              will.

                             FAITH
              Damn right.

                             LENNY
              It's you up on that stage, not him.
              You don't need him.

    She shrugs away from his touch.  Cold again.

                             FAITH
              You have to get out of here.  If
              Tran catches you he'll... he's
              acting crazy.  He's doing way too
              much playback and he's getting
              completely paranoid.  He's such a
              control freak, he's even paying Max
              to follow me around.

                             LENNY
              Max Pelcher?  You're kidding?

                             FAITH
              Yeah, for about a month now.  Lenny,
              just stay away from Tran, okay?  And
              stay away from me.  Stop trying to
              rescue me.  Those days are over.
              I'm a big girl now.  Stop trying to
              save me, okay, because I don't need
              saving... Just... give up on me.

                             LENNY
              Can't do it.

                             FAITH
              You know one of the ways movies
              still have Squid beat?  Because they
              always say "The End." You always
              know when it's over.  It's over!
              Now please leave.  I have to go on
              again in a couple of minutes.

    She looks at him and, after a moment, he nods and leaves.
    As the door closes behind him, Faith tosses her towel on
    the table.  She looks frightened and alone.

                             FAITH
              Hell.

    INT.  RETINAL FETISH/CORRIDOR AND MAIN FLOOR

    Turning a corner from the dressing room into the CORRIDOR,
    Lenny runs into Max.

                             LENNY
              Shoulda told me about your new gig,
              buddy.

                             MAX
              I was gonna tell ya.  Hey, it's just
              a job.  I feel like shit about it.

                             LENNY
              You should feel like shit.

                             MAX
              I figured, what the hell, I could
              take the prick's money and make sure
              Faith was OK at the same time.  Do
              us both good.  Right?

                             LENNY
              Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for
              you.
                      (already over it)
              Hey, at least you got a job!
                      (slaps him on the
                       back)
              Watch her for me.  Stay on her.

                             MAX
              I'm on her.

    Lenny climbs the stairs to the MAIN FLOOR, pushing his way
    through the crowd.

    Vita, watching the backstage area leans over to Tran,
    whispers in his ear.  Tran makes a sign to Beemer, and he
    stands to go after Lenny.

    Mace, at the bar, sees the Tran-Vita-Beemer action, looks
    around for Lenny.  Can't find him.  But figures there's
    got to be only one reason Beemer's on the prowl: he's
    looking for Lenny.  She whips out her cellular.

    CUT TO: Beemer, grabbing Lenny in a painful come-along
    hold and hustling him toward the back of the club.

    Lenny's cellular rings.

                             LENNY
              Can I get that?

    He reaches for his cellular, connects with...

    MACE, over by the bar.

                             MACE
              Hey Lenny, where the hell are you, I
              think Tran's got Beemer looking for
              you.

    BACK TO: Lenny, as he's hustled out the rear door.

                             LENNY
              Thanks for the tip.

              I recognize you.  You're Wade
              Beemer.  Running back for the Rams,
              am I right?

    Beemer, who was about to go to work on Lenny, pauses.

                             BEEMER
              Yeah, that's right.

                             LENNY
              I saw you play, man.  You were good.
              Like a fucking freight train I
              remember saying.  So what happened,
              injuries or what?

                             BEEMER
              Bullshit politics.

                             LENNY
              It's always politics.  Like this
              thing we're in here, he's paying you
              to tune me up, right?  But I could
              pay you more not to.  See what I
              mean?  I could write you a check
              right now--

                             BEEMER
              Come on, let's go, I got to get
              back.

                       of his pocket)
              Okay cash!  Logical.  Here's
              everything I have on me, what do you
              say?  How about a Rolex?

                             BEEMER
                      (barely a glance at
                       it)
              I already got a real one.  Come on,
              it won't be too bad.  It's not
              personal.

                       Armani carefully)
              Just not the eyes.

    Beemer swings.

              They oughta get some lights back

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  MACE'S LIMO

    Lenny slumps in the back seat.

                             MACE
              You're some piece of work, you know
              that.  Just calmly backstroking
              around in the big toilet bowl, and
              somehow you never let it touch you.
              I mean, between Vice and this so-
              called occupation you're in now, you
              must've seen it all.

                             LENNY
              I have crawled through the gutter...
              through every wrinkle in the human
              brain.

                             MACE
              What I'm saying.  But you still come
              out this goofball romantic.

                             LENNY
              It is my sword and my shield, Macey.

    Lenny finds the anonymous tape in his pocket.  He looks a
    it, puzzled.

                             MACE
              What's that?  Present from Faith?

                             LENNY
              No idea.

    He opens his briefcase, pops the tape into the deck, puts
    the Squid rig on and closes his eyes.  Maybe he can forget
    about Faith a minute.  He punches PLAY.

    POV SEQUENCE: the first thing we notice is that the POV is
    distorted visually.  The colors are de-saturated.  Almost
    black and white.  Yet the detail is crisp and clear,
    almost hyper-real.

    WE ARE WALKING down a windowless hallway at a large hotel.
    An apparently endless row of doors.  The Wearer's glance
    goes to the numbers on the doors from time to time.

    We come to a particular door.  There is a DO NOT DISTURB
    sign on the door.  The Wearer moves to the room next door.
    Looks both ways.  The corridor is empty.

                             LENNY
              It's a test pattern so far.

    "Our" hands appear, quickly pulling on latex surgical
    gloves.  They look like male hands.  The snapping of the
    rubber is the only sound in the corridor.  The POV hunches
    down to the lock and we see the hands go to work with
    lock-picking tools.  Several seconds and the lock is very
    professionally picked.

                             LENNY
              Alright, a little B&E action.

    We enter the dark room, which is vacant.  The drapes are
    open and we see city lights.  It is night.  One gloved
    hand picks up the guest directory and looks at it in the
    moonlight coming in the window: the SUNSET SHERATON.

    The Wearer drops the directory and the hands reappear
    holding... a black ski-mask.  He pulls it on, leaving the
    subsequent POV seen through the eye-holes of the mask.

    The Wearer now looks into a mirror on the dresser.  He has
    avoided his reflection up until now.  We see a man,
    dressed in a jogging suit and black fanny-pack, and of
    course the ski-mask.  Totally anonymous.

                             LENNY
              Hey, getting good.  Solid suspense
              build.

    The Wearer crosses to the balcony door.  Opens it quietly
    and goes outside, moving to the wall dividing this room's
    balcony from the one next door.

    The Wearer climbs the railing and, six stories above the
    pavement, slips around the wall, stepping down onto the
    other balcony.  We hug the wall, looking furtively into
    the room.  It is a suite.  In the living room we see a
    woman making herself a drink at the mini-bar.  She
    turns...

    It is Iris.  She is wearing a T-shirt and panties.
    Probably ready for bed.  She looks like she can't sleep.
    Pours the Scotch shakily.

    CUT TO LENNY, the streetlight washing across his face.  He
    gets suddenly serious with a flash of premonitory dread.

    IN POV we see Iris go into the bedroom, out of sight.  We
    can hear the television on in there.  Using a steel jimmy
    the Wearer slips the latch on the balcony slider and
    silently opens it, slipping inside.

    We stalk quietly to the bedroom door, listening to her
    movements.  Water running in the bathroom.  We come around
    the door frame.  Bedroom dark, bathed in TV glow.  Iris in
    the bathroom, washing her face with cold water.

    We move toward her.  Crossing the room as she reaches for
    a towel.  We are now only a couple of feet away.  She
    comes out of the bathroom, walking right past us, drying
    her face.  She lowers the towel, turning away... her eyes
    whip back.  Widening in terror.

    She reacts with surprising speed, diving across the bed.
    We go after her.

    Her hand goes under the pillow and comes out with a small
    automatic.  She whips it around toward us but we grab it
    and twist it away before she can fire.  She smashes the
    palm of her hand into our face and rolls off the bed,
    lightning-fast.

    We follow her as she scrambles up, running through the
    bedroom door.  Across the living room and down the short
    hall to the front door.  Closing rapidly on her as she
    somehow gets the chain off the door and gets out into the
    hall.

    Slam!  We tackle her against the far wall of the corridor.
    Our right hand comes into view holding a small electric
    stunner.  ZAP!  We nail her right in the back between the
    shoulder blades.

    She sags to the floor, gasping.  We zap her again.  The
    Wearer's glance does a 180 both ways down the corridor...
    nobody in sight.  We clamp our hand over Iris' mouth and
    drag her back into her room, locking the door.

    ON LENNY, reacting.  Going white.

                             MACE
              What is it?

                             LENNY
              Go to the Sunset Sheraton.  RIGHT
              NOW!  Just go!  GO!

    Lenny goes back under the wire, seeing...

    WE ARE DRAGGING a semiconscious Iris into the bathroom...
    propping her up with her back against the white tile
    wall... grabbing her hands and handcuffing them one by one
    to the steel towel rack above her.  She is moaning.  And
    crying.

                             IRIS
                      (voice distorted)
              I haven't seen your face... I
              haven't heard your voice... you can
              still let me go...

    ZAP!  The Wearer hits her with the stunner again.  She
    jerks and gasps for breath.  We see our latex-gloved
    finger come up in front of us and hear SSSHHH.

    Moving quickly now.  Our hands unbuckle the fanny pack.
    Pull out something... a set of playback trodes.  Our hands
    place them on her head.  She stares uncomprehending.
    What?  We catch a glimpse of some electronics stuff inside
    the pack... a record deck, some wires, a small metal box.

                             LENNY
              Holy shit.  He's jacking her in to
              his own output.  She's seeing what
              he's seeing.  She's seeing herself.

    Iris can now see herself as the Wearer sees her... wide-
    eyed with terror, white-lipped, weeping.  Helpless.  And
    she can feel what he feels.

    The Wearer's hand goes back into the fanny-pack and pulls
    out something else.  A black athletic headband.  We slip
    it over her head, down over her eyes.  A blindfold.  Now
    she can only see what the wearer sees.

    And also from the bag we pull... a yellow plastic object.
    With our thumb we extend the five inch blade of the razor
    knife, the type with tips that can be broken off by
    segments when they get dull.  It extends with an ominous
    clicking sound.

    We lower it toward her and cut up the middle of her T-
    shirt, laying it open.  Exposing her torso.  We then look
    down and slide the knife under the side band of her
    panties, slicing them off.  We put the knife up to her
    throat, and she whimpers, afraid to cry out, and then we
    draw the flat side of the blade across her body as if to
    tease her with the prospect of her death.

    MACE LOOKS AT LENNY'S EXPRESSION of dawning horror and
    pulls the car to the curb about a half-block from the
    Sunset Sheraton.  Lenny is hyperventilating, shifting in
    his seat as if ants are crawling over him.  He is
    experiencing the stalker's exhilaration.

    IN POV we see the Wearer pull his jogging pants down below
    his knees (R-rated please) and reach for Iris.  Kneeling
    in front of her, he pushes her legs apart and pulls her
    hips forward onto him, pushing into her.

    Iris is feeling and seeing what he sees and feels... She
    feels her own pain and humiliation swirling with the
    killer's exhilaration.

    ON LENNY, sweating and barely able to breath.  Mace stops
    the tape... concerned by Lenny's reaction.  He opens his
    eyes... Mace see the fear there, of what the tape may
    reveal.  But he shakes his head.  He has to know.  He
    pushes her hand away and punches PLAY.

    IT FLOODS INTO HIS HEAD AGAIN.  The sweaty, grunting
    horror.  The stalker picks up her slit T-shirt and quickly
    wraps it around her neck.  He knots it tight and twists
    one powerful hand into the knot.  The muscles in his
    forearm look like cables as he turns the knot tighter.

    The stalker viciously twists the knot a full turn and the
    T-shirt fabric almost disappears into the skin under her
    jaw.

    Via her trodes, Iris watches herself die.  Her death comes
    at the moment of his orgasm which is fed to her...
    blasting off the planet on total overload... terror, pain,
    death merging with ecstasy and exultation at the same
    instant.

    ON LENNY, crying out and grabbing for the trodes, but he
    just holds onto them, as if they are sucking his brains
    out of his skull.

                             LENNY
                      (like a mantra)
              On my God.  Oh my God.

    BACK TO POV, a glimpse of the Wearer's hand relaxing the
    knot.  Iris' head lolls.  Her mouth is slack and open.  We
    remove her blindfold.  Her eyes are half-lidded.  Very
    dead looking.  Our fingers gently push them wide open.

    BACK TO LENNY, looking like he has been gut kicked.  He
    gasps for breath.

    TO POV, as the killer's hand calmly moves Iris' head from
    side to side... studying her dead face.  Her staring eyes.
    He leans very close to her and stares into one dead eye,
    the pupil wide, seeing nothing.

    A burst of static.  End of tape.

    Lenny opens his eyes.  He fumbles open the car door and
    practically rolls out onto the sidewalk.  The trodes pull
    off his head as he lurches up, reeling across the sidewalk
    to a darkened storefront where he leans for support.  He
    doubles over and heaves up the contents of his stomach.

    Mace circles around the car and catches him as he sags to
    his knees.  She holds his shoulders while he throws up
    again.

                             MACE
              My God, Lenny.  What is it?

                             LENNY
              Black.  Jack.

                             MACE
              Blackjack?  I don't understand--

                             LENNY
              Snuff clip.  It was Iris.  She said
              she needed my help and I... aw
              Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker
              killed her.

                             MACE
              Are you sure it's real?

    Lenny looks up, in the direction of the hotel.  Mace
    follows his glance.  They notice for the first time: cop
    lights; cop cars; ambulance; coroner's wagon.

    CLOSE on Iris' body, in a bag, being loaded into the
    coroner's van.

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  PARKING LOT/DIM SUM JOINT/LITTLE TOKYO - NIGHT

    Neon reflections on the roof of Mace's limo as it pulls
    into the lot and slides up to Max's car.  Max is sitting
    in the open door, feet on the pavement, eating dumplings
    from a take-out carton.  He looks up as Lenny and Mace get
    out of the limo.  Sees their expressions.

                             MAX
              Ohhhh shit.

    TIME CUT: Lenny, sitting on the hood of Mace's Lincoln,
    has his head propped in his hands.  His eyes are
    distant... replaying.  Still shocked to his soul.  Mace
    paces nearby.

    Max sits in the open door of his car ten feet away, trodes
    on, playing back the tape.  His face is transformed into
    an ashen mask lit by neon... mouth open in shock.  With
    shaky hands he stops the deck.

    Opens his eyes.  Long beat.  He glances down at the dim-
    sum carton in his hands.

                             MAX
              Well... I've lost my appetite.
                      (lofts it into a
                       nearby dumpster)
              For about a year.

    He gets to his feet, offering the deck and trodes to Mace.

                             MACE
              No way.

    Max pulls a hip-flask full of tequila from his army jacket
    and takes an eye-watering pull.  Offers it to Lenny, who
    follows suit.

                             MAX
              You alright?  Y'okay?

                             LENNY
              Yeah.  No, not really.

                             MAX
              Let's work it.

                             LENNY
              Not now... I don't want to think
              about it--

                             MAX
              Come on, Lenny.  You used to be good
              at this stuff.  Play it down.
              What's the perp doing?

                             LENNY
              He stalks her.  He rapes her.  Then
              he does her...

                             MAX
              And he records it.  Thrill kill.
              Wants to see it again.  And again.

                             LENNY
              He records himself raping and
              killing her--

                             MAX
              But at the same time he's sending
              the signal to her--

                             LENNY
              So she feels... what he feels...
              while he's in her.  The thrill while
              he's killing her... is sent to her,
              heightening her fear... which in
              turn heightens the turn on for him.
                      (turns to him)
              I've seen a lot, Max.

                             MAX
              So've I.  Too much.

                             LENNY
              But this is a bad one.

                             MAX
              Top ten.

                             LENNY
              He makes her see her own death,
              feeds off the reaction... killer and
              victim merging... orgasm and agony
              merging.  And he records it all.

                             MACE
              And gives it to you.

                             LENNY
              Wants to share.

                             MAX
              That's right.  He wants to share.
              Needs an audience.  This is one sick
              puppy.

                             LENNY
              Why me?

    Mace is hugging herself.  Edgy and tense.

                             MACE
              Cause you're the man, right?  The
              Magic Man.  If it's got something to
              do with the wire, sooner or later it
              washes up on your beach.

                             LENNY
              I've never dealt in black-jacks.
              Never.  Everybody knows that.

                             MAX
              He's skull-fucking you, bud.  Trying
              to get a reaction.  Maybe pushing
              you to do something.

                             MACE
              Maybe he just figures Lenny will
              appreciate what he's created.  It's
              the dark end of the street, Lenny.
              How do you like it now?

                             LENNY
              Jesus, Mace.  Back off.

                             MACE
              This guy is someone you know, one of
              your squid-head contacts.

                             MAX
              Problem is, Lenny knows everybody.

                             MACE
              Take the tape to the cops.

                             LENNY
              Uh unh.  No way!  They'd crucify me.

                             MACE
              So some psycho wire-freak gets to
              keep running around--

                             MAX
              Naw, he's right.  They'll figure
              Lenny's the perp, or go through his
              client list, ruin his life... such
              as it is.  Look, I'll call the guys
              in Homicide... tell them she was a
              friend of mine and they'll keep me
              in the loop.  Get me the forensics
              and all that.
                      (he opens his car
                       door)
              Get some sleep.  I'll call you when
              I get something.
                      (he starts his car)
              And Lenny... I'd keep moving if I
              were you.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  ELEVATOR AND TRAN'S LOFT

    The elevator is huge -- big enough for a truck -- and
    Lenny seems small in the huge space, while shadows crawl
    across his body as the old machinery pulls him up
    toward...

    FAITH, in the loft above.  She looks into the vast
    bedroom...

    ... at Tran sitting in a chair, tranced out under playback
    trodes, his eyes closed.  She softly closes the sliding
    door and walks across the cavernous main room.  The place
    is lit by the flickering reflections from a series of huge
    television screens along both walls.  Otherwise there is
    little light.  The cavernous loft is sparsely but very
    expensively furnished.  Haute-tech design.  Total contrast
    to Lenny's ratty digs.

    LENNY'S POV through the cage-door of the elevator as it
    reaches the loft and Faith is revealed, waiting for him in
    the shadows.  He slides open the cage-door and she moves
    quickly to him.

                             FAITH
                      (whispering, furtive)
              You're crazier than I thought,
              Lenny.  Coming here... Tran's just
              in there.

                             LENNY
              Iris is dead.  She was murdered.

    Faith stiffens.  We see the fear, now, exposed.

                             FAITH
              Who did it?

                             LENNY
              Don't know.  But this guy's real
              damaged goods.  Iris knew someone
              was after her... and she said you
              were in danger too.
                      (he grabs her
                       shoulders)
              Now no more games, Faith.  Whatever
              you're hiding, whatever's going on,
              you have to get out of here now.
              Come with me right now.  Don't even
              think about it.

                             FAITH
              Then what?  Then what, Lenny?!  You
              going to protect me?  Big tough guy.
              You're a talker, Lenny.  You don't
              even have a gun.

                             LENNY
                      (hurt)
              I have a gun.  It's under my bed.

                             FAITH
              You don't know what you're fucking
              with here.

                             LENNY
              Tell me.

    A VOICE from the shadows, like the whisper of a blade in
    the air.

                             TRAN
              Go ahead, Faith.  Tell him.

    Tran steps forward, totally at ease with the situation.
    Out of the shadows behind him step Joey Corto, Duncan and
    Vita Minh.

                             FAITH
              Look, Tran... Lenny just came by to
              give me some bad news.  An old
              friend of mine has been murdered.
              You remember Iris?

                             TRAN
              A tragic story, no doubt.
                      (to Lenny)
              How'd you get up here?

                             LENNY
              Charm.

                             TRAN
                      (looks at Faith)
              Uh huh.  Look, Nero.  I'll make you
              an offer.
                      (he grabs Faith by
                       the arm, steps
                       closer)
              Take her.  Right now.  If she wants
              to go, if she's unhappy here, she
              can go.  I'll let her choose.  Faith
              always knows what she wants.
                      (he turns her loose)
              Hands off.  See?

    Lenny glances at the open elevator right behind him.  So
    close.  She just has to take one step to him... and they
    will be out of there.  Together.

                             LENNY
              It's alright.  He means it.

                             TRAN
                      (to Faith)
              I do mean it.
                      (to Lenny)
              And I mean this... if Faith stays
              you go away and never come back.
              You scuttle back into your cockroach
              hole and never cross my vision
              again.  You understand?

    She glares at them both for a long moment.  Emotions play
    across her face, complex and unreadable.  She steps back,
    taking her place at Tran's side.

                             FAITH
              I made my choice, Lenny.

                             TRAN
                      (to Lenny, nodding
                       toward the elevator)
              You're going down.

    Joey Corto and Duncan shove Lenny roughly backward into
    the elevator.  Corto slams the gate shut and slaps a
    button to lower the lift.  The last thing Lenny sees as he
    descends is Faith's face, above him.

                             FAITH
              I don't love you, Lenny.  Give up.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  BEDROOM AREA/TRAN'S LOFT

    Faith is crying as Tran comes up behind her.

                             FAITH
              You said you were going to get her
              out of this.

                             TRAN
              Maybe now you appreciate the danger
              we're in.
                      (he moves very close)
              It was touching the way you stood by
              me in there.  "Stand by your man".
              I was moved.  You were very good.  I
              don't think he even understands that
              you did it for him.

                             FAITH
              He doesn't know what's going on.
              Leave him alone.

                             TRAN
              I'd love to.  But he keeps showing
              up.  And you keep talking to him.  I
              can't have that--

    And he slaps her.  Really hard.  Decks her.  He's
    trembling with rage... and something else.  Fear.

                             TRAN
              The only time a whore should open
              her mouth is when she's giving head.

                             FAITH
              Fuck you.

                             TRAN
                      (walking away)
              Maybe later.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  ELEVATOR/TRAN'S LOFT

    The huge elevator, with Lenny its sole occupant, descends
    through the shadows toward the first floor.  Lenny watches
    the shadow patterns on the wall through the iron grillwork
    door.  He's still thinking about Faith...

    ... even when the elevator reaches the first floor and
    Mace comes into view.  She's waiting for him.  He steps
    forward.  But he can't open the grillwork door.  And the
    elevator doesn't stop.  It keeps going down.  Lenny,
    spooked, works the door hard... as Mace disappears from
    view above him...

    ... and the elevator bumps to a stop in the basement.
    With Vita and the beef squad waiting for Lenny, stoney-
    faced.  Last stop.  All out.

    Lenny tries to keep the door shut, but Duncan wrenches it
    open.  Vita grabs Lenny and twists his arm painfully
    behind him in one fluid move.  They hustle him toward a
    dank basement room near the elevator.

                             LENNY
                      (speed-rap)
              Listen, can we be smart here?  I
              could make it really worth your
              while... I could cut you a check for
              500 each... hell, make it an even
              grand... I'm not saying you don't
              land a couple shots, just go light
              is all I'm saying... here, take my
              Rolex.

                             CORTO
              Lemme see.

    A glimmer of hope in Lenny's eye as he whips it off his
    wrist.  Corto doesn't even look at it.  Gets it over his
    hand about mid-way, then -- using the watch like a pair of
    brass knuckles -- clobbers Lenny in the face.  Watch parts
    go flying as Corto steps away and Duncan slams Lenny up
    against a column.

    Vita weighs in... gut-punching Lenny savagely.  She works
    him expertly, with a series of painful jabs.

    He sags to his knees.  Not only is this painful.  It's
    goddamn humiliating.  And Duncan and Corto enjoy every
    second of it.

                             CORTO
              We tried to find a smaller girl, to
              beat the shit out of you, Lenny...
              but it was short notice.

    Vita grabs Lenny by his hair and pulls him up with one
    rock-hard arm.  She is cocking back the other arm for a
    pile-driver punch when...

    Suddenly a dark shape materializes behind her.  Mace
    drives Vita head first into the steel column.

    Duncan lunges in and grabs for Mace.  This is a mistake.
    Mace doesn't fight fancy.  And she doesn't fight fair.
    She fights to win.  And she is awesomely fast.  Her moves
    are street moves, coupled with arm-locks and come-alongs
    she has been trained to use as a security driver.

    Lenny recovers enough to size up Vita, who is still a
    little stunned.  She has blood dripping in her eyes and
    can't see too well.

    But she charges him.  And -- being the gent that he is --
    he busts her over the head with a dusty old folding chair.

    Mace drops Duncan about the time Vita is hitting the
    ground, leaving...

    CORTO, who fumbles out a Beretta 9mm and sticks it in
    Mace's face.  He sniggers, loving the upper hand.

                             MACE
              Safety's on.

    And like a jerk, he looks.

    She snaps sideways in a headfake and closes blindingly
    fast, twisting the gun out of his hand.  She continues to
    twist his wrist brutally and Corto goes down to one knee,
    groaning.  She takes his Beretta and backhands the barrel
    hard across his face.  Mace releases his wrist and he
    crumples in a heap.

    She and Lenny back out the door.  Then Lenny runs back in
    and kicks Corto in the ribs.

                             MACE
              Lenny!

    Mace grabs him and pulls him out of the room, then slams
    the metal firedoor behind them, locking it with a piece of
    junk wedged behind the release bar.

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

    Mace and Lenny hotfoot it toward the parked limo.  Mace is
    disassembling the Beretta without looking at it.  She
    chucks pieces over a chain-link fence as they go.  Lenny
    brushes himself off, checking his jacket for damage.  He
    is high from winning the fight.

                             LENNY
              Is this great fabric or what?

                             MACE
              You ever wonder why you get beat up
              a lot?

                             LENNY
              Never really thought about it.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  LENNY'S APARTMENT

    Squid POV: the killer enters the vacant hotel room,
    passing the mirror on the dresser.

                             LENNY (V.O.)
              Come on... look in the mirror.  You
              know it's there, you're keeping your
              eyes off it, you bastard... SHIT!
              Who are you?

    CUT TO: Lenny, yanking the wire off his head, Mace near
    him.

                             LENNY
              He knows what he's doing.  He's worn
              before... a lot.

                             MACE
              So that gives you something.

                             LENNY
              It gives me... I don't know... maybe
              two hundred people who I know wear.

    As he talks Lenny fiddles with some custom electronics
    gear.  The back is off the deck, and he has a ribbon wire
    connecting it to some kind of amplifier black-box which he
    is using to boost the gain.

                             MACE
              Don't crank the gain any more.
              You're gonna fry yourself.

                             LENNY
              I need to see more... get more
              detail.  Something.  I feel his
              presence, so strong...

    Mace watches, concerned, as Lenny puts the trodes back on
    and hits playback.

    Squid POVs: strobe-like images of Iris' rape and death,
    separated by burst of static...

    ... as Lenny keeps hitting the forward and rewind buttons,
    searching the tape for clues, reacting to the feelings on
    the tape, trying to manage his revulsion...

    ... until Mace yanks the trodes off and Lenny sags back on
    the couch.  He rubs his eyes.  He is seeing ghosts,
    afterimages burned into his visual cortex.  The room is
    alive with them, shimmering.

                             MACE
              No more, Lenny.

                             LENNY
              Yeah.  I'm ghosting pretty bad.

    Lenny see Iris' terrified face.  Literally.  It floats
    iridescent on his living room wall, fading slowly.

                             LENNY
              She came to me for help.  I should
              have read it better... I just
              figured, y'know... another strung-
              out hooker having a bad night.

                             MACE
              It's not your fault.

    Lenny gets up, staggering to the kitchen.  She goes with
    him.

                             LENNY
              Sex killers act alone.  So there's
              no information on the street, which
              is how cases get made.  Cops know
              they'll never nail this guy the
              second they look at the scene.

    Lenny sucks down four Tylenol with a long pull from a
    bottle of vodka.

                             LENNY
              And anyway, nobody gives a shit
              about a dead hooker.  They're
              roadkill.

    Requiem for Iris.  Mace watches Lenny rubbing his eyes,
    waiting for the Tylenols to hit.

                             LENNY
              See, it's all about what they see
              walking in.  A dead hooker,
              handcuffs, penetration... they'll
              see a trick gone wrong.  Random
              kill.  The kind you never solve.

                             MACE
              But that doesn't add, does it.

                             LENNY
              No it doesn't.

                             MACE
              Because Iris knew somebody was after
              her.

    Lenny, wound up like a Swiss movement, starts pacing.

                             LENNY
              She said "If they get me".  They.
              Which means the whole sex-killer
              thing is a cover, which means
              somebody whacked her for a reason.

                             MACE
              So the guy's not a sicko.

                             LENNY
              If he could do what's on that tape,
              he's a sicko.

                             MACE
              Okay, so he's a freak who thinks
              he's sane pretending to be a freak.
              The point is, he was a hitter.
              Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But
              why not just put a little lead in
              her ear?

                             LENNY
              Because it had to look random.  Not
              connected to anything or anyone.
                      (he seems to run out
                       of energy)
              But then why give the rape to me?

                             MACE
              That's where it gets a little
              strange.

                             LENNY
              And what about the guy that was
              following me?

                             MACE
              Now you're really getting paranoid.

    Lenny collapses on the couch, rubbing his temples.

                             LENNY
              The question is not whether I am
              paranoid, but whether I am paranoid
              enough.  You want to rub my neck?

                             MACE
              Sure.

    Mace sits next to him and starts to work.  Strong, knowing
    fingers.  Lenny starts to relax a little.

                             LENNY
              How's Zander?

                             MACE
              OK.  He asks about you all the time.
              It's been weeks since you've seen
              him.

    Lenny sort of keels over.  His head slumps in her lap.

                             MACE
              I'm sorry about getting on your case
              earlier.  I just see you getting
              sucked in deeper and deeper, and I
              -- anyway.  I'm sorry.

                             LENNY
                      (drifting off,
                       joking)
              S'okay.  I know you still love me.

    She looks down at him, gently brushes his hair off his
    sweaty forehead in an unconsciously maternal gesture.  He
    is out cold.

    Mace gazes at Lenny's sleeping face in a way we haven't
    seen before: unguarded.  Caring.  Loving.

    And we get it: she does love him.  It makes no sense, and
    it is a great burden to her that he doesn't see her... but
    there it is.

    She shakes it off: she doesn't want to deal with it now.
    Maybe not ever.  She leans her head back against the ratty
    top of the couch, sighs.  And keeps her hand moving
    soothingly on his head.

    EXT./ INT.  MACE'S HOUSE/INGLEWOOD - DAY

    Mace pulls the limo into the driveway of a modest stucco
    house in Inglewood.  It's dawn.  A neighbor is walking the
    dog.  Mace heads into the house, picking up a couple of
    toys left scattered in the front yard.

    Inside, ZANDER, age 6, is watching TV in his pajamas and
    eating a bowl of cereal.  Behind him, on the couch, is
    Mace's younger sister CECILE, zee'd-out.  Zander frowns at
    her and looks at a red-plastic (toy) watch.

                             ZANDER
              Where were you Mom?  Did you meet a
              guy?

                             MACE
              Just Lenny.

                             ZANDER
              Right.  That explains it.

                             MACE
              Are you going to make me beg?

    Zander scrambles over to his mom, throws his arms around
    her.  Big hug.

                             MACE
                      (looking at weird
                       stuff in cereal)
              What is that?

                             ZANDER
              Cheerios and wieners.  I made it
              myself.  It's good.

                             MACE
              Well give me some then... I'm
              starving.

    INT.  LENNY'S APARTMENT

    2:20  P.M.  DEC 31

    Lenny wakes up to the sound of the phone ringing.  He is
    on the couch, still clothed.  He hears Max's voice on the
    answer machine and groggily grabs the receiver.

                             MAX (V.O.)
              Hey, the last day of the world and
              you spend it in bed.

                             LENNY
              W'sup, Max?

    EXT.  A.M.E. CHURCH AND STREET/SOUTH CENTRAL - DAY

    Max, on the cellular, across the street from a church
    where mourners stream out of a memorial for Jeriko One.
    The sidewalk and street are clogged with fans, and further
    off -- a cordon of very anxious-looking crowd control
    cops.

                             MAX
              Not a whole hell of a lot.  They've
              just been saying words over Jeriko.
              Tensions running pretty high down
              here.  I'm telling you.

    WHAT MAX SEES across the street... SLOWMO as Tran comes
    out of the church with Faith next to him.  Corto, Vita,
    Duncan and Beemer form a loose protective shell around
    them as the press bears down, shouting out questions.
    Tran ushers Faith into a waiting limo and climbs in after
    her.  The rest of the muscle keeps the press away from the
    car as it pulls away.

    CUT TO: Max, still on the phone to Lenny.

                             LENNY (V.O.)
              Faith OK?

                             MAX
              Yeah.  She's leaving with Tran so I
              got to boogie.  Real quick... Iris
              checked into the Sheraton last night
              under a false name.  Paid cash.

                             LENNY
              Looks like she was holding out.

                             MAX
              Yup.  Hey, so I heard you dropped in
              on Tran last night.  Another slick
              Lenny move.

                             LENNY (V.O.)
              He's in this somehow... I don't know
              how.  Just stay close to Faith.

                             MAX
              I'm on her, amigo.  No worries.
              Gotta jam.

    INT.  LENNY'S APARTMENT

    As Lenny is hanging up he notices something.  A MANILA
    ENVELOPE stuck between the steel bars and the glass of his
    front window, next to the door.  "NERO" is printed on the
    envelope.

    Oh shit.  He opens the door, looking both ways.  No-one is
    around.  He fishes out the envelope from behind the bars
    and takes it inside.  Of course it contains a tape.  He
    stares at it with dread.

    Lenny sits down and put the tape in his playback deck.  He
    picks up the trodes and places them on his head.  He
    notices his hands are shaking.  He takes a deep breath and
    punches PLAY.

    POV SEQUENCE: DAY.  As expected we see the de-saturated
    signature look of the killer's vision.  The Wearer is
    walking through the courtyard of Lenny's apartment
    building.  We recognize it by the unkempt pool, the sunken
    deck furniture.  We walk through a breezeway to an ally-
    like courtyard behind the building.  We approach a door...
    the back door to Lenny's apartment.

    The killer picks the lock on the back door.  Opens the
    door and enters.  The apartment is dark, blacked out.  We
    are in the kitchen.  We stop and listen.  Water dripping
    in the sink.  Soft snoring from the living room.

    Moving to the other room.  Slowly, silently.  Furtively
    looking around the door frame to the living room.  There
    is Lenny, crashed out on the couch.

    Now moving stealthily toward him.  Kneeling down beside
    him.  Lenny, burned out from the night before, is deep
    under.  Our hand comes into view, holding the yellow
    plastic razor knife.  With his thumb, the killer extends
    the blade... click, click, click, click.

    The blade flashes in a beam of sunlight as it moves toward
    Lenny.  The killer lays it gently against Lenny's throat.
    Draws it slowly across... not leaving a mark.

    The POV backs away and -- static as the tape ends.

    LENNY, IN THE PRESENT, whips off the trodes, freaking.  He
    feels around his throat with one hand... can't feel
    anything.

    Crossing quickly to a mirror near the front door, he
    inspects his neck minutely.  There is a hair-line red line
    over his carotid.  He looks around the room wildly, his
    heart hammering.  Slowly, he gets his breathing under
    control.

    Then... he hears something in the kitchen.  A tiny click.

    His eyes go wide.  Hyperventilating, Lenny moves silently
    into the bedroom.  He fishes around under the bed and
    pulls out a GLOCK 22 .45 auto pistol.  He stalks silently
    toward the kitchen.

    Then he looks at the butt of the pistol-grip: no magazine.
    He un-stalks back to the bed and finds a loaded magazine
    under a bunch of dirty socks.  He inserts it quietly,
    wincing as he chambers a round.

    Heart thudding, he works his way to the kitchen door.  He
    edges around the frame, pie-ing the room.  Cop reflexes
    intact.

    Mace is sitting at the kitchen table, giving him a funny
    look.  She is drinking a cup of coffee, made from the
    bottle of instant on the counter.  She is dressed
    casually, in bicycle pants, work boots and oversized nylon
    jacket over a tank-top.

                             MACE
              Whatup Lenny?

                             LENNY
                      (hands shaking)
              Jesus, Mace!

    INT.  LENNY'S APARTMENT

    A little later.  As Lenny tosses stuff into a folding bag:
    clothes, a playback deck, a box of .45 hollow points.  He
    grabs his grimy old Second Chance body armor from the LAPD
    and stuffs it into his Haliburton.  When Mace sees him do
    that, she knows things are freaky.

                             MACE
              Where we going?

                             LENNY
              Anywhere.
                      (finger to his lips)
              We'll talk about it in the car.

    Mace glances around... unnerved by the possibility of
    audio surveillance.

                             LENNY
              Hand me that box of tapes, will you?

    He's pointing to a shoe box full of "Faith" tapes.  Mace
    hands them over with obvious distaste.  He throws them in
    the bag, starts to zip it...

    ... then sees his reflection in the bedroom mirror:
    something's the matter.

                             MACE
              What is it?

                             LENNY
              This tie doesn't go with blue!

    He yanks off the tie and grabs another.

    INT./ EXT.  MACE'S LIMO AND STREET - DAY

    Mace and Lenny drive through the streets of LA on the last
    day of this millennium.  There are cops in body armor and
    helmets on some street corners, holding automatic rifles.
    Helicopters orbit endlessly.  And a National Guard tank
    rumbles down the street.  State of siege.  The car radio
    is on, with KROQ's poor Man hyping the impending
    Millennium LA party.

                             POOR MAN
              ... the New Years Eve mega-bash of
              the century.  Ten square blocks of
              madness, with live music, fireworks
              and the actual rich and famous of LA
              hobnobbing with us peons.  Also
              yours truly the Poor Man will be
              there at the KROQ bandshell, giving
              away "Millennium LA" and "KROQ 2-K"
              T-shirts by the truckload--

    Lenny is keyed up and tense.  He keeps looking out the
    back window.

                             MACE
              Will you relax.  There's nobody back
              there.

                             LENNY
              Mace, the guy had a knife.  To my
              throat.  In my living room.
              Relaxing might be right out, okay?!

                             MACE
              You better keep a low profile for a
              while.

                             LENNY
              No shit.  You got someplace in mind?

    EXT.  BACKYARD/MACE'S HOUSE - DAY

    On Zander, face lighting up, giving Lenny a high five.
    Lenny drops his bag, shakes, does a little silly hand
    choreography -- a goof on a bro grip -- that makes Zander
    laugh.  Mace watches this ritual and smiles herself.
    Zander can call out a part of Lenny that Mace would like
    to see more of.

    Cecile is there, hanging out with her boyfriend CURTIS,
    and Curtis' friend VEJ.  These two guys are about 18,
    dressed in gangsta garb.  They are listening to "The
    Prophets of Rage" on a CD player, and watch Lenny with a
    dispassion that flirts with distaste.

                             ZANDER
              What do you got?

                             LENNY

                      (seeing the tape)
              Lenny, have you lost it completely?

                             LENNY
              Easy, there, Mom.  Easy.  This is
              audio only.
                      (hands tape to

              John Coltrane.  "A Love Supreme."
              Give it a listen, let me know what
              you think, maybe you won't go for it
              now, but it'll get in your head and
              grow like a seed into something
              really beautiful.

                             ZANDER
              Let's play it now!

                             LENNY
              Later.  Your mom'n I are heading
              right back out.

    Groans of outrage and protestations of unfairness from
    Cecile, Vej and Curtis follow this bad news.  Cecile even
    musters the gumption to speak up.

                             CECILE
              Hey, come on, I been baby-sitting a
              full 24 hours, I have to get ready
              for the party tonight...

                             MACE
              Cecile.

    Mace frosts her with a look.  You don't mess with Mace.

                      (to a disappointed
                       Zander)
              You're not the only little boy I
              have to look out for, honey.

    Zander nods: OK.  Lenny gives him the grip.  Zander's hand
    outmaneuvers his, and the boy smiles in triumph.

    what he's seen.

                             TICK

              Well... the guy's fucked up.

                             MACE
              We know that, Tick.

                             TICK
              No, I mean the killer's got some
              kind of distortion in his visual
              cortex.  The color and gray-scale
              values are all messed up, like color
              blindness.

    He gives the tape a fast run through his processing
    equipment.

              Lookit, you see the peak period

                      (shaking his head)

    EXT.  SAN PEDRO IMPOUND YARD - DUSK

    6:05  P.M.

    The last night of this millennium is falling.  Mace's limo
    pulls to the curb.  The yard is located in the vast no-
    man's land of storage lots, cranes and warehouses near
    harbor piers.  The impound office is locked.  Closed for
    New Years Eve.

    CUT TO Lenny and Mace cutting the chain off the gate with
    the long-handled bolt-cutters.  They enter the yard.  Mace
    is carrying a blunt object that looks like a ray-gun.  A
    TAZER.

    Right on cue a huge Rottweiller bounds out of the shadows
    at them, growling, its head low on an attack run.  Mace
    fires and the tazer lights up the with 120,000 volts (low
    amperage, not lethal).  It whines and flips over twice,
    then runs off behind some parked cars.

                             LENNY
              That's a handy little attitude
              adjuster.
                      (sees his car)
              Damn.  I'm boxed in.

    Lenny and Mace approach his BMW, blocked in by ten other
    cars, so he's not getting it back this trip.  He unlocks
    the door and looks inside with a tiny Mag-Lite while Mace
    covers them with the tazer.  A puppy-like whine comes
    occasionally from behind some cars nearby.  We catch a
    glimpse of the puzzled, snuffling Rottweiller eyeing them
    warily.

    Lenny finds the tape on the floormat, passenger side,
    still wrapped in the note.  He reads the note: "HELP ME.
    IRIS."

                             MACE
              What's it say?

    He crumples the note.

                             LENNY
              Nothing.  Let's go play this back.

    CUT TO LENNY AND MACE returning to the limo.  As they
    reach the car they are hit by two flashlight beams.  It is
    the two cops, SPREG AND ENGELMAN, out of uniform, but
    looking very serious with their pistols aimed at Lenny and
    Mace.  They have been following Lenny, knowing sooner or
    later he would lead them to the tape.

                             SPREG
              Give me the tape.  Right now.

                             LENNY
              What tape?  I'm just trying to get
              my car back but the place is
              closed--

                             SPREG
              Shut the fuck up Nero.

    Engelman grabs a fist-full of hair at the top of Mace's
    head and jams his 9mm into the back of her skull.

                             MACE
                      (cool and even)
              Lenny, give them the tape.

                             LENNY
              It's in my case.  Okay?  I'm going
              to open my case...

                             ENGELMAN
              Facing us, where we can see it.

    Lenny slowly opens the Haliburton.  He takes out the tape
    and holds it out toward Spreg.

                             LENNY
              Take it and turn her loose.  Okay?

                             SPREG
              Absolutely.

    And you see in his eyes that it isn't going to go that
    way.  Spreg edges forward and takes the tape.  Then he
    points his pistol at Lenny's head, about to fire--

    Which is when the pissed-off Rottweiller shoots through
    the open gate like a black torpedo and tears into
    Engelman's leg.  Engelman screams in pain.  Mace twists
    out of his grip.  Engelman shoots the dog.

    Lenny swings up his Haliburton, using it as a shield, and
    dives for the car.  The case takes three rounds from
    Spreg's 9mm before Lenny gets behind cover.

    Mace just seems to vanish.  She reappears over the trunk
    of the limo and puts two rounds squarely into Spreg's
    chest, knocking him down.  Lenny and Mace scramble into
    the car, starting it up.

    Spreg sits up, pulling up his shirt to make sure his body
    armor stopped the slugs.  No blood.  He comes up firing.
    He and Engelman empty their magazines at the limo as it
    pulls away.  No damage.  They realize the limo is a bullet
    proof security model and run to their pickup truck, parked
    nearby, to give chase.

    Spreg's face is a mask of rage.  He slams the truck in
    gear and accelerates after the limo before Engelman even
    has the door closed.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT./ EXT.  LIMO AND SAN PEDRO STREET - NIGHT

    Mace has the big car floored.  She looks in the rear-view
    as the truck gains on them.  Mace is doing her thing...
    what she's trained for.  Security driving.  She whips some
    moves in the big car, but the truck is closing on them.

                             LENNY
                      (holding on)
              Oh no, we're not being followed,
              Lenny, Don't be so paranoid, Lenny.

    They hear rounds hitting the car, and look back.  The
    truck is right behind them.

                             LENNY
              Shit!

                             MACE
              Take it easy.  The glass is bullet
              resistant.

                             LENNY
              Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened
              to bullet proof?

                             MACE
              Lenny.  Calm down.  This is what I
              do.

    THE LIMO slides broadly through a turn, side slamming a
    parked van.  Mace accelerates.  The truck stays with them.

    Engelman is leaning out the passenger side window with an
    AK-47 assault rifle.  He rips off several burst which
    riddle the limo, cracking the glass in starburst patterns.
    The Lexan-laminated windows are cracked to hell, but the
    rounds don't come all the way through.

    Spreg's truck comes alongside, ramming them.  The impact
    drives them sideways.  Mace swerves to miss a light-
    standard and finds herself roaring between warehouse
    buildings which front the harbor.

    The truck stays right with them.  Engelman fires bursts at
    the tires, shredding them off the rims.  The limo thunders
    along on steel rims, throwing rooster-tails of orange
    sparks.

    Mace finds herself boxed in by the buildings.  No way to
    turn.  Ahead is a short concrete pier.  She hits the
    brakes and the limo skids on its rims out onto the pier,
    stopping before it reaches the end.

    They are trapped.

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  SAN PEDRO PIER - NIGHT

    Engelman and Spreg jump out of the truck, taking cover
    behind it.  They rake the limo with bursts from their AK-
    47s.

    INSIDE THE CAR.  Lenny and Mace keep their heads down
    below the door frame.  It sounds like they are inside a
    steel drum in some psychotic Calypso band.  But the
    armored body panels hold.

    Lenny is punching his cellular.

                             LENNY
              Goddamnit!!  911 is busy!

                             MACE
              It's okay, Lenny
                      (he looks at her
                       hopefully)
              They'd never get here in time
              anyway.

    Mace has reloaded her Sig and is trying to open the door
    on her side (away from the bad guys).  It is jammed from
    the sideswiping.

    Spreg reaches into the bed of the truck and pulls out a
    gallon gas can.  He uncaps it and throws it across the
    pavement.  It slides under the limo, glugging its contents
    onto the ground.  Spreg grabs a road-flare from under the
    seat of the truck and strikes the cap, lighting it.

    He tosses the flare under the limo...

    KA-WHOOMPH!!  The gas can explodes in a fireball.  The
    Continental is engulfed in flames.  From the inside all
    Lenny and Mace can see is fire.  All the windows are
    covered in roaring flames.

                             MACE
                      (matter-of-fact)
              This is bad.

                             LENNY
              The gas tank's going to go any
              second!

    Mace slams the car into gear and floors it.  The powerful
    Lincoln thunders forward.  It crashes through a chain-link
    fence and launches right off the end of the pier.  A
    fireball plunging in a meteoric arc into the oily black
    water.

    Inside, they are slammed forward by the impact.  The car
    sinks.

    UNDERWATER: The car hits bottom, twenty feet down, sitting
    there amid the junk.  Shafts of light play down from the
    big streetlights at the end of the pier.

    INSIDE, Lenny and Mace are in a flooding black tomb.

                             LENNY
              Are you out of your fucking mind?!

                             MACE
              Fire's out, isn't it?

    She scrambles into the back seat.  She wrenches at the
    rear seatback, pulls it free... and crawls half-into the
    huge trunk.  Water is up around their legs.  She grabs her
    shotgun: a sawed-off ten-gauge.

                             MACE
              Get in here.  Come on Lenny, move
              it.  MOVE!!

    Mace yanks him toward her and he tumbles in.

                             MACE
              Get ready to hold your breath.

    She aims the ten-gauge at the trunk latch mechanism.

                             MACE
              Lenny, kick out hard, then just
              follow me. Okay?

    He nods.  BLAM!!  She blows the trunk latch into shrapnel.
    The trunk lid belches open in a whoosh of bubbles.  Lenny
    and Mace kick out, heading toward the lights of the pier.

    ON THE SURFACE: Mace breaks the surface slowly alongside
    the slimy concrete wall.  Lenny comes up beside her,
    spluttering.  Her hand goes over his mouth.  They are in
    the inky shadows under a massive bumper made of rail-road
    ties.

    Engelman and Spreg are standing above them, scanning the
    black water over the barrels of their AKs.

                             SPREG
              Let's get out of here.

    They run back to the truck and high-tail it out of there.

    Down below, Lenny and Mace are clinging to the pier,
    chest-deep in the water.  They hear the truck pulling
    away.  They let out a big exhalations of relief.

    CUT TO LENNY AND MACE walking on the pier, shoes
    squishing.  They leave a shiny trail behind them.

                             MACE
              I can't believe we had to give them
              the damn tape.

                             LENNY
              Yeah, me neither.  It was one of my
              favorites.  Me and Faith in a hot
              tub on my birthday.  I'm going to
              really miss it.

    He feels around in his jacket pocket.  He pulls out the
    MYSTERY TAPE... nice and dry in its plastic case.  He
    holds it up to show a grinning Mace.

                             LENNY
              Are we impressed yet?

                                                CUT TO:

    INT./ EXT.  FREEWAY AND CURTIS' CAR - NIGHT

    7:45  P.M.

    Lenny and Mace, still wet, riding in the back seat of
    Curtis' car.

                             CURTIS
                      (pissed)
              I got better things to do on New
              Year's Eve than be some kinda damn
              chauffeur...

                             MACE
              Hey Curtis?  Just drive.

    Curtis swears.  But he shuts up and drives.

                             LENNY
              Those two guys were cops.

                             MACE
              You sure?

                             LENNY
              It's the walk.  Something.  Anyway,
              they'll run your plates and get your
              address.  We gotta keep moving.

    Mace takes it in.  She nods.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  MACE'S HOUSE

    Mace comes in the front door and walks straight to the TV,
    switching it off.  Zander and Cecile are shocked.

                             CECILE
              Lornette, girl... what's going on?

    Lenny goes past them and starts grabbing his stuff...
    wardrobe bag, playback gear.

                             MACE
                      (to Zander)
              We're going to aunt Cecile's, honey.
              We're going to watch fireworks from
              there.  Let's go.  Chop chop.

                             ZANDER
              Aw, Mom!

                             LENNY
              Come on Zander.  You can ride on my
              shoulders.  Here you go.

    Lenny hoists him overhead and goes out the door.  Cecile
    catches up to Mace in the hall, just as she is opening a
    locked cabinet and pulling out a little .380 auto, holster
    and ammo.

                             MACE
              Cecile, get in the car.  Now.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT./ EXT.  STREET AND CIVIC - NIGHT

    Sirens pierce the night.  Two pillars of fire are visible
    blocks away.  There are dark crowds of people everywhere.
    People on the sidewalks, lighting fireworks.  There are
    flashes and explosions.  It could be a celebration, or a
    war zone.  Maybe both.  Or one about to turn into the
    other.

    Mace is driving, scanning the streets.  She has her .380
    auto in her hand, resting in her lap.  Lenny is riding
    shotgun, while Curtis, Cecile and Zander are in the back
    seat.

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  CECILE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

    It is gang territory pure and simple.  Blacks and
    Hispanics.  Graffiti everywhere.  Burned-out buildings.
    Lenny sees abject poverty, here.  Even so, people are
    partying.

    They pull up to the front of Cecile's apartment building
    and get out.

    There are some homeboys chillin' on the front steps who
    give Mace the local hand-sign.  She returns the sign
    automatically as she carries Zander past them.

                             ONE OF THE BOYS
              Yo, Mace.  Whatup wit you, homegirl?
              You never come roun' here no more.

    Lenny follows with his wardrobe bag.  The homeboys give
    Lenny the eye as he brushes past them.  Mace chills them
    with a glare.

                             MACE
              He's with me.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  CECILE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

    A small and dingy place.  Cecile has done her best to make
    it a home.

    Mace and Lenny go into the kitchen and shut the door.

    He quickly sets up his playback deck on the table.  He
    puts on the trodes and pulls the tape out of his pocket.
    Then he pauses, looking at it apprehensively... knowing
    that it contains the answer to all this madness.

    He puts it into the deck.  The deck closes.  He punches
    PLAY.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  APARTMENT/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

    Mace watches Zander lighting bottle rockets with Curtis on
    the balcony of the apartment... visible through the
    window.  Staccato fireworks nearby sound like automatic
    weapons, making her flinch.  She goes back into the...

    KITCHEN.  Where she sees Lenny sitting at the table,
    trodes in his hands.  Stunned.  Face the color of old
    cement.  Hands shaking.

                             MACE
              Tell me.

                             LENNY
              I can't tell you.  You've got to
              see.

                             MACE
              Uh unh.  I won't do it.

                             LENNY
              Mace.  I know what you think about
              the wire.  But I'm asking you to do
              this.  It's that important.

    Mace sees how serious he is.  She nods: OK.  He puts the
    trodes on her.

                             LENNY
              Sorry this has to be your first
              playback.

    He hits play and Mace reacts as the sensory input hits
    her.  She opens her eyes...

                             LENNY
              Keep your eyes closed, or you'll see
              double.

    She bites her lip as the sensation of being another person
    floods through her.

    POV SEQUENCE: We are Iris.  Riding in a car.  Fixing our
    makeup in a mirror on the passenger side sun visor.  Iris
    flips the sun visor back up, revealing the moving street.
    It is night.

    We look down, and recognize the dress Iris was wearing
    when we first saw her, two nights ago.  She puts her
    lipstick into a purse which is belted to her waist.  Iris
    turns her head and we see the driver.

    It is JERIKO ONE.  He is laughing, talking to someone in
    the back seat.  Iris looks and we see REPLAY, Jeriko's
    sideman, and another woman, DIAMANDA.  They are amorously
    entwined.  Then they are all laughing and passing around a
    bottle of Jim Beam.  The car stereo is thumping loudly.

    Iris' POV swings around and looks down, seeing Jeriko's
    hand caressing her thigh.  She puts her hand on his chest
    and leans close to him.  Jeriko grins, then looks up and
    swears at a wash of red/blue cop flash.

                             JERIKO
              Shit.  Fuckin' Five-O

    Our POV swings to the rear-view mirror and we see an LAPD
    car behind us, with the gumball machine on.  A spotlight
    hits us and we hear a single whoop on the siren.  Jeriko
    pulls over, but they are on an overpass... no shoulder.

                             COP VOICE
                      (on bullhorn)
              Go to the bottom of the ramp.

    Jeriko and Replay are both swearing.  He pulls the car
    down the ramp, stopping on a deserted street in a
    warehouse district.  Our POV looks around nervously.
    Black shadows and concrete pillars.  No-one around.  Cars
    whoosh by on the bridge above but they might as well be on
    Mars.  The car is stopped next to a train yard.  We hear
    the rumble of diesels nearby, the clank of freightcars.

    We see the outlines of TWO COPS advancing through the beam
    of the spotlight, their guns drawn.

                             JERIKO
                      (jumping out of the
                       car)
              Goddamn, now what you pull me over
              for?  If I was going any slower I'd
              be parked--

                             COP VOICE 1
              Get down on your knees and put your
              hands on your head.  Now!

                             COP VOICE 2
              Everyone else, out of the car and
              down on the ground.

    Our POV comes up and out of the car.  Jeriko is
    righteously pissed off.  He's not following orders.

                             COP VOICE 1
              Put your hands behind your head
              right now!

    He goes along, madder than ever.  The cops get Replay down
    on his knees as well, in the wet gutter next to the curb.

    The cops are closer now.  We see that they are SPREG and
    ENGELMAN.

                             ENGELMAN
                      (to us)
              Put your hands on the hood of the
              car and don't move.

    We exchange a look with Diamanda.  Fucking cops.  But
    Jeriko is winding them up.  Not giving them the pleasure
    of the humiliation.  You can see it escalating.

                             JERIKO
              I suppose you stopped us cause you
              had suspects fitting our description
              in the area, what you're gonna tell
              me.  What was the description?  Two
              black males in a car?  Yeah, right,
              I heard that one before...

    As Engelman pulls out Jeriko's wallet, looks at his ID,
    Jeriko checks name tags.

                             JERIKO
              Well you stopped the wrong black
              male tonight officer... what is it?
              Spreg.  Officer Spreg.  Cause I'm
              the 800 pound gorilla in your mist,
              fucker.  I make more in a day than
              you make in a year, and my lawyers
              love to spend my money dragging
              sorry-ass Aryan robocops like you
              into court.  Get a man down on the
              ground with no probable cause.  Fuck
              you!

                             SPREG
              Shut the fuck up!

    He kicks Jeriko down on his face.  Jeriko hits the ground
    hard.

                             DIAMANDA
                      (yelling)
              Leave the fuck off of us, we weren't
              doing anything...

                             SPREG
              Shut up!  Don't make me walk over
              there.

    Engelman shows the ID to Spreg, saying something we can't
    hear.

                             SPREG
              You're that rap puke?  Jeriko One?
              You're the one getting all the
              gangbangers to form citizens groups
              and go downtown... trying to rake
              the LAPD over a cheese grater?

                             JERIKO
              That's right.  And you're gonna be
              in my next song, motherfucker, it's
              called Robo-Spreg.

    Replay starts laughing.  Diamanda stifles a giggle.  Spreg
    is white-lipped with rage.  Years of frustration coming to
    a head.  Too many disciplinary actions, too many
    suspensions, too little appreciation of the tough job they
    do.

                             JERIKO
              It's a song about a cop who meets
              his worst nightmare, a nigger with
              enough political juice to crush his
              ass like a stink bug.  You're gonna
              be famous.

    Spreg looks around the empty street.  Looks at Engelman.
    Down at Jeriko, proned out on the pavement.  Replay's
    laughter in his ears.

                             SPREG
              I don't think so.

    And shoots him BLAM!  BLAM!  Twice in the back of the
    head.  Just like that.

    Diamanda screams.  Replay tries to roll to his feet.
    Spreg shoots him twice in the stomach.  Replay is
    screaming.  Rolling around, holding his guts.

                             SPREG
                      (shouting)
              Hey... I don't hear you laughing!

    Engelman's yelling something at him we can't hear.  Spreg
    turns, eyes wide with adrenaline.

                             SPREG
              Get the bitches.

    Engelman hesitates and then spins toward us.  Diamanda is
    screaming, backing away from Engelman.  Spreg shoots
    Replay four more times.

    We spin one-eighty and start to run.  Hear shots... BLAM!
    BLAM!  BLAM!  Spin back... to see Diamanda dropping to her
    knees.  Engelman shoots her again.  Then raises his gun
    toward us.

    We spin away.  The world becomes a kinetic blur.  The
    sound of shots.  We see puffs of dust on the ground in
    front of us.  Missed shots.  We tumble over a guardrail
    and roll down an embankment... get up and keep running.

    Train tracks ahead.  Looking back... here come Spreg and
    Engelman down the embankment, overtaking us.  We hear the
    thunder of a train... spinning again to look forward.
    Freight-train doing fifty on the nearest track.  Almost to
    us.

    We leap forward.  Over the track.  The diesel roars past
    behind us.  Looking back... a black wall of moving steel.
    Backing away from it.

    We see Engelman and Spreg crouching down... trying to aim
    through the wheels.  Hear the impotent pop of their guns
    over the roar of the train.

    Turning to run again.  We see a tiny hole appear in a sign
    right in front of us with a metallic SPANG.  Running and
    running.

    Looking back.  No pursuit.  Train still rolling by.  Can't
    see the cops.  Running, running.  Heart pounding and lungs
    heaving.  Sobbing sounds coming from somewhere, seeming to
    fill the night.

    Looking down... one shoe on, one shoe off.  Iris' hand
    takes off the remaining shoe, clutches it to her chest.
    We move forward into the dark train-yard as--

    THE TAPE ENDS.

    And Mace sits stone still.  Shakes.  For a beat.  And
    another.  Then she tears the trodes off and throws them
    across the room, near where Lenny is on the cellular.

                             LENNY
                      (into phone)
              Hang on.  Hang on, Max.
                      (looks at Mace)
              You see?

                             MACE
              I see.
                      (trembling)
              I see the earth opening up and
              swallowing us all.

                             LENNY
              Yeah I know.
                      (into cellular)
              So what do we do?

                                                CUT TO:

    INT./ EXT.  MAX'S CAR - NIGHT

    As Max drives along a crowded downtown street.

                             MAX
                      (into phone)
              Don't talk to anybody.  Anybody.
              You're invisible.  Okay?  Just meet
              me at Tick's in a half hour.  And
              Lenny... don't get pulled over.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  CECILE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

    Lenny pushes "End" on his cellular and looks at Mace.  The
    first-time impact of the Squid experience, and the killing
    of Jeriko, still haunts her.  We've never seen Mace
    scared.  But she looks scared now.

                             LENNY
              We got to make another copy of this.
              Little life insurance.

                             MACE
              You know what this tape could do if it
              gets out.

                             LENNY
                      (tucking Glock in
                       his waistband)
              I've got a good idea, yeah.

                             MACE
              People finding out... seeing... that
              the LAPD just flat out executed
              Jeriko One.  Jesus.  Maybe they
              ought to see.

                             LENNY
              Maybe.  But tonight is probably not
              the best night.  Come on, we're
              rollin'.

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  CECILE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

    Cecile catches them on the steps as they are leaving.

                             CECILE
              Lornette, when you gonna stop laying
              off everything on me?  We had plans
              tonight--

                             MACE
                      (steely)
              Listen to me, little sister.
              There's something going on, and it's
              very big.  Now you've got to take
              care of Zander.  And stay off the
              streets tonight... you hear me on
              this?

    Cecile gets the message.  She nods.

                             MACE
              Curtis.  What about you?  Do we
              understand each other?  You stay
              put.

                             CURTIS
              Yeah.  I'm wit it.

    Mace and Lenny go on down the steps to the car.

                             CURTIS
                      (to Cecile)
              Damn!  She worse than you.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT./ EXT.  CIVIC AND STREET - NIGHT

    Lenny and Mace see helicopters circling as they maneuver
    the dark streets.  Xenon searchlights crisscross the
    rooftops nearby.  They see patrol cars passing on cross-
    streets, lights flashing.  It feels like the entire LAPD
    is looking for them.

    Everywhere in the street there are small crowds, street
    parties in progress.  People drinking and firing bottle
    rockets.  The police watch everything.

                             LENNY
              So, let's see, I've got Tran's
              goons, some squidhead psycho and the
              LAPD all trying to kill me.  Happy
              new year, Lenny.

                             MACE
              Well, look at the plus side.

                             LENNY
              There's a plus side?

                             MACE
              Yeah.  You gave up your hot tub tape
              to save me.  That's real progress
              for you.

                             LENNY
              It was a tough call.

                             MACE
              I still can't square the psycho
              smarts of whoever did Iris with
              those two cops.

                             LENNY
              I don't think those cops did Iris.
              I think whoever Iris was wearing for
              killed her.

                             MACE
              Why?

                             LENNY
              To break the trail.  If those cops
              had gotten hold of her, they would
              have beat it out of her who she was
              wearing for, and then gone after
              them too.  Our killer is running as
              scared as we are.  Which makes him
              really dangerous.  Judging by how
              scared I am.

    They pull up to the checkpoint; Lenny squirrels into the
    seat, hiding in the shadows, as Mace flashes her security
    pass and the cop waves them on.

    Lenny lets his breath out slowly.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  UNDERGROUND GARAGE/TICK'S VAN

    Lenny and Mace pull in with a SQUEAL of brakes and park
    the car.  Sound of rock music -- some kind of refried
    psychedelia -- coming from Tick's van down the ramp.

    Mace and Lenny get out, approaching the van.  Hearing
    tires squeal, they turn to see Max pull up.  He gets out
    wearing an ill-fitting rental tux.  Music louder, echoing
    in the empty garage, even though the van is shut tight.

                             MAX
              Sounds like Tick's already
              celebrating.

                             LENNY
              You may be a little overdressed for
              this party.
                      (Lenny pounds on the
                       van door)
              Yo, Tick!  It's Lenny.  Open up!

    Mace slips out her .380, on alert.

                             LENNY
                      (knocks again, then opens
                       rear van door)
              Tick, I got to talk to you, man...
              oh shit.

    Tick's slumped in the back of the van with playback trodes
    on his head.  He's breathing, but otherwise he's still.
    Near lifeless.  A cyborg after a power outage.  All the
    equipment in the van is trashed.

                             LENNY
                      (as he starts to
                       examine Tick)
              He's been cooked-off

                             MAX
              Is he dead?

                             LENNY
              No.  But his frontal lobes are like
              two runny eggs.  They put an
              amplifier in-line to boost the
              signal till it french-fried his
              brain.

    Mace hits "Off" on the built-in CD player.  The sudden
    silence is creepy.  Lenny gets right in front of Tick's
    eyes, shouting at him, at the top of his lungs.

    TICK'S POV: We see a roaring blizzard of inchoate static.
    Somewhere in the middle of it is a suggestion of Lenny's
    face, almost invisible.  We hear the tiniest ghost of his
    voice, like a radio playing two blocks away.

                             LENNY
              He's totally cut off from the outer
              world.

                             MACE
              How long does it last?
                      (off Lenny's look)
              Oh.

                             MAX
              Those two psycho cops are on a
              slash-and-burn to find the tape and
              cover their tracks.

                             MACE
              This seems a little sophisticated
              for them.  These are not subtle
              guys.

                             MAX
              There's more to this whole thing
              than you think.

                             LENNY
              Whattya mean?

                             MAX
              All I'm saying... you don't know how
              high up the food chain this thing
              goes.  I've heard stuff.

                             LENNY
              What stuff?

                             MAX
              Smoke.  Rumors.  I've heard stuff
              about a death squad.  A group a guys
              loyal to the hardline school.  Guys
              that've had too many years of city
              hall and the review boards and the
              goddamn media pissing down their
              necks, suspending cops right and
              left, tying their hands... while
              outa the other side a their mouths
              these same people're squealing save
              us, save us, do something you
              fucking morons, crime is totally out
              of control.

    Lenny takes this in.  All the fight goes out of him.  This
    is just too overwhelming.

                             LENNY
              Jesus.

                             MAX
              Yeah.  So don't walk near me in
              public, alright.

                             LENNY
              Thanks, buddy.  See... things
              weren't bad enough.  They weren't
              fucking bad enough!

                             MACE
              The only card we have to play is the
              tape.  You know, we get it to the
              media somehow...

                             LENNY
              Yeah, right, blow it open.

                             MAX
                      (interrupting)
              Mace... no disrespect... but you run
              this on the 11 o'clock news, by
              midnight you got the biggest riot in
              history.  They'll see the fucking
              smoke from Canada.

                             LENNY
              Okay... what about Strickland?

                             MAX
              No.  Bad idea.

                             MACE
              Who's Strickland?

                             LENNY
              Deputy Commissioner Palmer
              Strickland.  The sanctimonious prick
              who busted me out.  His ass is so
              tight when he farts only dogs can
              hear it.  I know this guy.  If
              there's one cop who's not dirty
              it's him.

                             MAX
              Listen to me, Lenny... stay away
              from cops.  All cops.  You have no
              way of knowing who you can trust.

    Mace looks from one to the other with a growing expression
    of outrage.

                             MACE
              So you're saying we just pretend is
              didn't happen?  It happened!  The
              LAPD executed one of the most
              important black men in America!  Who
              the fuck are you to bury this?!

                             MAX
              Fine.  Do you want blood running
              waist deep in the storm drains?  The
              gangbangers'll spread like a wave
              through this city and burn it to the
              ground.  And when the fires start
              the street cops'll be capping off at
              anything that moves.  It'll be all-
              out war and you know it.

                             MACE
              Yeah, well maybe it's time for a
              war!

                             MAX
              You really want that on your head?

                             LENNY
              Hey, Max, Mace... whoa... time out.

                             MAX/MACE
                      (together/annoyed)
              What!?

                             LENNY
              Whoever killed Iris did Tick.  It's
              the same sick wirehead shit.  Same
              reason... to burn the trail.  If
              Faith knows anything about this, and
              I think she does, then she's on the
              list.  So... who's driving?

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  RETINAL FETISH/ALLEY - NIGHT

    Roadies are loading out gear through the back doors of the
    club into a van in the alley.  Lenny and Mace ENTER FRAME
    and we follow them between the roadies, going through the
    doors into...


    INT.  RETINAL FETISH

    A grungy black corridor.  The thunder of music gets louder
    with each step as Lenny and Mace walk down the corridor
    with purposeful strides.

    Through chainlink partitions and banks of dark equipment,
    Lenny catches glimpses of the stage.  He can see Faith in
    a blue-white spotlight.  She is a whirling dervish,
    convulsing with the divine madness of her music.  Beyond
    her, beyond the lights, in the gloom... Lenny can just see
    Tran and his entourage.  Dressed in tuxes, they look out
    of place... clearly on their way somewhere else as the
    evening progresses.

    Faith whirls to a stop as the band crashes in a final
    downbeat.  The spotlight goes out and the set is over.

    ON TRAN, clapping.  Watching.

    NEARBY, Max arrives through the crowd, scanning for
    Tran... spotting him.

    BACKSTAGE... FAITH, bathed in sweat, walking along a dark
    corridor backstage.  WE TRACK WITH HER, as she walks
    through the shadows, like a fighter returning from the
    ring, soaked and breathing hard.

    A HAND shoots from a black doorway and covers her mouth,
    pulling her into the shadows.  Terrified for a split
    second... before she recognizes that it is Lenny.  He
    pulls her into the room and closes the door.  It is Tex
    Arcana's VJ control room, full of monitors and constantly
    changing graphic images.  Tex is not there.

                             FAITH
              Lenny!  Jesus!  You scared the Hell
              out of me.

    Faith sees that Mace is standing there, in the shadows,
    waiting.  She turns back to Lenny with a frown.

                             FAITH
              What's going on?

                             LENNY
              Faith, we know about Jeriko.  Iris
              made me a copy of the tape.

                             FAITH
              Oh God, Lenny.  I was trying to keep
              you out of this.

    But she seems relieved now that he knows, now that there
    is someone to talk to.

                             LENNY
              How did it happen?  What was Iris
              doing riding around with Jeriko
              wearing a wire?

                             FAITH
              We should talk alone.

                             LENNY
              No.  Mace is in this.

                             MACE
              Tell us.

                             FAITH
              Tran's gotten obsesses with
              playback, a total wiretrip junkie.
              And he's such a control freak, he's
              been having people followed,
              videotaped... recording his business
              partners' calls.  Wiring up people
              left and right.

    INT.  CLUB/MAIN FLOOR

    Tran looks at his watch and gets up from the table,
    impatient.

                             TRAN
              Let's go get her.  We're late.

    Max shows up suddenly, right in front of him.  Stopping
    him.

                             MAX
              Tran, listen.  I was wondering how
              you want me to work it tonight, down
              at the Bonaventure.  You want me
              downstairs at the party or upstairs
              at the suite?  Where you going to
              be, mostly?

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  TEX'S ROOM

    While Max stalls, Faith talks.

                             FAITH
              Tran and Jeriko weren't getting
              along.  He was afraid Jeriko was
              getting ready to dump him, but he
              wasn't sure, so he started with the
              surveillance.  A couple nights ago
              he wires up Iris and sends her and
              the other girl, Diamanda, over to
              Jeriko's table.

    CUT TO: TWO NIGHTS AGO, Iris, wearing a wig, leaves Tran's
    table with Diamanda and moves toward... a booth in the
    Retinal Fetish where Jeriko One sits with Replay.  Iris
    stands over Jeriko for just a moment.  Then he nods,
    smiles a little, and moves over to make room for her in
    the booth right next to him.

                             FAITH
              That night Iris calls up, freaking.
              She comes over and Tran watches the
              tape.  He just loses it.  He can't
              believe the disaster she's gotten
              him into.  He's terrified the cops
              will beat it out of her who she was
              working for, and come looking for
              him.

    CUT TO: TRAN'S LOFT as a tear-streaked and frantic Iris is
    telling Tran about how the cops tried to kill her (we
    don't hear).  Tran backhands her furiously, his face thin-
    lipped with rage.  She crumples to the floor, sobbing.
    Tran keeps looking at the squid tape in his hand like it's
    poison.

                             LENNY
              Kinda guy you can count on in a
              pinch.

                             MACE
              Why didn't he just go public with
              the tape?  Save himself that way.

    CUT TO: An image of Tran burning the squid tape.  It
    blazes in his hand and he hurls it into the fireplace like
    a venomous snake.

                             FAITH
              The scandal would wipe him out.  If
              it got out that he had his own
              artists under surveillance... he'd
              lose all his other acts.  He'd be
              over.

    Now we see Tran, more composed, comforting Iris.  He wipes
    at her tear-streaked face.  Hands her a wad of bills.

                             FAITH
              So finally he gives Iris some cash
              and tells her to check into the
              hotel under a wrong name till he
              figures out what to do.

                             LENNY
              Yeah... he figured out what to do
              all right.

                             FAITH
              You think Tran killed her?

                             LENNY
              The killer knew right where she was.
              Because he put her there.

                             FAITH
              What a nightmare.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  MAIN FLOOR

    Tran impatiently gestures to Corto.

                             TRAN
              Go get her, Joey.  Stupid bitch.
                      (to Max)
              We'll talk about this later.

    INT.  TEX'S ROOM

    Mace is getting the sixth sense feeling that seconds
    count.

                             MACE
              Come on.  We're out of here.

    Lenny gets close to Faith, taking her face in his hands.

                             LENNY
              Leave here with me, right now.

    Mace sighs heavily, rolls her eyes toward the ceiling.
    Faith considers her options.  Then she smiles at him.

                             FAITH
              Okay, Lenny.  My guardian angel.

    Faith hugs him, and he clutches her.  Mace locks her jaw
    and looks away.  This is hard for her.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  CORRIDOR

    Mace leads the way, with Lenny following, gripping Faith's
    hand like Orpheus leading Eurydice out of Hell.  They push
    through shapes of people in the thundering dark corridor.
    Half-lit, in alcoves, far-gone wireheads loll in semi-
    consciousness.  Faith looks back and sees:

    TRAN'S POSSE rounding a corner... spotting them.  They
    start shoving through the crowd like juggernauts, knocking
    protesting people out of the way.

    Mace, Lenny and Faith break into a run, pounding down the
    corridor.

    Behind them, Duncan leads the charge.  Suddenly TEX ARCANA
    shoots into the hallway, intentionally blocking their path
    with his wheelchair.  Duncan crashes over him, toppling
    the chair, and they both sprawl to the floor.  Vita,
    Beemer and Corto go around the sprawl.

    Tex, like many legless men, has incredibly strong arms.
    Lenny looks back to see him pounding Duncan's head against
    the floor...

                             TEX
              Teach you...
                      (pound)
              to mess with...
                      (pound)
              a helpless cripple!

    Lenny et al reach the main floor of the club where they
    shove through the buffeting crowd amid strobe-flashes and
    a wall of sound.

    Behind them we see Corto and Beemer hurling partiers
    aside, cutting a swath, while Vita moves like a mongoose
    through tall grass.  Mace drops back, going tail-end-
    Charlie... her bodyguard mode kicking in.

    ON LENNY AND FAITH, charging through the jostling crowd,
    Lenny is looking back, then he looks ahead and...

    TRAN is right in front of him.  In the whirling shapes and
    colors of the crowd, he is an island of composure in a
    white tux.  He holds a glass of champagne in one hand, the
    bottle in the other.  In one lightning-fast move he
    uppercuts with the bottle, clipping Lenny under the jaw.
    Faith screams as Lenny staggers.  Tran swings again,
    smashing the bottle over the back of Lenny's head.  Lenny
    sprawls on the floor amid champagne foam and glass.

    Lenny, blood flowing in his eyes, rises blearily to see
    Faith being pulled away by Tran, who has her arm twisted
    viciously behind her back.  They go around a chain-link
    divider and double back, heading for the exit.  Lenny
    staggers to the chainlink, sagging to his knees again as
    Faith passes within a few inches of him.  He slips down
    the chainlink, into unconsciousness, as her image is lost
    in the pounding darkness.

    Mace gets to him through the crowd, and then whirls like a
    cat as the Posse arrives.  She stands guard over him like
    a rabid dog, her .380 auto straightarmed and covering them
    expertly.  Corto eyes her with hatred.  The stitches on
    his nose and the bruised swelling are a reminder of his
    last run-in with her.  He backs off.

                             CORTO
                      (to the others)
              Not here.  Lets go.

    They back off, fading into the crowd... catching up with
    Tran at the exit.

    Mace watches them recede.  Then she bends to Lenny.  Max
    arrives a moment later and they lift him to his feet.

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  RETINAL FETISH/ALLEY - NIGHT

    Max and Mace support a semi-conscious Lenny, hustling him
    to the car.  As they are putting him in the car, TWO LAPD
    OFFICERS come through the crowd, eyeing the bleeding
    Lenny.

                             MAX
              Everything's cool.  Too much to
              drink.

    Lenny picks this moment to slump sideways, falling half
    out of the car.  The squid tape of the Jeriko kill falls
    out of his jacket pocket and clatters to the pavement.
    Mace's eyes go wide.  The boot of one of the cops is
    inches from it.

                             MACE
              Yeah, uh... he slipped on the
              stairs.  We're taking him to
              emergency.
                      (to the nearest cop)
              Excuse me.

    The cop steps back, giving Mace room to push Lenny back up
    in the seat.  She surreptitiously kicks the tape under the
    car, over to the driver's side.

                             COP
              Go to Cedars.  It's closest.

    Mace nods and goes around the car.  Max starts asking them
    questions and the cops turn away, distracted.  She picks
    up the tape and gets in.  Closes the door.  Let's out a
    big breath.

    INT.  PARKING GARAGE/BONAVENTURE HOTEL - NIGHT

    A line of expensive cars waiting to valet park.  Tran's
    limo jumps the line and swoops up parallel to the elevator
    doors.  The posse get out, scowling at the valet who
    swallows his protest.  Tran emerges, helping Faith out
    with a firm grip on her arm which he does not release as
    they head for the elevators.

    They push through a group waiting for an elevator... men
    in tuxes, women in gowns and diamonds.  The elevator opens
    and Tran's entourage sweeps inside.  Beemer and Duncan
    block any civilians from entering.


    INT.  ELEVATOR

    They ride in silence a moment.  Faith is pale, her jaw
    clenching.  Tran has her arm in a tight grip.  There is a
    march-to-the-gallows feel about the moment.

                             FAITH
              Well, I'm certainly in the mood for
              a party.

                             TRAN
                      (to Wade)
              Take her up to the suite.
                      (to Faith)
              Have a glass of champagne... or
              six... I'll be up in a while to help
              you ring in the New Year.

                             FAITH
              I live for the moment.

    The elevator doors open, revealing...


    INT.  FOYER AND BALLROOM

    The heart of the MILLENNIUM L.A. New Year's ball.  A
    glitterati event in full swing.  Red carpet, minicam
    lights and paparazzi.  Limos pulling up outside four deep.
    Movie stars rubbing elbows with politicos, music movers
    and shakers chatting with city hall types.  This is a
    party to celebrate the millennium, sure, but its main
    function is to celebrate the celebrants: if you're here,
    there's no need to be anywhere else.  There is a heavy
    police presence, as well as lots of private security.

    Tran exits the elevator with Vita Minh, Joey Corto and
    Duncan.  They wedge through the crowd, Tran smiling.
    Nodding to people he knows.

    INT.  CECILE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

    Lenny is in a chair in the kitchen, listening to Max on
    the cellular.  He is holding a dish-towel full of ice
    cubes on his scalp.  It is soaked with blood and his
    Armani jacket and silk shirt are spattered.  Mace lifts
    the ice pack to check that the bleeding has stopped.

                             MACE
              You are a pussy-whipped sorry-ass
              motherfucker, you know that?

    She slaps the ice pack back down.

              Owww!!  Take it easy.
                      (to phone)
              Uh huh.  So where are they now?

    TIGHT ON MAX, leaning against a pillar.  He looks over his
    shoulder, around the column.

    MAX'S POV: through a dense throng of glitterati we see
    Tran and his entourage seated at a table, holding court
    with music types and politicos.

                             MAX
              He's got her up in the room, under
              guard.  And he's still working the
              party... acting smooth like nothin's
              nothin'.  So buddy... I say we work
              a trade.

              What do you mean?

                             MAX
              Give him the tape.  See?  It's
              fucking brilliant!  The tape for
              Faith.  I know he'll go for it.  I
              can set it up.

                             LENNY (V.O.)
              This is what we laughingly refer to
              as a plan, right?

                             MAX
              Come on!  If he gives us any shit,
              we kill 'em all.  Whattya say?
                      (same old Max)
              Just get your butt down here.  If
              I'm not at the shindig downstairs
              go to the room.  It's 2203.  You
              writin'?

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  APARTMENT

    On Lenny, at the table.  He dabs his finger in the blood
    on the ice pack and writes the number on the table top.

                             LENNY
              2-2-0-3.  Got it.  Stay on her.

                             MAX (V.O.)
              I intend to.

    Lenny punches END.  Mace looks at the number written in
    blood on the white formica.  Her eyes ratchet up, boring
    into Lenny.  Not noticing, he gets up, still woozy, and
    staggers to his wardrobe bag across the room.

                             LENNY
              Okay, we gotta get over there.
                      (opens the bag)
              Can you borrow a dress from Cecile
              or something--

                             MACE
              I'm not going.

                             LENNY
              Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's
              gonna do her right there unless--

                             MACE
              Lenny... shutup.  Just park your
              mouth and listen.  It's a set-up.
              Think about it!  Why's he been
              sending you tapes?  To freak you,
              get you to rush in without thinking.
              Then they put one in you, put one in
              her, put the gun in your hand...
              crime of passion.  This guy's bent
              enough to think of that.

    Lenny nods, hearing what she is saying.

                             LENNY
              That sounds right.
                      (but it changes
                       nothing)
              I'm going.

    He reaches into his wardrobe bag... pulling out the box of
    "Faith" tapes and setting it aside, then pulling out the
    suit.  Mace's frustration explodes as anger.

    She grabs his shoebox full of tapes.  Holds them up to
    him.

                             MACE
              You gonna get yourself killed for
              this?  This toxic-waste bitch!

    She dumps the box of tapes on the floor.  She starts
    stomping on them with one heel, crunching several into
    junk.

                             LENNY
              What the fuck are you doing?!

    Lenny freaks out and scrambles to pick them up, trying to
    stop her, push her away.  They struggle for a pathetic,
    tragic moment.

    Mace snaps.  She grabs him by the lapels and swings him
    around, slamming him back against a wall.

                             MACE
              Lenny!  This is your life, Lenny!
              Right here.  Right now.  This is
              realtime... not playback.  Real...
              time.  Time to get real.  Understand
              what I'm saying... she doesn't love
              you.  Maybe she did once, I don't
              know, but she doesn't now.  These
              are used emotions.  It's time to
              trade them in.

    Mace's tone becomes more gentle.  We see that her outburst
    is, beneath it all, coming from a place of compassion.

                             MACE
              Lenny, memories were meant to fade.
              They're designed that way for a
              reason.

    Lenny seems to crumple.  He knows he has to let go.  But
    it is so painful.

                             LENNY
              Have you ever been in love with
              somebody who didn't return that
              love?

    Mace gives him a look like, jeez Lenny, are you dumb
    sometimes.

                             MACE
              Yeah.  Lenny.  I have.

                             LENNY
              It didn't stop you from loving them.
              Right?  Or understanding them, or
              being able to forgive them...

                             MACE
              I guess.

                             LENNY
              And it didn't stop you from wanting
              to protect them.  Did it?

                             MACE
              No.  It didn't.

    Lenny's eyes are brimming with tears.  He makes no attempt
    to hide it... doesn't brush them away.

                             LENNY
              I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent
              Crimes... and I saw every known
              depravity.  I was lost, Mace.  In
              outer darkness.  Then I busted this
              strung-out little teeny-hooker.
              When I met Faith she was just
              another runaway giving twenty dollar
              blowjobs to buy crank.  Another lost
              soul.

                             MACE
              You never told me.

                             LENNY
              But she was different.  There was a
              light in her eyes... and she had
              this voice.  It was scary, all that
              pain coming out of that little body.
              Like she could take all the hurt and
              rage of the entire world and lift it
              up to heaven in one voice.  I helped
              her.  And I promised her that I'd
              always be there... to protect her.
                      (long pause)
              See?  It's not about what's in her
              head.  It's what's in mine.  I can't
              let go of the promise.  It's...
              like... it's all I have left.

                             MACE
              No, it's not.

    Mace takes his face in her hands.  She kisses him lightly
    on the cheek, where the tear-track is.

                             MACE
              Come on, Lenny.  Let's go to a
              party.

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  STREET AND BONAVENTURE HOTEL - NIGHT

    11:07  P.M.

    IT IS THE MOTHER OF ALL PARTIES.  IN AN AERIAL SHOT we see
    there must be 100,000 people jamming the closed streets of
    downtown L.A.  Arc lights sweep the sky.  There are two
    outdoor bandstands, with live music pounding.  There are
    lasers, strobe-lights.  People are literally dancing in
    the streets... if they can move at all.  Huge projection
    video screens are set up all over the place.

    LA is connected to other cities all over the world by
    satellite, sharing in the celebration in different time
    zones.  The excitement has been building all evening as
    midnight sweeps across the country toward the West Coast.
    It looks like a U2 concert 10 blocks long: a multimedia
    blow-out.

    Madness in the streets.  And Lenny and Mace are stuck in
    it.  The Civic can't move in the middle of this millennial
    Mardi Gras.  People swarm around, pounding on the Civic as
    they go by, or press their faces against the glass.  It
    may be the party of the century, but it looks like the
    middle of a third world revolution.

                             MACE
              That's it.  Let's bail.

    And she's out of the car, leaving the keys, ignoring the
    protesting horns behind her.  And we see that she's
    wearing a short black cocktail dress.  Lenny comes around
    the car, through the wild crowd.  He's in his other suit.
    Snappy.

    Mace unselfconsciously hikes up her dress and slips her
    .380 auto into a holster velcroed to her leg.  She pulls
    the dress down and you can't see the gun, hidden between
    her upper thighs.

    In fact, it looks like she couldn't be concealing a
    quarter anywhere on her body.  The dress is cut low at the
    top and high at the bottom, showing plenty of muscular
    legs.  High heels doing great things for her calves.  Her
    braids now loose and full, like a mane.

    Lenny glances at Mace and does a double take.  He is
    caught by a sudden realization:

                             LENNY
              Mace... you're a girl.

                             MACE
              Good, Lenny.  I can see why the
              detective gig didn't work out.  Come
              on.

    They push their way through the swirling mass of humanity.
    Mace moving like a wedge, security training coming to the
    fore.  The whole street is vacuum-packed with people.
    Filled with cars deserted in the general euphoria, an
    unparted Red Sea of man and machine.

    They will move through the various strata of society as
    they work their way in to the party's inner sanctum.  It
    is like all of LA, from poorest to richest, compressed
    into a few square blocks.  There are cops everywhere.
    Cops on motorcycles, cops in cars, cops in riot gear.

    Lenny scopes out the security at the front entrance...
    metal detectors, cops... plus you have to have a 500
    dollar-a-plate ticket.

                             LENNY
              Got your ticket?

                             MACE
              No.  They must have sent it to my
              beach house by mistake.

    Lenny motions toward the back of the hotel and Mace
    follows.  They pass a uniformed cop who is standing thirty
    feet away, his back to them.

    REVERSE ANGLE: It is SPREG.  His black eyes scan the
    crowd.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  HOTEL KITCHEN

    ON LENNY AND MACE moving with purpose through the vast
    steaming factory of the kitchen where a thousand dinners
    are being prepared.  They are ignored by the bustling
    staff.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  HOTEL BALLROOM

    Lenny and Mace emerge from a service door into the
    glitterati crowd, heading into the ballroom.

    They scan the room.

                             LENNY
              You see Tran?

                             MACE
              Uh unh.

    Lenny whips out his cellular and recalls Max's number.  He
    hears the phone connect.  It starts to ring.

    LENNY'S POV... as the crowd parts for a moment.  He sees
    PALMER STRICKLAND talking to a city-hall type.  Lenny
    turns away before Strickland sees him.

                             LENNY
                      (to the ringing
                       phone)
              Come on, Max.  Come on, buddy...
                      (two more rings)
              Damnit.

    He looks around now.  Starting to feel the creeping edge
    of panic.  No Tran.  No Max.

                             LENNY
              Alright.  We're going up.

                             MACE
              And do what?  Take on his whole
              posse?

                             LENNY
              I still got one ace to play.  Tran's
              got what I want... and I've got what
              he wants...

    Lenny pulls the Jeriko tape out of his breast-pocket and
    holds it up.  Mace just stares at him completely outraged.

                             MACE
              That's the original.  There are no
              copies.

                             LENNY
                      (not getting it)
              Exactly.  That's why it's a make-
              able deal.

    Mace gets very, very close to Lenny, and her voice drops
    to an odd, cold... lethal-sounding... growl.

                             MACE
              Look.  That tape is a lightning bolt
              from God.  It's worth more than you,
              more than me, more than Faith.  You
              understand?  It can change things.
              Things that need changing before we
              all go off the end of the road.  And
              you do not have the right to use it
              for currency.
                      (Lenny's eyes are
                       wide)
              You go... you go alone.  This is
              where I draw the line.  I care about
              you Lenny... a lot more than you
              know... which makes us both pretty
              stupid.  But you pawn that tape, you
              mean nothing to me.

    Lenny doesn't know what to say.  Tough choice.  He
    clenches his jaw...

    And turns away.  He strides into the crowd, heading for
    the lobby and the elevators.

    ON MACE, watching him go.  Wanting to run and stop him.
    But she's said what there is to say.  She turns away,
    desolate and churning with emotion.  The moment lengthens
    as she wrestles with it.  You see her fury, her sadness...
    and her protective instincts.  Her resolve fails her.
    Ultimately, she must protect him if she can.

                             MACE
              Ah, hell.  Lenny--

    She turns, running toward the lobby.  And...
    BOOM.  Slams into him.  He came back.

    Lenny takes her hand and puts the tape in her palm.
    Closes her fingers on it.

                             LENNY
              See that guy?
                      (pointing)
              The one with the ramrod up his ass.
              That's Strickland.

    Mace follows his look to Strickland, across the room.

                             LENNY
              Take it to him.

                             MACE
              A cop?  You want me to trust a cop?!

                             LENNY
              No.  Trust me.

    He unclips his playback deck from his belt and hands it to
    her.

                             MACE
                      (nodding slowly)
              Oh boy.
                      (she takes a deep
                       breath)
              What if you're wrong?

                             LENNY
              Then we'll be right where we are
              now.

                             MACE
              Yeah, right.  Fucked.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  BONAVENTURE ELEVATOR

    It is a glass-cage scenic elevator, running up the outside
    of the building.  10th floor.  The last passengers step
    out.  When the doors whoosh closed and Lenny's left alone
    there's only the sound of Muzak Christmas carols.  The
    elevator rises, the lights of LA spread out below.  He is
    hyperventilating.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  HOTEL BALLROOM

    Mace threads her way past tables circling a dance floor
    full of dancers and makes her way through celebs air-
    kissing each other.

    But as she gets near Strickland's table, he stands up and
    excuses himself.  He starts toward the men's room.  And
    Mace follows him.

                                                CUT TO:

    INT.  MEN'S ROOM/HOTEL

    A few guys in tuxes tending to themselves.  Strickland
    enters, crossing to a urinal.  He unzips.

    Mace steps up beside him.  Guys behind her looking on,
    slack-jawed.  Mace pays no attention to them.  Strickland,
    stern and flinty-eyed, raises one eyebrow.

                             STRICKLAND
              Yes?

    She puts the playback deck on top of Strickland's urinal.
    He scowls.

                             MACE
              There's a tape in there you need to
              see.  I mean right now.

    While see is looking at Strickland, a young LAPD OFFICER
    comes out of a stall, and goes to the sink.  He glances in
    the mirror at Mace.

                             STRICKLAND
              If it wasn't New Year's Eve, I'd
              arrest you for possession of illegal
              equipment--

                             MACE
                      (interrupting)
              Just look at the tape!  You want to
              know who killed Jeriko One?  Go in
              the stall right now and hit Play.

    The young cop steps up behind her.

                             YOUNG COP
              Sir, is there a problem here?

    Mace turns.  Oh shit.  She backs away from them.

                             MACE
              Damn!  I knew it--

    Strickland motions with his eyes and the cop grabs for
    her.  Mace twists viciously out of his grip, knocks him
    down and vanishes out the door.

    STRICKLAND hefts the recorder, pondering it.  His
    expression is opaque.

    INT.  HALLWAY/BONAVENTURE HOTEL

    Lenny comes out of the elevator.  Standing at the corner,
    where he can watch the elevators and the corridor, is Wade
    Beemer.  Lenny doesn't break stride.  Just walks toward
    Beemer.  He's not afraid anymore.  He's pissed off.
    Beemer moves toward him.

                             LENNY
              Now, Wade, can we talk here, like
              two human beings--

    We think he's starting the usual negotiation.  But when he
    gets in range he lets fly with a line-drive right,
    straight into Beemer's face.  We're talking a John Wayne
    haymaker punch.  He staggers back, surprised and dazed,
    and Lenny knees him right in the gut as hard as he can.

    He drops to his knees, sucking wind.  Lenny draws his
    Glock and puts it behind Beemer's ear, pulling a pair of
    handcuffs off his belt.  Okay, we're starting to believe
    he might have been a cop once.

                             LENNY
              It's not personal.

    INT.  BALLROOM

    Mace, moving fast as she can through the crowd and past
    the tables when...

    ... she's grabbed by DUNCAN.  He gets her in a good tight
    come-along.  Like any good security person, the hold is
    not so obvious that the party around them is disrupted.
    VITA MINH steps up next to her, closing ranks.

    MACE IS WALKED around behind the bandstand.  Joey Corto
    walks up to her, looking mean and smug.

    Mace twists one hand free and snaps it out in a blur.  Her
    open palm breaks Corto's nose with an audible crunch.
    Corto screams and grabs his face.

                             CORTO
              Aw, not the fucking nose!!

    She slams her foot down on Duncan's instep and snaps her
    head back simultaneously in a reverse head-butt.  He keeps
    the hold.  Mace drives her free hand back into the
    approximate position of his nuts.  Even though Duncan
    looks like he bench-presses Buicks, this has the desired
    effect.

    Mace jerks away from him, shoving him back through a
    buffet table.  Vita draws a knife in a lightning move
    but...

    Suddenly Mace is standing there with her dress hiked up
    and her pistol straight-armed, with the muzzle right in
    her face.  Vita says the smartest line of the night.

                             VITA
              Hey, enjoy the party.

    Mace spins and sprints through dumbfounded glitterati, her
    gun innocuously tight to her side.  She spots a red "Exit"
    sign above a fire door and goes through.

    INT.  STAIRWELL AND PENTHOUSE/BONAVENTURE

    Lenny closes the stairwell door, giving us a quick glimpse
    of Beemer handcuffed to the steel railing.  Lenny moves
    down the empty corridor.

    He approaches suite 2203.  The door is ajar.  Always a bad
    sign.

    EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

    Mace finds herself back in the millennium madness, among
    the street crowd who don't even notice her.  She holsters
    the gun and moves away from possible pursuit.  The sky
    explodes with purple light as huge fireworks go off
    overhead.  A crack like thunder follows.  Then more
    flashes.

    The countdown to midnight has begun.  The party is
    building to a crescendo.  It seems to have a surreal,
    nightmarish quality.  She passes a MIME in a clock suit,
    who keeps adjusting the hands closer to midnight.

    INT.  SUITE 2203

    As Lenny enters the suite.  It is very quiet.  Dark.

    Lenny's heart is pounding.  He moves through the luxurious
    suite, gun in the low-ready position.

    Lenny can barely breathe from the tension.  He notices
    that one balcony door is open.  The roar of the crowd
    comes in like the sound of surf from far below.  Fireworks
    explode across the sky, and the cheers sound like distant
    screams of slaughter.

    His feet crunch on broken glass... a shattered champagne
    bottle.  A lamp is knocked over.  He reaches the door to
    the bedroom and looks in.  The room is empty.  The bed is
    unmade, the bedspread and sheet pulled off.  This isn't
    right.  None of this is right.

    EXT.  STREET PARTY/HOTEL

    Mace is scanning warily as she circles the hotel, looking
    for a way back in.  She turns and sees ENGELMAN in the
    crowd, not twenty feet from her.  He is looking right at
    her.  Not recognizing her for a moment.  Then... he
    realizes who she is.

    He starts toward her and Mace pushes people out of the
    way, breaking into a run.  Engelman charges after her,
    pulling out his rover to call Spreg.

    INT.  PENTHOUSE/BONAVENTURE

    Lenny looks back at the living room.  Suddenly he notices
    something on the coffee table.  It is an envelope, with
    NERO hand-printed on it.  He is drawn to it, hypnotically.
    He opens it...

    ... and with a nightmarish sense of destiny a SQUID TAPE
    falls out into his hand.

    EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

    Now both Spreg and Engelman are stalking Mace through the
    crowd.  Spreg catches a glimpse of her running and he
    charges after her, like a bull, with his gun drawn.  He
    hammers through anybody that gets in his way.

    Mace kicks off her high heels and goes flat out, an Indian
    runner.

    Sprinting through the crowd, she sees an apparition ahead
    of her... a guy wearing Death's Head make-up and a black
    shroud, carrying a huge cardboard scythe in one hand and a
    doll (New Year's Baby) in the other.  Death watches her
    pass.

    INT.  PENTHOUSE/BONAVENTURE

    LENNY, moving as if he's in a trance, puts the trodes on
    his head.  TIGHT ON THE PLAY BUTTON as his finger punches
    down.

    IN POV we approach room 2203.  It is the familiar
    monochromatic vision of the killer.  Our hands open the
    door quietly with a keycard.  We enter the suite.

    Some of the lights are on.  We see Faith out on the
    balcony.  Watching the sea of madness below.  She comes
    back in, carrying an empty champagne glass.  She grabs a
    bottle off an end-table and up-ends it.  Empty.  She hurls
    it across the room, and it shatters against the wall.

    We approach her, standing with her back to us.  Closer.
    Only a few feet now.  She whips around, startled.  Gasping
    loudly.  But then... she recognizes the wearer.

                             FAITH
              Oh.  I didn't hear you come in.

    THE RECORDING STOPS, in a blast of static.  Lenny jerks at
    the discontinuity in the input, he is so keyed up.

    THE RECORDING RESTARTS: A new image resolves out of
    static.  Faith is pushed roughly down on the bed.  We
    climb onto the bed, straddling her, and she gasps.  We
    turn her onto her back.

    She has been blindfolded.  The Wearer goes SSSHHH.  A
    warning.  Like the hiss of a snake.  Our hands seize her
    wrists and handcuff them one by one to the iron frame at
    the head of the bed.

    The hands go out of sight and then reappear holding a set
    of trodes.  They are placed on her head... the spidery
    gecko-hand device almost disappearing in her black hair.

    LENNY'S guts have turned to water.  He is shaking his head
    in horror...

                             LENNY
              No, no, no...

    IN POV we see one of our hands come up holding the yellow
    plastic razor knife.  The blade clicks out to its full
    length.

    Our hands reach down and slowly slit her dress open,
    starting between her breasts and going down out of sight.
    She groans, squirming away from the cold knife.  The
    killer's hands open the material, exposing her white body,
    which in his peculiar vision is pure ivory.  The knife
    deftly cuts off her panties.

    We unbuckle our pants and reach for her, grasping her
    hips, pulling her to us.

    ON LENNY, gagging.  Overcome by revulsion and horror,
    mixing obscenely with the pleasure flooding into him from
    the tape.

    BACK TO POV as we pull our belt out of the belt loops of
    our pants and wrap it around Faith's neck.  Faith begins
    to pant in tiny rapid breaths.  We tighten the belt
    slowly.

    LENNY tears the trodes from his head.  He clutches his
    stomach, gasping for breath.  Carrying the playback deck,
    he staggers into the bedroom... to the bed.  He stares
    wildly around the room.

    One whole wall of the bedroom is mirrored.  In the mirror
    he spots a shape, on the floor beyond the bed.  It is
    covered in the bed sheet, but it is clearly a human form,
    propped up against the wall on the far side of the night
    stand.  He missed it in his earlier look from the bedroom
    door.

    Lenny moves around the bed and reaches down to the foot of
    the figure, grasping the edge of the sheet with a
    trembling hand.  With horrified apprehension he pulls on
    the sheet.

    It reveals the head and upper body of... Tran Vo.

    The last thing he expected.  Lenny leans close and sees
    that Tran is breathing shallowly, but his eyes are vacant.
    He looks like Tick did.

    Lenny sits on the bed and puts the trodes back on.  The
    fireworks and screaming outside sound like some
    nightmarish war, like the sound of the world coming to an
    end.  But all Lenny cares about is what's on the tape.  He
    hits PLAY.

    THE POV CONTINUES where it left off.  Faith's body lurches
    with the Wearer's thrusts.  His hand tightens the belt.

    Lenny feels the climax building.

    Faith's body shakes as the killer comes... she cries out
    herself, in pain... or is it?  The killers hand releases
    the belt.  We see Faith gasping for breath and moaning.

    Suddenly the POV whips sideways to the mirrored closet
    doors along one wall.  In the mirror is a reflection of
    the bed and on it Faith.  And on her...

    ... MAX.

    Pants down, her legs pulled up around him.  They are both
    gasping for breath, spent, following their shattering
    orgasms.  He runs his hands over her sweat-slick belly.

    LENNY is stunned beyond his power to imagine.  He does not
    have the strength or the will to stop the tape.

    IN POV Max's hands remove her blindfold.  She looks right
    at us, still gasping with the aftershocks of her pleasure.
    Max's hands undo the handcuffs, freeing her.  She reaches
    for us, her eyes glittering with sated lust.  We slump
    forward onto her, and her face fills the POV.

                             FAITH
              I love you.

    Lenny is reeling with these revelations.  His best friend
    is the killer.  And the woman he loved loves him.  But the
    tape is not over...

    THE POV CONTINUES as Max's eyes whip around in response to
    a sound behind them.  The bedroom door is opening.  Tran
    is standing there, stunned.  Maybe the first time he's
    ever been surprised in his life.  What a way to start.

    Like lightning we are off the bed snatching our .45 from
    the night stand and whipping around... putting the muzzle
    right in Tran's face.  We pull him roughly across the
    room, too stunned to resist.

                             TRAN
              You're going to die, you're both
              going to fucking die.

    We slam him back against the mirror wall and jam the
    muzzle of the gun right in his mouth: a deadly gag.  Using
    the gun we push him down until he is sitting on the floor
    with his back to the mirror.

    Our eyes whip to Faith.  She is freaking out.  We see
    Max's reflection in the mirror as he talks to her, talking
    fast.

                             MAX
              This piece of puke hired me to kill
              you, baby.  Do you believe that?
              Isn't that right, Tran?  You
              pinhead.

                             FAITH
              Oh my God.  I don't believe this is
              happening.

                             MAX
              Believe it.  Now bring me the
              trodes, baby.  Come on, quick.

                             FAITH
              What're you going to do?

    Still in a kind of stupor, she hands him the trodes.  Max
    puts the trodes on Tran's head, then pulls something out
    of his pocket.  It is a booster box.  He plugs it into the
    deck.  He takes the gain control and cranks it all the way
    up.  He's setting up a cook-off.  Tran's eyes go wide when
    he figures that out, starts to splutter.

                             FAITH
              You can't just... kill him.

                             MAX
              I'm not.  Just a little poach job.

                             FAITH
              Jesus.

                             MAX
              Hey, he was going to kill you.  And
              this ratfuck paid to have Iris
              killed, to save his own sorry ass.

    Tran freaks at that point but Max jams the gun deep into
    his throat, up to the trigger guard, choking off his
    words.

                             MAX
              You shut the fuck up, right now,
              I'm gonna pull this fuckin' trigger!

    K-BANG!  Faith shrieks, thinking Max shot him.  But it's
    just the start of the fireworks outside (remember all this
    has already happened relative to Lenny entering the
    suite).

                             MAX
              Look, baby, it's now of never... the
              guy is a known input junkie, so a
              little OD won't surprise anybody.
              It's the only way we can be
              together.  You know it's true.

                             FAITH
              My God.

    We don't know if her reaction is to the horror of what is
    about to happen, or to the realization that she has the
    capacity to let it happen.

                             MAX
              Here's how much I love you, baby.

    She stares, transfixed, as Max reaches for the deck.  He
    punches PLAY.  Max puts his hand over Tran's mouth to
    muffle his screams as the input hits his brain like a
    screaming chainsaw of static from Hell.  The screaming
    outside, the pandemonium, give the moment a special
    madness.

    The POV turns, looking out the window... staring fixedly
    at burst after burst of brilliant fireworks.  Like the
    fireworks inside Tran's head.

    THE TAPE ENDS.

    Lenny takes off the trodes.  He is wrung out, drenched
    with sweat.  We see that there is a figure standing in the
    doorway behind him.  Lenny turns, not surprised to see Max
    there with his .45 aimed at Lenny's chest.  Max's surgical
    gloves look incongruous with his tux.

                             MAX
              Don't make any assumptions about our
              friendship, Lenny.

    Lenny stands up, slowly.

                             LENNY
              No.  I suppose not.  I didn't know
              you were colorblind, Max.

                             MAX
              Only way I could stand your ties.

    Max moves up to him cautiously, and takes the Glock out of
    Lenny's waistband.

                             MAX
              I'll have that.  Glock 22.  Nice.

                             LENNY
              Where's Faith?

                             MAX
              I sent her to the party.  I figured
              I'd wait up here until you killed
              Tran.

                             LENNY
              What makes you think I'm gonna kill
              Tran?

    Max looks out the window at the fireworks.  Waits for a
    flash, knowing that the bang will follow.  Keeping his own
    .45 on Lenny, he aims Lenny's Glock at the catatonic Tran.
    BLAM!  One right into Tran's forehead.  The crack of
    thunder from the fireworks masks the sound.

                             MAX
              You just did.

                             LENNY
              Jesus!

                             MAX
              You know, statistically that's the
              second most common word people say
              right before they die.  Shit being
              number one.

    Max sticks Lenny's Glock in his waistband, keeping his own
    .45 trained on Lenny.  Lenny knows the next bullet is for
    him.  He does what he does best... talk.

                             LENNY
              So... I killed Tran.  Then you ran
              in, being on his payroll, and shot
              me.

                             MAX
              That's pretty much the way it
              happened.

    CUT TO FAITH in the living room, moving silently up to the
    edge of the door frame.  She looks through the crack
    between the door and the jam.  Her POV: Max with the gun
    on Lenny.

                             LENNY
              Wait a minute.  Now I'm remembering.
              I killed Iris too, didn't I?

                             MAX
              That's right.  They'll find the
              original of her snuff clip in your
              apartment.  The one I left for you
              at the club was a copy.

                             LENNY
              Was I a really busy guy?  Did I do
              Tick too?

                             MAX
              You bet.  Did you like it?

    Lenny drops the cutesy role.

                             LENNY
              So why Max... why d'ya have to do
              Iris?  She never hurt anybody.

    CU FAITH, reacting to this.

                             MAX
              Picture it... I feel like I gotta
              share this with somebody.  It's too
              perfect.

                             LENNY
              I won't say anything.

                             MAX
              I know.  So, I'm working for this
              puke, right?  And he says he'll pay
              me quite large to do the hooker.
              But also I gotta do his bitch
              girlfriend cause she knows the whole
              score and she's totally out of
              control.

    Lenny nods.  Starting to see it.

                             MAX
              Only he doesn't know about me and
              Faith.  So I say to myself, if I
              turn the job down, he just gets
              somebody else.  And I lose Faith...
              to coin a phrase.  So to buy time, I
              do the skank.  I still gotta do
              something about Tran... I figure
              it's him or me... but I can't cap
              him without a chump to take the
              fall.  And who better than his
              girlfriend's loser ex-boyfriend... a
              known criminal... who has been seen
              hassling them in public numerous
              times.

                             LENNY
              And who was, regrettably, also your
              best fucking friend.

                             MAX
              No plan is perfect, Lenny.  Hey,
              cheer up.  World's gonna end in ten
              minutes anyway.

                             LENNY
              You must be so pleased, I followed
              your jellybean trail right here,
              like a good little chump.

                             MAX
              You got froggy on me a couple times.

    CUT TO: The Underground Garage, where Tick has been
    cooked-off.  We see Max running his number on Mace and
    Lenny.  Lenny buying it.

                             MAX (V.O.)
              I thought that riff about the Death
              Squad was pretty good.  I hadda keep
              you from bringing the cops into it.

    AND BACK again to REAL TIME.

                             LENNY
              So there never was a death squad.

                             MAX
              Naawww.

                             LENNY
              Just those two loose-cannon cops
              running around covering their butts.

                             MAX
              Yeah.  Pretty zany, huh?  All this
              shit caused by a random traffic
              stop.  Hey... nothing means nothing.
              You know that.  Look around... the
              whole planet's in total chaos.  You
              gotta take what you can, while you
              can.  Cause some shitbird can come
              up and put a fuckin' .22 in the back
              a your head any second.

    CUT TO: A brief, violent flash from the Jeriko tape: Spreg
    shoots Jeriko.

                             LENNY
              How did you hook up with Faith?

                             MAX
              This dink hires me a month ago to
              eyeball her, right?  But Faith knows
              me from you, right, so she comes up
              to me and says, 'Hey Max why you
              following me?' I say, 'I'll buy you
              a drink and explain.' And she says...

                             FAITH
              'So, do you enjoy watching me?'

    Max turns and sees her in the doorway.

                             MAX
              You were supposed to go downstairs,
              baby.

                             FAITH
              I know.  I don't always do exactly
              what I'm told.
                      (she walks slowly
                       toward them)
              So I said, 'Do you enjoy watching
              me?'  And you said -- come on Max.

                             MAX
              I said, 'Yeah.  I'd even do it for
              free.'

                             FAITH
              Uh huh.  And I said, 'That's good,
              because I like the feeling of
              someone watching me.  I acquired
              the taste from Lenny.'

    Lenny looks between Faith and Max, feeling like the
    asshole of the western world.  Faith moves up close to
    Max.  She puts her hands lightly on his shoulders,
    caressing them.  Max grins, realizing she is 100% with
    him.

                             MAX
                      (to Lenny)
              And then she said, 'Since we're
              going to be spending so much time
              together--'

                             FAITH
              'We might as well make the best of
              it.'

                             LENNY
                      (crushed)
              Jesus, Faith.

    Faith runs her hands appreciatively over Max's shoulders
    and arms.  Then, in an eyeblink, she grabs his forearm in
    both hands and deflects the gun.

                             FAITH
              Lenny!!

    Lenny jumps in, wrestling Max for the gun.  Faith pulls
    the Glock out of Max's waistband and throws it across the
    room.

                             MAX
              Fucking bitch!!

    BLAM!  BLAM!  Max fires wildly, trying to hit Lenny, who
    is just barely keeping the muzzle out of his face.  Faith
    grabs Max's hair, trying to pull him away...

    His "hair" comes off in her hands.  A prosthetic wig,
    containing the squid-net array.  Max's head is shaved to a
    Sinead O'Connor stubble.  He looks demonic, grimacing with
    effort as he struggles with Lenny.

    He continues firing.  The shots hit the mirrors.  ANGLES
    of the reflected images of them shattering.  Faith,
    screaming, reflected, her face fragmenting into shards.
    The crystal chandelier shatters, reigning glassy snow on
    them from above.

    Max is stronger and heavier than Lenny, but Lenny has one
    advantage: Max has managed to make him really angry.
    Lenny gives a guttural cry and drives Max backward into
    the doorframe.  They tumble together into the living room,
    falling together over the couch.  Lenny pounds Max's hand
    against the glass coffee table, shattering it.  He forces
    Max's hand along a glass edge, cutting it, and Max drops
    the gun.  Lenny reaches for it, but Max kicks it away a
    split-second before his hand touches it.  It skitters
    under the couch, out of play.

    Max punches Lenny brutally in the face, then in the gut,
    and grabs him with both hands.  He hurls him against the
    wall.  Lenny staggers off the wall into several vicious
    punches from Max.  We feel the tide turning.  Lenny goes
    down to one knee.

    Max pulls out his knife and flicks it open.  Lenny throws
    a lamp.  Max ducks and charges through.  Lenny spins away
    from the downthrust.

    The knife embeds itself in his shoulder blade, sunk into
    the bone.  Lenny punches Max in the throat and jerks away,
    pulling the knife handle out of Max's hand.  Max tackles
    him and they crash together through a sliding glass door
    onto the balcony.  Explosion of flying glass.

    Max pulls a dazed Lenny to his feet and rushes him
    backward toward the railing.  At the last instant, Lenny
    twists with all his strength and spins Max into the
    railing, using his weight against him.  He pushes hard and
    Max topples.

    As he is going over, Max grabs Lenny's tie, pulling him
    over.  Max is dangling 12 stories above the oblivious
    crowd, his entire weight hanging from Lenny's tie.  Lenny
    has one arm and one foot hooked around the railing, and he
    is being strangled by the tie.

    Lenny is starting to black out.  In agony he gropes with
    his free hand to his own shoulder blade, finding the
    handle of the knife.  He jerks it out of himself.  Max
    sees it coming a split second before it happens.

    Lenny slashes the knife across the tie, just above Max's
    hands.

    Max takes the express elevator to Hell.  He hits 12
    stories down, on top of a video truck.

    Lenny stands there panting, bleeding down the back of his
    jacket.  Faith runs to the railing and looks down.  All
    the strength goes out of her legs.  She sags to the floor.
    Fireworks continue to boom across the sky.

    Lenny looks down at her, gazing at the object of his
    quest.  She looks up at him, her wet eyes seemingly at the
    bottom of a deep well from which he cannot save her.

    He turns and walks away.  It's hard.  But he keeps
    walking.

                                                CUT TO:

    EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

    DOWN BELOW, in the madness of the crowd, we move with
    Spreg as he searches for Mace.  He sees her from behind,
    walking near one of the stages.  He moves up behind her,
    aiming his pistol at the back of her head.  She turns
    and...

    ... it isn't Mace.  Another girl in a similar dress.
    Spreg curses and looks around.

    Engelman catches a glimpse of Mace running.  He points to
    her position and Spreg charges after her.  He has his
    baton laid back along his forearm and is clubbing people
    out of the way as he runs.

    Mace sprints barefoot through the crowd, pushing people
    out of her way.  Strobe-lights from the stage and flashes
    from the fireworks give the crowd a nightmarish look.

    Spreg fires at her.  People drop, their screams drowned
    out by the pandemonium.  The gunshots don't register above
    the concussions from the fireworks.  No one notices the
    shootings.  Spreg continues to fire, missing her as people
    block his shots.  Mace won't fire back in the crowd.

    ON SPREG, coming to a stop at the base of a lighting
    tower.  He has lost sight of her.  He starts to reload his
    pistol.  Mace comes up to him silently from behind the
    tower and hammer punches him behind the ear with the butt
    of her pistol.

    Spreg comes around with a roar, slamming the baton across
    her forearm.  Her .380 clatters to the ground.  Mace
    bodyslams him back against the steel tower, smashing her
    palm up under his chin.  His head raps off the metal.
    Mace is like a she-panther.  She rips the baton out of his
    hands and cracks him once across the windpipe.  He drops
    to his knees, gagging and unable to breathe.

    A shot hits the metal space-frame next to her head.  She
    spins to see Engelman, charging toward her.  Before he can
    fire again she drops behind the kneeling, gasping Spreg,
    using him as a human wall.  She clamps an arm around his
    neck, controlling him, and pulls his tazer from his belt.

    She shoots Engelman in the chest from 8 feet.  He
    convulses and drops instantly to the pavement, flopping
    like a fish.  She holds the current on him while she goes
    over and kicks his gun away.

    She takes Engelman's cuffs from his belt.  Spreg glares at
    her through the blood running into his eyes.  She raises
    the baton.

                             MACE
              All the way down!  RIGHT NOW!!

    He slowly drops to the pavement, face down.  Now that
    she's got them both proned out, she quickly handcuffs one
    of Spreg's hands to one of Engelman's.

    The crowd of partiers stares.  Can't believe what they're
    seeing.  Mace takes Spreg's cuffs and attaches his other
    wrist to the base of the tower.  That's when THREE LAPD
    COPS in riot gear burst through the surrounding crowd and
    see a black girl crouching over two of LA's finest with a
    police baton.  The cops advance toward her.

                             MACE
              Wait.  Let me tell you what's going
              on here--

    The nearest shoots her with a tazer.  She spasms and goes
    to her hands and knees.  One of the cops kicks her down.
    She cries out, trying to explain, but she can't get the
    breath as the batons start to fall.  The crowd around them
    watches fascinated, gasping.

    Mace sees another cop arrive and start to uncuff Spreg.

                             MACE
              NO!!  NO!!!

    They crack her with their batons, telling her to stay
    down.  Another one kicks her in the stomach.

    A BLACK KID in the crowd leaps onto one of the kicking
    cops.

    And then they come out of the crowd... one, then three,
    then half a dozen.  Just normal people... black, white,
    Latino people... that can't watch this happen any more.
    They jump the cops, swarming them, wrestling them down.
    It becomes a brawl.

    Then cops are running in from everywhere.  We see the
    trigger point of a full-scale riot.  Cops in full riot-
    gear, with Lexan shields, push the crowd back, clearing a
    space.  A helicopter XENON comes straight down from above,
    like the divine light of God.

    Mace hugs herself, at the center of it, unable to get up.
    Within seconds there are twenty cops there, and more on
    the way, forming a human wall.  They get the crowd settled
    down.

    Through the phalanx of riot cops comes Palmer Strickland
    and several ranking officers.  He surveys the scene.
    Strickland looks down at Mace and then at Spreg and
    Engelman, who are getting to their knees, though still
    handcuffed to each other and the steel tower.  The beat
    extends... Strickland unreadable, face stern as Moses.
    Then...

    He points at the two prone cops.

                             STRICKLAND
                      (to the nearest
                       officers)
              These two are under arrest for
              murder.

    Strickland looks Spreg in the eye and holds up Lenny's
    squid tape.  Spreg and Engelman react, knowing they are
    over.  The helicopter Xenon gives the whole moment an
    otherworldly quality.  Like they are in some celestial
    court of judgment.

                             STRICKLAND
              Get some medical attention for this
              woman.

    Lenny pushes through from behind Strickland.  He runs to
    Mace and kneels next to her.

                             LENNY
              Are you okay?

    A trickle of blood runs down her face.  She nods weakly
    and reaches for him.  They hug, then they both wince in
    pain.  Mace sees the cops running in to arrest Spreg and
    Engelman.  One of them unhooks Spreg from the tower.

                             MACE
              I got 'em, Lenny.

    ENGELMAN LUNGES, grabbing a gun from the holster of the
    closest cop.  He waves them back with it.  Then puts it in
    his mouth and fires.

    He topples against Spreg, spraying him with his spurting
    blood.  Spreg clutches him, lowering him to the ground,
    bathing in his blood.  You see him going insane, right at
    that moment.  His face is suddenly demonic.

    SPREG, the street-monster cop, RISES IN SLOW MOTION.  His
    glare is fixed on Lenny and Mace.  He has Engelman's gun
    in one blood-drenched hand.

    Lifting the dead weight of Engelman by the handcuff, he
    begins to drag the body, lurching toward Mace.  He keeps
    the pistol down along his side.  Spreg exists at the
    center of a circle of cops who don't know what to do.  He
    has a gun so they can't rush him.  But he's a cop, so they
    can't shoot him.  Several officers shout at him to drop
    the weapon.  You barely hear them over the pandemonium of
    the crowd, the helicopter, the fireworks.

                             LENNY
              SHOOT!

    Like a scene from a nightmare the blood-drenched Spreg,
    completely unhinged, lurches toward them.  Engelman's body
    slides over the ground, leaving a snail-track of blood a
    foot wide.

                             SPREG
              YOU FUCKING NIGGER BITCH!!

    He raises Engelman's pistol, points it at her and...

    Lenny throws himself across her, turning his back to take
    the fire, and...

    POW POW POW!  The LAPD executes Spreg in a hail of fire.
    He drops like a sack of cement.

    The smoke clears.  Lenny blinks... realizing he is alive.

    He faints.  Mace shakes him, thinking he is shot.  He
    opens his eyes.

                             LENNY
              Yeah, what?

    CUT TO SEVERAL MINUTES LATER.  Mace and Lenny are being
    escorted through the crowd by Strickland and a number of
    cops who part the rowdy mob before them.

    Lenny and Mace are both limping, bruised, cut up.  Lenny's
    arm is drenched with blood from his shoulder wound.  They
    support each other like two soldiers after a battle.

    Mace sees Faith... FAITH, escorted by a couple of cops,
    passing near them.  She is in handcuffs and her eyes are
    dull.  Mace turns back to Lenny...

                             MACE
              Are we under arrest?

                             LENNY
              Naw.  They just have to ask us a
              few questions... for about six
              hours.

    They pass DEATH, with the (plastic) BABY still in his
    arms.  Life out of Death in the endless continuum.  Lenny
    pushes the scythe out of the way so they can get past.

    They reach a row of police cars and an ambulance.  The EMT
    guys run to Lenny, helping him painfully out of his suit
    jacket.  Strickland motions Mace toward a waiting squad
    car.  Lenny sees...

    The CLOCK MIME, who smiles at him and puts his hands at
    midnight.  We hear a roar passing through the crowd.  A
    huge chanting and cheering, that becomes thunderous as
    everyone begins to shout the countdown to midnight.

                             CROWD
              TEN!  NINE!  EIGHT!...

    Lenny and Mace look around... the wonder of it sinking in.

                             CROWD
              SEVEN!  SIX!  FIVE!...

    Mace and Lenny let it wash over them... the deliverance
    from darkness.

                             CROWD
              FOUR!  THREE!  TWO!  ONE!  HAPPY NEW
              YEAR!

    The exultation of the moment flows through them as the
    people lift their voices in a great cheer.  Balloons are
    released, confetti and streamers fly in a blizzard.
    Couples grab each other and kiss passionately.

                             MACE
                      (grinning)
              Hey, Lenny.  We made it.

                             LENNY
              Yeah.  We did.

    She hugs him.  Then pulls back.  Friends... yes.  And
    always.  But there's that line that she can't cross.  Only
    he can do that.

                             MACE
              Well...
                      (she shrugs)
              Get going.  You're still bleeding.

                             LENNY
              See you downtown.

                             MACE
              Yeah.  See you there.

    TRACKING WITH LENNY as he walks toward the ambulance.
    They open the back door for him.  The walk is
    hallucinatory... with confetti falling like snow, and the
    hysteria of the crowd.  He looks back at Mace as the
    paramedics help him up into the ambulance.  The back doors
    close.

    ON MACE, watching him go.  A cop gently takes her arm,
    opening the squad car door for her.  She turns away, her
    face sad amid the exultation of the crowd.  She gets into
    the back seat.  The door slams.  Strickland gets in next
    to her.  The driver starts the car.  They start to move,
    and...

    There is pounding on the glass, startling her, and...
    The door is wrenched open...
    A hand comes in, grabbing her arm, pulling her out...

    Lenny.  His eyes are full of emotion.
    He grabs her in his arms, fiercely, and kisses her... like
    there's no tomorrow.  She grabs his head and won't let him
    break, even if he wanted to, which he doesn't.

    Strickland, in the car, rolls his eyes and looks at his
    watch.  Reflex.  Because if there's one time you don't
    need a watch, it's...

    12:01  A.M.  JANUARY 1, 2000

    PULL BACK AND UP as Lenny and Mace stay locked together,
    while the cops wait for them, and the world begins again.

                             THE END

                                                   November 30, 2001



    FADE IN:

    ...on a BLACK WAVE - vast, oceanic, and coming right at us.
    BEGIN TITLES.

    The wave is relentless, huge, menacing. We can't tell if this
    is daytime or night because it simply obscures everything -
    noisily. It sucks, it yawns, it roars.

    Then we realize... this massive wave of darkness is actually
    just a RUN-OFF of dirty black WATER alongside the edge of an
    Interstate. We PULL OUT OF IT now...

    ...to find concrete, and garbage, and weeds. END TITLES.

1   EXT. DITCH - OFF THE INTERSTATE - 4:30 A.M.                      1

    Amongst the refuse is a discarded MILK CARTON, resting on its
    back. The carton asks "Have You Seen Me?" above a photographed
    face that's been obscured by grime.

    Yellowing newspaper, old Coke cans, Twinkie wrappers... in
    that bed of untended weeds. A hollow Texas wind blows through
    it all. We stay with the carton...

    Then that hollow wind gains speed... and a deep RUMBLE grows
    in the distance, becoming a ROAR. The yellowed newspaper lifts
    off and whips past us.

    ...as an 18-WHEEL MACK TRUCK blows by, just a blur in the
    corner of our frame, doing 75 in the pre-dawn darkness.

    Then, the truck is gone, and the rush of air dissipates. The
    milk carton, the coke cans... they lie undisturbed.

    A LIGHT RAIN begins to fall... and some of the grime washes
    away from that milk carton, revealing a face. A child. "Have
    You Seen Me?" It's heartbreaking.
    TILT UP... to take in the vast flatness of Texas' I-35:
    concrete forever. In the distance, gray highway yields to
    black STORMCLOUDS gathering silently over endless prairie.

    A vertical vein of LIGHTNING streaks through one of them.

                                                     CUT TO:

    ...a spoon, stirring a cup of coffee.

                                                                 2.


2   INT. "THE ALL-AMERICAN DINER" - GAINESVILLE TEXAS - CONTINUING 2
    (4:30 A.M.)

    HAROLD SPECK sits: mid 40's, pleasant face. A family man.
    Reads "Rod and Reel" magazine. Has a SALESMAN'S CASE by his
    side. Around him is a TRUCK-STOP in twilight:

    Truckers at the counter, Elvis on the wall, a "Drink Bud!"
    mirror. The WORLD SERIES can be heard on a RADIO...

                         DOLLY (O.S.)
               Top that off for ya, Hon?

    That's DOLLY, a waitress, (50, been here too long.) Speck
    looks up, smiles thinly, "No." Dolly heads off. Speck returns
    to his article, underlining a particular passage.

    ...until a MAN seats himself, suddenly, in the seat opposite
    Speck's. Speck reacts, startled.

                          SPECK
               Jesus...

    The MAN's name is O'RYAN. We only see PIECES of him: his eyes,
    his hands, a stain on his parka...

                         O'RYAN
               What's in the case?

                          SPECK
               I'm sorry?

                         O'RYAN
               You're always lugging that case around.
               I'm curious.

    Speck looks around: there are plenty of empty tables in here.
    So why is this guy bothering me???

                         O'RYAN (CONT'D)
               What do you sell?

                         SPECK
               I'm... in restaurant supplies. I didn't
               get your name?

                         O'RYAN
               Must travel a lot, huh?

    Speck is looking for Dolly, a Manager, anyone...

                         O'RYAN (CONT'D)
               Whole country, or just hereabouts?

                                                           3.


                     SPECK
           I don't mean to be rude but--

                     O'RYAN
           How's your wife feel about it?

That spun things a bit. Speck pauses.

                     SPECK
           What?

                     O'RYAN
           She must get lonely, with you gone all
           the time. Does she?

                     SPECK
           Look, I...

                     O'RYAN
           Do you get lonely?

Speck's so thrown now he can't answer.

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           Ya miss fucking her, Harold?

                     SPECK
           Listen, I don't know who you are but you
           can't--

O'Ryan silences him... by holding up a piece of paper. On it
is a DRAWING. The image faces away from us. But Speck can see
it in rich detail. And his eyes go wide.

We catch GLIMPSES: The color of flesh. A body-part. Looks like
a rendering of a young, naked WOMAN.

And, just like that, Speck finds himself STARING. Glued.

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           Did it myself. It's sort of a hobby.
               (no reply)
           I've got more. Would you like to see
           them?

O'Ryan lowers it and slides a SECOND DRAWING over... Speck is
speechless, transfixed. Can't look away.

                      O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           Tell me: those jokes about the traveling
           salesman and the farmer's daughter - are
           they true?
                      (MORE)

                                                            4.


                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
               (Speck remains silent)
           Here. This one's my favorite.

O'Ryan slides over DRAWING #3. Again, we don't get to see it.
And we still haven't seen all of O'Ryan's face.

But we can see Speck, and his reaction. Utter horror. In fact
he recoils so violently that his coffee spills.

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           Really says it all, wouldn't you agree?

                     SPECK
           You're a... You're sick.

                     O'RYAN
           That's a matter of opinion.

                     SPECK
           You're sick!

He rises, leaving the drawings behind. We STAY WITH HIM as he
crosses the diner - deeply unsettled. He reaches the Manager,
(MEL, balding, 50, in no mood) at the register.

                      MEL
           Mmm-hmm?

                     SPECK
           I'm having a problem - with another
           customer. I'd like you to ask him to
           leave, please.

                     MEL
           What kind of problem?

                      SPECK
           He's--

He turns, to point out O'Ryan.

...but the booth, suddenly, is empty. The guy has simply
disappeared, taking those drawings with him.

Speck tightens. Mel eyes him, annoyed.

                                                  CUT TO:

                                                                 5.


3   EXT. ALL-AMERICAN DINER - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER             3

    Speck hurries out to his Buick, checking over his shoulder
    repeatedly. Gets to the car, fumbles with his keys. They fall
    to the asphalt. He grabs them, opens the door.

                                                       CUT TO:

4   INT. SPECK'S CAR - DRIVING - MOMENTS LATER                        4

    Speck guns the Buick. Interstate 35 flies by. The farther he
    gets away from that Diner, the happier he'll be.

    ...until a strange SOUND gets his attention: it's WIND, as if
    whistling through a ghost town. Hollow, varied - building then
    falling off again. Wind.

    Trouble is, the windows in this Buick are up.

    Yet there it is again: a thin, hollow GHOST-TOWN WIND,
    whistling over his shoulder. He's heard it before - in every
    Western he ever watched as a kid.

    But this wind is coming from his back-seat.

    The blood drains right out of Speck's face. Doesn't know if he
    should jam on the brakes or drive faster.

    He looks in his rear-view, catches a glimpse of a LATEX GLOVE
    snapping onto a hand. Dear God: O'Ryan is back there, making
    that odd Ghost-Town wind sound. Whistling.

                          SPECK
                    (sheer terror)
               What-do-you-want?! What-do-you-want-with-
               me?!

    No reply. Instead, another gift appears from the back: a
    FOURTH DRAWING, tossed from the darkness into Speck's lap.

    He looks down, registers the image... and SHRIEKS.

                         O'RYAN (O.S.)
               There's a rest stop, next off-ramp. Pull
               into it.

                         SPECK
               I have some money. It's not a lot but--

                         O'RYAN
               Nobody wants your money, Harold. Just
               pull in.

                                                                 6.


                         SPECK
               Why?!

    O'Ryan rises into frame now, like Nosferatu...

                         O'RYAN
               Because I don't wanna do this at 70 miles
               an hour. It could be dangerous.

    Speck finds the off-ramp. His breaths are shallow now.

                         SPECK
               Please, Mister - what do you want from
               me?

    O'Ryan's face: a knowing grin fans across it...

                                                      CUT TO:

    ...the face of VIRGIL RAY STARKEY, on a bulletin board.

5   INT. F.B.I. RESIDENT AGENCY - WICHITA FALLS - MORNING (SAME       5
    DAY)

    We're looking at the F.B.I.'s "Ten Most-Wanted List." Starkey
    is #7 on it. He's 40, white. His crime are listed as rape,
    murder, kidnapping.

    THOMAS MACKELWAY stares at Starkey's image. At the eyes...

    Mackelway is 34, bred for success - bred for stardom in fact,
    a whiz at everything he's ever attempted.

    So what the hell is he doing in Wichita Falls, Texas...?

    EIGHT AGENTS, in cubicles, with a ring of outer offices. Quiet
    phones, lousy take-out options, hardly a dream gig.

                         CHARLTON (O.S.)
               Got a spot set up for you, Tom.

    That's RICK CHARLTON: late 40's, thinning hair, friendly.
    Charlton heads around a corner. Mackelway follows.

                         CHARLTON (CONT'D)
               Ms. Potter's the nice girl you met at the
               desk. She puts a package together for all
               the new agents, things to know about the
               area, help with finding apartments and
               such. This one's yours:

    Charlton stops at a CUBICLE: Carpeted walls, formica desk. A
    corner of dull Hell. Mackelway eyes it, fighting dread.

                                                                 7.



                         CHARLTON (CONT'D)
               Not so different from Dallas, is it?

                         MACKELWAY
                   (fuck yes)
               No, Sir.

                         CHARLTON
               Good.

    An abandoned SPORTS PAGE tells us about that World Series, so
    we must be mid-October. Charlton heads out. Mackelway throws a
    briefcase on to the desk, setting up his world:

    A framed picture of himself and his BROTHER, ages 10 and 15,
    on a childhood camping trip. Address book, coffee-warmer,
    calendar, a baseball covered with autographs.

    He opens up a drawer, and casually tosses two bottles of
    BUFFERIN into the back of it.

    ...but first grabs four tablets from one of the bottles,
    and throws them down his throat, as:

                         GRIEVES (O.S.)
               Ya like Frito Pies?

    Mackelway turns. BILL GRIEVES stands here, holding a white
    grease-stained paper-bag. Grieves is Mackelway's age, not
    quite as ambitious. But solid, decent.

                         MACKELWAY
               I dunno. What are they?

    Grieves pulls out a greasy concoction that's wrapped up like a
    semi-burrito. Pure Texas. Tosses it to Mackelway:

                         GRIEVES
               Welcome to the minors.

    Grieves passes by with a faint smile, handing out lunch to a
    few other agents. Mackelway eyes the still-wrapped Frito Pie.
    God, get me outta here...

                                                      CUT TO:

6   INT. WICHITA FALLS F.B.I. OFFICE - LATER                          6

    A BRIEF MONTAGE: Mackelway, in his cubicle, watching as THOSE
    OTHER AGENTS take calls, strap on guns, head out on
    assignment. Men in motion.

                                                                 8.


    But Mackelway's land-locked, writing up an Auto-Theft report.
    It's drudgery, but he's meticulous about it, deleting the word
    "beige" and replacing it with "tan."

    His head is throbbing - not an unusual circumstance for him.
    But after lingering for a half-second on that "Most-Wanted
    List" again? Starkey? It's a wound...

7   INT. F.B.I. OFFICE - KITCHENETTE - MOMENTS LATER                  7

    Mackelway struggles with a COFFEE MACHINE that's unfamiliar to
    him. Filter, water, grounds, etc.

                         KATIE (O.S.)
               Here. Lemme do that.

    He turns. This is KATIE POTTER. She's 25, friendly, under-
    challenged by her job. Been here two years. In two seconds
    she's got the thing percolating. Of course.

                         KATIE (CONT'D)
               It takes some experience.

    He shrugs, not feeling too smooth.

                         KATIE (CONT'D)
               You're Mackelway, right?

                          MACKELWAY
               Mmm-hmm.

                         KATIE
               Fax came in for you. It's the room next
               door.

                         MACKELWAY
               Oh. Thanks.

    He rises, heads for the "fax room"...

8   INT. "FAX ROOM" - CONTINUING                                      8

    A former closet, converted into useful space. FIVE FAX
    MACHINES sit on stands, sharing a surge protector. One fax
    machine is printing. Mackelway approaches it.

    Six pieces of paper await him. The first is a TOP-SHEET,
    written by hand: "Attention: Agent Thomas Mackelway, FBI
    Resident Agency - Wichita Falls." No sender named.

    He looks beneath the top sheet - at Page One of the fax.

                                                                 9.


    A young BOY stares back at him, his face photostatically
    copied. Across the top, also-handwritten: "HAVE YOU SEEN ME?"
    At the bottom of the sheet, typed, we read:

    "Jason Corey, Age 14. Ht. 5'1", Wt. 130, Eyes Brn, Hair Brn.
    Last Seen: Riverside, Ca. Date of Disappearance: 10-16-99."

    Mackelway eyes the face, then the vitals. No idea why this was
    sent to him. Then he looks at Page Two.

    A young WOMAN stares back at him this time. Another faxed
    photo. Another "HAVE YOU SEEN ME?" scrawled across the top of
    it. And, at the bottom of the sheet:

    "Anna Casitas, Age 22. Ht. 5'6", Wt. 125, Eyes Brn, Hair Blk.
    Last Seen: Macon, Ga. Date of Disappearance: 5-6-00."

    The other three faxes are more of the same: Pictures and
    vitals. Faces. Facts. "HAVE YOU SEEN ME?"

    He looks at the bottom of the transmissions, finds the fax
    number of the sender. Dials it. All he hears back is the loud
    grainy shriek of a dedicated fax line.

    He eyes the faxes again. It's not alarming, but it's odd. Then
    Charlton emerges from his office, shouting:

                         CHARLTON
               Mackelway! You gonna sit on your ass all
               day, or do you wanna do something?

    Mackelway's out of this room in an instant.

                                                       CUT TO:

9   EXT. REST STOP - OFF THE INTERSTATE - DAY                         9

    Your standard roadside rest-stop: a parking lot with weeds
    poking through it and bathrooms you wouldn't go near. Those
    STORMCLOUDS we saw earlier are CLOSER now...

    POLICE CARS and HIGHWAY PATROL MOTORCYCLES fill this site.
    Charlton's FBI SEDAN pulls up. He and Mackelway get out.

    Two men approach: SHERIFF HARRY DYLAN, 50; and his deputy, BUD
    GRANGER, a gangly, baby-faced pup.

                         DYLAN
               Afternoon, Rick.
                   (Charlton nods)
               Looks like a robbery/homicide. Body's
               over that way.

                                                                 10.


     He gestures toward a ravine, where a TOW TRUCK is currently
     lowering a winch toward an abandoned vehicle.

     It is Harold Speck's Buick, nose-down in the ravine, teetering
     on a rock, like the balanced scales of justice.

                          MACKELWAY
                Ya run the plates?

     Charlton eyes Mackelway: "Easy, Hot-shot." Mackelway nods,
     reminding himself to remember his new rank. Dylan hands a
     preliminary report to Charlton.

                          DYLAN
                Fella's name is Harold Speck. Traveling
                salesman, from Abilene.

     Charlton eyes the report, then hands it to Mackelway. The
     hierarchy is being made clear. Very.

     Mackelway turns: this ravine runs right up against a SIGN that
     reads "Welcome to Texas" on one side and "You are now leaving
     Oklahoma" on the other.

     A vehicle, left right on the state-line. Odd...

     Then, a NOISE: that Tow-Truck WINCH, grinding badly. It's just
     about to yank the Buick out of this ditch.

                          MACKELWAY
                    (it blurts out)
                Hey!

     Before Charlton can react, Mackelway is running across this
     weed-choked lot, zeroing in on the TOW-TRUCK DRIVER.

10   EXT. ATOP THE RAVINE - CONTINUING                                 10

     The Driver, JUMBO, is operating the winch from a hydraulic
     handle on the back of the truck. Mackelway barrels in:

                          MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
                What the fuck're you doing?!

                          JUMBO
                What's it look like, Bud?

     Mackelway reaches past Jumbo and hits the "Stop" button
     himself. The winch shuts down. Mackelway turns. A handful of
     LOCAL COPS stand atop this ravine, watching.

                                                                 11.


                           MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
                You guys ever heard of evidentiary
                procedure?

     No one replies. Charlton approaches. Mackelway tightens,
     expecting a reprimand for overstepping his bounds.

                          MACKWELWAY (CONT'D)
                Sorry, Sir. There wasn't time.

     Charlton eyes the car. Then Mackelway.

                          CHARLTON
                Did the right thing, Agent Mackelway.
                Let's have a look.

     Charlton starts down the embankment. Mackelway doesn't,
     hanging back as he eyes the TRACKS this Buick made before
     tumbling. Something about them...

     He pulls a small CAMERA from his pocket, a Minox. Snaps off a
     few photos of the scene - the Buick, the ravine, those tracks,
     some FOOTPRINTS alongside them.

     Then he heads down the 15-foot embankment.

11   EXT. RAVINE - CONTINUING                                          11

     It's an ugly sight. Speck is inches from us, but his head is
     facing in the other direction, twisted unnaturally.

     Mackelway kneels beside the open window, pulls out some
     gloves, puts them on. He will not lean on the car, or even
     breathe on it, his caution around evidence obvious.

                          CHARLTON (O.S.)
                What's that?

     Charlton is opposite him, outside the passenger-side window,
     pointing at the DRAWING that O'Ryan had tossed onto Speck's
     lap. It lies face down on the seat.

     But something's been FINGER-PAINTED on the back of it: A
     RED CIRCLE, with a SLASH through it.

     Charlton begins to reach for it, when:

                          MACKELWAY
                    (to stop him)
                Sir?

     Charlton stops. Mackelway indicates: "Gloves."

                                                            12.


Charlton eyes him. It's irritating being corrected by a guy
you outrank, especially when he's right.

                     MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
           Sort of a... stickler for procedure.

                     CHARLTON
           I imagine you would be.

That was a jab, but we don't know it yet. Charlton puts on his
gloves. Mackelway snaps off a few more shots with that Minox,
looking over the rest of this car, as:

                     GRANGER
               (aloud)
           Hey Jumbo. Toss me down a crowbar.

Granger's by the trunk. Before Mackelway can comment, Jumbo
has tossed a CROWBAR down from the top of the embankment: a
ten-pound hunk of iron, flying right at us.

Everybody ducks... as it CLANGS on the roof of the Buick.
Jumbo shrugs.

                     JUMBO
           You said toss it.

Mackelway shakes his head. "Shitkicker." Granger grabs the
crowbar. He's just about to open the trunk as:

                     MACKELWAY
           Hold it a second.

Granger pauses. Mackelway crosses to the trunk, and snaps off
a few shots with the Minox.

Something catches his eye, along the line of the TRUNK. He
kneels closer... An odd RESIDUE, crusty and hard, has formed a
thin line on top of the paint in a single post.

He takes out a VIAL, and scrapes some of the residue into it.
Then he sniffs it. Pauses...

                     MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
           Smells like... clove.

He looks to Granger: now you can open the trunk.

                     DYLAN
               (re: Mackelway)
           Where the hell'd you find this guy?

                                                                 13.


                          CHARLTON
                Field Office. Dallas.

                          DYLAN
                    (impressed)
                Well now...
                    (Charlton shrugs)
                So what the hell's he doin' here?

     That one is left unanswered. Granger opens the trunk.
     Mackelway and the others look inside...

     There, they find restaurant supplies: napkin dispensers, salt-
     shakers, ketchup dispensers, a short-order wheel... And a
     fishing reel, tackle-box, a kid's bicycle helmet.

     Mackelway eyes it all, but his instincts tell him there's
     nothing significant here. So he returns to Speck's body.

     He leans in, lifts Speck's head a few inches away from the
     steering wheel. Gently.

     ...which is when we learn that Speck's EYELIDS have been torn
     off. It's gruesome, but Mackelway notes it calmly. Charlton
     leans in, gets a look.

                            CHARLTON
                Christ...

     Mackelway is expressionless. But something about these LIDLESS
     EYES draws him closer. He leans in, then BAM! We are rocketed
     into a series of dark, disjointed images:

12   EXT. A WHEAT FIELD - NIGHT                                        12

     Seems like we're standing in a field of TALL WHEAT; we can't
     say for sure. Everything's wet, wind-whipped.

     A MUZZLE FLASH... Someone just fired a gun. We slump hard to
     the ground. Then we look up.

     Mackelway stands over us, his face wet with rain. Then, just
     as quickly, those IMAGES VANISH and we are:

13   INT. UNIDENTIFIED MOTEL ROOM - GRAHAM TEXAS - DAY                 13

     We start on the EYES OF O'RYAN. Cross-Dissolve to a pad of
     paper, on a DESK. Scrawled on the pad is a WAVY LINE. He holds
     the tip of that pen upon it, for a few seconds, as if
     expecting to get some kind of pulse from it.

     Here come those IMAGES again: wet wheat, a muzzle flash,
     Mackelway. Choppy, disjointed, dark. Then they cease...

                                                                 14.


     ...and O'Ryan begins to DRAW, hurriedly. Only half of his face
     is visible to us, but we can tell that his concentration is
     total.

     His pen continues its furious work, a spasm of activity, as
     the SOUNDS of that vision bleed in: the gun-shot, the rain,
     the wind. They're all alive in O'Ryan's mind...

     And that DRAWING takes shape quickly: The wheat field, the
     gun, Mackelway.

     Then, the pen is set down. The drawing is complete.

     O'Ryan eyes it calmly, then checks his watch, jotting down the
     exact time and date on to the drawing. Then he slips it into a
     folder marked, "MACKELWAY."

                                                       CUT TO:

14   EXT. SPECK'S HOME - ABILENE, TEXAS - ESTAB. DAY                   14

     Picket fence, a swing on the porch, a lawn that needs mowing.
     A LINE OF PEOPLE file in, each bringing food... and tissues to
     cry into.

15   INT. SPECK'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER (DAY)             15

     Shocked faces. Food on unmatching trays. Speck's wife - JAN,
     40 and frayed - sits in a chair, immobile. FRIENDS and FAMILY
     mill about, tending to her.

     KIDS hover. Two of them, a 4-YEAR-OLD BOY and an 8-YEAR-OLD
     GIRL, sniff back tears as people offer condolences.

     But the focus here is Jan - her grief. She's shaking...

                          O'RYAN (O.S.)
                Mrs. Speck?

     She looks up. O'Ryan crouches down, to eye-level, one of fifty
     faces in here. Jan half-nods.

                          O'RYAN (CONT'D)
                Just wanted to offer my condolences.
                    (takes her hand)
                I didn't know him well but... I think
                Harold was a much more complex man than
                people realized.

     Jan is so raw that anything about Speck touches her now.

                                                                  15.


                          JAN
                    (through tears)
                He was, wasn't he?

                          O'RYAN
                I'm very sorry for your loss, ma'am.

     She sniffs back a tear, thanks him with a smile. O'Ryan
     extends his hand to her. She takes it. He moves off.

     Beside her is a FRAMED PORTRAIT of Speck. We blow past it, and
     into the BLACK CREPE that is adorning the corner of the
     portrait's FRAME, and:

     BAM! We're rocketed back into a set of odd IMAGES again:

16   EXT. DARKNESS - UNIDENTIFIED TIME                                  16

     This time, everything before us is a blur of gray. We hear
     that wet wind. We hear our own heavy BREATHING, as if we were
     running somewhere... a VOICE, rising above the wind, seems to
     be saying:

                            (O.S.)
                Please...

     The sound echoes oddly, as if bouncing off a satellite
     somewhere, or a distance of time and space.

     Then the sound and the soupy grayness VANISH. This vision just
     ended. When we pop back out of it, we're TIGHT on Mackelway...

                                                        CUT TO:

17   INT. MACKELWAY'S YUKON - PARKING LOT - GAINESVILLE 10:30 P.M. 17

     Mackelway sits behind the wheel of his Chevy Yukon, parked
     between two big-rigs in the lot of the "All-American Diner."
     Sky looks black tonight. It rumbles...

     And that soupy gray vision we just heard and saw... It was all
     his.

     He pulls four more Bufferins out of a bottle in his pocket.
     Slugs them down. This headache is a constant. Then he gets out
     of the Yukon...

18   INT. ALL-AMERICAN DINER GAINESVILLE - CONTINUING                   18

     Mackelway enters, spots Charlton at a booth - sitting opposite
     a WOMAN, her back to us.

                                                               16.


19   INT. BOOTH - CONTINUING                                         19

     Mackelway approaches. The Woman doesn't turn.

                           CHARLTON
                Agent Mackelway. I was 'bout to introduce
                you, but I understand that won't be
                necessary.

     Mackelway doesn't get it... until the WOMAN turns. She is
     AGENT FRAN KULOK. 35, sharp, pretty when she allows herself to
     be. But with a guard that never comes down.

     Mackelway has some history with her, so he tries not to react.
     It takes some effort.

                          CHARLTON (CONT'D)
                Seems your former office has decided we
                might need some help on this one. So they
                sent out Agent Kulok.

                          FRAN
                Tom.

                          MACKELWAY
                Fran.

     That was terse, from both of them. Charlton takes note.

                          CHARLTON
                I guess we're skipping the tearful
                reunion. Have a seat, Tom.

     Mackelway sits opposite Fran. She folds her hands.

                          MACKELWAY
                How's things back at the ranch?

                          FRAN
                Movin' right along.

     That might've been a dig; Charlton can't tell.

                          CHARLTON
                Okay. Whadda we know?

                          FRAN
                Picked up a foot-print in the back seat
                of Speck's car, size-and-a-half bigger
                than Speck's.

     Just like that, Fran is piping up. Mackelway's unoffended.

                                                         17.


                       CHARLTON
           'Kay.

                     FRAN
           Wounds on Speck's throat indicate that he
           was strangled from behind... I think our
           guy waited for him in the backseat,
           sprung this on him once the car was
           moving.

She slides that FOURTH DRAWING to Charlton - giving us our
first look at it.

INSERT - THE DRAWING:

...a STEAMER-TRUNK, lined with plastic. Inside it are large
ZIPLOC BAGS. Inside the bags are BODY PARTS.

It's realized so accurately that it looks more like a
photograph. No wonder it horrified Speck so deeply.

THE BOOTH - RESUMING

Charlton eyes it without reaction.

                     FRAN (CONT'D)
           Lab picked up talcum traces on the edges
           of the paper, consistent with powdered
           gloves.
               (Charlton nods)
           So he gets the dropped in his lap, it
           spooks him, and the car winds up in the
           ravine.

Plausible enough, until:

                     MACKELWAY
           I don't think so, no. I think it was
           pushed.

                     FRAN
           How ya figure?

                     MACKELWAY
           The look of the tracks. Foot-prints near
           the embankment.

Without embellishing any further, he slides over the
PHOTOGRAPHS that he took this morning with the Minox: tire-
tracks, foot-prints. She eyes them.

Then she eyes Mackelway. Charlton notes the tension.

                                                           18.


                     CHARLTON
           Okay. So our guy likes to draw pictures
           of body parts and then spring 'em on
           people. What's that get us?
               (they're silent)
           That's what I thought.

There is plenty going unsaid here between Mackelway and Fran.
Charlton has no time for it.

                     CHARLTON
           Oh. 'Fore I forget. This came in for you:

He tosses a 9-by-12 ENVELOPE at Mackelway, who opens it. Six
sheets of paper slide out.

First one we see is the TOP SHEET of a FAX: same hand-written
inscription as the last one: "Attention, Agent Thomas
Mackelway, FBI Resident Agency, Wichita Falls."

Okay. This is twice now. He knows what will be under this top
sheet without even looking. But here's Page One:

A photo of a middle-aged African-American WOMAN. Across the
top of the photo, in hand-writing: "HAVE YOU SEEN ME?"

And typed on the bottom: "Tanya Green. Age 42. Ht. 5'9", Wt.
165, Eyes Blk, Hair Blk. Last Seen: Ames, Iowa. Date of
Disappearance: 3-22-97."

The following four sheets bring four more faces: men, women,
young, old. Four more HAVE YOU SEEN ME's.

But before he can think it through, he hears:

                     MANAGER (O.S.)
           It's about time.

They turn. That came from the NIGHT MANAGER: a humorless guy
named LES. He's looking at the front door, through which Dolly
has just entered. Pink cowboy boots tonight.

                     DOLLY
           Don't start in on me, Les. I couldn't get
           the pickup started and Harlan took the
           Dodge.

The Manager now throws a glance at the three feds in the
booth. Dolly stops short, taken aback.

                                                                 19.


                           DOLLY (CONT'D)
                 Holy Hell. My one shot at winding up on
                 "Cops" and I'm in my weekday boots!

                                                       CUT TO:

20    INT. DINER - BOOTH - LATER                                       20

      Dolly and Mel sit opposite Mackelway and Fran.

                           DOLLY
                 He was a quiet guy. Normal. Liked to read
                 fishing magazines. Not much of a tipper.
                 Is that a lousy thing to say?

                            FRAN
                 It's fine.

      Mel rolls his eyes.

                           MACKELWAY
                 What can you tell us about the other man?

                           MEL
                 Like I said, I never really saw him.
                 Harold came up, complainin' about the guy
                 - but time I turned, he was gone.

                    FRAN                      MACK
              (at Dolly:)               (at Dolly:)
          Could you de--            Did you get a--

     They each stop short, waiting for the other to yield. Finally
     Mackelway nods, "Go ahead."

                           FRAN
                 Can you describe him, Ma'am?

                           DOLLY
                 Sure. He was...

      Dolly pauses, her face scrunching a bit. Troubled...

                           DOLLY (CONT'D)
                 That's weird. Guy was in here better part
                 of an hour. We had a real pleasant
                 chat... But I can't remember a thing
                 about him. For the life of me. Couldn't
                 even tell you what color his eyes were.

      She shrugs apologetically.

                                                                 20.


                          FRAN
                Happen to see what he was driving?

                           DOLLY
                That one's easy. It's still in the lot.
                    (they perk up)
                The Bonneville out there with the awful
                paint job.

     She gestures to the lot, where an old PONTIAC BONNEVILLE sits,
     its paint stripped down to the primer. Bingo.

     Fran and Mackelway eye it, then one another.

                                                       CUT TO:

21   EXT. DINER - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER                          21

     Fran and Mackelway emerge, heading for the Bonneville.

                          MACKELWAY
                We ought to work out some kind of
                protocol.

                            FRAN
                For what?

                          MACKELWAY
                Interviews. Witnesses. Looks pretty
                silly, our talking over one another.

                          FRAN
                Fine. I'll handle them from now on.

     He doesn't argue. They come to a stop at that Bonneville,
     stripped down to its primer. Time to work...

     Two agents, all instinct. We see them study things, details,
     their minds always churning... Mackelway pulls out his Minox,
     snaps off a few more shots. Then:

                          MACKELWAY
                Trunk's ajar.

     She turns. Sure enough, the Bonneville's trunk is ajar.
     Mackelway approaches, cautiously.

     He doesn't have gloves on him, so he uses his jacket pocket to
     protect against prints. He opens the trunk.

     First thing he sees is that SYMBOL again: a circle-with-a-
     slash-through-it... staring right at him.

                                                                 21.


     But this time, it's been carved into somebody's back.

     Mackelway stares. So does Fran. Before them lies a body,
     stripped to the waist: a chunky middle-aged MAN. Dead.

     Mackelway sighs. Things just got tougher...

                                                      CUT TO:

22   INT. ARCHER COUNTY MORGUE - DAY                                   22

     Harold Speck lies on a table. A BESPECTACLED CORONER examines
     him. Victim #2, BARNEY FULCHER, lies on another, his ample
     frame yet to be examined.

     The lights are out, but that Coroner wears a FLUORESCENT HALO,
     with a MICROPHONE pinned to his gown. He speaks into it with a
     quiet monotone: anatomical terms, etc.

     Mackelway and Fran are here... watching. Mackelway is
     particularly focused on Fulcher's face. His EYELIDS, we now
     see, have also been torn off. Hmmmm...

                          FRAN
                Why eyelids?

                          MACKELWAY
                Huh?

                          FRAN
                No other signs of torture here. Why take
                somebody's eyelids off?

                          MACKELWAY
                So they can't blink.

     She sighs, aloud: "I know that already, Asshole." Coroner
     keeps his head down, speaking into that microphone.

                          MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
                It's a metaphor - to make certain the
                victim sees... or to make certain that we
                see something.
                    (she's silent)
                Or maybe it's just a fuck-you.

     Coroner continues his monotone narration... then crosses to
     the sink.

     That puts him out of earshot. So:

                                                                  22.


                          MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
                    (to Fran, quietly)
                I'm sorry about Don.

                          FRAN
                    (thrown)
                Huh?

                          MACKELWAY
                You're not wearing your ring anymore.

     That was an attempt at kindness. She knows that. Still, she
     eyes her left hand, self-consciously, while Mackelway loses
     himself in those lidless eyes of Fulcher's...

     Then there's a KNOCK AT THE GLASS WINDOW BEHIND THEM.

     They turn. Charlton stands on the other side of a GLASS
     WINDOW, in a VIEWING ROOM adjacent to this Morgue. He presses
     a piece of paper up against the glass.

     On it, in typed bold letters at the top, we read: "MATCHES
     ONE OF ONE." Below that we see that Circle-with-the-slash-
     through-it.

     This is a FAX, which Charlton's just received. He points
     further down on the fax at what look like little squiggles at
     first, until we move in to discover it is a hand drawn street
     map.

     The ink bleeds a bit due to a poor fax transmission. Those
     scrawled lines take us to "The Hope House," in Oklahoma City.
     At the bottom a scribbled name, "David Dyson," and a contact
     number.

     Moving closer to the glass, Mackelway nods. He just got a
     break...

                                                        CUT TO:

23   INT. GRAMMAR-SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - BOULDER, CO. - DAY                23

     A CHOIR of FIRST AND SECOND GRADERS stands before a school
     assembly. The rest of Boulder Elementary's student body fills
     the seats in here, along with FACULTY MEMBERS.

     Everybody's weeping. A framed picture of Barney Fulcher sits
     on a stand, with candles around it:

                          SINGING FIRST AND SECOND GRADERS
                A-may-zing Grace, How sweet the sound--

                                                                 23.


     In the back, some of the TOWNSFOLK have gathered for this
     assembly, touched. O'Ryan stands among them. No expression on
     his face at all...

                                                     CUT TO:

24   EXT. "HOPE HOUSE" - OKLAHOMA CITY - NIGHT                         24

     A three-story Victorian residence in decay, next door to a
     CHURCH/SOUP KITCHEN in the middle of Oklahoma City's Skid Row.
     Rain falls. The street is still.

     Mackelway approaches this halfway-house. A few lights shine
     within, and the blue glow of a tv. Upstairs can be heard the
     strident, off-key voice of somebody singing.

25   EXT./INT. HOPE HOUSE - DOORWAY - CONTINUING                       25

     The front door is open. Through a SCREEN DOOR, Mackelway can
     see an old-fashioned "foyer." He knocks. Waits.

     Two sounds dominate: the buzz from that tv, and the strident
     singing, which we realize is an a capela version of "La Vida
     Loca" audible through an open bedroom window.

     But no one's coming to answer the door, and it's wide open
     anyway... So Mackelway enters.

                          MACKELWAY
                Hello?

26   INT. HOPE HOUSE - ENTRY - CONTINUING                              26

     TV room is to his left. There, a single 35 year-old DRUNK/
     TRANSIENT (we'll call him "PIPER") sits, watching "Behind the
     Music" on VH1. Tonight's subject? Leif Garret...

     Piper doesn't look up, or acknowledge Mackelway at all. Rather
     he INCREASES THE TV VOLUME to drown out the singing upstairs,
     which seems to be intentionally off-key.

     Torn couches, stained carpet, cracked window. Posters and
     fliers on the walls. 10 BEDROOMS upstairs.

                          DYSON (O.S.)
                Agent Mackelway?

     Mackelway turns. Descending a creaking stairway is DAVID
     DYSON: 50, lean, with a friendly smile.

                                                      CUT TO:

                                                               24.


27   INT. HOPE HOUSE - BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER                      27

     We are staring at a BASEMENT WALL that has been covered, floor
     to ceiling, with 1,000 identical renderings of that same
     symbol: the CIRCLE-WITH-A-SLASH-THROUGH-IT.

     1,000 of them, in bright red paint, against pitch black
     enamel. Only a machine could have achieved this kind of
     repetition. Or a maniac.

     This basement is leaky, drafty, poorly lit. But it's also
     quiet: the sound of that awful singing upstairs has been MUTED
     by the basement door and the rain itself.

                          DYSON
                Benjamin spent hours down here.

     Mackelway takes it all in, every corner of this basement. He
     notes a row of standing GYM LOCKERS.

                          MACKELWAY
                    (re: lockers)
                Did he have access to those?

                          DYSON
                No. They're staff-only.

                          MACKELWAY
                Would you mind opening them for me?

     Dyson shrugs; he thinks it's a waste of time - but he'll do
     it. Mackelway follows him across the dank room.

                          MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
                He was here... seven years you said?

                          DYSON
                Off and on. It's not uncommon for our
                guests to vanish for months at a time.

     Dyson works a combination lock on the first locker.

                          MACKELWAY
                I ran the name through our database, just
                to be sure. There's never been an Agent
                Benjamin O'Ryan in the Bureau.

                          DYSON
                No... but as elaborate fantasies go, it
                was one of my favorites.
                    (fondly)
                And he always seemed so sincere about it.

                                                          25.


Dyson half-chuckles; he always liked the guy... He throws open
the locker. Inside, nothing. Mackelway indicates the next
locker. Dyson works the combination.

                     MACKELWAY
           Is that what you called him? Benjamin?

                     DYSON
           It's what he wished to be called.

Locker #2 is opened - also empty. Only one locker left.

                     DYSON (CONT'D)
               (re: locker #3)
           That one's mine.

Mackelway shrugs: "Sorry, it has to be opened." Dyson sighs,
then works the combination. Mackelway waits.

Locker #3 is opened. Inside, nothing incriminating: a sweater,
some old junk, two trophies. Dyson eyes him: "See?" Mackelway
nods. Dyson shuts the locker.

Mackelway looks to that wall: 1,000 copies of the circle-with-
a-slash-through-it. No idea what they signify...

                     DYSON (CONT'D)
           He painted one of the walls in his room,
           too.

                     MACKELWAY
           Can I see it?

                     DYSON
           We've painted it over.

                     MACKELWAY
           Still, might be helpful.

Dyson heads for the stairs. They're wooden slats with more
basement-junk stored below: old sporting equipment, an old
vaccuum cleaner, broken chairs, rusted patio furniture.

Mackelway follows. They climb...

                     MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
           Wait.

They stop. Something just caught Mackelway's eye, visible
beneath these stairs: a BOX, with a bucket of PAINT sticking
out of it...

                                                                26.


28   INT. BASEMENT - BENEATH THE STAIRS - CONTINUING                  28

     Mackelway climbs under the stairs, crouching down, pushing
     aside all of the aforementioned junk. He grabs the box.

     Sure enough, that bucket once held red paint - same color
     O'Ryan used to cover that wall. There's also a bucket of BLACK
     PAINT here. And some used brushes.

     Mackelway brings the box into the meager light. We get a look
     INSIDE IT now. So does Dyson.

     Inside, beneath the paint-buckets, we see a few TV GUIDES, a
     yo-yo, a football. Then a BOOK on TRIBAL RITUAL AND TRANCE.
     Mackelway grabs it, eyes it.

     He flips through a few pages - odd images: a TRIBESMAN with
     eyes rolling back in his head, strange rites, etc.

     Mackelway sets the book down. Then, amidst the other materials
     in this box, he spots a large folded MAP.

     He grabs it, begins to unfold it. We see that this map's been
     written on, in pen. Cities on it have been CIRCLED.

     But before we can get a good look at it, Mackelway spots
     something else, at the bottom of this box, a shocker:

     A photograph of himself.

     It takes him a second to realize what he's looking at. But
     there it is, a NEWSPAPER PHOTO, of Agent Thomas Mackelway.

     It is part of a FRONT-PAGE STORY, dated July of this year,
     concerning the trial and release...of Virgil Ray Starkey. #7
     on the F.B.I.'s Most-Wanted List...

     Dyson can't help but notice the picture of Mackelway.

     Mackelway stares. Suddenly we JUMP BACK IN TIME, NINE MONTHS,
     for a brief, choppy FLASHBACK.
                                                                      29
29   EXT. STREET - MATAMOROS - NIGHT - MACKELWAY'S FLASHBACK
     We're RUNNING, dashing between two buildings of chipped-adobe,
     hearing nothing but the sound of our own breathing and the
     thuds of our own heavy feet.

     This is Matamoros, Mexico, a shit-hole of a border town.
     Squalor and sin. We find a DRUNK MEXICAN TEEN. He nods: "This
     is the place," and sticks out his palm.

                                                              27.


30   INT. HOPE HOUSE - BASEMENT - RESUMING                          30

     Mackelway stares at that newspaper: Starkey - rapist,
     murderer, whose case was just thrown out of court - a stunning
     failure for all involved.

     ...as we RESUME MACKELWAY'S FLASHBACK - Matamoros again...

31   INT. "CLUB" - BACKSTAGE - RESUMING FLASHBACK                   31

     Bad-lighting, drunk patrons in a CIRCLE, and a DONKEY-SHOW
     taking place on a bare stage. Feels like we've stepped into
     some kind of evil carnival. It's dizzying.

     Among the crowd: Virgil Starkey, in an ugly drunken binge, the
     only guy in here who isn't cheering or laughing.

     Suddenly our GUN is pointed right at his head.

     Starkey freezes, caught. Some of the PATRONS around him find
     somewhere else to stand... But the show goes on.

32   INT. HOPE HOUSE - BASEMENT - RESUMING                          32

     That ARTICLE gives us more detail now, the reason Starkey's
     case was thrown out of court. It is this:

     The F.B.I. Agent on the case had made a mistake in
     "evidentiary procedure." Hence, Mackelway's picture.

     On his face, we GO BACK TO ANOTHER MEMORY: six months ago.

33   INT. COURTHOUSE - ANTEROOM - DAY - ANOTHER FLASHBACK           33

     Three months have passed since the arrest in Matamoros. Now
     Mackelway sits in this courthouse ANTEROOM, adjacent to a
     courtroom. Four sour PROSECUTORS surround him.

                          PROSECUTOR #1
                D'you understand how fucked we are?

                            MACKELWAY
                Yes, Sir.

                          PROSECUTOR #1
                Leaving a tissue sample in the care of a
                Mexican lab? Are you fucking kidding me?

                          MACKELWAY
                They assured me that they understood
                protocol.

                                                                 28.


                          PROSECUTOR #1
                Well guess what? They didn't. And this
                prick's gonna walk, ten murders or not.

     That registered.

34   INT. HOPE HOUSE - BASEMENT - RESUMING                             34

     Beneath this newspaper article are OTHER ARTICLES, all
     concerning Starkey: his crimes, his capture, all of it.

     Mackelway's memory just got stoked again:

35   INT. COURTHOUSE - HALLWAY - RESUMING FLASHBACK                    35

     Mackelway emerges from that courthouse anteroom, whipped.

     The hall's busy with MEDIA and other traffic. First face he
     sees is Fran, who sits on a bench, (wedding ring ON). Her eyes
     say how lousy she feels for him. It almost helps.

36   INT. COURTHOUSE BATHROOM - CONTINUING FLASHBACK                   36

     The door bursts open and Mackelway storms in. No need to look
     composed now; he's alone in here. He crosses to a paper-towel
     dispenser, SLUGS IT. Stares in the mirror.

     He's livid, embarrassed, frustrated - can barely look at his
     own reflection.

     Then he hears LAUGHTER, behind him. He turns.

     Out of the darkness of a badly-lit STALL, Virgil Starkey
     emerges, coming into view under a single light.

     Beside him is a GRIM COP, his chaperone. Starkey passes by
     Mackelway, almost snickering. Then he's gone. Mackelway shuts
     his eyes tight. His head is pounding. END FLASHBACK.

37   INT. HOPE HOUSE - BASEMENT - RESUMING                             37

     Mackelway stares... at a record of his deepest wound. But what
     the hell is it doing in the locker of a transient?

                                                       CUT TO:

38   INT. HOPE HOUSE - "O'RYAN'S ROOM" - MOMENTS LATER                 38

     Mackelway leans in, looking around. A bed. A small end-table.
     Bathroom. A window without bars.

                                                               29.


     From down the hall we hear the sound of a PHONE RINGING, then
     a FAX transmission. An old fax machine begins to whine
     noisily, creaking. It's a distraction.

     But Mackelway's focus is in this room. The walls have been newly
     painted. But there's a hint of barely-perceptible color
     beneath one of them. Rain from a LEAKY ROOF is causing some of
     the new paint to peel a bit.

     A BUCKET collects drops in the center of the room. The feeling
     in here is damp, mildewy, creepy. Mackelway remains in the
     doorway... then backs out.

                          DYSON (O.S.)
                I guess you fellas're never unaccounted
                for, huh?

39   INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUING                                       39

     Mackelway turns, a bit startled. Dyson is approaching, FAX in
     hand.

                            MACKELWAY
                Huh?

     Dyson extends six pages. On the TOP-SHEET, written by hand,
     are the words: "Agent Thomas Mackelway, C/O Mr. David Dyson,
     Hope House" with a street address.

     And under that top sheet? Five more pages.

     Mackelway sighs, takes them from Dyson. Sure enough, he's
     staring at five more faces, five more fact sheets. Five more
     HAVE YOU SEEN ME's.

     But how would anyone know to send them here?

                          DYSON
                Anything urgent?

                            MACKELWAY
                      (doesn't look up)
                No.

     Dyson is glad to hear it.

                                                     CUT TO:

40   INT. HOPE HOUSE - FOYER - MOMENTS LATER                         40

     Mackelway descends, having had quite enough of this place.
     Piper is where we left him, watching VH1 in the TV Room.

                                                         30.


Mackelway passes, eyeing those newly-faxed pages: five more
HAVE YOU SEEN ME'S... He reaches the door.

                        PIPER
              Ever seen a fifty-foot shark?

Mackelway stops, turns.

                        MACKELWAY
              I'm sorry?

                        PIPER
              Fifty-foot shark. Ever seen one?

                        MACKELWAY
              No.

                        PIPER
              Doesn't mean there aren't any.

Great. Mackelway reaches for the front door again. Then he
halts. Maybe this guy can be helpful. Mackelway turns:

                     MACKELWAY
           Did you know him?
               (Piper's silent)
           The guy who used to stay upstairs.
           "O'Ryan." Did you know him?

                     PIPER
           Why? Is he dead?

                       MACKELWAY
           I don't...

                     PIPER
           You said "Did." Is he dead?

                     MACKELWAY
           Oh. I mis-spoke. No, he's not dead...
               (a beat)
           You know him?

Piper nods.

Mackelway eyes him, then approaches, holding up a copy of that
image: the circle-with-slash-through-it.

                        MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
              He ever talk about this? A circle with a
              slash through it?

                                                                 31.


     Piper rises, crosses to us... leaning in unnecessarily close.
     It's unsettling.

                          PIPER
                That's not a circle. It's a zero.

                          MACKELWAY
                Oh. How do you know?

     Piper doesn't answer. Instead he simply starts whistling.

     But it's not a tune coming out of his mouth. It's that same
     sound that O'Ryan made: A WHISTLING WIND, blowing through a
     ghost town... Building, then falling again.

     Piper smiles, backing away, enjoying the theatricality of it,
     stifling a giggle...

     Then, suddenly, everything turns GRAINY, CHOPPY...

     We've jumped into a distorted, REMOTE POV of this same scene -
     as if watching it through a crystal ball, or a broken lens, or
     a distance of time and space...

     We see images, fragments: Piper, the tv, the sofa, Mackelway's
     face. Then all sound breaks up, and we are...

41   INT. MOTEL ROOM - SLEEPER, MISSOURI - CONTINUING                  41

     Start on O'Ryan's EYES. Then a pad of paper. The spasm of a
     pen, scrawling a LIST on to it: "Piper. TV. Whistling." We're
     in another non-descript MOTEL ROOM. $29 a night.

     He holds down the point of his pen on a wavy line beside that
     list of words, keeping it there for a few seconds, as if
     expecting to receive some kind of pulse from it.

     No more pulse. He has lost the "connection" that had somehow
     transported him. He notes his watch. Jots down the exact time.
     Slips the pad into that FOLDER: "Mackelway."

     Then he starts to DRAW - a hurried but accurate sketch of
     Mackelway and Piper, just as they stood during that
     conversation. The geography is fairly accurate.

     O'Ryan continues to draw. We CRANE OUT of this motel room, to
     find, on the street below:

42   EXT. A BAR - SLEEPER, MISSOURI - CONTINUING                       42

     A typical honky-tonk in a town called Sleeper, Missouri. Just
     across the street from O'Ryan's cheap motel...

                                                                32.


43   INT. BAR - SLEEPER, MISSOURI - CONTINUING                        43

     Low-lights, dust on the floor. Pool tables.

     LORETTA is a pretty 19-year-old who stands at the jukebox,
     weighing her choices. She's got a thick curtain of hair, which
     she wrangles with a CHIP-CLIP. It's a habit.

     She chooses a country-rock tune, then heads for the bar,
     walking to the beat. It's fun being 19 and beautiful.

44   AT THE BAR - CONTINUING                                          44

     The BARTENDER'S a stocky guy with a broad smile.

                          LORETTA
                    (re: song)
                How's that?

                          BARTENDER
                Little cute for my taste, but I can stand
                three minutes of it.

                          LORETTA
                I'll have a seven and seven, please.

                          BARTENDER
                Seven and seven. Got some i.d.?

     She half-laughs, as if she hasn't been carded in a decade, and
     throws that curtain of hair from one side to the other, re-
     fastening that chip-clip. It's her best move.

                          LORETTA
                It's in the car. No one's asked me for it
                for a couple years now.

                          BARTENDER
                If ya hurry, you'll still catch the end
                of the song.

     She eyes him: are you really carding me? He smiles: nothing
     personal, Sugar. So she heads for the door.

     ...on her way, she passes a booth. In it we find a familiar
     face - Virgil Ray Starkey...

     He remains still, as if he hadn't noticed her. But behind
     his eyes, something primal just took place. He rises, heads
     for the door.

                                                                 33.


45   EXT. BAR - MOMENTS LATER                                          45

     Loretta walks to her VW Bug. Starkey exits the bar. She
     doesn't notice. We TILT UP: the lights are off in O'Ryan's
     motel room...

46   EXT. AT LORETTA'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER                             46

     It all happens pretty fast: That chip-clip hits the ground
     beside the open VW door. A battered PICK-UP speeds away,
     kicking up gravel.

                                                      CUT TO:

     ...Loretta's eyes, wide with terror and dread.

47   INT. STARKEY'S PICK-UP - MINUTES LATER                            47

     We're off-road. Missouri's woods can be seen through the
     windshield. And Starkey is staring at us. Pawing at us...

                          LORETTA
                Please, Mister...

     Starkey's hand shoots out, banging Loretta's head against the
     window, hard. That makes things start to swim. Starkey tears
     at her clothes, lowers himself on to her.

     She whimpers. WE CARRY THE SOUND OF IT INTO:

48   INT. MACKELWAY'S APARTMENT - SAME                                 48

     This is where you go when you've just moved to Wichita Falls
     and money's tight: spotty shag carpet, chipped Formica kitchen
     table, scuffed blinds.

     ...and one sleepless agent, having one lousy night.

     Mackelway sits on the edge of his bed, almost able to hear
     Loretta's helpless cries. Some nights are like this. His head
     is POUNDING again. Down go four more Bufferin.

     Above him, covering the bedroom mirror, is the MAP he took
     from that Hope House basement. O'Ryan's map, UNFOLDED.

     It's HUGE: 6-feet-wide, 4-feet-tall, obscuring the mirror.

     As we glimpsed while still in that basement, this map his been
     written on, in pen. O'Ryan's notations cover it:
     Over a THUSAND CITIES on it have been CIRCLED, by hand, in
     RED. Each of those circled cities has a DATE written beside
     it, also in red: ("4/6," "5/19," "10-26," etc.)

                                                                 34.


     Mackelway studies it, his face working. Another of those
     WHIMPERS from Loretta seems to hang, suspended. Mackelway
     shakes it off, certain that he's imagining it.

     He won't sleep a wink tonight. We LEAVE HIM, returning to:

49   INT. STARKEY'S PICK-UP - RESUMING                                 49

     The attack continues, its terror unimaginable. Loretta sobs.
     It hurts. Starkey's too powerful to fight off. We stay on her
     face: dazed, her mind simply checking out.

     ...until a look of cognizance comes over her, brought on by a
     SHADOW that just passed by.

     Then the window behind Starkey simply EXPLODES.

     Glass flies everywhere, and TWO ARMS reach into the pick-up.
     They grab Starkey by the neck and yank him out of the pick-up,
     his back sliced open by shards. He screams.

     She can't resist coming to the window, where she sees:

50   EXT. WOODS - STARKEY'S PICK-UP - CONTINUING                       50

     Starkey lies, face up. Shocked. Squirming. Bleeding. Standing
     over him, looming large as a Grizzly... is O'Ryan. A long
     HUNTING KNIFE extends from his hand.

     But his tone, to our great surprise, is conversational:

                          O'RYAN
                Hey, listen, I'm sorta new in town. Ya
                know where I can find a good donkey show?

     Starkey has no idea how to respond to this maniac:

                          STARKEY
                Huh?

                          O'RYAN
                Oh. Forgot. Wrong country... In America
                animals have rights.
                    (pointedly)
                Don't they, Virgil?

                          STARKEY
                How the fuck should I know?

     O'Ryan half-smiles, then kicks Starkey right in the head.
     Loretta's eyes go wide. Another kick follows, to the ribs.
     Then one to the groin. Then:

                                                                 35.


                          O'RYAN
                    (at Loretta)
                Turn around.

     He said that without looking at her. But he can tell that she
     hasn't moved - too frightened. So he eyes her.

                          O'RYAN (CONT'D)
                    (again)
                Turn around!

     She turns away, lying face down on the seat, covering her
     head. No idea what kind of terror is to come next. We STAY
     WITH HER... able only to hear what follows:

     The sound is animal, awful - like a pig being gutted - a
     horrible SQUEAL, covering the GRUNTS coming from O'Ryan.

     In goes the knife again, prompting another agonized cry from
     Starkey. Loretta's crying too: from fear, shock... She keeps
     her face buried, shutting her eyes tight. The sounds of
     savagery fill the night.

     Then, one last gasp from Starkey... followed by an awful
     silence... and the assault is over.

     Loretta's too afraid to look up - certain that the maniac with
     the knife will be coming after her next.

     But then she hears FOOTSTEPS, trailing away. So she rises,
     peeking over the edge of the window. WE STAY ON HER FACE, as
     she sees what's become of her attacker.

     Her horrified SCREAM fills the woods...

51   INT. MACKELWAY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - RESUMING                   51

     Mackelway STARES out the window; seems like he just HEARD that
     scream. Of course, that'd be impossible. He looks to that map.
     His PHONE RINGS. He eyes it, unsurprised...

                                                       CUT TO:

52   EXT. WOODS OUTSIDE SLEEPER, MO. - LATER                           52

     Law enforcement VEHICLES surround the site. COPS, Grieves,
     CORONER'S GUYS taking pictures. Loretta is sitting on the back
     of an ambulance, being tended to.

     A COMPOSITE ARTIST sits beside her, trying.

                          LORETTA
                I don't think the eyes are right.

                                                          36.


                       COMPOSITE ARTIST
           Narrower?

                     LORETTA
           No, they were... I don't really know.

Composite Artist keeps trying, but his attempt doesn't look
anything like the face of O'Ryan.

Charlton, meanwhile, stands over the body, mind racing.

A Missouri Highway Patrol car pulls up. Mackelway steps out of
it. We follow him as he takes in the scene.

A FLASHBULB illuminates Starkey's CHEST; is got a zero-with-
a-slash-through-it. But Mackelway hasn't seen the guy's face
yet.

                       MACKELWAY
           Sir?
               (Charlton turns)
           We got an i.d. yet?

                     CHARLTON
           Mmm-hmm.
               (Mackelway waits)
           Might wanna find yourself a fender.
           You're gonna need to sit down.
               (Mackelway's still waiting)
           It's Virgil Ray Starkey.

Mackelway pales.

We stay on him for a moment as it registers. The man he
caught, and then lost, has killed again. No. God, no.

                     MACKELWAY
               (struggling for composure:)
           Starkey did this?
                     CHARLTON
           No. Starkey's the one on the ground.

Mackelway pauses, thinks he must've heard wrong. But he turns
toward the face, as ANOTHER FLASHBULB illuminates it, searing
the image into the darkness. Starkey. Dead. His eyelids ripped
away.

Mackelway stares, stunned. Can't fucking believe it.

                     MACKELWAY
               (breathless)
           My God...

                                                                  37.


     It's like looking at a ghost - a spectre that's been haunting
     him, dead now... Mackelway pulls out his Minox, starts
     photographing, moving in on those LIDLESS EYES...

                          GRIEVES
                Gonna make a wallet-size of that one?

                          CHARLTON
                Give him a break, Grieves.

     Mackelway doesn't comment. Just keeps snapping shots...

                                                        CUT TO:

53   INT. FBI OFFICE - MACKELWAY'S CUBICLE - MORNING                    53

     The number of HAVE YOU SEEN ME's has now grown, quite a bit.
     45 PAGES sit stacked on Mackelway's desk. 45 victims. He grabs
     the stack, rises.

     Heading for the Conference Room, he nearly bumps into Katie,
     the Receptionist, rounding a corner.

                          MACKELWAY
                'Scuse me.

     She smiles. He carries the HAVE YOU SEEN ME's into:

54   INT. FBI OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUING                     54

     A room has been dedicated solely to those three murders. On an
     erasure board are the words: The "O'Ryan" Room.

     On one wall is the MAP Mackelway took from Hope House: over a
     thousand CITIES circled by O'Ryan himself.

     Mackelway puts down the stack of HAVE YOU SEEN ME's. Picks up
     a box of YELLOW STICK-PINS, affixing them to the map - one for
     every faxed face.

     Here's "Jason Corey, Age 14." Last seen in "Riverside, Ca." on
     "10-16-99."

     Sure enough, O'Ryan had circled "Riverside, Ca." on this map.
     Next to it he'd written "10-16."

     Mackelway sticks a yellow pin in Riverside.

     Next, the fax concerning "Anna Casitas, Age 22." Last Seen?
     "Macon, Ga." on "5-6-00."

     Of course, O'Ryan had circled "Macon" too. Beside it he'd
     written "5-6." So Macon gets a yellow pin.

                                                         38.


Mackelway continues, as:

                     FRAN (O.S.)
           Got nothing on the last fax.

Mackelway turns. In comes Fran.

                     FRAN (CONT'D)
           Came from a business center at a Mariott
           in Dallas. Nobody saw who sent it.

Mackelway nods. Then they both turn... Charlton enters the
room.

                     CHARLTON
           Whadda we know about the map?

                      MACKELWAY
           It matches the faxes, Sir. Almost
           perfectly.

Charlton approaches the map: 1,242 cities, circled in red.
Mackelway continues with the yellow pins: one for every HAVE
YOU SEEN ME? (45 of them so far.)

Charlton eyes the stack. 45 HAVE YOU SEEN ME's... Then the
map: 1,242 cities. Each with a DATE beside it.

                     CHARLTON
           Why's Greenville in blue?

(Mackelway has put a yellow pin beside a dozen cities... but
tiny Greenville, Texas has a BLUE PIN beside it.)

                     MACKELWAY
           Only city where the date on the fax and
           the date on the map didn't correspond.

He pulls out a fax from the stack: a Korean boy named "Steven
Kim. Age 16. Last Seen: Greenville, Tx. Date of Disappearance:
8-7-98."

                     MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
           Fax lists the date of disappearance as
           August 7. On the map he's written "10-
           26."

The DATE on O'Ryan's map reads "10-26" beside Greenville, Tx.
So Greenville gets the only blue pin on this map.

Charlton notes today's date: October 17...

                                                                39.


                          CHARLTON
                Any of these bodies been recovered?

                          MACKELWAY
                Two so far. Female, disappeared from
                Dayton, Ohio on April 12. And a male,
                Trenton, New Jersey, January 5th.

     On the MAP, Dayton's got "4/12" written beside it. Trenton has
     "1/5." Both have yellow pins in them.

                          MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
                But both bodies were found over a
                thousand miles from where they'd last
                been seen. One in Montana, the other in
                Oregon. Got autopsy reports on both.

     Charlton looks to the table, where AUTOPSY REPORTS and AUTOPSY
     PHOTOS sit - two victims we've never seen before.

     We see the VICTIMS photographed face up, face down, waist and
     above, waist and below. Charlton gives the photos a cursory
     glance, nothing more.

     But we notice something, on one of the bodies: the male from
     Trenton - an odd BURN MARK on his lower left calf.

     Looks almost symmetrical, horizontal across the calf...

                          CHARLTON
                Either of the bodies have the zero on
                them?

                           MACKELWAY
                No, Sir.

     Charlton, frustrated, SHOVES THOSE AUTOPSY PHOTOS ASIDE. We
     look to that MAP, a handful of yellow pins in it...

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

     ...that same map, over a HUNDRED YELLOW PINS in it now.

55   INT. FBI OFFICE - "O'RYAN ROOM" - NIGHT                          55

     It's 8:30 at night. Mackelway is alone in here - staring at
     the map. He's been doing a lot of that lately.

     The stack of HAVE YOU SEEN ME's has grown as well. Every one
     of them corresponds to a yellow pin on the map.

                                                           40.


(Some of the HAVE YOU SEEN ME's have arrived via U.S. MAIL. We
see a stack of ENVELOPES in a box, each sealed in PLASTIC,
each stamped and addressed to Mackelway.)

Mackelway eyes the map, puzzling. Fran's right beside him.
Assorted papers and leads fill this room, including photos he
took himself with that Minox.

                      FRAN
           Why you?

                      MACKELWAY
           Huh?

                     FRAN
           He could be sending these to any agent in
           any office in the country... But he's
           sending them to you. Why?

Mackelway's been asking himself that same question lately.

                     MACKELWAY
           I don't know.

PHONE RINGS. She grabs it.

                     FRAN (INTO PHONE)
           This is Agent Kulok.
               (a beat)
           Who's calling?

She hears the answer, then covers the phone.

                     FRAN (CONT'D)
               (to Mackelway:)
           Do you know a professor named Daitz? Says
           he's from Tulane.

                     MACKELWAY
               (eagerly)
           Yeah. Criminal Psych. I've been trading e-
           mails with him.

                     FRAN (INTO PHONE)
           One moment, please...

She hands him the phone...

                                                 CUT TO:

                                                                 41.


56   EXT. TULANE UNIVERSITY - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT                     56

     A beautiful campus, quiet tonight. In its center lies a vast,
     expensive structure - the Behavioral Sciences Building. The
     place goes on forever.

57   INT. TULANE - BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES BUILDING - SAME                 57

     Mackelway exits an elevator on the "B-1 Level." Corridors
     octopus their way from these elevators, confusing us...

58   INT. BUILDING CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER                            58

     Every door looks the same. Mackelway follows the numbers -
     can't believe how long these hallways are. Turns a corner.

     Air can be heard, moving through the corridor. But he has
     found the right number, at last.

     A tiny CARD fastened to a wall reads, "Dr. Emile Daitz,
     Professor Emeritus, Criminal Psychology." It also lists his
     office hours. Mackelway knocks at a door.

                          MACKELWAY
                Professor Daitz?

                          O'RYAN (O.S.)
                Yes?

     Mackelway opens the door. Looks inside.

     Here sits O'Ryan, looking as much like a tweedy professor as
     he can look. He rises, smiles warmly.

                          O'RYAN (CONT'D)
                Agent Mackelway. Come in...

                                                      CUT TO:

59   INT. DAITZ' OFFICE - LATER NIGHT                                  59

     A tiny, cramped hovel. Books, papers, and all of it jammed to
     overflowing. Mackelway sits across from O'Ryan...

                          O'RYAN
                    (as "Daitz:")
                ...The name of this theory was "Suspect
                Zero."
                    (Mackelway nods)
                The idea of Suspect Zero posits that if a
                serial killer were diabolical enough, he
                could traverse the country without ever
                being caught, killing randomly.

                                                         42.


There's a COLLECTION here in a glass case: ANCIENT WEAPONS -
crude knives, swords, blow-darts. Mackelway notes them.

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           Tell me, what makes a killer catchable?

                     MACKELWAY
           Patterns, repetition of behavior.

                     O'RYAN
           Now imagine a killer with no patterns, no
           tell-tale fetishes, no rituals, no hidden
           desire to be caught. A perfect vessel of
           evil, killing without ever leaving a
           single meaningful clue in his wake...
           He'd be immune to capture, wouldn't he?
           Your task forces, your forensics teams -
           they'd be helpless.

Mackelway looks over Daitz' bookshelf: volume after volume
about evil, the devil, the minds of sociopaths, the history of
serial-killers, ritual killers, tribal rites...

                     MACKELWAY
           Is that something you believe in,
           Professor? Evil?

                    O'RYAN
          As a citizen of the world, it's hard not
          to. Wouldn't you say?
              (Mackelway can't argue)
          Evil is all around us, I think - a part
          of the natural order of things. Like
          gravity. Like wind. A vast black wave,
          corrupting everything it touches. A virus
          invades a cell, causing it to
          dysfunction. Perfectly logical. But did
          it ever occur to you that something may
          have invaded that virus, something
          capable of using it to mutate so
          powerfully?

Mackelway pauses, considering that.

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           Just because something's invisible to us
           doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

Mackelway is silent: Something's off here. But he can't say
for sure just yet what it is...

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           Have you ever seen a fifty-foot shark?

                                                         43.


That wasn't just the echo of a question he's heard before; it
was a red flag. A big one. Mackelway tightens.

                        MACKELWAY
           I'm sorry?

                     O'RYAN
           A shark, as we know, will only attack
           humans if he runs out of food. But
           biologists have theorized that for a
           shark of fifty feet the ocean would be an
           endless buffet. He'd never run out of
           food, so he'd have no need to come to the
           surface. Consequently, we would never see
           him. Do you follow?
               (Mackelway doesn't)
           We'll never see one. But that doesn't
           mean they don't exist. Hence Suspect
           Zero.

Mackelway eyes those books on evil, then those ancient
weapons... Casually, almost imperceptibly, he reaches for his
sidearm, as O'Ryan continues:

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           Some of my colleagues think I'm
           fascinated with evil. I think the truth
           is just the opposite: evil is fascinated
           with us. What better vehicle could there
           be for creating havoc in the world - what
           better instrument - than Man? We're vain,
           we're stubborn, we're deceitful, we have
           an imagination that is limitless in its
           perversions. Of course Evil keeps trying
           to harness us. Wouldn't you?

The more he talks, the closer Mackelway comes to extracting
that gun...

Then, disturbing the silence, a KNOCK at the door.

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           Excuse me.

O'Ryan rises, goes to the door... as Mackelway unholsters his
gun. O'Ryan opens the door. Standing here is a COED, with a
backpack. She looks confused.

                     COED
           Oh. I'm sorry. I was looking for
           Professor--

                                                                44.


     Just like that, O'Ryan has bolted past the Coed, literally
     tossing her onto Mackelway, exploding into the hall.

     She screams. Mackelway grabs her, moves her aside as gently as
     time allows, then blows out of the room...

60   INT. BUILDING - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - CONTINUING                   60

     O'Ryan turns a corner, vanishing. Mackelway follows.

61   INT. BUILDING - CORRIDOR CORNER - CONTINUING                     61

     Mackelway finds himself facing another endless corridor: One
     door after another, for what seems like a mile. But no O'Ryan.
     Then Mackelway spots an EXIT SIGN. A stairwell...

62   INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUING                                      62

     Mackelway enters. The stairs go six stories UP from here...
     and one story DOWN. A sub-basement.

     It's a guess. He descends, gun drawn.

63   INT. SUB-BASEMENT - CONTINUING                                   63

     Mackelway emerges. "B-2" looks a lot like B-1: long and
     endless. We hear air moving around us, pipes carrying water,
     the wheezing of an old generator...

     And, on all sides of us, DOOES, a mile of them: maintenance
     offices, supply rooms, labs. He opens one - a janitor's
     supply. No one in here.

     Tries another door. Locked. A second. Locked. A third. Locked.
     Air sucks through a corridor around us. He thinks he hears
     footsteps around a corner. Runs at them.

64   INT. SUB-BASEMENT - CORNER - CONTINUING                          64

     Nothing. No one. Just another vast corridor. More doors.

     Then, a sound. GLASS, shattering on the floor. He runs down
     the corridor, passing a long metal CAGE that houses this
     building's FIVE FURNACES. They're old and wheezy.

     It's dark behind them, shadowy. Not a bad place to hide.

     Farther down the corridor is another door - made of frosted
     glass. A sign on it reads "Neuropsychiatric Lab." That's where
     the sound came from... he thinks.

                                                                 45.


65   INT. SUB-BASEMENT - LAB - CONTINUING                              65

     Mackelway enters. The lab is dark. He throws on every light
     switch within reach... and finds himself standing over the
     shards of what used to be a GLASS BEAKER.

     So he's in the right place. He scans it: five rows of work-
     stations, ten microscopes per row, each with a sink beside it.
     Lining the walls are wide CABINETS.

     But there's also a MINI-LIBRARY down here: Four rows of
     BOOKSHELVES, housing medical journals. These are the "stacks" -
     perfect for hiding behind.

     He plunges in. Row #1. Doesn't see anyone. Then Row #2, Row
     #3, Row #4. Okay, the stacks check out...

     He walks along the rows of work-stations, scanning, crouching,
     nudging open cabinets. One has been opened:

     Bottles of SOLUTIONS sit inside it. And a JAR that's been
     unsealed: It's got GAUZE PADS in it...

     In the back of the room, an INSTRUCTOR'S DESK awaits. It's
     tall enough to hide beneath. Mackelway slinks around it.
     Kneels down, looking into darkness...

     Then, a NOISE. The FRONT DOOR of this lab just swung open...
     And O'Ryan just bolted out. Fuck.

66   INT. SUB-BASEMENT - CORRIDOR - CONTINUING                         66

     Mackelway emerges from the lab. Those furnaces whine beside
     him on the other side of that cage. But a GATE on that cage
     has been left ajar...

67   INT. "FURNACE ROOM" - CONTINUING                                  67

     Five furnaces, separated from the sub-basement corridor by
     steel mesh. Mackelway enters. A few meager BULBS burn.

     He moves amidst shadow and noise: the chugging of engines, the
     humming, the wheezing, a slight vibration to the floor beneath
     us. He walks along the edge of Furnace #1...

     ...and is assaulted, from above.

     O'Ryan falls on him, knocking Mackelway hard into the sharp
     CORNER of that furnace, then down to the ground. Mackelway's
     gun skids across the floor.

     And his mouth, suddenly, has been covered with gauze.

                                                                46.


     He wants to fight back... but suddenly he finds that his head
     is swimming. Something's on that gauze. The room is getting
     fuzzy.

     We see the belly of a furnace - flames, heat. Then our own
     BLOOD... (Mackelway's CHEST was torn open by the corner of
     that furnace.) Wait. Did we just see the glint of a KNIFE?

     O'Ryan is leaning over us, in utter control.

     Then O'Ryan's head turns, abruptly - at the sound of
     FOOTSTEPS. And we hear:

                          MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                Hey! You! What're you doing down here!

     We turn, groggily. TWO JANITORS rush toward us, keys jangling.
     It's all foggy, wavy, distorted.

     We see O'Ryan RISE. Then everything goes black...

                                                      CUT TO:

68   INT. A HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING                                   68

     Mackelway's head is ringing. Feels like he can hear
     electricity in the walls around him. Slowly, he awakens. Above
     him are fluorescent lights. Monitors blink...

     Fran is here. So's Charlton. Mackelway tries to sit up. The
     shock of pain from his chest stops him.

                          FRAN
                How ya doin'?

     Mackelway half-nods. His chest is bandaged.

                          CHARLTON
                We're gonna need everything you can
                remember about this guy, Tom. Physical
                description, any kind of distinguishing
                characteristics.

     That was terse. Charlton looks pretty pissed-off.

                          MACKELWAY
                    (scratchy)
                Where is he?

                          CHARLTON
                The suspect fled. Couple janitors walked
                in on it.
                    (before Mack can ask:)
                          (MORE)

                                                         47.


                     CHARLTON (CONT'D)
           They're fine. But the description they
           gave of him wasn't worth a damn.

Mackelway nods.

                     CHARLTON (CONT'D)
           Case you're curious the real Professor
           Daitz is on sabbatical, out of the
           country. We can't find him.
               (Mackelway nods)
           Whose idea was it to meet there?

                       MACKELWAY
           His, Sir.

                     CHARLTON
           Uh-huh. Did he ask you to come alone?

                       MACKELWAY
           No, Sir.

                     CHARLTON
           But you figured you'd get a bigger pat on
           the head if you wrapped this whole thing
           up without any help - is that it?

The truth? Charlton has him pegged. But:

                     FRAN
           Sir, I'm the one who took the call. Agent
           Mackelway was acting under the assumption
           that I'd already checked the guy out.
           We're both to blame.

Hold it. That was a major exaggeration, if not an outright
lie. Mackelway eyes her, thrown. She's poker-faced.

Charlton, however, seems unmoved...

                     CHARLTON
           Did Agent Mackelway attend the interview
           unaccompanied?

                     FRAN
               (reluctantly)
           Yes, Sir.

                     CHARLTON
           Then whose fuck-up is it?

Mackelway eyes her: "Thanks for trying." She nods.

                                                                 48.


                          MACKELWAY
                    (at Charlton)
                It was... poor judgment, Sir.

                          CHARLTON
                You wanna work alone, start your own
                agency.

     Mackelway can do nothing but nod. Then, bailing him out,
     another COMPOSITE ARTIST enters, tools in hand. Charlton
     sighs, frustrated.

                          CHARLTON (CONT'D)
                    (re: Composite Artist)
                Let's get you two started.

     Composite Artist is ready to begin...

                                                       CUT TO:

69   INT. BAPTIST CHURCH - DAY                                         69

     A lively Sunday Service. Lots of Baptists, singing a rousing
     spiritual. Music and praise filling the room.

     We move along the pews, until we came to the very back row...
     There, one man sits. Alone. Quiet. O'Ryan.

     Odd expression on his face - it's as if he can't hear this
     rousing music, or feel the power of this place. People in the
     next row are stomping their feet. Music soars.

     But O'Ryan just drops his head, slowly... and begins to WEEP
     in the middle of this boisterous congregation.

     Outside, an 18-WHEEL TRUCK can be heard, rumbling by with
     great force. No one else in here seems to hear it.

     But O'Ryan shuts his eyes tight, grieving, sobbing...

70   EXT. STREET - OUTSIDE THE CHURCH - CONTINUING                     70

     That TRUCK has just thundered by, leaving a swirl of debris in
     its wake. We TILT UP from it... to find that those STORMCLOUDS
     once in the distance are upon us now.

     And they are pulsing with menace. Rain, wind, lightning,
     thunder. Like a black wave, about to descend...

71   INTERCUT WITH/INT. FBI OFFICE - "FAX ROOM" - SAME                 71

     One of those five FAX MACHINES begins to ring. Then it begins
     to PRINT.

                                                               49.


     It's a Sunday. No one's here... but we get a look at what's
     coming in. Same TOP-SHEET again: "Attention Agent Thomas
     Mackelway" etc.

     CONTINUE INTERCUT: this incoming fax, set against a few
     tableaus of Americana. Innocence...

72   EXT. HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL STADIUM - SAME                        72

     A high school MARCHING BAND is out here, practicing.
     Cheerleaders work on their routines nearby.

     Then a LOUD WHISTLE SOUNDS. It's the BAND-LEADER, who is
     taking note of the weather gathering overhead. The music from
     the band ceases.

                          BAND-LEADER
                Everybody into the gym!

     The band-members start to move. LIGHTNING erupts overhead.

73   EXT. UNIDENTIFIED HOME - BACKYARD - SAME                        73

     An unnamed MOTHER emerges onto her back-porch, where her FIVE-
     YEAR OLD DAUGHTER is having a playdate with a FRIEND.

     This house borders a wooded area. That wind is starting to
     make the trees swirl.

                          MOTHER
                Girls, I want you to come in now.
                Startin' to rain.

     The girls sigh, disappointed, deciding instead to hide
     themselves inside the TENT they've erected out here.

     They giggle. The mother doesn't. CONTINUE INTERCUT:

74   INT. FBI OFFICE - "FAX ROOM" - RESUMING                         74

     That fax is now printing page after page. Photos with HAVE YOU
     SEEN ME? across the top and vitals across the bottom.

     But this time the transmission isn't stopping at five. There
     are at least TEN sitting in the tray. Maybe twenty. Faces.
     Eyes. Stats. Locations. Innocence violated...

75   EXT. PARK - SAME                                                75

     A SOCCER GAME's been called in the middle of the Second Half.
     PARENTS and their uniformed 12 YEAR-OLDS scatter.

     RAIN is pouring down now, blown sideways by that wind.

                                                                 50.


76   INT. THE 18-WHEELER - SAME                                        76

     That massive, gleaming beast that rumbled past the church now
     rolls right by this park - as all of those kids and their
     parents scramble for the shelter of their cars.

     The windshield wipers on this truck push water away, giving us
     a clear look at the wet suburban chaos.

77   INT. BAPTIST CHURCH - RESUMING                                    77

     The faithful in here keep singing, their voices full with
     praise - despite the heavy weather outside. They feel safe in
     here. We move along the PEWS...

     ...until we find O'Ryan's. He's not here anymore.

78   EXT. BAPTIST CHURCH - SAME                                        78

     O'Ryan leans against the door of the church, pelted by that
     heavy rain.

     BAM! Here comes those IMAGES AGAIN:

79   EXT. WHEAT FIELD - NIGHT - RESUMING                               79

     Tall wheat, whipped by wind and rain. A muzzle-flash. The
     sound of a body slumping hard to the ground.

     ...and Mackelway, looking over us. Then:

80   EXT. BAPTIST CHURCH - RESUMING                                    80

     We're back with O'Ryan. He leans against the door, his
     torment constant.

     He walks away from the church, into that heavy rain.

81   INT. FBI OFFICE - "FAX ROOM" - RESUMING                           81

     The fax tray has overflown onto the floor - 200 more photos,
     200 more HAVE YOU SEEN ME's. Forgotten victims. We hear a last
     rumble from that 18-WHEELER. END INTERCUT...

                                                      CUT TO:

82   INT. FBI OFFICE - "O'RYAN ROOM" - LATE NIGHT                      82

     Now there are 800 YELLOW PINS stuck in this map - one for
     every single FAX or LETTER that's been received in the past
     weeks.

                                                                 51.


     800 faces. 800 HAVE YOU SEEN ME's, represented by 800 pins in
     800 cities. It's like a national plague.

     Mackelway sits, examining it soberly. His chest-wound is
     killing him. (We see a thick bandage beneath his shirt.)

     In his pocket now is a bottle of PRESCRIPTION PILLS. Percodan.
     He slugs one down without water, his eyes never straying from
     that map.

     Beside it is a COMPOSITE DRAWING from O'Ryan, taken from
     Mackelway's description. It's dead-on...

                                                      CUT TO:

83   EXT. LONGHORN DINER WICHITA FALLS - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING          83

     This is the lone source of light on an otherwise dark stretch
     of road. Mackelway's Yukon pulls up.

84   INT. LONGHORN DINER WICHITA FALLS - MOMENTS LATER                 84

     Hardly a sound in here. Mackelway stands at the register,
     paying for his TAKE-OUT. Another night with nothing but his
     thoughts for company. Great. Then:

                          A YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                Agent Mackelway?

     It's Katie, the receptionist from his office - sitting by
     herself in a nearby booth. Mackelway smiles.

                          KATIE (CONT'D)
                Hi.

                                                      CUT TO:

85   INT. KATIE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - LATER NIGHT                    85

     Inexpensive, but furnished with all the touches that
     Mackelway's apartment lacks: flea-market stuff, lace, antique
     books, photos from other eras. Character.

     And candles. Lots of candles. They throw SHADOWS of Mackelway
     and Katie all over the walls.

     An odd MUSIC fills the room, coming from a BOOM-BOX on the
     floor. It's a rhythmic Navajo CHANT, with Native-American
     drums providing the pulse.

     It's eery, tuneless, but awfully authentic... and it fits the
     intensity of the moment: Mackelway and Katie, coupling madly,
     their eyes locked. She's breathless.

                                                                52.


     First time we've seen him shirtless since his injury in that
     furnace room. A FAT BANDAGE covers a quarter of his chest.
     Dried blood can be seen beneath it.

     There's an intensity in his eyes. The chanting, the candles,
     Katie's body, his wound... they've conspired to bring an
     intensity into his eyes. It's dark, primal.

     And he's been expressing it for an hour without relent...
     which is why Katie gasps one last gasp, then rolls to the edge
     of the bed, exhausted.

     She reaches for that boom-box, lowers the volume. The chanting
     dies down into silence. She catches her breath.

                          KATIE
                    (softly)
                I can't anymore.

     Mackelway eyes her, then reaches past her, and turns the
     VOLUME on that boom-box back UP. The chanting fills the room
     again.

     And just like that, he has pulled her back onto him, urgently.
     That primal side hasn't been sated yet...

                                                      CUT TO:

86   INT. KATIE'S APT. - BATHROOM - LATER NIGHT                       86

     Mackelway stands at the mirror, changing the dressing on that
     wound across his chest. He unwraps the gauze over that fat
     bandage soaked through with blood.

     He pulls the bandage off, giving us a better look at the deep
     gash. Dried blood, torn skin, bruising. Looks like hell. But
     Mackelway eyes it calmly.

     He slugs down some beer from a nearby bottle, then cleans the
     wound with some Hydrogen Peroxide... as Katie appears in the
     doorway. She eyes him.

                          KATIE
                Can't sleep?

     He shrugs, turns.

                          MACKELWAY
                What was that music?

                          KATIE
                It's Navajo. A song for dead warriors. I
                never played it for anybody before.
                          (MORE)

                                                                 53.


                          KATIE (CONT'D)
                    (a beat)
                Just had a feeling you'd like it.

                          MACKELWAY
                How?

                          KATIE
                I dunno. The way you stare when you think
                nobody's looking.

     She shrugs. Silence hovers...

                                                      CUT TO:

87   INT. KATIE'S APT. - BEDROOM - PRE-DAWN                            87

     4:30 a.m. Rain pounds the window and roof, a real storm out
     there. The boom box is still. The candles are down to their
     nubs. Katie continues to sleep. Mackelway too.

     Then his eyes SNAP OPEN.

     Something just hit him, something huge. One of those 4:30-in-
     the-morning ideas that has to be expressed. Now.

                                                      CUT TO:

88   INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - 5 A.M.                                       88

     Mackelway stands outside Room 217 at a Mariott. He's just
     knocked on the door.

     Fran opens it, in a robe. Very confused. He looks manic.

                          FRAN
                What're you--

                          MACKELWAY
                I can't get a read on this guy.

     Two minutes ago, she was sound asleep.

                          FRAN
                Huh?

                          MACKELWAY
                Why is he sending us all this shit? I've
                got 800 pins in that map, 800 missing
                people. What's he telling us?

     She gets it now: he's on a combination of painkillers and lack
     of sleep. Or maybe she can sense where he's been...

                                                       54.


                     MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
               (rapid-fire)
           He kills a travelling salesman, then a
           school-teacher. Then Starkey? It doesn't
           connect.

                     FRAN
           You're a mess...

                     MACKELWAY
           I'm fine. I'm clear. I just didn't think
           this could wait. Fran, this guy is trying
           to point us at something. Starkey's part
           of it. But the other two don't connect.

                     FRAN
           Did you drive here?

                     MACKELWAY
           I'm fine! I just need somebody to think
           this through with me! He wanted to meet
           me. It's like he was interviewing me
           somehow. What is that? Then he kills
           Starkey. So what was he doing with Speck
           and Fulcher?

                     FRAN
           You wanna come in?

                     MACKELWAY
           No. No. You come out. Get dressed.

                     FRAN
           Out where?

                     MACKELWAY
           I dunno. Somewhere. We're right on the
           edge of this thing.

She studies him. A long beat.

                     FRAN
           I'm going back to bed. You're welcome to
           the couch if you want. I think you could
           do with some sleep.

He sags a bit. She reaches for his hand.

                     FRAN (CONT'D)
               (gently)
           Mack...

                                                                  55.


     Just like that, there is contact. Their hands. It surprises
     them both.

     He appreciates it, but now's not the time. So he smiles
     thinly, turns, and goes.

     She watches him vanish around a corner.

                                                        CUT TO:

89   EXT. HAROLD SPECK'S HOUSE - 6:00 A.M.                              89

     We've been to this house before. Suburbia.

     Mackelway sits in his car, at the curb, studying the place.
     Rain falls in sheets, wind blows. And there he is, all alone,
     six in the morning, staring at a house.

     That idea - the thought that snapped his eyes open - it's
     still working on him. Beside him is the DRAWING that was found
     in Speck's car:

     The rendering of a steamer-trunk, lined with plastic,
     containing body parts in plastic bags... Mackelway seems to be
     fixated on it now.

     A hand knocks on the front door. Jan Speck opens up.

                          JAN
                    (hoping for good news:)
                Agent Mackelway?

     Mackelway stands in the doorway, rain falling behind him.

                           MACKELWAY
                    (all business)
                Mrs. Speck. Just had a few more
                questions.

                                                        CUT TO:

91   INT. SPECK'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER                   91

     Mackelway sits at the WINDOW, looking over the backyard.
     Nothing special out here: some trees, a swing, a storm-cellar
     door.

     But he's staring at it, intently. We're not sure why.

                                                         56.


Behind him, Jan re-enters, purse over her shoulder, umbrella
in hand. She grabs his cup of coffee and saucer from the
coffee table.

                     JAN
           I'm sorry I don't have more time, Agent
           Mackelway. It's my PTA Day.

                     MACKELWAY
           It's fine. I should've called.

She smiles tightly: "I have to go now" and heads for the
kitchen. Once she's there, Mackelway turns to the BACK DOOR
and UNLOCKS IT, eyeing that storm-cellar outside...

She leaves the cup in the sink. He enters the kitchen.

                     JAN
           I hope I was of some help.

                     MACKELWAY
           You were. Thanks.

                     JAN
           A friend of mine said I'll feel like this
           one month for every year we were
           together. Sort of a grieving rule-of-
           thumb. Have you ever heard that?

                      MACKELWAY
               (gently)
           No. Sorry.

She half-smiles. He turns to the door. Turns back.

                     MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
           Oh. There was one other thing: Did he
           keep any kind of chemicals around the
           house? Acids, that sort of thing?

                      JAN
           No. Why?

He shrugs, dismissing it:

                     MACKELWAY
           It's nothing. Trace elements we found on
           his trunk. Any interest in chemistry?
           Maybe as a hobby?

Jan pauses for a moment, as if recovering a faint memory...
Then she shakes it off. He lets it go.

                                                                  57.


                          MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
                Anyway, thank you. And thanks for the
                coffee. Next time I'll call first, I
                promise.

                          JAN
                No trouble at all.

                                                        CUT TO:

92   EXT. SPECK'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER                                 92

     Mackelway sits in his car. Through his windshield we see Jan
     as she backs out of the driveway.

     She pulls past us, giving Mackelway as friendly a wave as a
     grieving widow can give. He waves back.

     Then she's gone, disappearing around a corner.

     Mackelway pauses a beat, checking his rear-view mirror to be
     sure. Then he gets out of his car...

                                                        CUT TO:

93   EXT. SPECK'S HOUSE - SIDE GATE - MOMENTS LATER                     93

     Mackelway sneaks around the side of the house, pulling on a
     lever to unlatch the side-gate.

94   EXT. SPECK'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - CONTINUING                         94

     He emerges into the tiny backyard, making a bee-line for that
     storm cellar door.

     He knows he shouldn't be doing this. It's beyond risky. But
     here he is, without a warrant.

     There's no lock on the cellar door. He reaches for it. Then he
     stops himself. Just noticed something:
     A NEIGHBOR-LADY, visible just over Speck's backyard fence, is
     looking right at him through her bedroom window.

     Fuck it. He enters the storm cellar.

95   INT. SPECK'S STORM CELLAR - CONTINUING                             95

     Seven steps, leading to a dusty cement floor. Mackelway looks
     around.

                                                                58.


     Facing him are the things a meticulous man would store in case
     of disaster: Cans of food, sternos, sleeping mats, drums of
     potable water.

     And long FOOT-LOCKERS. Two of them. That's where Mackelway's
     eyes go, instantly. He hurries to them.

     Throws one open. Nothing but sheets and blankets inside. He
     paws through it... finding nothing else.

     He throws the other trunk open. Inside? Pillows. Fuck.

     He slams it shut, looks to those cans of food, stacked on
     shelves. He approaches the shelves, jostling cans from their
     rows, making more noise than he ought to.

     But he finds nothing behind them... except more cans. He
     approaches those two huge drums of water, lugs them aside.
     Behind them is a tall CUPBOARD, locked.

     He pulls at the cupboard door, hard. It splinters.

     Inside, a rifle and some boxes of ammo... same as you'd find
     in every other storm-cellar in Texas.

     He pauses: Am I crazy...?

                                                      CUT TO:

96   EXT. SPECK'S BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER                            96

     He emerges from the storm-cellar, confused. Shuts the storm-
     cellar door.

     Then he turns. Something else just caught his eye:

     Above Speck's bedroom window is another window, a tiny one. An
     attic...

     He heads for that UNLOCKED BACK DOOR, and enters...

97   INT. SPECK'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUING                    97

     He hurries toward the stairs, reaches them... then spots
     something through the Entry Hall window:

     On the street outside, pulling up to the curb... is a POLICE
     CAR. Sirens off. That Neighbor-Lady must've placed the call.
     And here's Mackelway, without a warrant. Shit.

     Two ABILENE COPS get out, approaching the house. Mackelway
     climbs the stairs.

                                                               59.


98    INT. SPECK'S HOUSE - STAIRS - CONTINUING                        98

      If he stays quiet, he might just pull this off.

99    INT. SPECK'S HOUSE - SECOND STORY - CONTINUING                  99

      A tiny hallway, with four doors. Up ahead, dangling from the
      ceiling, is a tiny rope which promises a set of hidden fold-
      out stairs... and an attic.

      Mackelway tugs on the rope. The fold-out stairs drop down out
      of the ceiling. Then he hears:

                           NEIGHBOR LADY (O.S.)
                 He's inside! He's inside! Went in through
                 the back!

      ...which means he has mere seconds before this all blows to
      hell. So he climbs up those fold-out stairs.

      The two ABILENE COPS now circle the house, entering through
      the back-porch door, just as Mackelway did.

      He pulls up the folding stairs. Maybe the guys'll do a half-
      assed search and then leave...

100   INT. SPECK'S HOUSE - ATTIC_- CONTINUING                        100

      Mackelway looks around: lots of dusty junk around here - old
      clothes, mementoes.

      ...and one more trunk. A steamer-trunk. Huge. And locked.
      Looks just like the one in that DRAWING rendered by O'Ryan...

      Mackelway races for it. Takes out his gun, uses the butt-end
      to bust the lock off. Throws it open.

      ...as we hear the sound of those fold-out steps, being tugged
      down from the second-floor hallway. And:
                           ABILENE COP #1 (O.S.)
                 Freeze, Asshole!

      The COP is just ten feet away, most of him still concealed by
      those steps - gun trained right on us.

      But Mackelway seems utterly untroubled.

                           MACKELWAY
                     (calmly)
                 It's okay, Fellas. FBI.

                                                                 60.


                             ABILENE COP #1
                 I'll bet.

      Mackelway drops his gun, kicks it toward the cop, who doesn't
      quite know what to make of that.

      Also confusing him is the odd smile playing its way across
      Mackelway's face. But we understand it now:

      The inside of that steamer-trunk is filled with BODY PARTS:
      bagged, stacked, and sealed in Ziplocs...

      Powdered LIME is sprinkled on them.

      Mackelway stares, at once satisfied and sickened. COP #1 can
      be heard, approaching across the attic floor. His gun is
      drawn...

      ...until he too sees what's in there.

                           ABILENE COP #1 (CONT'D)
                 Oh Jesus Christ...

                                                       CUT TO:

      ...a Grammar-School CLASS PICTURE: of Barney Fulcher and his
      2nd Graders, sitting on a mantle. We are...

101   INT. FULCHER'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - BOULDER - DAY                101

      That picture sits beside other photos, awards, plaques - all
      celebrating Fulcher's career in Colorado education.

      We turn away from that mantle, blowing through this modest
      Living Room, finding an open door - leading down to:

102   INT. FULCHER'S HOME - BASEMENT - CONTINUING                      102

      Down the steps we go, until we hear the HUM of an old FREEZER.
      We turn toward the sound.

      The freezer is open. A team of FORENSICS GUYS study it.

      Inside this freezer, frozen into a block of ice... are six
      female HANDS. No arms, no heads. Just six slender hands, each
      with a wedding band on the ring finger.

      Mackelway stands in the back of this basement, taking it all
      in. He looks to Charlton, who is expressionless.

                                                       CUT TO:

                                                              61.


102a EXT. FULCHER'S HOUSE - DUSK                                102a

     Close on Mackelway as he returns to his Yukon satisfied. He is
     pleased with himself. Out of nowhere, a firm hand grasps his
     right shoulder stopping him.

     Mackelway turns abruptly, finding himself sandwiched between
     his Yukon and Charlton, who is now in his face.

                          CHARLTON
                Listen to me Cowboy. You have any idea
                the kind of favors I had to pull with the
                Abilene cops to cover your ass?!

                          MACKELWAY
                Sir...

                          CHARLTON
                    (not allowing him to talk)
                Breaking and ENTERING the Speck house
                without a shred of evidence and NO
                WARRANT?!

                          MACKELWAY
                    (not going down without a
                     fight)
                The sample I took from Speck's bumper...
                It's crystallized sulfuric acid mixed with
                oil of Clove, the clove neutralizes the
                odor of the acid.

     Charlton shakes his head, he is not getting through.

                          MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
                It was SPECK not his killer who was
                hiding something.

                          CHARLTON
                Ever ask yourself why a big shot agent
                from Dallas gets sent down to the
                Wichita Falls Field Office? I'll give
                you TWO WORDS... Hell I'll even write it
                down for ya.

     Charlton leans in to emphasize his point. He pulls out a pad
     and pencil from his breast pocket and writes what he says using
     Mackelway's chest as support. It's humiliating.

                          CHARLTON (CONT'D)
                "EVIDENTIARY PROCEDURE." Don't talk about
                it. Learn it.

                                                                 62.


      Those words just hang there, haunting Mackelway. Charlton
      tears off the sheet with those two words and stuffs them into
      Mackelway's hand.

                           CHARLTON (CONT'D)
                 Turns out you were right about this guy.
                 You were right about both of them. But
                 that doesn't change the fact that you
                 went about your business like a rookie.
                 Got it?

      Charlton turns, the buzz of a street lamp breaks the silence
      throwing a circle of light around the Yukon. Mackelway watches
      as Charlton puts on his headlights and drives away.

      A sudden gust of wind tears that piece of paper out of
      Mackelway's hand, he stares at it, as it disappears into
      darkness.

103   INT. FBI OFFICE - THE O'RYAN ROOM - EVENING                      103

      Everything yet known about the murders of Speck, Fulcher, and
      Starkey fills the wall space in here:

      We see O'Ryan's MAP: All those yellow pins... and the one blue
      one, (Greenville, Tx.) Also, that DRAWING: of the ghastly
      Ziploc bags inside a steamer trunk. Damn thing seems prescient
      now.

      Agents mill about, awaiting a conference.

                           GRIEVES
                     (passing by)
                 Nice job, Mack.

                           MACKELWAY
                 Thanks.

      A few OTHER AGENTS also pat him on the back. Fran's proud of
      him too - we can see it. In fact everyone in here seems to be
      giving Mackelway his due. It all feels good.

      Charlton enters.

                           CHARLTON
                 Seated please.

      The agents find seats around the table. Charlton takes his
      place at the head of it.

                                                                 63.


                           CHARLTON (CONT'D)
                     (to the assembled:)
                 Okay. We've got a serial killer of serial
                 killers.

      Fran scribbles something on a piece of paper: "What a genius!"
      Slides it over. Mackelway conceals the note, as:

                           CHARLTON (CONT'D)
                     (still grand-standing)
                 He's a transient with a history of mental
                 illness. He also happens to think he's a
                 former agent of this Bureau. And he is
                 pursuing something that he calls "Suspect
                 Zero." Anybody got anything intelligent
                 to say?

      Nobody's volunteering.   There's just silence.

                           CHARLTON (CONT'D)
                     (familiar refrain)
                 That's what I thought...

                                                       CUT TO:

104   OMIT                                                             104

105   EXT. WICHITA FALLS FBI OFFICE - PARKING LOT - NIGHT              105

      Mackelway exits the office, heading for his Yukon.

      Then he stops... because Katie is waiting out here, leaning
      against her Toyota Camry.

                           MACKELWAY
                     (fondly)
                 Hey.

                           KATIE
                 Somethin', huh? Guy with a wife and kids
                 keepin' bodies in his attic?

      He nods... but what is she doing out here?

                           MACKELWAY
                 Yeah.
                     (a beat)
                 You okay?

                           KATIE
                 Yeah. Just... Wondered if you could do me
                 a favor.

                                                                  64.


      Mackelway waits... as Katie hands over a manila envelope.
      Mackelway opens it.

      Inside, a photo of a heartbreakingly-sweet 22 year-old girl
      named KAREN SUMPTER, with an attached sheet listing her
      vitals: height, weight, age, etc.

      Another face. Another disappearance...

                            KATIE (CONT'D)
                 Her name's Karen Sumpter. We were
                 friends.
                     (almost reluctantly)
                 She disappeared last year. Nobody knows
                 where. She was a little wild, but not
                 like that.

      Her sadness is obvious. Mackelway nods.

                           KATIE (CONT'D)
                 Anyway, I know you're gonna be in on the
                 autopsies - of the girls they found over
                 at Speck's. Figured you might see if one
                 of 'em was...

      Her voice trails off. This is hard.

                           KATIE (CONT'D)
                 If it is, I'd like to be the one to
                 notify her folks. Out families've been
                 friends for years.

                           MACKELWAY
                     (gently)
                 Sure. Of course.

                           KATIE
                 Thanks... 'Night.

      Mackelway puts the envelope under his arm. She starts up the
      Camry. The sky rumbles. He eyes her.

      For some reason, she hasn't pulled away yet...

                                                 SMASH CUT TO:

106   INT. KATIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                      106

      Candles. Shadows on the wall...and Mackelway and Katie, at it
      again, with the sounds of that eery Navajo CHANTING coming
      from the boom-box.

                                                                 65.


      Mackelway is studying her, staring into her eyes, her
      breathing. She's beginning to climax now... and those eyes go
      wider. We MOVE INTO THEM, and:

      We are abruptly SLAMMED, again, INTO ANOTHER SET OF THOSE ODD,
      DISJOINTED IMAGES from that unidentified place:

107   EXT. DARKNESS - UNIDENTIFIED TIME - NIGHT                        107

      Wet wind in a blur of gray. The sound of our own heavy
      breathing. A voice rising above the wind, pleading:

                             (O.S.)
                 Please...

108   INT. KATIE'S BEDROOM - RESUMING                                  108

      She is utterly lost now. And that CHANTING seems to have
      gotten louder somehow.

      IMAGES FLICK at us now: culled from that BOOK on TRIBAL RITUAL
      AND TRANCE, found at the halfway house: a TRIBESMAN with eyes
      rolling back in his head, foaming at the mouth.

      Mackelway tries to shake it off, tries to keep his focus on
      Katie. He buries his head into her neck, as:

109   EXT. WHEAT FIELD - NIGHT                                         109

      Tall wheat, wet wind. Then a MUZZLE FLASH, and a body slumping
      to the ground. And suddenly we are in:

110   INT. ANOTHER UNIDENTIFIED MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - NIGHT 110

      O'Ryan, at a desk. He has just "remote viewed" these images
      somehow. And they've left him rattled.

      It's time to get out of this room. Quickly.

                                                       CUT TO:

111   EXT. ROAD - DENTON, TEXAS - SAME (NIGHT)                         111

      A stolen, non-descript CHEVY pulls out of a motel room parking
      lot, on to the street.

112   INT. STOLEN CAR - DRIVING - CONTINUING                           112

      O'Ryan is behind the wheel, driving.

                                                                  66.


113   INT. STOLEN CAR - DRIVING - MOMENTS LATER (DUSK)                  113

      The radio is BLASTING - anything to shake those images out of
      his head. Driving, unsettled... which may be why he doesn't
      notice that there's a SIREN wailing behind him.

      He looks in the rear-view. A TEXAS STATE TROOPER is on his
      tail. Shit. O'Ryan tightens, pulling over...

114   INT./EXT. STOLEN CAR - ROADSIDE - CONTINUING                      114

      The TROOPER approaches, noting the condition of the vehicle.
      He stands before O'Ryan's window. O'Ryan's face reveals no
      evidence at all of anxiety.

                            TROOPER
                 Evening.

                           O'RYAN
                 Evening, Officer.

                           TROOPER
                 See your license, Sir?

                           O'RYAN
                 'Course. Is there a problem?

      O'Ryan reaches into his back pocket, produces an I.D. Hands it
      over.

      Trooper eyes it. According to this i.d., we are now staring at
      "James Garvey" from Littleton, Colorado. But the Trooper
      doesn't seem too convinced.

                           TROOPER
                 See your registration, please?

                            O'RYAN
                 Sure.

      O'Ryan opens up the glove compartment, starts searching
      through it. But it's a stall, that's obvious.

                           TROOPER
                 Mind stepping out of the car, please?

      O'Ryan pauses. There is no way in hell he's going to let
      himself get deterred by a State Trooper. But he gets out.

115   EXT. ROADSIDE - CONTINUING                                        115

      Trooper eyes him with caution. O'Ryan holds his hands in front
      of his chest, keeping them visible to the guy.

                                                         67.


                     O'RYAN
           Officer, I am carrying something that
           could be construed as a weapon. I'd like
           to hand it over, voluntarily, so you
           won't think I'm trying to conceal
           anything. Would that be all right?

                     TROOPER
           What kind of weapon, Sir?

                     O'RYAN
           It's a hunting knife, right here on my
           hip.

Trooper notes the shape of that large, sheathed KNIFE - the
one O'Ryan butchered Starkey with - visible beneath O'Ryan's
shirt.

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           I was on my way to the woods. My gear's
           in the trunk.
               (Trooper doubts it)
           Would you like me to hand it to you? I
           don't know what the procedure is for
           something like this.

                     TROOPER
           Take the weapon off your hip, place it on
           the ground, and kick it toward me.

                       O'RYAN
           Happy to.

O'Ryan takes the knife off his hip. The size of it gets some
attention from the Trooper.

                     TROOPER
           What exactly were you planning on
           hunting, Sir?

                     O'RYAN
           A fifty-foot shark.

No reply. O'Ryan drops the menacing knife to the ground and
kicks it toward the Trooper.

Trooper, slowly, kneels down to get it - never taking his eyes
off O'Ryan.

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           Ya know, I used to be in law enforcement
           too.

                                                                  68.


                           TROOPER
                     (kneeling)
                 That right?

                            O'RYAN
                 Mmm-hmmm. FBI. 'Course this was some
                 years ago.

      Trooper grabs the knife, straightens. Examines it.

                           O'RYAN (CONT'D)
                 Psy Ops. Classified.

                           TROOPER
                 Had anything to drink tonight, Sir? Under
                 medication of any kind?

      An 18-WHEEL TRUCK rumbles by, distracting O'Ryan... rendering
      him immobile for a moment.

                           TROOPER (CONT'D)
                 Sir?

                           O'RYAN
                 Oh. Sorry. Just found myself wondering
                 what was inside that truck.

                           TROOPER
                 Sir, I'm going to ask you to hand me the
                 keys to your vehicle, please.

                           O'RYAN
                 Of course.

      O'Ryan opens the car door. We steal a look INSIDE.

      ...he's got a GUN under the front seat.

      In a flash, that gun is in his hands and pointing right at the
      forehead of that Trooper.

      Trooper knows he's been had. And he knows that he's about to
      die...

                                                        CUT TO:

116   OMIT                                                              116

117   EXT. MACKELWAY'S APARTMENT - DOORWAY - EVENING                    117

      Mackelway approaches, carrying a greasy bag: another Frito Pie
      and a soda. Fumbles with his keys... Then he notices
      something, waiting on his doorstep.

                                                               69.


      It's a thick FILE, roughly 150 pages, in a FOLDER. The word
      "MACKELWAY" is written across the front.

      He leans down, opens the folder. The light is spotty out
      here... but it's just strong enough to show us the expression
      on his face: a look of pure awe.

118   INT. MACKELWAY'S APARTMENT - ENTRY - CONTINUING                118

      The door bursts open. The greasy bag and the soda fall to the
      floor. Mackelway hurries to a phone, clutching that file. He
      dials hurriedly.

119   INTERCUT WITH/INT. FRAN'S CAR - SAME                           119

      We're in a PARKING LOT outside a WAL-MART. Fran's just thrown
      a bag into her Ford Taurus. Her CEL-PHONE RINGS. She grabs it.

                           FRAN (INTO CEL)
                 Kulok.

                           MACKELWAY (INTO PHONE)
                 He really was FBI.

                           FRAN
                 Huh?

                           MACKELWAY
                 O'Ryan. He left his file on my doorstep.
                 Fran, he was FBI.

      He can barely believe it himself, but we get a look at what
      was in that file now; PAGES are splayed across Mackelway's
      coffee table:

      A copy of an FBI I.D. BADGE, xeroxed memoes, test scores,
      citations, evaluations, reports. The entire career of Special
      Agent Benjamin O'Ryan... in black and white.

                          FRAN
                That's impossible.

                          MACKELWAY
                I'm look at his whole history!
                Citations, letters of commendation, even
                his fucking test scores from Quantico.
                The guy was an agent.

                          FRAN
                I don't believe it.

                          MACKELWAY
                Listen to me--

                                                         70.


Then we hear a BEEP. Call-Waiting. Great.

                     MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
           Shit! Hold on.

That irritated her. Mackelway clicks over.

                     MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
           Yes?

                     O'RYAN (THRU PHONE)
           Read anything interesting lately?

Mackelway's eyes go wide.

                     MACKELWAY
           Where are you?

CLICK. O'Ryan's just hung up.

                     MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
           Shit!

He stares at the phone, then clicks over again, re-connecting
to Fran.

                     MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
           That was him.

                     FRAN
           He called you at home?

                     MACKELWAY
           Yes.

BEEP. Call-Waiting again.

                     FRAN
           Jesus. Call me back.

Mackelway clicks over again without saying goodbye.

                     MACKELWAY (INTO PHONE)
           O'Ryan?

                     O'RYAN (THRU PHONE)
           I've found him, you know.

                     MACKELWAY
           Who?

                     O'RYAN
           Zero.

                                                          71.


                     MACKELWAY
           Zero's a myth. You made him up.

                     O'RYAN
           Myths don't kidnap little boys. Do they?

                     MACKELWAY
           Do you?

Sounds like O'Ryan just laughed... Then, another curve:

                     O'RYAN
           Was she pretty?

                     MACKELWAY
           Huh?

                     O'RYAN
           I could hear her moaning, right under the
           Navajo chanting. Whole thing was
           downright tribal. What's she look like?

That was unsettling. Very. Mackelway looks around feeling
violated, feeling "watched." He draws the blinds. Double bolts
the front door. Runs his hand under the window frame for any
kind of wire tapping.

But Mackelway won't allow himself to over-react. Not now, with
O'Ryan on the phone.

                     MACKELWAY
               (calmly)
           You tell me.

O'Ryan laughs. He liked that.

                     O'RYAN
           Fair enough. We'll stick to business:
           How'd ya like my old room?

                     MACKELWAY
           Huh?

                     O'RYAN
           "Hope House." You were there.

How the hell did he know that? It's unsettling.

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           Dyson re-paint it?
               (no reply)
           My room. Did he re-paint it?

                                                                  72.

                           MACKELWAY
                 Yeah. White.

                           O'RYAN
                 ...But you saw what was underneath, of
                 course.

                           MACKELWAY
                 No. Tell me about it.

                           O'RYAN
                 No. You tell me.

      CLICK. O'Ryan just hung up. Mackelway stares at the phone.

                                                        CUT TO:

120   INT. HOPE HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT (9 P.M.)                          120

      More rain falls outside. Lightning too. Mackelway waits here.
      Piper's in his usual spot in front of the TV. Dyson descends
      the stairs, a bit testy tonight.

                           DYSON
                 Welcome back.

      That had some edge. Mackelway doesn't reply.

                                                        CUT TO:

121   INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM/HALLWAY - NIGHT            121

      Mackelway stands in the center of this room, Dyson in the
      doorway. That SINGER down the hall is at it again, off-key as
      ever. Tonight it's the "Gilligan's Island" theme-song.

                           DYSON
                 I'll be in my office.

      Dyson backs away, leaving the door ajar.

      Now Mackelway is alone - eyeing the tiny bed, sink, window,
      the leaky ceiling, the bucket, the peeling paint. This room is
      heaving with energy...

      He sits on the bed, checks his watch. 9:05 p.m.

      Opposite this bed is that WALL, re-painted in industrial
      white, with the hint of a shape underneath. It's what
      Mackelway's come here to investigate. INTERCUT WITH...

                                                                 73.


122   INT. MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - SAME                           122

      O'Ryan sits at a desk: eyes closed, writing pad at his wrist.
      On it, more of those unidentifiable lines become visible to
      us. They're called IDEOGRAMS.

      He holds the point of his pen down upon one of them, as if
      receiving information from it, and we jump back into:

123   INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM - RESUMING                123

      Mackelway. Sitting. Staring. Outside this room we hear that
      awful, toneless singing as it fills the hallway.

      Mackelway rises, approaching that re-painted wall. He pulls
      out his keys. Checks to see that no one's watching.

124   INT. MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - RESUMING                       124

      O'Ryan, his pen on that pad, his concentration total.

125   INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM - RESUMING                125

      We hear the singing, the TV, the rain, that bucket collecting
      drips. Semi-darkness... until MORE LIGHTNING throws a burst of
      white light against that wall.

      A faint shape becomes visible, just beneath the white paint.
      Then it vanishes again.

      Using his keys, he begins to scratch away at the white paint.
      It's an irrational thing to do - but in the context of the
      last few days it makes an odd kind of sense.

      Instantly, a hint of BLACK can be seen underneath...

126   INT. MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - RESUMING                       126

      O'Ryan, at that desk. Outside, he can hear an 18-WHEEL TRUCK
      rumble by. He doesn't allow it to distract him.

127   INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM - RESUMING                127

      Mackelway scratches more of the white paint off of that wall.
      More BLACKNESS appears beneath it. Then, a SOUND behind him.
      He turns.

      The door to this room just SHUT; someone outside must've
      pushed it. He keeps scratching at the paint.

      LIGHTNING rages outside. We PULL BACK, away from that wall,
      which gives us the opportunity to see something that Mackelway
      is too close to the wall to see for himself:

                                                                  74.


      There is indeed an image beneath that thin coat of white
      paint. It is the shape of a vast, black WAVE. A hand-painted
      image as large as this wall itself.

      Mackelway seems tiny by comparison, and the mere inch of black
      that he has uncovered so far seems infinitesimal.

      In fact, it almost look as if the wave is poised to swallow
      him whole... and he can't even see it.

      But we can. Must've taken O'Ryan days to paint something this
      large. A vast, black wave. Evil itself...

      And Mackelway, without meaning to, is about to unleash it.

128   INT. MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - RESUMING                        128

      O'Ryan, somehow, seems to be sensing what is going on in that
      room. Or maybe he's just feeling the power of that wave, from
      memory. Or maybe he's just plain crazy.

      But he and Mackelway, on some unspoken psychic level, are
      feeding one another...

129   INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM - RESUMING                 129

      Mackelway chips away at that white paint, moving rapidly,
      revealing more of the blackness underneath. We PUSH IN on it,
      moving past Mackelway and his frantic scraping.

      Then we're beneath that thin coat of white, and:

130   INT. INSIDE THE BLACK WAVE - UNDETERMINED TIME                    130

      Somehow, we've submerged into the wave itself. A black, tidal
      force of nature.

      And it is MOVING. Alive. We hear the SOUNDS of it: a sucking,
      a yawning, as if a tide were drawing back just before
      exploding forward.

      The sounds blend in with the wind, the rain, the drops in that
      bucket... Evil itself, on the move, gathering might. And we're
      along for the ride...

      The wave begins to roll forward now as if shot from a cannon.
      It is massive, powerful, dark. And we're right on its forward
      edge, as if surfing it somehow.

131   INT. MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - RESUMING                        131

      O'Ryan reacts. Something just changed:

                                                                  75.


132   INT. INSIDE THE BLACK WAVE - RESUMING                             132

      The wave is rushing us forward with this speed and power of a
      tsunami.

      ...which is when we hear the laughter of a LITTLE BOY.

133   INT. MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - RESUMING                        133

      O'Ryan just heard it too. Then new images come at him - but
      they are, at first, GRAINY, CHOPPY...

134   EXT. UNIDENTIFIED PLAY AREA - SAME                                134

      The sounds of that wave become fainter, receding to the
      background, giving way to that sound of laughter, and the
      squeaking of a PLAY-SET SWING.

      Like an old tv slowly gaining reception, the image takes a
      moment to crystallize before us. But then it sharpens:

      We're in the PLAY AREA of a TRUCK-STOP DINER, but it feels
      like we're looking at it through a broken lens. The images
      appear SPHERICAL to us, surrounded by darkness.

      Before us a 5-year old plays on a swing. Call him CHARLIE.

135   INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM - RESUMING                 135

      Mackelway has scraped away more of the white paint now -
      enough to see the outline of the front edge of the black wave,
      its lip. He continues.

136   INT. MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - RESUMING                        136

      O'Ryan tightens. We can't tell if he experiencing something
      from the past, the present, the future...

137   EXT. PLAY-AREA - RESUMING                                         137

      We WHIP AROUND quickly, getting a look into the diner itself.
      There, through a window, we see a WOMAN, presumably Charlie's
      mother. Her name's KATHLEEN, 40.

      Kathleen has her back turned to us, because she's busy
      diapering her nine month-old BABY at a table.

138   INT. MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - RESUMING                        138

      O'Ryan, at his desk, seems to be getting all of this. And it
      is agitating him. There's perspiration on his forehead.

                                                               76.


139   EXT. PLAY AREA - RESUMING                                      139

      The sound of that wave is still a presence. Charlie looks up
      at us as he swings. His smile is pure, genuine.

      We whip around for another look at Kathleen. She's still busy
      with that diaper. Then we look back to Charlie.

140   INT. MOTEL ROOM - RESUMING                                     140

      O'Ryan keeps his eyes shut, his focus total... but every part
      of him is becoming tense.

141   INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM - RESUMING              141

      Mackelway is beginning to perspire from the effort. More of
      that wave is visible to him. But he doesn't step back to take
      that in.

142   EXT. PLAY AREA - RESUMING                                      142

      That swing is now EMPTY, dangling gently. And we're running
      we know not where.

143   INT. MOTEL ROOM - RESUMING                                     143

      O'Ryan's foot starts to tap: anxiousness, discomfort.

144   EXT. PLAY AREA - RESUMING                                      144

      We run... toward a PARKING LOT. But we do so smoothly, without
      effort, as if being carried by that relentless black wave.

      Then, ANOTHER SOUND bleeds in. The BANGING of the Diner's back
      door, which leads on to that Play Area.

      And we hear a horrified yell:

                           KATHLEEN (O.S.)
                 Charlie?! Charlie, where are you, Honey?!
                     (fainter)
                 Charlie?! Honey, are you out here?!

      The sound begins to break up as if on a bad radio, being taken
      over by the sounds of that awful WAVE...

145   INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM - RESUMING              145

      Mackelway suddenly stops... as if some electric charge had
      just shot through him, short-circuiting him into stillness. He
      begins to step away from the wall.

                                                                  77.


146   INT. MOTEL ROOM - RESUMING                                        146

      O'Ryan has lost the "pulse" - the connection that had allowed
      him inside what we just witnessed.

      He rises, hurrying into a tiny bathroom. We STAY ON THAT
      WRITING PAD, trying to decipher these lines and squiggles -
      the ideograms - as we hear the sounds of O'Ryan, retching.

147   INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM - RESUMING                 147

      Mackelway sits on the bed, looking at what he's just
      uncovered. An awesome sight. His head is pounding worse than
      ever... so he reaches for the Vicoden.

148   EXT. PLAY-AREA - RESUMING                                         148

      We've stepped out of that SUBJECTIVE POV now. Kathleen grabs
      her infant, distraught, as another massive 18-WHEEL TRUCK
      blows by us in the distance...

149   INT. MOTEL ROOM - DENTON, TEXAS - RESUMING                        149

      O'Ryan washes his face, eyes his reflection in the mirror,
      scrutinizing himself.

150   INT. HOPE HOUSE - O'RYAN'S FORMER ROOM - RESUMING                 150

      On the wall opposite Mackelway, that huge black wave is now
      entirely visible to him. Bits of chipped white paint litter
      the floor.

      A vast black wave. It fills the whole wall...

      Mackelway eyes his watch. It's one o'clock in the morning.
      He's been in here for four hours. That seems impossible.

                                                        CUT TO:

      ...a box, slamming down hard on a desk. We are:

151   INT. FBI OFFICE - O'RYAN ROOM - LATE NIGHT                        151

      2:30 a.m. Mackelway is in here by himself, angry. He reaches
      into that box. Inside? More pins. BLACK ONES. He crosses to
      the map.

152   CLOSE-UP: MACKELWAY                                               152

      He starts pulling out the YELLOW PINS we've grown accustomed
      to seeing on this map, replacing them with the BLACK ONES,
      tossing the discards onto the floor.

                                                                  78.


153   A SERIES OF DISSOLVES                                             153

      ...as Mackelway replaces pin after pin.

      ...Mackelway's face, as he backs away from that huge map.

154   INT. FBI OFFICE - O'RYAN ROOM - LATER NIGHT                       154

      Ten minutes have passed, but Mackelway has seen a revelation.
      We can read it on his face.

      He eyes the map... which has now been stuck with over 1,000
      BLACK PINS, one for each city with a HAVE YOU SEEN ME to its
      credit.

      And those black pins, seen from a distance, form a pattern we
      weren't expecting - something that never quite took shape when
      the pins were yellow.

      Looks like a big black WAVE. And that's just what it is.

      1,000 black dots conspiring to form the same exact shape that
      O'Ryan had painted onto the wall of his room - a massive wave
      of darkness, gathering strength.

      But this black wave is consuming America...

      Mackelway stares at it: awed, even a bit frightened. The thing
      seems vast, unstoppable... A black wave - pure malevolence,
      covering the states like a fog.

      One blue dot lies in its center: that blue pin, in the heart
      of Greenville, Texas. Then, piercing the silence:

                           CHARLTON (O.S.)
                 Got one of those pins in Denton yet?

      Mackelway turns. Charlton leans in the doorway.
                           CHARLTON (CONT'D)
                 O'Ryan was spotted there tonight. Took a
                 squad-car and a side-arm from a State
                 Trooper. 'Bout an hour later a five-year
                 old boy was abducted, roughly a mile up
                 the Interstate.

      It's 3 a.m. What's this guy doing here?

                           CHARLTON (CONT'D)
                 The vehicle was found in an abandoned
                 lot. We're establishing a perimeter
                 around the city now.

                                                         79.

                     MACKELWAY
               (knows already)
           But the Trooper wasn't hurt...

                     CHARLTON
           What makes you so sure?

                     MACKELWAY
           Professional courtesy.

Charlton's at a loss... until Mackelway gestures to the table,
where he has laid out O'Ryan's entire FBI File. Every memo,
citation, letter, i.d. picture. 150 pages.

Charlton eyes it, calmly. He's not going to let his jaw drop,
not with Mackelway watching. So he just nods.

                     MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
           Is that... possible, Sir? An agent can
           just be deleted?

                     CHARLTON
           Looks like it.

 Mackelway pauses. It's a depressing reality...

                     MACKELWAY
           I couldn't understand it before - pushing
           Speck's car onto the state line. Makes
           sense now. He wanted to make the case
           Federal. He's drawing us in.

                     CHARLTON
           Why would he do that?

                     MACKELWAY
           So we'd be paying attention when he found
           Suspect Zero.

                     CHARLTON
           Ya know what? I'm getting extremely tired
           of hearing that word. In fact, that's
           gonna be policy from now on. No Zero.
                     MACKELWAY
           Sir, profile the guy. He's straight outta
           Quantico. All he's doing is working a
           case, like we would. He's not kidnapping
           little kids - he's chasing the guy who's
           doing the kidnapping! Look at the map!

                                                       80.


                     CHARLTON
           What're you saying - that all these
           abductions are the work of one guy? Do
           you know how fucking insane that is?!
               (over Mackelway)
           Not let's try something that actually
           makes sense: He sends in these faxes,
           picks off three scumbags. For what?! So
           we'll think exactly what you're thinking
           right now - that we've got a friend out
           there, somebody willing to take out the
           garbage for the rest of us. And it's all
           horse-shit!

                     MACKELWAY
           What if it isn't? What if there really is
           a Zero out there and O'Ryan's the one guy
           who's got a shot at him?

                     CHARLTON
               (just blew his top)
           Fuck's sake, Mackelway - when did you
           start buying into this guy?!

A beat. Mackelway lets the silence hover.

                     MACKELWAY
               (quietly)
           He's smarter than we are.

                     CHARLTON
           Speak for yourself.

Charlton heads for the door.

                      MACKELWAY
           Sir? What if I told you I knew how to
           catch him?

Charlton stops. Turns.

                     CHARLTON
           Do you?

                     MACKELWAY
           And what if I told you that the way I'd
           catch him involved sitting in a dark
           room, with nothing in front of me but a
           pad of paper... until I'd tapped into
           some kind of... energy out there. The
           collective unconscious. Something. If I
           told you I thought I could target and
                     (MORE)

                                                            81.


                     MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
           locate him, without ever leaving this
           building, what would you say?

                     CHARLTON
           I'd say you'd watched too many "X-Files."

                     MACKELWAY
           Y'ever heard of a project called
           "Icarus," Sir?

                     CHARLTON
           No.

Mackelway tosses over a few pages from O'Ryan's file.

                     MACKELWAY
           Agents, trained to "see" distant
           locations using nothing but the mind.
           They called it Remote Viewing.

Charlton eyes the pages without comment.

                     MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
           Army stole it from the Soviets. The
           Bureau stole it from the Army - used it
           to track serial killers.
               (a beat)
           Experimental program. O'Ryan was the
           first agent they recruited.

                     CHARLTON
           Good for him.

                     MACKELWAY
           Voodoo, right? Pure Bullshit.
               (Charlton's waiting)
           ...except, it worked. It's how he drew
           this:
Mackelway's referring to that DRAWING: a steamer-trunk, filled
with ghastly Ziploc bags:

                     MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
           He'd never been in that house before. He
           just saw what was in there - the Bureau
           taught him how... same one that deleted
           him. Same one that's trying to catch him
           now... Does anything about all this
           strike you as odd?

Charlton studies him, a long beat, measuring him... Then:

                                                                  82.


                           CHARLTON
                 I'm going to Denton at Oh-Six-Hundred.
                 You can take the day off.

      With that, he's gone - leaving Mackelway alone in here.
      Nothing to look at but that black wave... He hears Charlton,
      leaving the building.

      He slams another Vicoden, then hears a PHONE RING. Fuck it.
      He's not moving. Let Voice Mail get it.

      ...until he hears the sound of a FAX coming in.

      He rises. Follow him:

155   INT. FBI OFFICE - CUBICLES - CONTINUING                           155

      Mackelway hurries through the office, as the sound of that fax
      grows louder.

156   INT. "FAX ROOM" - CONTINUING                                      156

      He enters. The fax has spun out a single sheet. No top-sheet.
      That's odd...

      But here's another face, another victim, with the customary
      HAVE YOU SEEN ME? across the top.

      A young African-American boy: "Lloyd Simms, Age 9. Ht. 4'10",
      Wt. 67 lbs. Last Seen: Greenville, Texas. Date of
      Disappearance: 10-26-99."

      That's it. One face. The transmission ends. Mackelway eyes
      those vitals. They mean something. Greenville...

157   INT. FBI OFFICE - O'RYAN'S ROOM - RESUMING                        157

      He re-enters, and approaches that huge MAP. There's that wave
      of black pins, with the one BLUE PIN in its center;
      Greenville, with a "10-26" written beside it.

      Mackelway pulls out the lone blue pin, replaces it with a
      black one. Now the wave is complete. All black...

                                                        CUT TO:

158   INT. 18-WHEELER - CAB - MOVING - NIGHT                            158

      We've seen this truck before - several times in fact. It
      rumbles along the highway. We don't see who's driving, but we
      do see who's in the passenger seat:

                                                                 83.


      It's Charlie, five years-old, whose abduction we just
      witnessed. He sleeps fitfully.

      A MAN'S HAND can be seen, edging into frame - the DRIVER. He
      picks up a CASSETE, shoves it into the tape deck.

      And out comes the sound of "Barney the Dinosaur."

                           BARNEY (THRU DASHBOARD STEREO)
                 Oh silly songs get sillier/When you hear
                 them once again/And maybe you're hearing
                 an echo/Or maybe it's only a friend!

      The truck continues to rumble along.

                                                       CUT TO:

159   INT. FBI OFFICE - OUTSIDE THE O'RYAN ROOM - MORNING        159

      6 a.m. Fran pauses outside the O'Ryan Room... where Mackelway
      sleeps on a chair. Poor guy was here all night.

      She regards him... then her eyes find that MAP, and the gaping
      black wave across it. A horrible image...

      She studies Mackelway again, almost tenderly, until:

                           CHARLTON (O.S.)
                 Does he listen to you?

      She turns, startled. Here's Charlton, right behind her. And
      she's been caught... watching Mackelway sleep.

                           FRAN
                 I'm sorry?

                           CHARLTON
                 It's not a strength of his. I'm noticing
                 that lately.

      Truth is, she doesn't like Charlton. Or trust him...

                           FRAN
                 He's fine.

                           CHARLTON
                 I'm not so sure.
                     (a beat)
                 You oughtta sit him down, remind him how
                 a chain-of-command works.

                           FRAN
                 He's fine, Sir.

                                                               84.


                           CHARLTON
                 Talk to him.

      With that, he's gone. Fran watches as he heads for the Front
      Door... and exits.

      She looks back to Mackelway. He awakens with a start. Thinking
      no one's watching, he pops another Vicoden.

160   INT. O'RYAN ROOM - CONTINUING                                  160

      Fran enters, feeling slightly dirty from that exchange.
      Mackelway checks his watch as a few AGENTS exit the suite.

                           MACKELWAY
                 They going to Denton?

                             FRAN
                 Mmm-hmm.

                           MACKELWAY
                 But not you?

                           FRAN
                 Sitting in on two autopsies.

                             MACKELWAY
                 Oh.

      He rises. Heads for the door, stiff. She looks at those O'Ryan
      FBI DOCUMENTS NOW - her first time seeing them...

                             FRAN
                 You okay?

                             MACKELWAY
                 Yeah. Why?

                             FRAN
                 Nothing.

      She leaves it at that. He's about to exit, when:

                           MACKELWAY
                 Are they male or female?

                             FRAN
                 Huh?

                           MACKELWAY
                 The autopsies.

                                                           85.


                     FRAN
           Females - Logan, Utah; and Decatur,
           Alabama.

(Neither city is represented with black pins on that map.)

She slides over a packet of PHOTOS: two FEMALE VICTIMS,
photographed in separate morgues - face up, face down, waist
and above, waist and below, etc.

Mackelway eyes them, then leaves the room. We STAY WITH
FRAN... taking in that O'Ryan FBI file. It troubles her.

Mackelway returns, carrying the 9-by-12 envelope that Katie
gave to him.

                     FRAN (CONT'D)
               (re: O'Ryan's file)
           So is this what happens when an agent
           spins out? He gets deleted?

                     MACKELWAY
           Sometimes. The lucky ones get sent to
           Wichita Falls.

She breathes out an ironic laugh. He hands over the envelope,
opens it. Inside: that photo of Karen Sumpter. Mackelway
didn't pay much attention to it before.

Fran eyes the photo, then the vitals.

                     MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
           Friend of the Receptionist, missing for
           about a year now. I told her I'd let her
           know if the body ever turned up.

Fran doesn't look up from the photo.

                     FRAN
           The Receptionist.

                     MACKELWAY
           Her name's Katie.

She half-smiles: "You mean the one you've been fucking?" He
shrugs, confirming nothing - wishing Fran weren't quite so
smart. She puts the photo back into the envelope.

                     FRAN
           I see you got the blue pin out of
           Greenville.

                                                          86.


                     MACKELWAY
           Yeah. Last night. Kid named Simms.

That confused her.

                     FRAN
               (re: Sumpter)
           No. I meant her. The girl.

That confused him.

                     MACKELWAY
           What're you talking about?

                     FRAN
           Did ya look at her vitals?

She hands him the material on Karen Sumpter.

                     FRAN (CONT'D)
           Greenville, Texas. October 26.

He grabs the material, looks at it for the first time:

"Karen Sumpter, Age 25. Ht. 5'6", Wt. 110. Eyes Blu, Hair
Blnd. Last Seen: Greenville, Tx. Date of Disappearance: 10-26-
00."

Mackelway looks to the Conference Table - that huge stack of
faxes, all those helpless faces.

The one on top is the one that came in last night: Lloyd
Simms, Age 9. Ht. 4'10", Wt. 67 lbs. Last Seen: Greenville,
Texas. Date of Disappearance: 10-26-99.

At last, a pattern. A break.

Mackelway grabs the Simms fax, hurries out of the room.
Nearest Agent is Grieves. Mackelway hands him the fax.

                     MACKELWAY
           Need an address on this fax line.

Grieves has done this on fifty different faxes now; it never
yields their suspect, but:

                     GRIEVES
           'Kay.

Mackelway leans back in to the O'Ryan Room.

                     MACKELWAY
           O'Ryan's in Greenville.

                                                            87.


                     FRAN
           What makes you think so?

                     MACKELWAY
           That's where Zero is.
               (Fran's a blank)
           Lloyd Simms - October 26, '99. Karen
           Sumpter - October 26, 2000. Both
           disappeared from Greenville.
               (still no reply)
           Zero comes back to the same spot, once a
           year. Today's the 25th.

                     FRAN
           Wait. When did we establish that Zero was
           real?

                     MACKELWAY
           O'Ryan thinks so.

                     FRAN
           Do you?

That's the million-dollar question, and it hangs there.

Mackelway's about to answer... when he stops himself. Just
noticing something. That MORGUE PHOTO from Logan, Utah:

There's a BURN MARK on the lower left calf of the victim.
We've seen such a mark before, on another autopsy photo.

                     MACKELWAY
           I've seen this before.

                     FRAN
           Huh?

He doesn't answer, just hurries to a thick BOX OF OTHER
AUTOPSY FILES AND PHOTOS. Starts rifling through them...

...until he finds the one we've seen before. The body from
Trenton. He extracts it. Eyes it. A confirmation...

He lays the two PHOTOS side by side. Looks to Fran.

                     MACKELWAY
           Same burn-mark.
               (she leans in)
           I saw it before but it didn't register.

Fran eyes the photos. No doubt about it - they both have the
same burn mark on the lower left calf: a symmetrical, almost
horizontal stripe across the flesh.

                                                                   88.


                           FRAN
                 He burns them?

                            MACKELWAY
                 I dunno. Almost looks too symmetrical to
                 be a burn.
                     (re: Logan victim)
                 They're autopsying her this morning?

                           FRAN
                 Yeah.

      She gets the idea: "Find out where the hell this mark on the
      leg came from." Grieves enters.

                           GRIEVES
                 Fax number traces back to a Copy Center
                 on I-30. Greenville.
                     (Mackelway eyes his watch)
                 I called. They don't open for another
                 hour.

      Mackelway looks to Fran. She's not entirely sold yet... but
      she's getting there.

                                                         CUT TO:

      Mackelway plows along I-30.

      Ahead of him, one hell of an ugly STORM-FRONT seems to be
      waiting. Thick, black clouds. Mackelway's driving right into
      the teeth of them...

                                                         CUT TO:

      front.

163   INT. "FAST-COPY" - COUNTER - DAY                                   163

      Mackelway stands opposite a DAY-MANAGER: 30, harried, eyeing a
      copy of the composite drawing of O'Ryan.

                           DAY-MANAGER
                     (re: O'Ryan)
                 Naah. I never saw that guy in here.

                                                                89.


                           MACKELWAY
                 He sent a fax from this location 'bout
                 seven o'clock this morning.

                           DAY-MANAGER
                 We're closed at seven.

                           MACKELWAY
                 Are your faxes programmable? Could he
                 have paid last night to have it sent this
                 morning?

                           DAY-MANAGER
                 Sure. But that costs extra.

                           MACKELWAY
                 Were you here last night?

                           DAY-MANAGER
                 Nope. Haven't done nights since I got
                 promoted.

      Mackelway eyes the guy... then hears a CEL-PHONE ring.

                           MACKELWAY
                 'Scuse me.

      Mackelway grabs his cel, backing away from the counter.

164   INTERCUT WITH/INT. MORGUE - SAME                                164

      Fran is at a phone, in the Morgue. The Logan Utah BODY lies on
      the table.

                           FRAN
                 It's not a burn. It's a freezer-burn.
                           MACKELWAY
                 You're sure.

                           FRAN
                 There's crystallization in the blood
                 stream. The blood never clotted in the
                 wound. It's a freezer burn... I'm having
                 the other body shipped out - the guy from
                 Trenton. We'll see if he's got the same
                 thing.

      Mackelway pauses, thinking...

                                                                   90.


                           MACKELWAY
                 So... he keeps the bodies in a freezer,
                 then buries them...?

      That was a question. He can't do any better.

                           FRAN
                 I dunno. If he kept them in a freezer
                 they'd have marks like this all over.
                 Wouldn't they?

      Mackelway nods - that made sense. Shit.

      The noise of the Interstate doesn't make things any easier. A
      huge TRUCK rumbles by. 18 wheels.

      Mackelway eyes it, absently. Then a bolt hits him:

      On the side of the truck is a trademark: "EVER-FROST." This
      truck is hauling ice cream.

      Things just began to click.

                           MACKELWAY
                 Thanks, Fran.

      He has hit "End" before she can reply. Heads to his Yukon.

      Fran eyes the phone: that was odd...

      Mackelway sits at a table by a window. Watching. FIFTY MASSIVE
      TRUCKS in this lot - some refrigerated, most not.

      This Diner is big enough to seat 200: truckers, a few
      families, and folks who just like the buffet, (gravy covers
      just about every entree.)

      Mackelway's been here for hours. A WAITRESS comes by.

                           WAITRESS
                 You want some more breakfast, Honey, or

                 Just some coffee, thanks. Might hit the

                 Meatloaf's lookin' good today.

      He smiles, thanks. She turns away. That leaves him alone
      again, scanning - not even sure he's in the right place.

      CEL-PHONE RINGS. He grabs it.

                     (knows already)
                 Why would you be doing that?

                           FRAN
                 I think agents are safer when they have
                 some company. I can send along Katie if
                 you'd rather.

      Mackelway laughs. He appreciates a good jab.

                           MACKELWAY
                 I'm at the truck-stop we traced. Off the
                 I-30.

                           FRAN
                 I'm 'bout a half hour out.

                           MACKELWAY
                 I'll order some lunch for you. Hear the
                 meatloaf's good today.

      She half-smiles. She likes him, despite herself.

                                                                 92.


168   DINER - MACKELWAY - RESUMING                                     168

      He half-smiles, puts the cel-phone away. He likes her, despite
      himself.

      Then a MAN passes by him, a trucker. Let's call him VIC.

      All we see as he passes is the TATTOO on his forearm: a cobra.
      Keys jingle on his belt-hook. He wears a sleeveless down vest
      and a "God Bless America" cap.

      Mackelway turns, but Vic's already past us.

      Something about him attracts Mackelway's attention. The walk,
      the attitude. Something.

      So Mackelway is watching - without really knowing why - as Vic
      crosses the parking lot, heading for his rig. It's a beast.
      Vic climbs in, unaware that he's being watched.

      Mackelway looks away, chiding himself for allowing the guy to
      distract him. That WAITRESS comes by with more coffee.
      Mackelway smiles, looking absently out the window again.

      And sees a LITTLE BOY of 5, in the cab of Vic's rig...

      But this little boy is SCREAMING, struggling to get out of his
      car-seat, until Vic grabs the kid by the shoulders, roughly...
      all of this visible through the windshield.

      Mackelway locks in on the kid. Holy shit...

      Vic's rig pulls out. The kid pounds on his window. Looks like
      he's saying "Lemme out of here! I want my Mommy!" He might be
      little Charlie - we can't tell from here.

      But we can see that Vic is yelling at him: "Shut up!"

      And we can see that Vic's truck is refrigerated. He's hauling
      dairy products.

      On a normal day, Mackelway might shrug this off as
      coincidence. He might not be so vigilant.

      This isn't a normal day. He races for the door.

169   EXT. TRUCK-STOP - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER                    169

      Mackelway backs out in the Yukon, trying to keep a visual on
      Vic's truck.

      ANOTHER 18-WHEELER pulls in front of him, blocking his view
      entirely.

                                                                  93.


                           MACKELWAY
                 Dammit!

      He honks - loud - pulls around that other 18-wheeler, heading
      for the exit of the lot.

      Just spotted Vic's rig again.

170   EXT. ROAD/INT. MACKELWAY'S YUKON - CONTINUING                     170

      He follows Vic's rig out of the lot and onto a road
      approaching I-30. But there are three cars between them -
      Mackelway can't get a clean look at Vic's license plate.

      Vic approaches the Interstate. So do the three cars between
      them.

      Vic passes the Interstate on-ramp. The three cars turn on to
      it... putting Mackelway right on Vic's tail.

      He grabs his cel, dials. This truck has license plates from
      ten states.

                           MACKELWAY (INTO CEL)
                 This is Mackelway. I need a run down on a
                 plate. Texas: Delta-142-Romeo-Victor-
                 Alpha. Got that?

      He puts the cel down, but doesn't hang up. Vic just made a
      turn onto a VAST DIRT LOT.

      A huge BANNER overhead reads, "FOUNDERS DAY CARNIVAL!!!"

171   EXT. CARNIVAL - PARKING LOT - CONTINUING                          171

      There are several BIG-RIGS parked here, but the vast majority
      of the vehicles we see are garden-variety cars and SUV's. A
      few pick-ups.

      There are RIDES at this carnival: Pony rides, a ferris wheel,
      and a huge ring of Barbeques, each fired up and cooking. Must
      be a thousand people in attendance today.

      Vic parks his rig. Mackelway hangs back, watching:

      Vic gets out of the rig. From here we can see that that 5-year-
      old BOY is still stick in his car seat, and he is still
      screaming and flailing.

      Vic points a stern finger at the kid as if to say, "Behave or
      else." Then Vic disappears into the crowded carnival.

                                                                  94.


172   EXT. MACKELWAY - AT HIS CAR - RESUMING                            172

      He gets out of the Yukon, approaching Vic's truck. We CROSS
      THE LOT WITH HIM.

      He reaches Vic's truck, looks in the passenger window. There's
      the five year-old kid, tears streaming down his face. (We
      still can't tell if it's Charlie.)

      Mackelway reaches for the passenger-side door. It's locked. Of
      course. And he can't shoot his way in.

      He looks to the kid inside:

                           MACKELWAY
                 You okay?
                     (Kid's a blank)
                 Kid? You okay in there?

      The Kid doesn't respond - just seems spooked. Shit...
      Mackelway looks into the heart of that crowd. Vic's still
      visible to us, but he won't be for long.

                           MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
                     (at the Kid)
                 I'll be back. Don't worry.

      Mackelway heads into the carnival.

173   EXT. CARNIVAL - CONTINUING                                        173

      He begins running now, past the table where ladies are selling
      TICKETS for the rides and games, past the Cotton-Candy Guy.

      Running... because we just lost sight of Vic.

      Mackelway hurries through that ring of barbeques, upsetting a
      tray or two. Then he stops. There's the ferris wheel. Was that
      Vic on the other side of it?

      Mackelway takes off.

174   EXT. FERRIS WHEEL - CONTINUING                                    174

      No Vic. But Mackelway thinks he sees the guy... heading back
      in the direction of the parking lot.

      He runs past the Pony rides, past a funhouse, past a popcorn
      machine, past those ladies selling tickets.

                                                                 95.


175   EXT. PARKING LOT - RESUMING                                      175

      He hits a bottleneck of people at the entrance. But he bursts
      through, runs into the dirt parking lot, around cars and big-
      rigs, then turns a corner and:

      ...runs smack into Benjamin O'Ryan.

      The shock is so total it takes each of them a moment to
      recover from it. But here he is. O'Ryan, five feet away.

      Mackelway's speechless, still trying to recalibrate himself. A
      second ago he was chasing a possible Zero. Now he's face to
      face with O'Ryan.

      And O'Ryan isn't running. In fact, he almost seems amused.

                           O'RYAN
                 Well, well... Must be quite a moment for
                 you. Congratulations.

      Mackelway still hasn't spoken, until:

                           MACKELWAY
                 What're you doing here?

                           O'RYAN
                 Waiting for you.

      ...which is when Mackelway realizes that he is standing right
      in front of Vic's rig.

      But he wasn't expecting what comes next:

      Vic has returned to the rig, with a WOMAN beside him. Turns
      out, she's his WIFE. Vic opens the passenger-side door,
      unclasps that five year-old kid from his seat.

                           FIVE YEAR-OLD
                 Mommy!

      The kid dives into the Woman's arms.

                           WOMAN
                 Morning, Baby!

                           VIC
                 I told you she'd be here.
                     (to Woman)
                 He's been a brat all morning.

                                                                  96.


      Mother hugs son... which means that Mackelway has misread
      things, badly.

      And O'Ryan is a witness to it - hence the grin.

                           MACKELWAY
                     (at O'Ryan)
                 Hands up.

      O'Ryan raises his hands. Mackelway reaches for his cuffs.

                                                        CUT TO:

176   EXT. CARNIVAL - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER                       176

      O'Ryan's hands are cuffed in front of him. Mackelway leads him
      to the Yukon, opens a door for him, and puts him into the
      backseat. A few LOOKIE-LOU'S strain for a peek.

177   INT. MACKELWAY'S YUKON - CONTINUING                               177

      Mackelway gets in, hits the ignition. Reaches for his cel-
      phone. Starts to dial.

                           O'RYAN
                     (disappointed)
                 Awfully conventional - don't ya think?

      Mackelway pauses.

                           MACKELWAY
                 Huh?

                           O'RYAN
                 Apprehend the fugitive, then call it in
                 for your pat on the head.

                           MACKELWAY
                 Sorry to disappoint you.

      Mackelway continues to dial.

                            O'RYAN
                 I'll get over it.
                     (flat)
                 But I'm not too sure that little boy
                 will.

      Bang. That just stopped Mackelway, mid-dial.

                                                               97.


                           MACKELWAY
                     (minor test)
                 What little boy?

                           O'RYAN
                 The one from the Diner, in Denton.

                           MACKELWAY
                 You know where he is?

                           O'RYAN
                 I can find him.

                           MACKELWAY
                 How?

                           O'RYAN
                 Same way I found Starkey, and Speck, and
                 Fulcher... and you.

      That rang a bell.

                           O'RYAN (CONT'D)
                 I need someplace quiet - someplace I can
                 concentrate... And your assurance that
                 once he's located, we go get him
                 together.

                           MACKELWAY
                 I can't do that.

                           O'RYAN
                 Then I can't help you.

      Mackelway, disgusted, pulls out of the lot.

178   INT. MACKELWAY'S YUKON - DRIVING - MOMENTS LATER               178

      Through sparse traffic, heading for an Interstate on-ramp.
                          O'RYAN (CONT'D)
                I'm talking about uncompromised justice.
                No trials. No lawyers. No hiccups in a
                chain of evidence that can set a monster
                free. You of all people should be able to
                appreciate the value of that.

                          MACKELWAY
                Where's the boy?

                          O'RYAN
                I won't be doing this much longer.
                Actually, this is the end of it. I've
                          (MORE)

                                                         98.


                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           come to accept that. But there is one
           last thing to--

                     MACKELWAY
               (anger rising)
           Where's the boy, O'Ryan?

                     O'RYAN
           Do we have an understanding?

Mackelway pulls the car over, under an I-30 overpass... and
out comes his gun, pointed right at O'Ryan's forehead.

                     MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
           Enough of this shit. Where's the boy?

O'Ryan can't help it. He's pleased.

                     O'RYAN
           Good. This is good. Sort of thing you'd
           never find in a procedural manual. It
           tells me I was right about you.

                     MACKELWAY
               (cocking the hammer)
           I will kill you, O'Ryan.

                     O'RYAN
           I know. But we have work to do first.

                     MACKELWAY
           Where's the Goddamn kid?!?!

Silence... Then that CEL-PHONE rings. Must be Fran.

                     O'RYAN
           Don't pick that up.

Mackelway eyes him: are you kidding? It rings again.

                    O'RYAN (CONT'D)
              (a panicked offer)
          This is the guy who put all those pins in
          that map of yours! And I can take you to
          him!

Ring #3. Mackelway grabs the phone.

                     MACKELWAY
           Fine. Where is he?
               (silence)
           Where is he?!?!

                                                                  99.


      Silence, punctuated by Ring #4. Then O'Ryan smiles... and
      points to his own forehead.

                           O'RYAN
                 Right here...

      Mackelway lets out a disgusted sigh.

                             MACKELWAY
                 Fuck you.

      He punches the "Talk" button, taking his eyes off O'Ryan for a
      split second.

      ...What follows is a blur:

      O'Ryan lunges forward like an animal, throwing his cuffed
      wrists over Mackelway's head, yanking Mackelway out of his
      seat with a violent tug. The gun falls.

      We POP OUTSIDE THE YUKON, pulling back... obscuring our view
      of what's going on inside that truck.

      That cel-phone continues to ring... We keep pulling back,
      under this sparsely-trafficked overpass, rain falling.

      The cel-phone stops ringing. CONTINUE PULLING BACK, taking in
      the expanse of highway - cars rolling by without a hint of the
      peril beneath them...

                                                       CUT TO:

179   INT. TRUCK-STOP - DINER - GREENVILLE - SAME (DAY)                 179

      Fran has just arrived. She scans the place. Doesn't see
      Mackelway. Great. She reaches for that cel-phone again...

                                                       CUT TO:

180   INT. A THIRD UNIDENTIFIED MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                      180

      Mackelway awakens. The room feels like it's swimming. His arms
      and legs are bound. His mouth has been GAGGED.

      And he is staring into his own REFLECTION.

      He lies on his side. A MIRROR has been propped on the floor,
      just inches from his face - leaving him with nothing to look
      at but himself.

      He strains against the ropes, but there's no give to them.
      He's helpless, powerless. And that mirror is forcing him to
      watch it all with perfect clarity.

                                                        100.


A few feet away, O'Ryan sits in a chair, calmly peeling the
skin off of an apple with that huge HUNTING KNIFE of his. A
CANDLE flickers on the floor by his feet.

                     O'RYAN
           Are you afraid?

There was a delight to that question - we can see it on
O'Ryan's face. Mackelway, of course, can't reply due to the
gag. But the answer's obvious.

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
               (quoting himself, as Daitz:)
           "Imagine a killer with no patterns, no
           tell-tale fetishes, no rituals of any
           kind. No hidden desire to be caught. A
           perfect vessel of evil."

All Mackelway can see is his own reflection - the fear in his
eyes - bouncing off a mirror that's only inches away.

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           And the name we give that killer... is
           Zero.
               (again:)
           Are you afraid?

Slowly, he lowers the knife into the flame of that candle on
the floor. It GLOWS. Good God...

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           It'd be customary at this point to start
           praying. I hear a lot of that. Haven't
           seen too many answers though. I wouldn't
           hold my breath waiting for another
           janitor to break in here and save you,
           either. You're alone.

Mackelway tries to speak. It's impossible.

O'Ryan pulls the GAG from his mouth, just long enough for
Mackelway to say:

                     MACKELWAY
           Where's the boy?

O'Ryan jams the gag back into his mouth, angrily.

                     O'RYAN
               (re: the mirror)
           My, my. Must be extremely satisfying to
           watch yourself say something so heroic.
           I'm almost envious.
                     (MORE)

                                                           101.


                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
               (casually)
           The boy's under the bed. In pieces. Are
           you afraid?

Mackelway absorbs that - watches himself absorb it - then
looks to that bed. Can't quite see what's under it...

O'Ryan eyes the flames as they dance over the blade.

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           I know what you're thinking: "There is
           pain coming. Am I going to take it like a
           man?" Let me put you at ease: You won't.
           None of them do. Men, women, children.
           They all weep, they all beg. They pass
           out, they piss themselves. They attempt
           negotiation: You wouldn't believe how
           many men have lain right where you're
           lying right now - grown men, with wives
           and children back home - offering all
           kinds of sexual gratification in exchange
           for a five minute reprieve. It's
           pathetic. Are you afraid?
               (of course, no reply)
           Then there's that moment when they
           realize there's nothing left to be
           negotiated. They're just mine. And
           they're helpless. And the look in their
           eyes, the level of surrender... well,
           it's almost pornographic. I put this
           mirror here because I don't want you to
           miss it. Are you afraid?

With that, he lifts that hunting knife out of the flame. It is
RED-HOT. Even looking at it is painful.

But Mackelway can't look at anything else.

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           How about now?

Just like that, that red-hot knife is an inch from Mackelway's
face. The heat alone makes his head jerk back. Wisps of smoke
rise from its edge.

And Mackelway is forced to watch his own reaction to it.

He struggles against these ropes, to no use. A guttural sound
comes out of him.

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           Are you afraid?

                                                           102.


O'Ryan's hand lashes out a bit, leaving the sizzling knife
just under Mackelway's chin. The anticipation of pain is
unbearable. And Mackelway is reading it in his own eyes...

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           Hmmm? Agent Mackelway? Are you?

Two things hit at once: 1) This monster is about to torture me
to death. 2) Please, God, don't let me give him the
satisfaction of seeing me cry...

O'Ryan moves the blade again, this time an eighth of an inch
above Mackelway's right arm. The heat from it is so incendiary
that Mackelway's shirt begins to smoke.

                      O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           Are you?

Mackelway's shirt is officially on fire now. The pain is
awful. He stares at his own reflection.

...as tears begin to flow from his eyes. He can't stop them.

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
               (top of his lungs)
           Are you afraid?!

That bounces off the walls. Mackelway shuts his eyes tight -
can't watch this anymore.

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
               (infuriated)
           Open your eyes! Open your eyes Goddammit
           or I'll cut the fucking lids off!!

Mackelway opens his eyes, forced to watch himself break. Deep
sobs shudder through him, as...

O'Ryan digs that red-hot blade into Mackelway's arm:
                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           ARE YOU AFRAID?!?!

Mackelway sees the answer in his own reflection: Yes, I am
terrified. He SHRIEKS, the sound muffled by that gag.

With his body able to do no more than spasm, he jerks his head
forward, smashing it into that mirror. THE MIRROR SHATTERS,
obliterating the image.

...and everything goes black.

                                                                 103.


      Then, MORE IMAGES SWARM AT US. We're helpless to beat them
      back:

180a EXT. DARKNESS - UNIDENTIFIED TIME                              180a

      Out of a soupy darkness, a dreamlike spin on a location we've
      visited before: It is the wheat field that O'Ryan has Remote
      Viewed countless times. Only this time we see it through
      Mackelway's fever, or nightmare... We see the tall wheat, the
      wet wind - familiar images to us. All to the pounding Chant of
      the Navaho.

      But then OTHER IMAGES enter this world. They're jarring:

      -That TRIBESMAN, eyes rolling back, foaming the mouth,
      dancing around a fire in a frenzy. Then a curtain of wheat
      obscures him, revealing:
      -Fran, and Katie, giggling, crooking fingers as if inviting
      us. Looks like they're naked. But as we approach them, they
      seem to get farther away. Then that curtain of wheat that
      separates us from them reveals:
      -Charlton, extending a hand to us, warmly, congratulating us
      for something, a job well done, when:

      Mackelway himself is hunting through the wet wheat, gun drawn.
      He FIRES... Then looks to see who he's just shot.

      A body. He turns it over.

      ...and is staring at himself, lying dead on the ground in the
      mud and pouring rain. It is a moment of shock and horror,
      giving way as we...

181   FADE UP AGAIN...                                                  181

      ...on O'Ryan - at a desk, sitting upright, making notes on a
      pad. Calm. Businesslike. His back turned to us.

182   INT. THAT UNIDENTIFIED MOTEL ROOM - LATER NIGHT                   182

      Time has passed. We don't know how much. Or maybe we're dead,
      or dreaming. It's hard to say...

      But there's O'Ryan, at a desk. Writing...

      Mackelway's eyes are open. His FOREHEAD has a bright red
      raspberry on it from smashing into that mirror.

      But the brain is functioning. It starts running through a
      check-list:

                                                           104.


I'm in the same motel room. I'm on a bed. I'm alive. There's
O'Ryan. Everything hurts. No, it's just my right arm. But it
is searing.

The check-list continues: my mouth is sore, but that GAG has
been removed.

And MY ARMS ARE UNBOUND. Legs too. Maybe I am dead.

Mackelway tries to move his hand. It takes some effort.
Everything's foggy. But he puts it before his face. Turns it.
Flexes it. Squeezes it. His hand... He stares at it.

Then he notices his SHOULDER. A fat BANDAGE has been wrapped
around it - covering up the source of that searing pain. Looks
as though a nurse had tended to it.

But this sure as hell isn't a hospital...

Then, O'Ryan turns, facing us. Mackelway recoils without
meaning to.

But O'Ryan's demeanor has changed. That look of possessed
malevolence - it's gone now. We can't imagine why.

                     O'RYAN
               (softly)
           Stand up.

Mackelway pauses, rewinding that one.

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           It's over now. Can you stand?

Mackelway is still bracing for torture, or at least combat. So
he's a step behind.

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           We really do have to go.

O'Ryan rises, crossing toward us. Even unbound, Mackelway is
expecting another onslaught... But all O'Ryan does is drop a
piece of paper onto Mackelway's lap.

It's another DRAWING: of a RANCH-HOUSE, with a windmill in the
background. Crude, but just specific enough. Mackelway's still
too unwound to speak...

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           This is where he'll be. With the boy.
               (a beat)
           Zero. He's coming home today. We're going
           to be there.

                                                        105.


Mackelway's starting to understand now. This was an act. An
initiation. That stuns him...

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           You're ready to come with me now. You've
           been in the pit. Stand up.

Mackelway eyes him - utter disbelief.

O'Ryan smiles warmly - like a Drill Sergeant at the end of
Basic: Sorry I was so hard on you but it had to be done... Can
we shake on it?

Instead, Mackelway simply EXPLODES:

It is a blur, faster than a blur, but Mackelway rises with an
animal roar, knocking O'Ryan flat on his back.

Then Mackelway is upon him.

All the helplessness, all the horror, the images of watching
himself in that mirror, the sounds of his own uncontrollable
sobbing... they ERUPT now into violence.

It is an overwhelming force. O'Ryan can't begin to fight it
off. Mackelway has one hand on O'Ryan's throat. The other hand
comes down like a sledgehammer.

One blow. Then another. The sounds coming out of Mackelway are
savage, barely human. He's out of control.

O'Ryan's eyes roll back. Mackelway now puts both hands around
this fucker's throat. He's going to kill him - right here.
He's going to squeeze the life from him.

This is a Mackelway we've never met before. His eyes are wild,
hateful - even as the last gasps of breath rasp their way out
of O'Ryan's throat.

Then Mackelway is distracted, for just a second. No. Less than
a second... by a glimpse of that SHATTERED MIRROR - his own
twisted image.

He looks away from it, refusing to be distracted, determined
to kill this guy.

...then those eyes drift back to the mirror again.

...and he sees his reflection: a hardened, crazed stranger. An
animal.

His hands, without warning, release their grip.

                                                                 106.


      O'Ryan gasps for air. His face has been bloodied. Mackelway
      rises, disgusted, removing a great weight from O'Ryan's chest.
      That makes breathing a little easier.

      Mackelway crosses to a tiny, cheap BATHROOM.

183   INT. MOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - CONTINUING                           183

      Mackelway enters. There's a mirror in here too. That fat
      BANDAGE on his shoulder stares back at him.

      He tugs at it - doesn't unravel it, just yanks it off his arm -
      revealing a hideous wound.

      It's a ZERO, WITH A SLASH THROUGH IT.

      Now everything clicks: O'Ryan was branding him. Initiating him
      with that red-hot knife.

      Mackelway stares at the wound, his eyes lifeless. He splashes
      some water on his face, his mind still reeling.

      Then O'Ryan appears in the doorway. He too looks like hell -
      face bloodied, throat red, eyes watering. A long beat...

      Mackelway eyes him, incredulous. O'Ryan nods, then places that
      DRAWING of the Ranch-House on the sink. Mackelway eyes it.

      Then O'Ryan stuns him... by laying Mackelway's GUN atop the
      drawing, without a word.

      Mackelway eyes the gun, then grabs it and points it right at
      O'Ryan's face, just inches away.

      We're TIGHT on Mackelway's hand. It trembles with rage.

      But O'Ryan, looking right down the barrel, seems unafraid. In
      fact he smiles, utterly confident. Then:

                           O'RYAN
                     (re: gun)
                 Soon. I promise... But not yet.

      He eases Mackelway's hand down, thus lowering the gun. Then
      O'Ryan turns, grabs Mackelway's car keys, and heads for the
      front door.

      Mackelway stands, rigid. He raises the gun. Maybe I'll just
      shoot this fucker in the back.

      Then those IMAGES come at us again, out of nowhere:

                                                                 107.


184   EXT. WHEAT FIELD - NIGHT                                          184

      Out of a gray, soupy swirl - coming slightly into focus: Wet
      wind, tall wheat, our own heavy BREATHING as we run... And
      that non-descript voice we heard echoing earlier becomes the
      sound of O'Ryan's voice, static-filled, wobbling:

                           O'RYAN (O.S.)
                 Please... I'm begging you.

      That was clear enough. A gun rises. We seem to be holding
      it...

      Then those images vanish, and we are jolted back to:

185   INT. MOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - RESUMING                             185

      Mackelway tightens. O'Ryan's out the door. This VISION that
      keeps getting clearer and clearer... What the hell does this
      it mean?

      Down go two more Vicodens...

                                                       CUT TO:

186   INT. MACKELWAY'S YUKON - DRIVING - NIGHT                          186

      A huge STORM devours scenery on both sides of us. O'Ryan
      drives. Mackelway sits, no expression at all on his face,
      still recovering from what happened in that room...

      Silence... Then:

                           MACKELWAY
                 Tell me about Icarus.

                           O'RYAN
                 Why?

                           MACKELWAY
                 Just... wanna know.

      O'Ryan eyes him. The sky is black.

                           O'RYAN
                 There were five of us. In the program.

      Mackelway's all ears...

                           O'RYAN (CONT'D)
                 We'd come in in the morning, have a cup
                 of coffee, talk about the Yankees. Then
                 you'd go to your room, with your pen and
                           (MORE)

                                                         108.


                       O'RYAN (CONT'D)
             your pad of paper, always alone, and
             you'd try to lock in. Son of Sam. John
             Wayne Gacy. Ted Bundy. He might be
             driving his car, or having a beer or
             brushing his teeth... or cutting
             someone's eyes out.

That was said flatly, matter-of-factly. It's chilling.

                        O'RYAN (CONT'D)
             If you did it right, you got all of it:
             The way it sounded. The way it smelled...
             Those people were looking up at you,
             begging you for mercy. It was like being
             God.
                  (a beat)
             ...except you're not. Because you can't
             do a thing for them. Can't make it stop.
             You're just watching, helpless.

He pauses.

                       O'RYAN (CONT'D)
             They wired us into this current, the five
             of us: darkness, the pit itself. We were
             plugged right into it. But nobody taught
             us how to shut it off...
                 (thinking back...)
             We were just men. And we saw things men
             shouldn't see. Agony, torture, evil - and
             it never shut off. Even now, it's still
             there.

                       MACKELWAY
             They all wind up like you? The other
             agents?

                       O'RYAN
             No. They're dead now.

Oh. Mackelway doesn't reply...

                       O'RYAN (CONT'D)
             They broke down. Then they opted out.
                 (Mackelway's a blank)
             Killed themselves... After a while, those
             conversations about the Yankees became
             impossible. Ya see?

Mackelway lets that sink in, as he stares at passing head-
lights. Then:

                       MACKELWAY
             I'm sorry.

                                                                   109.


      O'Ryan shrugs. He appreciates it. The windshield wipers beat
      back rain...

                                                         CUT TO:

187   INT. MACKELWAY'S YUKON - DRIVING - LATER NIGHT                      187

      O'Ryan continues to drive. Silence hangs. Then:

                           O'RYAN
                 We're here.

      Mackelway sits up. O'Ryan pulls over at:

188   EXT. RANCH-HOUSE - GREENVILLE, TEXAS - CONTINUING                   188

      We've seen this place before. That is, we've seen it in
      O'Ryan's DRAWING, which lies on the dashboard before us: A
      ranch-style house with a WINDMILL in the backyard.

      O'Ryan pulls over. Rain pounds on the roof and hood. Wind
      blows. Mackelway studies the house. Then his eyes shift
      briefly to the drawing.

                           MACKELWAY
                 Can't bring you in with me. You know
                 that.

      O'Ryan shrugs, then raises his hands: "Cuff me."

      The CUFFS are lying on the floor in the back seat. Mackelway
      reaches back, to grab them... a golden opportunity for O'Ryan
      to club the guy.

      But O'Ryan remains still. Mackelway grabs them. Then he stops.
      Simply has to ask:

                           MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
                 Those faxes, the Have-You-Seen-Me's...
                 How many of 'em is he actually
                 responsible for?

      O'Ryan lays it right out:

                           O'RYAN
                 All of 'em.

      Mackelway nods, sobered. Cuffs O'Ryan to the steering wheel
      and approaches the house.

                                                                 110.


189   EXT. RANCH HOUSE - WALKWAY - CONTINUING                           189

      The place is in some disrepair: untended lawn, chipping paint,
      etc. Mackelway looks through the kitchen window.

      No one's visible. He walks around the side of the house.

190   INT. MACKELWAY'S YUKON - RESUMING                                 190

      O'Ryan watches as Mackelway vanishes. This is a moment of
      opportunity. With his free hand, he reaches into his pocket,
      grabbing a lighter.

191   EXT. RANCH HOUSE - SIDE - CONTINUING                              191

      Mackelway moves cautiously, being pelted by rain. But now he
      can see inside the Living Room of this home:

      It's a bit of a time warp: plastic on the furniture, an old
      radiator, pictures on the mantle in antique frames.

      And an OLD LADY, leaning over a record player.

      Tough to hear what's playing - we're outside, and that storm
      is pounding - but it sounds like Glenn Miller. There's also an
      old tv in here: "Wizard of Oz" is on it.

      The lady is 70, frail, thin. She also happens to be BLIND.
      Cataracts on her eyes. Her name's DELIA. Mackelway watches
      her... as she exits the room, heading for the kitchen.

      He moves to another window.

192   INT. MACKELWAY'S YUKON - RESUMING                                 192

      O'Ryan, keeping his eyes on that house, now lights the
      lighter... and holds the flame up to the CHAIN connecting his
      hand-cuff to the one on the steering wheel.

      The chain begins to heat up...

193   EXT. SIDE OF THE HOUSE - RESUMING                                 193

      Mackelway watches as Delia makes her way into the kitchen.

      It, too, is from another era: the dishwasher stands in the
      center of the floor, connected to the sink with a long hose.
      The refrigerator, the table, the toaster - all old.

      The oven is an antique too. Delia crosses to it, grabs a
      towel, opens it... and pulls a CAKE from it.

                                                              111.


      She brings the cake to the kitchen table, moving well for a
      lady who can't see. On the table is an old-fashioned baker's
      frosting tube.

      She grabs it, using her hands to orient herself... and begins
      to write on the cake, in frosting. Slowly.

      Mackelway can't see the top of that cake, but we can. The
      first letters, in beautiful cursive, read: "Happy Bir..." It's
      a work in progress.

194   INT. MACKELWAY'S YUKON - RESUMING                              194

      O'Ryan has that handcuff chain GLOWING now. We don't know if
      he'll have time to break the thing... until:

      The passenger-side door is opened, abruptly.

                           MACKELWAY
                 It's his birthday, isn't it?

      O'Ryan turns. Here's Mackelway, who now gets an eyeful of what
      O'Ryan's doing with that lighter.

      O'Ryan pockets it, a bit sheepishly. Mackelway decides to
      ignore the whole thing...

                           MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
                 He comes home on his birthday.

      O'Ryan nods. Then Delia's front door swings open.

                           DELIA (O.S.)
                     (aloud, delighted)
                 Darling?! That you?!

195   EXT. RANCH HOUSE - ENTRY - CONTINUING                          195

      Delia stands in the open doorway: an old blind lady, talking
      to the dark rainy street. That confuses them.

      ...until we hear the rumble of an 18-WHEEL TRUCK.

      It turns a corner onto this street. Mackelway turns now...

      We've seen this truck before. A monstrous, rolling beast. And
      Mackelway straightens, reaching for his sidearm. Behind him,
      Delia smiles excitedly, almost dancing.

      But that smile soon leaps from her face... as she hears the
      sound of that 18-wheeler, BRAKING ABRUPTLY, its tires locking-
      up on the wet road.

                                                                 112.


      Mackelway gets a look at the DRIVER now - a wiry, sinewy man
      of 35... Let's call him ZERO.

      Their eyes lock - until Zero throws his rig into gear again
      and begins to rumble down the street.

                           DELIA (CONT'D)
                     (confused)
                 Daryl? Honey?

      No answer. That truck is rumbling away. Mackelway turns,
      racing for the Yukon, leaving Delia at the door.

196   INT. MACKELWAY'S YUKON - CONTINUING                               196

      Mackelway jumps in to the Yukon, unlocking those cuffs.

                           MACKELWAY
                 Drive.

      He accidentally burns himself on the super-heated chain.

                           MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
                     (re: burn)
                 Fuck!

      Cuffs are unlocked now. O'Ryan starts up the Yukon.

197   EXT. GREENVILLE STREETS - DRIVING - CONTINUING                    197

      O'Ryan drives, pursuing the big-rig. Mackelway gets on his cel-
      phone, dials. Rain falls in SHEETS all around them.

                           MACKELWAY (INTO CEL-PHONE)
                     (urgently)
                 This is Mackelway! I'm travelling north
                 on... Grove Road, approaching I-30 in
                 Greenville. Request immediate back-up.
                 Pursuing a suspect in a refrigerated
                 truck, Texas license plate Alpha--

      The Yukon swerves hard to the right, narrowly avoiding the
      tail end of Zero's rig as he swings it into our path.
      Mackelway drops the phone. Grabs it again.

                           MACKELWAY (PHONE, CONT'D)
                 Alpha-4-5-2-Tango-Foxtrot-Alpha.

      Zero does it again - swinging the rear of his rig across the
      road, forcing O'Ryan to swerve hard. The Yukon gets shoved on
      to a curb, then clunks down to the street again.

                                                                 113.


      Then Zero jams on the brakes. Mackelway's eyes go wide.

                           MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
                     (at O'Ryan)
                 Brakes!

      O'Ryan jumps on the brakes. The Yukon screeches to a stop,
      throwing itself into a sideways slide. It bangs, passenger
      side first, into the rear of the truck, breaking a window.

      Mackelway ducks out of the way of breaking glass. Then the rig
      pulls away again. O'Ryan follows.

198   THE CHASE - CONTINUING                                            198

      Zero's rig turns hard onto a SERVICE ROAD, running parallel to
      the Interstate. Mackelway is locked in on that truck.

                           MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
                     (into cel-phone again)
                 Travelling due west now. Don't see a
                 name. It's a service road, running
                 parallel to the--

      Then Mackelway freezes, mid-word. He just saw something that
      made his jaw drop:

      On the other side of this road is a field of TALL WHEAT.

      Time seems to stop. His blood feels like it just congealed.
      Tall wheat in a wet wind. He has been here before. He has seen
      it before.

      And so has O'Ryan...

      Mackelway just stares, slack-jawed, as that wheat whips past
      them. The feeling is so unsettling that for a moment he
      forgets about Zero, and the rig, and the kid...

      Everything has just crystallized in a horrible way. He knows
      that he is going to wind up in that wheat field, somehow, with
      O'Ryan.

      And O'Ryan will be begging him for mercy. "Please..."

      O'Ryan guns the Yukon, attempting to cut in front of the rig.
      Zero swings wide, sending the Yukon into a curb this time.
      That shreds their front tire.

      ...which means that in one minute this car is going to be
      undriveable. So if they don't stop Zero from hitting that
      Interstate - now - Zero will be gone.

                                                              114.


                           MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
                     (absently)
                 What're you...

                           O'RYAN
                 Can't let him hit the Interstate.

      Mackelway braces himself, as O'Ryan guns his car up the left
      side of the rig, shredded tire and all. Then:

      He pulls right in front of the rig. At about 60 m.p.h. And he
      jams on the brakes.

      Zero swerves, out of instinct. It throws the rig into a
      vicious JACK-KNIFE. The van whips around in front of the cab,
      swatting the Yukon away like a fly.

      We're inside the Yukon as it rolls, Mackelway and O'Ryan look
      like tinker toys.

      The torque pulls Zero's rig onto its side, sliding hard. Metal
      hits concrete, sending up a shower of SPARKS.

      The Yukon winds up in a ditch alongside the service road,
      upside down. Mackelway, alive and awake, strains to look out
      the busted windshield.

      What he sees is hard to discern - but it looks like Zero's rig
      is lying flat on its side.

      And, of course, he is mere yards from that wheat field...

199   EXT. SERVICE ROAD - CONTINUING                                 199

      The rig's cab lies driver's-side down. But the passenger-side
      door pops open. And Zero pokes through it, his eyes
      immediately scanning that TALL WHEAT. Rain pours.

      Mackelway's watching. O'Ryan, who blacked out for a second now
      opens his eyes, getting the picture in a hurry.

      Zero leaps to the ground, rolls, and rises. Only thing in his
      hand is a TIRE IRON. Carrying it, he sprints into the wheat
      field - vanishing.

      Mackelway bursts out of the Yukon, in pursuit. O'Ryan's door
      is stuck. Mackelway doesn't stop to help him - just barrels
      across the street.

      Just then - a STATE RANGER CAR arrives.

                                                                 115.


                            MACKELWAY
                      (over his shoulder, running)
                 Get the van open! He's got a kid in the
                 van!

      STATE RANGER hurries out of his squad car. Mackelway sprints
      into the tall wheat.

      O'Ryan, with a grunt, gets his door open. Now he too
      disappears into that Wheat Field.

200   EXT. WHEAT FIELD - CONTINUING                                     200

      Tall wheat in a stiff wet wind, and not a drop of moonlight to
      guide us. Mackelway plunges in, gun drawn. No idea where he's
      going.

      ...except he's been here before. He's seen it. And there is a
      feeling of inevitability to all this; it's haunting.

      He's practically blind in here. Can't see five feet in front
      of him. Nothing but the sound of his own breathing.

      That, too, was presaged. Those visions...

201   EXT. ZERO'S TOPPLED RIG - CONTINUING                              201

      It's locked. Ranger pulls out his handgun and blows the lock
      away.

202   EXT. WHEAT FIELD - RESUMING                                       202

      Mackelway keeps running, deaf and blind.

      O'Ryan is running nearby, but they can't see or hear one
      another.

203   INT. THE TOPPLED RIG - REFRIGERATED VAN - RESUMING                203

      200 sides of beef lie on their sides. Ranger plunges in.

      Then the Ranger spots, in the back of the van, a FALSE-WALL
      that used to hide a secret compartment.

      The crash has collapsed part of the false-wall. Frozen air
      blows out in wisps. He climbs over those carcasses, fast as he
      can...

204   EXT. WHEAT FIELD - RESUMING                                       204

      Mackelway keeps going, running blind.

                                                                116.


      Then, another sound, up ahead. Sounds like the noise of
      someone stumbling. Mackelway stops. Listens.

      Silence. The sound does not repeat itself.

      He continues along, step by cautious step now.

205   INT. TOPPLED RIG - REFRIGERATED VAN - RESUMING                   205

      Ranger gets over the last of the carcasses, pulling himself up
      to the now-open compartment.

      First thing we see is a REFRIGERATION ROD, the one that was
      responsible for those freezer burns.

      Then we see Charlie, bound. He's trembling with cold, but he's
      alive. His leg presses up against the rod.

206   EXT. WHEAT FIELD - RESUMING                                      206

      Mackelway, inching along, heart pounding. He hears a noise to
      his left. Whips around, gun poised.

      But it's nothing. He sighs. The wheat almost sounds like it's
      laughing at him.

      Then that TIRE IRON lashes out, from the right.

      It catches Mackelway with horrific force, shattering his wrist
      and sending that gun flying into the wheat.

      Before Mackelway can react, Zero is upon him...

207   EXT. THE TOPPLED RIG - RESUMING                                  207

      Fran's Ford skids to a stop outside the van.

      ...just as the Ranger brings Charlie out of the rig. The kid
      is shaking, traumatized. He begins to cry...

      Fran gets the idea. She hurries over.

208   EXT. WHEAT FIELD - RESUMING                                      208

      Mackelway and Zero wrestle, surrounded and obscured by all of
      that wheat... Zero is a monster, and he's got that tire iron.
      Mackelway has a busted wrist. Hardly a fair fight.

      But Mackelway is battling: kicking, clawing, getting in as
      many shots as he can. His shirt rips away from his body,
      exposing that brand-mark. They roll back and forth. Until:

                                                        117.


                       O'RYAN (O.S.)
                 (calmly, firmly)
           Up.

Zero freezes. Mackelway too. They turn to find:

O'Ryan... who stands here, Mackelway's gun in hand.

                       O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           Up.

Mackelway's relief is total. He pushes Zero away, rising. Zero
pulls himself off the ground, chagrinned.

                     ZERO
               (re: Mackelway)
           Glad you're here, Man. Guy was about to
           kill me.

O'Ryan, without ceremony, puts a bullet through Zero's left
palm. That got Mackelway's attention.

Zero howls with pain, his palm gushing. The TIRE-IRON falls to
the ground. Mackelway approaches O'Ryan.

                     MACKELWAY
           I'll take it from here.

He extends his good hand to O'Ryan: "The gun." O'Ryan pauses.
Then...

                     O'RYAN
           Are you going to shoot him?

                     MACKELWAY
           Give me the gun, O'Ryan.

                     ZERO
           Hey, I just surrendered.

                      O'RYAN
           Shut up.

                     ZERO
           I surrendered! That's it!

                       O'RYAN
           SHUT UP!!!

O'Ryan wheels around, aiming the gun right at Zero's face.
That shuts the guy up in a hurry.

                                                        118.


From that service road now, we hear a line of SIRENS,
approaching from a distance. Unit after unit.

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
               (quietly now)
           Look at him, Mack. He's not human
           anymore. Go dig up that old lady's
           backyard - you'll find bodies there...
           Maybe hundreds of them. Of course, ya
           gotta get a warrant first, chain of
           custody's gotta be followed. One breach,
           and he walks.
               (no reply)
           My way, he's eliminated; the world is rid
           of him. It's a lot closer to justice than
           having some Prosecutor tell you you've
           left a tissue sample in the wrong lab.
           Isn't it?

                     MACKELWAY
               (that stung)
           Give me the fucking gun!

O'Ryan turns, studies him.

...and hands him the gun. Just like that.

Mackelway eyes it. O'Ryan doesn't say a word, just crosses
back to Zero, and grabs that TIRE-IRON off the ground.

O'Ryan's now standing right behind Zero, as:

                     O'RYAN
               (at Mackelway)
           You have to understand: none of this was
           arbitrary. We were chosen, you and I.
WHAP! O'Ryan just swung that tire-iron into Zero's rib cage.
We hear bones crack, and air rushing from the guy's lungs. He
drops to his knees, gasping.

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           I saw us here. You did too.
THUMP! Another violent swing of that tire-iron, busting up the
other side of Zero's torso. Now both sides of his rib-cage
have shattered. Breathing is almost impossible.

Mackelway tightens. His head just began to throb...

                     MACKELWAY
           Okay. You made your point.

                                                        119.


                     O'RYAN
           Bullshit! If I'd made my fucking point
           you would've shot him yourself by now!

Another swing of that tire-iron, across the back of Zero's
neck. He crumbles, face down.

Fuck it. Mackelway crosses to O'Ryan and puts that gun right
up against the back of O'Ryan's head.

                      MACKELWAY
           Enough!

Then, an odd thing... O'Ryan simply smiles.

Something about having that gun pointed right at him - it's a
relief.

                      MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
           Drop it.

                      O'RYAN
           Or what?

                     MACKELWAY
           Just drop it.

                     O'RYAN
           Would you shoot me?

That's something Mackelway doesn't want to consider.

                     MACKELWAY
           Put it down.

                     O'RYAN
               (calmly)
           I want you to think for a second. About
           your destiny. Who you are. You're cursed,
           like I am - except you keep running from
           it.
               (Mackelway's silent)
           You hear things. You see things. That's
           why you can't sleep, why your head always
           aches.

He turns. They are face to face. Nothing but that gun between
them.

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           ...and it's why you are going to let me
           kill this animal. And then you're going
           to kill me.

                                                         120.


That threw Mackelway badly. O'Ryan seizes the moment -
wheeling around...

He takes one last swing at Zero, like a lumberjack. The tire-
iron impacts Zero's skull with a dull THUD, cracking it. He is
dead.

Mackelway's eyes go wide. Whole thing has been a blur.

O'Ryan releases the tire-iron... and drops to his knees like a
man awaiting execution, his back to Mackelway.

Mackelway is silent. Stunned. The blood from Zero's caved-in
skull finds its way to O'Ryan's knees.

But O'Ryan remains peaceful. Calm. Ready.

                     MACKELWAY
           Get up.

                     O'RYAN
           I can't do that, Mack. I've seen all this
           already. For months now.

                     MACKELWAY
           Get up.

                     O'RYAN
           Every time, we're in this field: same
           wind, same rain. And you...

He puts a finger to his head, pretending it's a gun. Then he
pretends to pull the trigger. Mackelway gets the idea.

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           It's okay. I want you to. I'm begging you
           to.

Mackelway doesn't know what to do. Then, making matters worse:

                     FRAN (O.S.)
               (aloud)
           Mack?

She's about a hundred yards away... but she'll be here soon
enough. That puts some heat under O'Ryan:

                     O'RYAN
           I'm tired, Mack.

                     FRAN (O.S.)
           Can you hear me?

                                                        121.


She's 90 yards out now...

                     O'RYAN
           Pull the trigger...
               (no reply)
           I'm not going to jail. Now pull the
           fucking trigger!

Mackelway's frozen. O'Ryan knows it.

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           Fucking coward.

O'Ryan rises now, facing Mackelway.

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           Some things are not up to us to decide.
           They just exist. They're inevitable. This
           field. This rain. This moment. It has all
           already happened. You know that. You've
           seen it too.

He shoves Mackelway in the chest.

                     FRAN (O.S.)
           Mack?

She's 70 yards out now...

                     O'RYAN
           Shut it off for me.

                     MACKELWAY
           I'm not going to kill you, O'Ryan.

                     O'RYAN
           Of course you will. I've seen it.

                     MACKELWAY
           You saw wrong!

                     O'RYAN
               (incredulous)
           That's impossible.

                     FRAN (O.S.)
           Mack? Can you hear me?

50 yards out now. Maybe close enough to hear O'Ryan's voice...

                     O'RYAN
               (rambling, unraveling)
           You don't understand. Those fucking faces
                     (MORE)

                                                        122.


                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           on that map. They call to me. I see their
           eyes in the dark - they're staring at me:
           "How did you let this happen to me?" But
           that's the thing about them - they're
           like pictures. They never blink. They
           just...stare, and always at me. That's my
           destiny, do you see? I didn't help them
           when they needed me and this is my
           penance. Fine. I ACCEPT IT. But I'm
           opting out now, ya get it? I can't stand
           this anymore! I wanna close my eyes for
           once and see something other than
           torture.
               (Mackelway's expressionless)
           It's not a bad start, Mack. We've made
           the world a little safer now. Speck,
           Fulcher, Starkey, now Zero. We've made
           justice. But I get some too. You have to
           end all this for me. That's why you're
           here. It's your destiny.

                     MACKELWAY
           Stop telling me about my fucking destiny!

                     O'RYAN
               (again)
           But I've seen it!

                    MACKELWAY
          Open your eyes, O'Ryan! Here I am,
          standing here. I'm not shooting you.
          Doesn't that fucking tell you something?
          You're a guy with a skill. Period. They
          taught you more than they should've. I'm
          sorry about that... But you're not God.
          You can't see everything.
                      O'RYAN
           Yes I can! And you can too! That's why I
           chose you!

                     FRAN (O.S.)
           Mack?

Mackelway's not budging. O'Ryan can see that.

                     O'RYAN
               (re: tire-iron)
           Fine. I'll make it easy for you:

O'Ryan picks up that tire-iron. Mackelway sees what's coming.
O'Ryan swings the tire-iron as Mackelway backs out of its
range.

                                                           123.


                     MACKELWAY
           Put the fucking thing down, O'Ryan.

O'Ryan keeps pursuing. Another swing. Mackelway keeps backing
up. The swing misses.

                     O'RYAN
           Look. It's perfect. Won't even need a
           hearing this way. You apprehended the
           suspect in the commission of a murder.
           Then he turned on you and you fired in
           self-defense.

O'Ryan isn't letting up. And Mackelway can't quite fire.

                     O'RYAN (CONT'D)
           These things are bigger than you -
           haven't you seen that yet? Destiny.
           Justice. Mercy. They're vast. We're just
           puppets!

                     MACKELWAY
           I'm not going to kill you!

                     O'RYAN
           You don't get to decide that!

                       MACKELWAY
           Yes I do!

O'Ryan takes one more swing, as:

                       FRAN (O.S.)
           FREEZE!!!

Silence. Mackelway turns. So does O'Ryan.

There's Fran, emerging from the tall wheat, gun trained right
on O'Ryan. His shock is total.

                       FRAN (CONT'D)
           Drop it.

O'Ryan doesn't move at first. Then, slowly, an ironic smile
snakes its way across his lips.

                     O'RYAN
               (at Mackelway, surprised)
           It's funny. I never saw anyone else out
           here. Did you?
Mackelway doesn't answer. He can't. O'Ryan eyes him.

                                                               124.


                          O'RYAN (CONT'D)
                Do it, Mack. Please.
                    (Mackelway's silent)
                Please. I'm begging you.

     There it was: the very thing Mackelway's been hearing all this
     time, the exact words. Unsettling as hell.

     ...and we begin to INTERCUT: images of this moment with images
     from those "VISIONS" that have been hinting at this very
     wheatfield since Page One...

208a INTERCUT WITH/EXT. WHEATFIELD "FANTASY" - SAME               208a

     Tall wheat, wet wind, O'Ryan's voice: "I'm begging you..."

     ...Mackelway snaps himself out of the vision.

                           MACKELWAY
                I can't.

     That was almost an attempt to make those images stop, to deny
     its awful, inevitable conclusion.

                          MACKELWAY (CONT'D)
                I'm not you.

                           O'RYAN
                Yet.

     Two men, neither of them flinching... until O'Ryan nods - as
     if to say "Good-bye."

     ...more of that vision interrupts now: a gun, rising...

     O'Ryan rears back and swings that tire-iron right at
     Mackelway's head.

     Fran has no choice. She fires.

     O'Ryan is hit right between the shoulder blades. The tire-iron
     hits Mackelway in the shoulder. O'Ryan crumbles to the ground,
     landing face up.

     ...a body slumping to the ground. O'Ryan... Mackelway stands
     over him...

     Now, real-life again, Mackelway stands over O'Ryan, just as
     O'Ryan had always envisioned it. That makes him smile, even as
     he's dying.

                                                                  125.


                           O'RYAN (CONT'D)
                     (weak)
                 Thank you.

      Then he dies, eyes open. Mackelway looks to Fran...

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

209   EXT. SERVICE ROAD - DAWN                                           209

      Hours have passed. Dozens of LAW ENFORCEMENT VEHICLES have
      arrived. Sherrifs, Feds. Zero's rig remains on its side.

      Mackelway sits nearby on a CURB, his shattered wrist is in a
      SLING. Up above, the CLOUDS have parted. Morning sun streaks
      through. No more rain. Fran sits beside him.

      At their feet, in the gutter of this service road, lies a
      discarded MILK CARTON, covered with dust. The face under the
      "Have You Seen Me?" is unknown to us.

      Kathleen is nearby, holding Charlie tight. Cops surround them.

      An UNMARKED SEDAN arrives. Charlton hurries out of it, making
      a bee-line for Mackelway.

                            CHARLTON
                 Nice work.
                     (Mackelway half-nods)
                 Where is he?

                           MACKELWAY
                 Sir?

                           CHARLTON
                 O'Ryan. Where is he?
      Mackelway rises, studies Charlton. There's nothing to say.

      So he extends a hand to Fran. She takes it, rising to her
      feet. They leave Charlton behind...

      We PULL AWAY from them, craning up, taking in this expanse of
      tall wheat, TILTING UP to that morning sun.

                                             MATCH DISSOLVE TO:

      ...an AFTERNOON SUN now - blazing white hot. TILT DOWN...

                                                                126.


210   EXT. DELIA'S RANCH-HOUSE - DAY                                   210

      We're some distance away. HEAT RISES off parched Earth,
      lending a vaporous screen to everything. But we can make out
      the shapes of men in HAZ-MAT SUITS.

      Delia's backyard is being torn up by a BACK-HOE. Looks like a
      war-zone: BODIES, wrapped in cloth, being exhumed from the
      ground. Dozens of them...

      But there's plenty of soil yet to be turned... Might be
      HUNDREDS unearthed by the time these guys are through. We...

                                                  FADE OUT...

FADE IN:





INT. BUS STATION - DAY


SUPERIMPOSE:     17 YEARS AGO



Small, Canadian, rural. Just the Native American CASHIER
jotting down sports stats from the paper. MARTIN, 16,
enters. Slight, pale and frail, new clothes, a tag still
hangs from his stiff work jacket. Martin stands in front
of the Cashier a beat. Nervously tugs an earlobe.

                         MARTIN

           Sir. Sir, may I have a ticket to
           Montreal please?

                           CASHIER

           Pardon?

                         MARTIN

           I need a ticket to Montreal.

                           CASHIER

           Montreal?

                            MARTIN

           Yes, sir.     Please.

                         CASHIER

           Forty-three dollars.
Martin pulls out an envelope filled with crisp twenties
and carefully counts out three. The Cashier gives Martin
his ticket and change. Points at a bus outside. The
DRIVER loading bags.




INT. BUS - DAY

A half dozen PASSENGERS. Martin steps aboard, takes a
seat. DAN SOULSBY, Martin's age, sits next to him,
offers a hand. Martin shakes.

                           DAN

           Dan Soulsby.

                            MARTIN

           Martin.     Nice to meet you.

                         DAN

           Where you heading to?

                         MARTIN

           Away from here.

                                           (CONTINUED)





                                                       2.





CONTINUED:




Dan produces a couple beers from his pockets.     Offers
Martin one.

                            MARTIN

             Pisswater.

                           DAN

             At least it's cold pisswater.
             Here's to getting away.
They CLINK CANS. The Driver enters the bus. Unlocks the
airbrakes. Puts the bus in reverse, gives it gas.
BOOM! The ENGINE throws a rod. Horrible GRINDING.
Smoke wafts into the windows. The Driver KILLS the
ENGINE. Silence. Martin and Dan trade looks.

                           DAN

             That was bad.
                     (bummed)
             It's gonna take all day to get
             another bus here.
Martin sighs, looks out the window.




WHAT MARTIN SEES

A car rental place.







BACK TO SCENE

Martin fingers the envelope of cash in his pocket.

                           MARTIN

             You have a license?

                             DAN

             Had one.    They took it away.

                            MARTIN

             I got one.   Let's go.




INT. RENTAL CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

Dan drives. JOURNEY ON the RADIO. Martin checks out
Dan's guitar. Dan shows Martin his teeth.

                             DAN

             See that?    They're all fake.

                                              (CONTINUED)





                                                 3.





CONTINUED:





                           MARTIN

             You take a hockey puck in the
             face?




                           DAN

             A fist. My stepdad socked me. I
             flew across the room and dented
             the sheetrock in the kitchen. My
             mom saw everything and still took
             his side.

                           MARTIN

             You got cracked good.

                           DAN

             I hate that guy. Two hundred

                           MARTIN

             Why'd he hit you?

                           DAN

             I wrecked his sixty-five Mustang
             and his boat in the same week.
             His babies. I totaled them.

                           MARTIN

             I would have popped you too.

                           DAN

             It was worth it. But I didn't
             deserve the tour in hell.
Dan rubs his close-cropped hair.

                           DAN

             Don't ever go to military school
             if you can help it. It sucks.
                     (a beat)
             I jumped the wall two days ago.

                           MARTIN

             You going back?

                           DAN

             I'm done with that racket. I'm
             going to Seattle and playing
             music.
Martin tries the guitar, he's not that good.

                           MARTIN

             I know some chords.

                           DAN

             Think you can learn drums?

INT. RENTAL CAR - MOVING - DAY




The land rolls endlessly. Martin drives.      Dan plays his
guitar. He's really good.

                        DAN

          I'm the next Billy Squire. Krokus
          will be opening for me one day.
POW! The CAR HITS a BOTTLE. A front tire deflates.
Martin guides the crippled vehicle to the curb.




EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

The middle of nowhere.    Martin flips a coin.    Heads.

                          DAN

          Shit.
Dan hauls the spare from the trunk.      Sets the jack under
the bumper.
A PICKUP TRUCK approaches.      Still a mile away.
Martin watches Dan lean in the trunk for the tire iron.
The pickup gets closer, a big one.      Heavy with bags of
animal feed. Speeding.
Martin looking at Dan's back. Martin shoves Dan hard,
into the highway. In front of:







THE GRILL OF THE PICKUP

WHAM! It plasters Dan. He goes over the hood, SHATTERS
the front WINDSHIELD. Bounces off, spins like a rag doll
into a ditch.
The pickup has lost control, it rolls.      Several times, a
heaving mass of steel.
CRASH! The TRUCK folds itself around a husky tree.         No
survivors, that's clear.




MARTIN

He can't believe what he has just done.       He takes in the
carnage, tugs at his ear.

A large Ferry plies the unstoppable waters.     Gliding
toward skyscrapers.







EXT. FERRY PIER - DAY

The signs in French. Crowded with PASSENGERS waiting to
board. As more PASSENGERS pour off the just-docked ship.
A WOMAN runs through the crowd. Terror etched in her
face. She knocks aside several PEOPLE. Runs toward a
row of restaurants. Even in her turmoil, she is
patrician, elegant.







EXT. PIER-SIDE CAFE - DAY

Two BEAT COPS eat at an outdoor table.   Laid back.    The
WOMAN approaches them, frantic.

                        WOMAN

          I just saw my dead son get off the
          ferry.
The COPS trade looks.

                         WOMAN

          Listen to me; he's been dead
          eighteen years. He just walked
          right past me.




INT. MONTREAL PD OFFICE - DAY

An INSPECTOR pours the Woman tea. She has calmed down.
He takes his pen, looking at her statement.

                        WOMAN

          You need to open that grave.   It
          can't be my son in there.
A beat.

                        INSPECTOR

          I lost my mother two years ago.
          Every day I think I see her.
          Driving to work in the car next to
          me. At mass. Shopping, I see
          her, but this is someone else's
          mother. You see?
The Woman lays a hand on his arm, looks him in the eye.
There is something formidable about her.

             Inspector, I'm saddened by your
             loss and touched by loyalty. But
             let's focus on the matter at hand.
             He walked right past me. We made
             eye contact. I know he recognized
             me. It was my son. A mother
             knows these things. I will sign
             anything, I will swear before a
             judge. And thank you, I do have
             all my faculties and friends who
             can vouch for my character.

             Did you talk to this man, he is a
             man now?

                           WOMAN

             Yes. Of course he's a man. He'd
             be thirty-two. And no, I did not
             speak with him. I ran.
                     (low, serious)
             Inspector, my son was very, very
             disturbed. He had serious
             emotional problems. I assure you
             he was.

He hands her some forms.

             Madame. The police department
             cannot resolve your problem. You
             need to get permits from the
             coroner and health and safety
             department. You pay for an
             exhumation. You have someone
             qualified examine the remains. If
             it is the wrong body, the Forensic
             Examiner will confirm there is a
             problem and call us. Then we open
             an investigation.
                     (a beat)
             No, Quebec City police will
             investigate. He is buried there,
             no?
The Woman bristles.     Stands, takes the forms.

                            WOMAN

             No.   Inspector. He is not.

EXT. FOREST CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY




Deep woods. In the mountains. Near a roaring river.        A
log vacation cabin is being erected by CONSTRUCTION

WORKERS.




A BACK HOE digs a trench. The scoop snags something -- a
wetsuit -- worn by a long dead corpse, twirling slowly,
hanging from the bucket's steel teeth. The BACK HOE
OPERATOR jumps off the huge machine, stares at the
headless body he has just dragged from its grave.
Workers gather and gawk.

INSPECTOR LAVAL and INSPECTOR REYNAUD, rock solid French

          Think she will like this?
Reynaud shrugs.    Laval tosses him a Newsweek.

                  (subtitled French)
          We are lucky the FBI is sending

DARKNESS

We hear BREATHING and the SOFT RUSH of a RIVER.        Soft,
rhythmic. Then FOOTSTEPS.
Two eyes open, reflect moonlight.      The FOOTSTEPS drawing
closer.
CLICK!     A FLASHLIGHT turns on.   REVEALING:







EXT. FOREST CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT

GRACE VANDERHOLT lies in the grave where the body was
discovered. It has been excavated by criminologists, the
soil sifted, the grass and brush removed. Grace sits up.
Grace holds out her FBI creds, shielding her eyes from
the bright light.

                           GRACE

             It's okay, I'm supposed to be
             here.
CLICK.     The LIGHT goes off.   REVEALING Laval and Reynaud.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             Agent Vanderholt, we requested
             your help. I'm Inspector Laval,

             Hi. Look, I'm not ready to talk
             to you guys yet. I need a little
             more time here.
Reynaud and Laval trade looks, walk toward two UNIFORMS

Grace lays back down. Sighs. Concentrates on the
sounds. The RIVER. WIND in the trees. Then: LAUGHTER

(O.S.).





                           GRACE

             Would you mind trading one liners
             somewhere else? I need to hear
             the natural sounds. I appreciate
             it.
The policemen have gathered in a chummy knot.    Laval
gestures for them to walk down the road.




ON GRACE

She steps out of the grave. Sits by it. Writes some
notes. Everything glistens in the moonlight, alive.
Grace takes it in for a beat.
Then:   HOWLING, the lonely song of a distant WOLF.
Grace rises, crosses to the river, to a big gravel bar.
Used as a campsite complete with a large fire pit. Grace
sits by the fire pit.
More HOWLING, CLOSER this time.
Grace looks down river, SEES the glowing eyes of a TIMBER
WOLF staring from a clump of trees. The animal stares a
beat, then runs off. Grace has the chills.
Grace walks quietly toward the trees. Grace just a few
feet away. RUSTLING. She cautiously moves aside a
sapling.







EXT. RIVERBANK - GRACE'S FLASHLIGHT - NIGHT

A TIMBER WOLF nestled amidst the trees gnaws on
something; a HUMAN HEAD.




EXT. RIVERBANK - NIGHT

Grace stands there alone, the wolf is long gone. She
stoops, pushes aside brush. She finds a hollow under
some roots. Grace CLICKS on her FLASHLIGHT.




WHAT SHE SEES

A human skull stares up from the hollow.     Picked clean,
weathered.




                                                     10.





EXT. DIRT ROAD IN THE FOREST - NIGHT




Laval and Reynaud, and the two UNIFORMS smoke and joke.
A quiet beat as the WIND picks up. Their cars up the
road in the b.g.



SOMETHING MOVES in the woods.   Inspector Reynaud draws
his Glock. SHUSHES the men.
A beat. MOVEMENT. Laval signals for the men to spread
out. Holsters are UNSNAPPED. Reynaud is all eyes and
ears as he picks his way toward the trees.
GRACE emerges from the trees, a laser-aiming dot on her
forehead. She REACTS to Reynaud, raises her hands.

                        GRACE

          Don't shoot, I'm on your team.
Reynaud holsters his gun.   The men relax.   Grace takes
Inspector Laval aside.

                        GRACE

          Call who you have to call.   I
          found his head.
Laval REACTS.




INT. AUTOPSY ROOM - DAY

Gloved hands carefully remove the skull from a box. The
MEDICAL EXAMINER places the skull on an exam table and
begins cleaning it.
Grace walks around the headless body. The wetsuit has
been removed, the body has been autopsied. Headless,
skeletal hands, the legs are surprisingly well-preserved.
DIRECTOR GILLET is tall, heavy, smoking a cigar.    He's a
cop's cop and all-around nice guy.

                        DIRECTOR GILLET

          I can't tell you how excited we
          are to have you here.

                         GRACE

          You only have one victim. Usually
          there's two or three by the time I
          get called in.

                        DIRECTOR GILLET

          This case made page one of the

             The Mayor wants closure. That's

             building. I get calls from
             supervisors I didn't know I had.

                           GRACE

             You clear the Mayor?

                           DIRECTOR GILLET

             We cleared the Mayor. He read the
             article on you in Newsweek and
             insisted we fly you up. The
             papers say two campers had a
             drunken fight and the loser lost
             his head.

                           GRACE

             What do you think?

             I don't solve crimes anymore, I
             balance budgets.

                           GRACE

             This was not a heat of the moment
             killing. And the victim was
             buried complete with head. The
             grave was five-foot ten. The
             victim's height. With square
             corners. Dug with a shovel the
             killer had the foresight to bring.

                           DIRECTOR GILLET

             Thirty-five detectives searched
             the area Saturday. My
             investigators think you're a
             witch.

                           GRACE

             I've been called worse.
The Medical Examiner finds two small holes in the skull,
waves the PHOTOGRAPHER over.

                           DIRECTOR GILLET

             Jeez. Look at that, looks like he
             got ice-picked.
She simulates fangs with her hands, they match marks on

             No. A large canine did that.
             Probably an old or sick timber
             wolf that couldn't hunt. It dug
             up the body and chewed off the
             head. It felt safe in the trees,
             away from the riverbank, away from
             the other wolves.
The Medical examiner looks at a chewed vertebrate.

             I'd say you're right.

The Medical Examiner examines the skull's teeth.

             The victim was afraid of dentists.
             Bad teeth.
Inspectors Laval and Reynaud enter. Both give Grace wary
nods. Inspector Laval hands the Medical Examiner a paper
bag marked HUMAN REMAINS.

                            INSPECTOR LAVAL

             This was a meter from the skull.
             At soil level.
The Medical Examiner opens the bag. Removes a wig. No,
not a wig; someone's ponytail and leathered scalp.
Tangled with the hair is a braid of green nylon cord tied
to two pieces of broomstick. The Photographer SNAPS some
shots.
The Medical Examiner gingerly untangles the cord.

                             MEDICAL EXAMINER

             Look at this.
Grace crosses, grins.      Grace studies the cord, noting the
intricate knots.

                            GRACE

             Bingo.   That's your murder weapon.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             It might be trash a camper left.

             No. Look at it, braided parachute
             cord, two pieces of broom stick.
             You approach the victim from
             behind, loop it around his head
             and hold on for all your might.
             The more the victim struggles, the
             quicker he passes out. And now
             you have convenient handles to
             drag around two hundred pounds of
             dead kayaker.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             That is a theory.

                           GRACE

             That's exactly what it is. A
             theory. That evidence supports.
             When the suspect is in custody you
             can ask him yourself what happened
             and you won't need me. Inspector.
Laval bristles, he crosses to check his cell messages.
Gillet looks at Grace, at the cord. Turns to her
quietly.

                           DIRECTOR GILLET

             Laval and Reynaud are my stars.
             Very smart, very persistent
             investigators. On the street;
             they're magnificent.

                           GRACE

             I can see that Director.   You're
             lucky to have them.
A beat.

                           GRACE

             Go ahead, Director, say what you
             have to say.

                           DIRECTOR GILLET

             You're the expert. If you have
             any suggestions on how to
             proceed...

                           GRACE

             Sure. A forensic anthropologist
             can draw the victim's face based
             on the skull. I know someone at
             Quantico who can do it by
             tomorrow.

                           DIRECTOR GILLET

             We have people.

                           GRACE

             Call 'em. Then show the results
             to everybody around who was
             selling outdoor goods two years
             ago. You have his initials; MRC,
             inside the wetsuit. The long hair
             is distinctive, someone may
             recognize him. It's a semi-long
             shot.

                           DIRECTOR GILLET

             No, that's bread and butter
             detective work. Thank you.
                     (checks his watch)
             We should get upstairs.
They cross to the exit. Director Gillet barks orders in
FRENCH at his two-star Inspectors.




INT. TASK FORCE ROOM - DAY

Photos, maps, newspaper articles cover the walls.
Twenty-four Hour News ON a TV. Six DETECTIVES man the
phones. ROOKIES fetch reports, pour coffee.







INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

The long table is crowded. Inspectors Laval and Reynaud.
Three more POLICE OFFICIALS. A pair of CITY COUNCILMEN.
Grace sits next to Gillet.

                           COUNCILMAN #1

             You found the skull. Incredible.

                           GRACE

             I had a case once where wild dogs
             had removed remains.

                           COUNCILMAN #2

             So I can tell my people there
             isn't a headhunter running around
             the wilds of Quebec?

                           GRACE

             No headhunters, sir.   However, a
             killer is out there.

                                                 (CONTINUED)





                                                       15.





CONTINUED:





                           COUNCILMAN #1

             Director Gillet. Do you have the
             victim identified?




                           DIRECTOR GILLET

             No name yet, sir. We have someone
             from the University recreating his
             face from the skull.

                           COUNCILMAN #1

             Why, after two years, has nobody
             reported him missing?

                           GRACE

             He wasn't missed. He had no
             family, or moved often. He had
             the musculature of a serious
             outdoorsman. He spent a lot of
             time in his kayak.

                           COUNCILMAN #1

             The big question is who killed
             him.

                           GRACE

             Always is, sir. I can give you a
             rough profile; white male, thirty
             to thirty-four. Has some college
             but no degree. Neat in
             appearance. At least six feet
             tall. Very intelligent. Charming
             when necessary. He uses murder as
             a tool, probably in furtherance of
             a criminal endeavor. He's killed
             before and will again unless
             caught.
Laval and Reynaud write furiously.     Gillet is impressed.
As are the Councilmen.

                           COUNCILMAN #1

             We really appreciate the FBI
             sending you. When can we expect
             your report?

                           GRACE

             A couple days, sir.




INT. TASK FORCE ROOM - DAY (LATER)

Grace writes notes on a yellow pad. Inspectors Laval and
Reynaud cross, Laval shows her an artist's sketch of the
victim.

                                           (CONTINUED)





                                                         16.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             Say hello to a dead man.
INSERT SKETCH: The victim has a deep stare, rugged
features, long hair.

                            GRACE

             Shame.   Good-looking guy.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             This is more than we had. Thank
             you.
Laval has declared peace.      Grace smiles.   Reynaud still
keeps his distance.




INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

A very nice bed and breakfast. Grace enters and finds
her luggage waiting. She loves the room. Antiques, art.
Grace finds a bottle of wine and a note from Gillet. She
smiles. Grace checks the mini fridge; bingo. Cracks a
Moosehead. Her CELL RINGS.

                           GRACE

                     (into phone)
             Vanderholt?

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL (V.O.)

                     (filtered)
             We named the victim; Curtis
             Kohler. The forensic dentist just
             verified the ID.

                           GRACE

             With a C?

                            INSPECTOR LAVAL (V.O.)

                      (filtered)
             No. K-O-H-L-E-R. The initials
             are for the Montreal River
             Company. Kohler worked there as a
             guide three years ago. The owner
             remembers him because he stole the
             wetsuit.

                           GRACE

             Can you do a full records search?
             Criminal, credit, commercial
             history. Transcripts.
             Everything.

             Yes, of course.




                           GRACE

             You're an awesome investigator,
             Inspector. Run his name on every
             database you can. I'll see you in
             the morning.
Grace hangs up. Makes notes on the sketch.       Slips it
into a picture frame.




INT. TASK FORCE ROOM - DAY

Grace, Reynaud and Laval look through a haystack of
computer printouts for needles of information. Grace
stretches. Grabs a donut from a box. Offers the box to
Laval.

                           GRACE

             Fruit of the Gods. You know you
             want one.
Laval gives in, takes a plain cake. She offers donuts to
Reynaud. He rubs his eyes, shoves aside papers, quietly
to Laval:

                           INSPECTOR REYNAUD

                     (subtitled French)
             Let's take her down the street. I
             will not eat one of those hockey
             pucks.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             Let's go down the street. Very
             good food. We are inviting you.
             Please.
Grace grabs her jacket and an armful of reports.







INT. BISTRO - DAY

Locals only. The Inspector's favorite spot, they are
like family here. Grace, Laval and Reynaud at a table in
back. Covered with reports and plates. Grace stops
reading. Tosses aside a printout.

                           GRACE

             Mr. Kohler has been dead two
             years. No doubt about that.
             Right?

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                  18.





CONTINUED:





                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             Very solid time of death. Two
             years ago.




                           GRACE

             So before he died he got his
             paychecks, paid his taxes.
             Patronized sporting goods stores.
             And had long spending gaps where
             he was enjoying the great
             outdoors. That pattern continues
             a year after his death. He gets
             some paychecks. Rents an
             apartment. Buys a three thousand
             dollar kayak. Pays his taxes.
             Dead and buried and still paying
             his taxes. Then everything stops.
             Last Visa charge was to
             Travelocity for a plane ticket to
             Mexico city.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             Dead men don't pay their bills.
             It's identity theft.

                           GRACE

             This isn't someone renting limos
             and fancy dinners on someone
             else's credit. Lifestyle and
             habits don't change.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             Computer error?

                           GRACE

             Too many independent systems.

                            INSPECTOR LAVAL

                     (beat)
             We work organized crime sometimes,
             maybe a hit man wanted to lay low.
             He assumed the life of a civilian
             until things cooled off.

                           GRACE

             You really think a gangster is
             going to break his stride and
             become a long hair groovy river
             guide? Inspector, this guy's
             whole life has been stolen.
             Someone killed him and became him.
             Down to profession and taste in
             clothing.
Laval and Reynaud trade looks.




                                                     19.





INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT (HOURS LATER)




The lights are still on, Grace has fallen asleep on her
bed, still in her clothes, paperwork everywhere. Case
photos now fill the picture frames, cover the walls, even
on the ceiling. KNOCKING at the door. Grace stirs.



Crosses to the door, groggy. She checks the peephole.
Cracks the door. It's Inspector Laval.

                        INSPECTOR LAVAL

          You are a heavy sleeper.

                        GRACE

          You're everywhere. What's up,
          Laval?

                        INSPECTOR LAVAL

          A man was killed tonight.
          Attacked from behind. Asphyxiated
          with a nylon cord with handles.
          And there's a witness. Or a
          suspect. We're not sure yet. We
          should go.




EXT. PARKING LOT CRIME SCENE (DOWNTOWN MONTREAL) -


NIGHT (4:00 AM)

Cop cars everywhere. Crime scene tape. The Coroner's
van. A couple NEWS CAMERAMEN. Grace crossing with
Laval.
Reynaud places a HANDCUFFED MAN in workout gear in the
back of a cop car.

                         INSPECTOR LAVAL

          That's him.   He says he saw the
          killer.
Reynaud SLAPS the cop car, it quickly drives away. Grace
and Laval arrive at a BODY dressed in sweats. A gym bag
nearby. A pair of UNIFORMS stand guard as a CRIMINALIST
processes the body. Thirty-ish, healthy, his generic
looks marred by bulging, bruised eyes. Face bruised.

                        INSPECTOR LAVAL

          Meet Mr. Todd Ford.
Grace squats by the body. CLICKS on her Mag-Lite and
inspects the victim. Bruises on his neck.

                        GRACE

          He's still warm.

Grace shines her flashlight along the corpse.      A couple
hairs glow in the strong light beam.

                           GRACE

             Want to get those?
The Criminalist takes a lint roller, collects the hairs.

                            GRACE

             Where is it?

                            INSPECTOR LAVAL

             There.   Under his car.
Grace shines her light under a car. A garrote is there,
made of broomsticks and knotted nylon cord.

                            GRACE

             Holy shit.   Has Le Directeur been
             notified?

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             I'm letting the poor man sleep a
             couple more minutes.
                     (pointing things
                      out)
             Twenty-four hour gym is there,
             next door. He has a membership
             card in his wallet. That's his
             car. Car keys.
Grace looks around the garage.      Taking it all in.
Getting a feel for the scene.
She carefully examines the victim's car with her
flashlight. The door has been brushed with black print
dust.




INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICES - NIGHT (4:43 AM)

Director Gillet sips bad coffee in a rumpled suit and T-
shirt. Looking through a two-way mirror. Grace, Reynaud
are with him.

                           DIRECTOR GILLET

             Is that our killer?

                           GRACE

             Maybe. So far he checks out as an
             art dealer from Winnipeg.

INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - NIGHT




JOHN COSTA, 33, sits at the small table. Glasses,
moppish hair. Laval sits across from him. Costa is
sincere, and frightened.




                        COSTA

          I walk out of the gym. Walk to my
          car. I'm unlocking it and I hear
          a scuffle, a fight. Over by this
          car I see this guy getting choked
          from behind and I shouted.

                        INSPECTOR LAVAL

          What did you shout?

                        COSTA

          'Stop.' I ran towards them. Then
          the person doing the choking lets
          go and pointed a gun at me and
          ran. I'm so stupid. I could of
          been shot. I called the police
          gave him CPR until the paramedics
          came.

                        INSPECTOR LAVAL

          You touched him?

                         COSTA

          Of course.   I was giving him CPR.

                        INSPECTOR LAVAL

          You removed the Garrote?

                        COSTA

          The thing around his neck? Yes.
          I took it off, it was choking him.

                        INSPECTOR LAVAL

          Did you see where the attacker
          went?

                          COSTA

          Away from me.

                        INSPECTOR LAVAL

          What kind of gun did he have?

                        COSTA

                  (frustrated)
          The kind that puts really big
          holes in people.

                          INSPECTOR LAVAL

          Was it black?    Was it silver?

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             Okay, see? I am getting information.
             He had a large black handgun.

                           COSTA

             Listen to me. I can draw a
             picture of his face. I saw him.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             You want to draw a picture?

                          COSTA

             A sketch. I can sketch him.     I'm
             very good.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             How could you see his face in the
             dark?
A beat. Costa realizing he is under suspicion.        He leans
forward, looks Inspector Laval in the eye.

                           COSTA

             I did not do this. I saw two guys
             fighting and should of ran the
             other way but I didn't.
                     (as if to a child)

             You need to find the guy who did
             this.




INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICES - NIGHT

Grace doesn't like the turn.

                           GRACE

             You need to confirm he's a suspect
             or clear him and kick-start a
             manhunt based on Costa's ID. If
             he is a legit witness, he'll get
             heated up and start forgetting
             details. I think there's a way to
             clear him without pissing him off.
             May I?

                           DIRECTOR GILLET

             Please.

Grace KNOCKS on the Interview room door.

                            GRACE

             Inspector.   I need a moment with
             you.
Laval exits the room, shutting the door behind them. A
ROOKIE hands Director Gillet a cup of coffee and a new
dress shirt wrapped in plastic.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             I was getting into his mind.

                           GRACE

             I have a shortcut. Can you get
             any of his school transcripts?

                            INSPECTOR LAVAL

             Sure.   It's all on-line.
Grace takes an evidence bag containing the garrote from
the latest crime scene. She drops it in her computer
bag.
Grabs a case file.

                            GRACE

             Call the Winnipeg Police and have
             them fax or e-mail his driver's
             license photo.
Grace crosses, opens the door, enters.




INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

John Costa smiles at Grace as she enters.        Sets her bag
on the floor. The case file on the desk.

                            COSTA

             I hope you guys are playing bad
             cop smart cop.

                          GRACE

             Sorry. I'm the dumb one. Agent
             Vanderholt. Call me Grace.
They shake.    She slides typing paper and a pencil over to
Costa.

                           COSTA

             Thank you. He had these real
             intense eyes.

Costa about to start drawing.

                           GRACE

             Hold on. Before you do that, I
             need some personal information
             from you. Can you write down the
             name of the elementary school you
             attended? And your elementary
             school teachers, as many as you
             can remember.
Costa looking at Grace a beat.

                           COSTA

             Are you kidding me? Lady, I saw
             someone get killed tonight and
             you're asking me about grade
             school?

                           GRACE

             I apologize, I know it's random,
             but it's the best way you can help
             me.

                           COSTA

             I don't remember any of that.

                           GRACE

             Please, Mr. Costa. You'd be
             surprised.

                           COSTA

                     (writing)
             I attended two. Holy Trinity and
             Mother of Good Counsel. I
             remember Sister Bernard. And. I
             don't know, Father Jeffrey. Mr.
             Johansen. Oh, and Mrs. Sebastien,
             she had a glass eye.

                            GRACE

             May I?
She takes the list of names. She tips over her briefcase
with her foot, the evidence bag spills out. Costa
glances at the garrote, REACTS.

                            COSTA

             Omigod.   That's it, isn't it?

                            GRACE

             That's what?

                           COSTA

             The thing around his neck.
Costa looking at Grace, realizes it's a mind game.




                           COSTA

             I told the other guy, I'll tell
             you. I did not do this. Grace.
             I saw who did this and I can show
             you what he looks like and you can
             go catch him.
Costa is unambiguously sincere. Grace's attitude softens
a bit. She tucks the garrote back in her bag.

                           GRACE

             Go ahead and draw the face of the
             man you saw.
Costa draws a simple smiley face.     He shows her.

                           GRACE

             We'll get an artist to help you.

                           COSTA

             I can draw him, thank you.
Grace crosses to the door.     Costa begins drawing in
earnest.




INT. INSPECTOR'S OFFICES - NIGHT

Grace emerges from the interrogation room. Reynaud hands
her a printout of Costa's school records. Grace checking
Costa's list against his transcripts.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             You left a file in there.

                          GRACE

             I know. See if he tries to peek
             in it. The real killer couldn't
             resist. He'll want to know what
             we know.
Laval watches Costa.







INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

Costa draws with skilled hands, delicate but strong.      The
file is ignored.

                        GRACE

          Can you remember any of your grade
          school teachers? He remembered
          three.
A Rookie crosses with a photo, hands it to Laval.

                        INSPECTOR LAVAL

          Here's his provincial driver's
          license photo. He's checking out.
Laval shows Grace the photo.   It is definitely Costa.    A
beat.

                        GRACE

          Have a nurse take a DNA sample.
          Just to make sure his DNA isn't in
          the victim's car or anything
          weird.

                        INSPECTOR LAVAL

          We'll run the tests.




INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

Costa has finished the sketch. He holds it up to the
mirror, for those he assumes are watching.
REFLECTED in the two-way mirror is COSTA'S SKETCH.   Cold
piercing eyes, chiseled features.
The door opens, expecting Grace, Costa is disappointed to
see a tough-looking PARAMEDIC unwrapping a cotton swab.

                        PARAMEDIC

          Please open your mouth.







INT. PATROL CAR - MOVING - DAY (7:08 AM)

INT. MEDICAL EXAMINER'S OFFICE - DAY




This is his personal space, tons of hockey paraphernalia.
A couple tired easy chairs. The Medical Examiner eats a
slice of pizza. Grace studies an evidence bag containing
a man's ring.




                        MEDICAL EXAMINER

          Fell out of his T-shirt when I
          removed the clothing. It doesn't
          fit the victim.

                         GRACE

                   (off the ring)
          WVSS.   1995. What's that?

                        MEDICAL EXAMINER

          West Vancouver Secondary School
          Class of '95.

                       GRACE

          CWE? Whose initials?   Not the
          victim's.

                        MEDICAL EXAMINER

          No. I called the school and had
          someone find them in a yearbook.
          Here's the original owner's name.
          But it could have been through a
          dozen pawn shops since then.
He hands her a piece of paper.   Grace has a big smile.

                        GRACE

          Doctor, can I take you back to
          Quantico with me?

                        MEDICAL EXAMINER

          Sorry. I must remain where the
          hockey is good.
Grace hands the paper to Reynaud.

             back?



Reynaud nods:     yes.    They get in his unmarked car.




EXT. PARKING LOT CRIME SCENE - DAY

Tape still up. The 24 Hour gym is closed for the day.
Grace looking around. Laval studies a shrine of candles
on the sidewalk.
Grace sneaks up on him. She gets real close.       Laval
watches the candles burn.

                            GRACE

             Inspector.
Laval startles.

                           GRACE

             C'mere a second, please.
They cross to the victim's car.

                           GRACE

             Borrow your keys? Stand there
             like you're going to choke me.
Grace pantomimes unlocking the door, drops the keys and
reaches for her throat.

                           GRACE

             Keys drop straight down, how'd
             they end up over there under that
             car?

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             They were kicked. During the
             struggle.

                           GRACE

                     (points)
             Okay. Kick them as hard as you
             can that way.
Laval looks at her, kicks his keys.

                           GRACE

             Not even halfway.

Grace crosses to the candles.     Laval follows.

                           GRACE

             I had this case. This young
             hundred-pound woman was abducted
             from a parking lot. She kicked
             off a mirror, broke a window,
             dented her door. She struggled.
             This guy? Nothing.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             Everything you are saying, you are
             saying one thing, do we trust
             Costa?

                           GRACE

             Good question.  Do we trust Costa?
An unmarked car pulls up.     Reynaud drives.

                           INSPECTOR REYNAUD

             Get in.




INT. UNMARKED CAR - MOVING - DAY

Grace and Laval get in, Reynaud guns it.       Grace belts in.

                           INSPECTOR REYNAUD

             I found a current address here in
             Montreal.
Reynaud leans on the HORN, aggressively maneuvering
through traffic.

                           GRACE

             You guys have an extra weapon? I
             didn't want to cross the border
             armed.

                           INSPECTOR REYNAUD

             The glove box.
Grace opens it and finds a compact Glock.       She checks it,
shoves it into her pocket.
Reynaud swerves into the wrong lane. Stops cold in front
of an apartment building. And gets out. Great driving.
A mere two blocks away from the crime scene.       Laval gets
out. Then Grace.




                                                       30.





INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY




An upper floor. Grace, Reynaud and the MANAGER cross to
a door. The Manager studies Costa's sketch of the
attacker.




                        SUPER

          I never met him. We conducted our
          business by phone.
They arrive at a door. Reynaud about to knock.   Grace
stops him, listening at the door.

                        GRACE

          I smell smoke. Back where I'm
          from anyone can kick a door if
          there's a fire. It's the
          'citizen's arrest' of search
          warrants.
Then: The SMOKE ALARM inside the apartment BUZZES O.S.
Reynaud and Laval trade looks. Reynaud cocks a leg...
The Manager unlocks the door a beat before Reynaud kicks
it. Laval is no danger junkie, he's a little hesitant to
enter. Grace gets down low, enters carefully, she knows
what she's doing.




INT. APARTMENT - DAY

It's dark, drawn shades. A small studio. Reynaud and
Grace move tactically with drawn guns. Grace enters the
kitchen. Light smoke.
Reynaud approaches the futon, a person-sized shape under
the blankets. Reynaud whips aside the blanket. Just
pillows.
Grace checks under the sink.
Reynaud checks the bathroom and shower.
A coffee pot smokes, SIZZLING sludge on the bottom.
Grace checks around the fridge, now satisfied no one
lurks in there.

                        GRACE

          Clear.
Grace turns off the burner. She crosses to a window,
whips aside the curtains, and opens it. Coughing.

                         GRACE

          Ugh.   Got a lung full.

                                           (CONTINUED)

Grace looks at a glass of orange juice, a half-eaten
plate of food on the table.

                           GRACE

             Looks like this guy ran out in the
             middle of breakfast.
Laval has entered, he stares out the window.      Grace looks
out the window, REACTS.




WHAT GRACE SEES

The apartment window has a perfect view of the gym
parking lot where the killing occurred.







BACK TO SCENE

Reynaud sees that and also REACTS.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             We should get out of here. Don't
             touch anything.
They back out of there.

             Monsieur Edwards is?




                           GRACE

             I bet Monsieur Edwards is in a
             deep grave with square corners
             like Messieurs Kohler and Ford.
             Which looks like all the victims.
             Maybe he's subconsciously killing
             himself.
Grace finds a guitar case. Opens it. It's a mobile
office; it has postage stamps. Postcards. Assorted
stationery, different address labels. Neat, organized.
Holiday cards. A CD titled: "Learn Flamenco Guitar."
Hundreds of practice signatures. Forged documents.
Victim's personal effects.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             We'll take that with us.
                     (in French)
             Put a number and seal on that case.
Reynaud SNAPS pictures of the guitar case.
Grace is absorbing everything this little apartment can
tell her. Bonding with the space. She smells a pillow.
Thinking.

                           GRACE

             Ever see a Hermit crab?

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             No.

                           GRACE

             It's a crab that lives in the
             shells of dead sea snails.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             Yes, yes. They have one big claw
             and curl up tight.
Laval takes a long, sharpened screwdriver from his
jacket. Begins prying off a door molding. Grace sits at
the kitchen table.

                           GRACE

             When they outgrow an old shell,
             they search for a new empty shell,
             crawl up to it and quickly switch.

             They live in these beautiful
             shells because they have these
             soft ugly bodies. They couldn't
             survive without the shells.
             Neither can the guy we're after.
Laval exposes several MINI DV and MICRO-CASSETTES hidden
under the molding.




INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CLOSE ON A TV SCREEN - DAY

Surprisingly clear video shot with a long night-vision
lens. TODD FORD exits the 24 Hour Gym, gets in his car.

WIDEN TO:

The Director, Grace, Reynaud and Laval watch the video on
the TV. Director Gillet turns it off. He is not in a
good mood and that has Laval and Reynaud on edge.

                           DIRECTOR GILLET

             We could have had him this
             morning.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             Director, please. We are getting
             close. The hairs recovered from
             the apartment match the hairs
             recovered at the crime scene on
             Ford's body. We found hours of
             video like that of the victim. He
             has been following him, filming
             him for weeks. He tapped his
             phone and has recordings of Ford's
             calls. Even a CD with copies of
             Mr. Ford's E-mail folders.

                            GRACE

             With that much detail, you could
             become anyone.

                           DIRECTOR GILLET

             So he hunts people and wears their
             lives as a kind of trophy.

                           GRACE

             More like a kind of camouflage.

                           DIRECTOR GILLET

             What's his real name?

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             We know what he looks like, we
             have his fingerprints, we know
             what he had for breakfast. But
             his name eludes us still.

                           DIRECTOR GILLET

                     (angry)
             Find it, Laval. Find him.

                          INSPECTOR LAVAL

             Yes, sir.
Laval and Reynaud quickly exit.     Grace stays.




INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Director Gillet and Grace walk down the hall.

                           GRACE

             They're working really hard.

                          DIRECTOR GILLET

             I know.

                           GRACE

             Someone died last night because the
             asshole we're after isn't in custody.
             It's happened to me before and I'm
             sure it will happen again. It's a
             pretty miserable feeling.

                           DIRECTOR GILLET

             I haven't felt it in a long time.
                     (a beat)
             Dinner?

                           GRACE

             Thank you. I promised the boys
             I'd hang out tonight. I'm sorry.







INT. BISTRO - NIGHT

Grace, Reynaud and Laval have mussels and beer.      Laval
watches the GUITARIST, a little melancholy.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             I'm fair and I keep my promises.
             My informants trust me. I have
             eyes on the trains, on the buses.
             If they see him, they will tell
             me.

                     (subtitled French)
             Maybe they will tell you. Why do
             you trust junkies?




                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

                     (makes a fist)
             I trust their fear of this.

                           INSPECTOR REYNAUD

                     (subtitled French)
             Don't say that in front of her.

                           GRACE

                     (subtitled French)
             It's okay. I was a street cop in
             Philadelphia for three years
             before I joined the FBI.
Grace speaks French.      Reynaud REACTS.    As does Laval.

                            INSPECTOR REYNAUD

             Very nice.   You like to play
             games.
Grace smiles.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             Mr. Ford worked as a cruise-ship
             musician. He would walk around
             and play his guitar on the decks
             at night.

                           GRACE

             Life is pretty cold sometimes.
             Man's just trying to spread a
             little music and gets murdered.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             He targeted Mr. Ford the night
             before he was supposed to get on a
             plane and meet a ship in Aruba.

                           GRACE

             Only the new improved Mr. Ford was
             going to meet he ship.

                           INSPECTOR REYNAUD

             Think he has a plan B?

                           GRACE

             I doubt it. He's been so
             meticulous and effective in the
             past, I bet he's never needed one.
             We can assume he has all sorts of
             fake IDs and passports.
             Disguises. But that's not enough
             for him, he has to be someone
             else. He gets off impersonating
             people. And he knows his current
             persona is compromised.
Laval and Reynaud have stopped eating, are looking at
her.

                           GRACE

             What?

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             You're always thinking. Save
             something for tomorrow. We have
             three boxes of evidence to go
             through.

                           GRACE

             Pretty cavalier attitude for a man
             who just got his ass chewed by his
             boss.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             My papa dropped dead of a heart
             attack in front of a drill press
             at work. Not me.
Grace understands.     Laval CLINKS her beer, Reynaud too.

                           GRACE

             I'm dropping by Costa's, I still
             have a couple questions.
                     (off Laval's look)
             I can't turn it off.




EXT. ART GALLERY STREET - NIGHT

A warm night, people are out. TEENS, COUPLES. Some OLD
MEN argue politics. Grace approaches the gallery, keeping
a low profile as she finds an angle to look inside.







INT. ART GALLERY - GRACE'S POV - NIGHT (MOS)

John Costa shares some Merlot with a statuesque ELEGANT
WOMAN. She's laughing, flirting. Costa is making her

An OLDER MAN joins them, the woman is his arm candy.
Costa shakes his hand. The Older Man and the Elegant
Woman exit.







INT. ART GALLERY - NIGHT

Grace enters. Costa sees her, REACTS, genuinely glad to
see her. And that throws Grace a beat. She really likes
his smile.

                           GRACE

          Mr. Costa.

                           COSTA

          You caught me.

                           GRACE

          Not yet.
Grace looks over the art.

                        COSTA

          Toussant Jean Bernard. I met him
          in Haiti last year. Very troubled
          life. Outlived all his children.
          And he had ten. He lost his wife
          to cancer and went blind. Passed
          away last year.

                        GRACE

          Overpriced folk art. Is it the
          work of a soul that has suffered?
          Sure. Are his explorations as an
          artist groundbreaking? No.

                        COSTA

          Ouch. And I was going to send you
          two and charge them to your Amex.

                        GRACE

          I couldn't afford it.
Costa is looking at her, looking through her.

                        COSTA

          What about Daddy's Amex? I've
          sold quite a bit of art to poor
          little rich girls like you.

             Try the wine.

                           GRACE

             I'm partial to beer. And I don't
             have long. I came by to thank you
             for your help. And I apologize if
             you were detained. You did the
             right thing. Trying to save him.

                           COSTA

             Why, thank you. Agent Vanderholt.
                     (gives her a card)
             I'm having a show Friday. You
             should come by and meet some good
             people.

                            GRACE

             Who knows.   Where'd you learn CPR?

                           COSTA

             Medical school. Before I dropped
             out. I had a moment of clarity:
             in anatomy class I realized I'd
             rather draw bodies than cut them
             up. And when I realized I couldn't
             make art, I decided to sell it.

                             GRACE

             Some journey.

                             GRACE

             No, I don't.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Grace has turned the romantic little room into a cave of
paperwork. Notes and photos cover the walls. Grace
reads a phone bill taped to a lamp. Circles a number
that keeps reappearing.







INT. TASK FORCE ROOM - DAY (6:03 A.M.)

The place is gearing up for a new day. Grace crosses to
where Laval and Reynaud struggle awake with coffee and
the morning paper. Grace takes a seat, grabs the sports
section. A YOUNG DETECTIVE eats a grapefruit.

                           GRACE

             Morning. Can you run this name?
             She got twenty hang-up calls from
             Edward's phone.
The Young Detective takes a Post-It from Grace and
crosses.

                           GRACE

             What happened to that beautiful
             thumbprint on the orange juice
             glass, you get an ID?

                            INSPECTOR LAVAL

             No hits. He's never been
             fingerprinted.

                          GRACE

             Shit. Any activity on Edward's

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             Nothing. I think he became
             Edwards a year ago. He was a
             software engineer. Did everything
             by the internet, he never met
             anyone face to face.
Grace trades Reynaud for the front page.

                           GRACE

             Why a year ago.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             Edwards went on a river trip.
             Kohler was a guide.
Grace REACTS.     Laval tosses her some papers.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             Those are E-mails between Kohler
             and Edwards discussing the trip
             one year ago.

                           GRACE

             You connected Edwards and Kohler?
             Somebody was working all night.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             I couldn't sleep.

                           GRACE

             Our suspect kills Kohler on the
             river, lives his life a year,
             kills Edwards and assumes his ID
             for a year. Then he stalks Ford,
             kills him but is interrupted by
             Costa. Think he's pissed at
             Costa?

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             Of course.
The Young Detective returns with a report, hands it to
Grace.

                           YOUNG DETECTIVE

             Agent Vanderholt, a report came
             back on the name.

             She must have sounded like a total
             fruitcake.




                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             This is it.
Grace watching Laval.      He looks pretty rough this
morning.

                           GRACE

             Let me go and be non-threatening.




INT. ASHER HOUSE - DAY

KNOCKING on the front door. The WOMAN from the ferry
answers the door. Her name is REBECCA ASHER. She opens
the door, smiles warmly at Grace.

                           MRS. ASHER

             Hi, please come in. Thank you for
             coming.







INT. ASHER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Classy decor. Grace sips Earl Grey.       Admires the
impressive antiques.

                           MRS. ASHER

             I'm glad they finally sent
             someone, those hang-up calls have
             me terrified. They started right
             after I saw him.
                     (a beat)
             I looked him directly in the eye.
             There was a moment of mutual
             recognition.

                           GRACE

             Do you think it's Martin calling
             and hanging up?

                           MRS. ASHER

             It couldn't sound crazier, but who
             else?

                           GRACE

             Were you ever asked to identify
             his body?

                           MRS. ASHER

             The body? Yes, they showed me
             some remains that had been hit by
             a pickup truck. The upper body
             was crushed. There was no face.
             I got physically ill.
Mrs. Asher studies Grace.

                           MRS. ASHER

             You're not Canadian, are you?

                            GRACE

             No.   I'm with the FBI.
Grace shows her creds.

                           MRS. ASHER

             There was three. About two weeks
             ago. I began turning off my
             telephone when I go to bed.

                           GRACE

             You have some very nice things,
             Mrs. Asher.

                           MRS. ASHER

             Thank you. Some of them have been
             in my family for several generations.
             Please call me Rebecca.

athletic kid. They stop at age fourteen.

                           GRACE

             Is that Martin?

                          MRS. ASHER

             No. That's Reese. Martin's older
             brother. He drowned in a terrible
             accident.
Grace notes a photo of a smiling young REESE receiving a
long distance swimming trophy.

                           GRACE

             I'm so sorry, Rebecca.    How did he
             drown?

                           MRS. ASHER

             The San Michel River. Martin fell
             out of their raft and Reese jumped
             in to save him.

                           MRS. ASHER (CONT'D)

             There was a lot of snowmelt that
             year. Martin reached the bank.
             Reese didn't. It was their
             fourteenth birthday.

                           GRACE

             Their fourteenth birthday?

                           MRS. ASHER

             They were twins. Identical twins.

                           GRACE

             You said Reese was older.

                           MRS. ASHER

             By three minutes. They were very
             different boys.

                           GRACE

             To lose one son so young, then to
             lose the other two years later; to
             think you've lost him. That must
             have been devastating.
Mrs. Asher lights a cigarette. Crosses to the window, so
poised, so tragic. Grace studies her with a critical
eye.

                           MRS. ASHER

             Reese was very charismatic and
             outgoing. Martin was introverted.
             He never thrived like Reese. He
             was a very disturbed young man.
             Reese was Martin's world. Martin
             never recovered his equilibrium
             after we lost him. He changed.
             Martin began to intimidate me. He
             could be very menacing. He began
             imitating Reese at school and that
             lead to fights with other
             students. At sixteen he stole
             some jewelry that was very
             precious to me and ran away. A
             few days later the Thunder Bay
             police called and said my son had
             been killed changing a tire.

                           GRACE

             The police want you to sign this
             so they can exhume the body in
             Martin's grave and verify
             identity.

INT. BATHROOM - DAY

Grace pokes her head in, looks around.     Nothing of note.







INT. MRS. ASHER'S BEDROOM - DAY

The door opens and Grace peers in. Flowing silk, throw
pillows, like a Sultan's tent. Interesting.




INT. THE BOYS' ROOM - DAY

Grace opens the door. Bingo. More LAUGHTER O.S. A bed,
still made. Old toys. Sports equipment. An "R" on the
headboard.
On the other side; shadows on the wall where pictures
used to hang. Indents in the carpet. Where a bed used
to be.
Grace's brow furrows.     Martin has been erased.




INT. HALLWAY - DAY

GROWLING. Grace turns. Sees a diminutive DOBERMAN
SNARLING at her. The miniature hound guards a door.
A door with several locks.    Grace takes a step toward it.
The tiny dog bares its fangs. Grace reaches for a
deadbolt. The little DOG GROWLING. One deadbolt is
open. CLICK. Grace opens the other one.

Grace startles.        Mrs. Asher is right behind her.

                              GRACE

             I know.     I was snooping.
Grace closes the door.       Mrs. Asher escorts Grace away,
past the boys' room.

                           MRS. ASHER

                     (re: the boys' room)
             My friends call it the shrine.     It
             can be difficult to let go.

                             GRACE

             I know.
A beat.

                           MRS. ASHER

             He's killing people, isn't he?
Grace nods:     yes.     Mrs. Asher assumed as much.

                           GRACE

             That doesn't surprise you?

                            MRS. ASHER

             No.   It doesn't.

Grace gets in. Laval shaving with an electrical razor.
Laval pulls out.

             That lady is definitely a queen
             without a country. I should have
             curtsied.
                     (watches him shave)
             Hygiene on the road. Very
             efficient.
The razor dies.        Leaving Laval half-shaven.

A cheap wood coffin sits on a gurney. The lid has been
removed. Grace, Laval and Reynaud peer inside and REACT.
Reynaud looks ill.

                           MEDICAL EXAMINER

             Hmm. Could be worse after getting
             run over by a pickup and twenty
             years in the ground.




INT. AUTOPSY ROOM - DAY (10 MINUTES LATER)

The body has been moved to the exam table. Covered with
mold the corpse seems to be upholstered with baby blue
velvet. The Medical Examiner checks the scale.

                           MEDICAL EXAMINER

             Bodies get mixed up all the time.
             Police found the wallet, called
             the mother and nothing was cross-
             checked. This was his head.
Medical Examiner pulls a plastic bag from the coffin.
Slices it open, revealing skull fragments and teeth.
Passes them off to an ASSISTANT.

                            MEDICAL EXAMINER

                     (to the assistant)
             Get that to Doctor Shivani and
             make sure someone signs for it.
                     (to Grace)
             She'll rebuild his jaw line and
             check it against Martin Asher's
             dental X-rays.

                           GRACE

             How soon, sir?

Five XL-sized COPS pump iron before their shift.

CAMERA FINDS GRACE.




She's doing sit-ups on a decline bench, holding a 25-
pound plate to her chest. She's a machine. Sweating.
Intense. The cops can't help but to be impressed.

          The X-rays don't match.

             She didn't have one picture of
             Martin. Not one. Even cut him
             out of the old yearbooks. And she
             had a basement door like a vault.
             She's hiding something. In the
             basement of her house. What is
             it, ten minutes away from here?
             Her house.
A beat.   Laval looks at Grace, decides he can trust her.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             If she's under our protection and
             something happens to her house,
             her belongings, the department
             could be liable. There could be a
             lawsuit.

                           GRACE

             You're right. We should make sure
             her front door is locked.
Laval makes a U-turn.




INT. ASHER HOUSE - NIGHT

The front door opens. Revealing Grace, and Laval as he
pockets a lockpick gun.

                            INSPECTOR LAVAL

             I'll stay outside. Kill him if
             he's in there.

                           GRACE

             Yeah, I'll get 'em.
Grace enters with a flashlight and a pistol. She
cautiously clears each room until she is sure she is
alone.
Grace crosses to the hallway. The little dog is there.
GROWLING. Grace tosses it a hamburger patty.

                           GRACE

             Let's be friends.
The dog happily attacks its treat as Grace opens the
deadbolts on the door the little dog was guarding.

INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT




Grace descends CREAKING STOPS. Shining her light around.
Old boxes. Furniture. Forgotten things. Dust.
Grace is looking for something and she's not sure what.
She spots a door chain. She moves some boxes. Finds a
leather razor strop hanging next to a small door.
Grace's hand undoes the chain. Lifts the latch and opens
the door as rusted HINGES SQUEAL.




INT. MARTIN'S CELL - NIGHT

Grace moves aside cobwebs with her big flashlight. The
room is tiny. Exposed joists overhead. Grace sits on
the cold concrete. A sleeping bag rolled in the corner.
One wall is just chicken wire. Her flashlight beam stabs
at the yawning darkness beneath the house.
There is a public school desk chair combo. The name
MARTIN neatly carved into it, then scratched out. A
broken light bulb overhead, its wires running to a corner
of the house.
Grace cautiously unrolls the sleeping bag. A pair of
socks, underwear, T-shirt neatly folded inside. She
rolls it back up. Finds a large jar, picks it up. Very
old feces inside, a makeshift toilet. She sets it down.
Grace pulls the door shut.   And turns off her flashlight.
Pitch black. So quiet.
She sits there, in the musty little cage. Listening to
her BREATHING, to her HEART BEAT. So lonely, so
frightening. A tear rolls down her cheek. She SNIFFLES,
wipes away the tear. A beat. Grace hears SCRATCHING.
She clicks on her light.







GRACE'S FLASHBACK - INT. MARTIN'S CELL - NIGHT

YOUNG MARTIN ASHER IS HUDDLED in the corner, shivering,
CRYING and WHIMPERING. Martin looks AT us with haunted
eyes.




INT. MARTIN'S CELL - NIGHT (PRESENT)

Grace REACTS, nothing is there. Chuckles for scaring
herself. Grace feels the chicken wire. MORE SCRATCHING.
Grace freezes. Listening carefully. Mice?
SOMETHING moves closer.

She swings her flashlight on:       TWO FIERY EYES.
WHAM! Something big slams into the chicken wire. Teeth
flashing, GROWLING. It's a BADGER. Grace almost shoots
it. The fearless beast GROWLS.
Grace kicks the door open and runs out of there.




INT. UNMARKED CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

Laval driving back to Montreal.      Grace is shaken.

                     (filtered)
             Grace. Someone broke into my
             office. Minutes ago.

                           GRACE

             At the art gallery?

                            COSTA (V.O.)

             Yes.   My office here.

                           GRACE

             Are they still there?

                           COSTA (V.O.)

             No.

                           GRACE

             Did you call the police?

                           COSTA (V.O.)

             You told me to call you if
             anything happened.

                           GRACE

             We'll be right there. I'm sending
             a car. Don't touch anything.







EXT. ART GALLERY - NIGHT

Two POLICE CRUISERS SCREECH to a stop outside.







INT. ART GALLERY OFFICE - NIGHT

Wooden painting crates everywhere. A table saw for
making frames. Costa is distressed. Grace looking at a
message typed onto his computer screen.

                           COSTA

             I do all my calls to Europe and
             shipping stuff at night. My
             address book was on the screen
             when I went out for coffee. I
             came back and this was on the
             screen.

                           GRACE

             How long were you gone?

                           COSTA

             Ten minutes. Maybe. When I
             returned, that was on the screen.

INSERT COMPUTER SCREEN: MR. COSTA: MEET ME TONIGHT @ LES


FRERS ON RUE CHAUCER. CU @ THE BAR 1:30 A.M.

Reynaud takes a picture of the screen. Laval checking
the door's lock. Finds no marks. Gives Costa a look.

                           COSTA

             Is this about the strangling?   Is
             that guy after me?

                           GRACE

             Please relax, Mr. Costa. We don't
             know if there's a connection yet.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             Is anything missing.

                           COSTA

             No.  Everything's here.
                     (a beat)
             Shit. He took my organizer and my
             business checkbook.
Grace nods for Laval to step outside with her.




                                                        52.





EXT. ALLEY BEHIND GALLERY - DAY




Grace and Laval.

                        GRACE

          How do we know Costa didn't stage
          this? For attention or something.

                        INSPECTOR LAVAL

          He's happy to see you. But the
          alarm was jumpered. Do you think
          Costa knows how to jumper an
          alarm?

                        GRACE

          We should take the computer.
Costa who has followed them out, overheard.

                        COSTA

          Don't take the computer.    That's
          my brain.
Costa turns to Grace.

                        COSTA

          I'm not making this up.     Believe
          me.
Grace shrugs, sees an ATM facing the alley.

                        GRACE

          Should I believe you?
Grace crosses to the ATM.   Peers into its security
camera.

                        GRACE

          Or should I believe this.

                        COSTA

          Believe what you want.
He's cocky, Grace likes that.




EXT. ALLEY - ATM VIDEO - NIGHT

Being fast forwarded. COSTA exits his office.        Locks the
door. He walks TOWARD CAMERA and EXITS FRAME.
A MAN'S SILHOUETTE in the alley. Crossing towards the
office door. An ATM CUSTOMER blocks the shot. The ATM
customer moves on.

CONTINUED:




Nobody is there.     Then:
MARTIN ASHER exits Costa's office. Closes the door.
APPROACHES CAMERA, nonchalant. His face is clear; the
piercing eyes, the sharp features. Asher EXITS FRAME.
Fast forward some more until Costa ENTERS FRAME and
crosses to his office with a cup of coffee. The VIDEO
STOPS. It REWINDS. FREEZES ON ASHER.

                                         CUT WIDE TO:





INT. TASK FORCE ROOM - NIGHT

Costa, Grace, Laval and Reynaud. Costa stands there
looking at Asher's image on the video monitor.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             Is that the man you saw choking
             Mr. Ford?
Fear flashes across Costa's face.

                           COSTA

             I must of walked right past him.

                           GRACE

             Mr. Costa, is that the man you saw
             kill Mr. Ford in the parking lot?

                           COSTA

             Yes. That's him. That is the man
             I saw murder Todd Ford in the
             parking lot outside my gym. No
             doubt. Now will you go catch him,
             please?

                            GRACE

             Thank you.   I just needed you to
             say it.

                           COSTA

             Who is this guy? He's like a
             Ninja. Sneaking into my office.
             How dangerous is he? Does he want
             to kill me?

                           GRACE

             John, no harm will come to you.
             Listen to me. No harm will come
             to you. I promise. Anyone who
             wants to hurt you will have to get
             through these two for starters.

She gestures at Laval and Reynaud.     Costa turns to them.

                           COSTA

             How many people have you killed?



Reynaud shrugs.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             You will be safe, my friend.

                           GRACE

             We want you to be there tonight.
A beat, Costa smiles.     Realizes she's serious.

                           COSTA

             No. I'm not meeting him.
             Absolutely not. You ever go
             fishing? The bait always dies.

                           GRACE

             He won't get within fifty feet of
             you. The second we see him, the
             cuffs go on.

                           COSTA

                     (adamant)
             Grace, no.




INT. STAKEOUT VAN - NIGHT

Costa gives Grace a look as Reynaud tapes a microphone to
the BODY ARMOR he is wearing.

                           COSTA

             What if he shoots me in the head?

                           INSPECTOR REYNAUD

             I will take the bullet for you
             like the Secret Service. Okay,
             friend?
Reynaud is serious.     Grace helps Costa with his shirt.

                           COSTA

             You're good. You could move a lot
             of art if you wanted to.
Their eyes meet for a beat.

                           COSTA

             And inspire some too, I'm sure.
Right then something very rare happens; Grace blushes.




                                                      55.





INT. LES FRERS - NIGHT (1:29 AM)




Ultra-hip. The dance floor THROBS with CLUBGOERS.      THE
DJ THUMPS a EUROBEAT.
Costa sits at the bar. PEOPLE all around him, jostling
to buy drinks. Two busy BARTENDERS sling booze.
Costa finds the noise and crowd absolutely nerve-
wracking. He twirls the ice in his Scotch with a finger.
Staring at the clock. 1:31 AM. He's nervous, sweat
beads his forehead. A big BARTENDER, an undercover cop,
pours Costa a Scotch.

                         BARTENDER

          Don't worry.   You're doing fine.

                        COSTA

          Could you look any more like a
          cop?

                         BARTENDER

          What?

                        COSTA

          Could I have some water?    I'm
          cooking in this thing.
Costa scratches around the neck of the hot BODY ARMOR.
The Bartender gives him a Dasani.
VARIOUS ANGLES: A half-dozen UNDERCOVERS are mixed in
with the CLUBGOERS.
CAMERA FINDS Reynaud sitting at the bar near Costa, gives
Costa a reassuring nod through the crowd.




INT. UNMARKED CAR - NIGHT (1:53 AM)

Parked outside the club. Grace and Laval watch Costa via
the TV built into the dash.

                        GRACE

          Costa fits Asher's choice of
          victims. Travels the World
          looking for art. Single. No kids
          or anything.
                  (looking around)
          Asher's here somewhere. Watching.
          With all the patience in the
          world.

CONTINUED:





                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             I wish I had his patience. He
             should be a cop. His mother
             should be punished. Like the
             owner of pit bulls that attack
             kids.

                             GRACE

             You got kids?

                             INSPECTOR LAVAL

             Three.

                           GRACE

             Don't keep them in a cage.




INT. LES FRERS - NIGHT (2:03 AM)

Costa looks miserable. Overheating, anxiously nursing
his water. He looks around. Then REACTS. A note sits
on the bar top. Right in front of him. Costa looks
around. Only sees strange faces.
Costa carefully unfolds the note.       It reads:   "MEET ME IN

THE RESTROOM NOW."








INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Costa walks down a narrow hallway. Paint peeling.        MUSIC
MUTED. Red light bulbs hanging from the ceiling.
Approaching the men's room, Costa looks over his
shoulder. No one is watching.




INT. MEN'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Costa cautiously pushes open the door. Stepping inside.
Dingy tiles. DRIPPING FAUCET. Several stalls.
The room seems empty. Costa swallows, bends down.
Checks under the stalls. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing...
Then. Something. At the far stall. A pair of men's
shoes. Black. Polished. Facing the stall door.
Waiting...
Costa freezes.     Backs away as...
The stall door slowly swings open. HINGES CREAK.        A
foot, a trouser cuff. A leg stepping out...

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                         57.





CONTINUED:




A BLACK MAN emerges.       One of the guys at the end of the
bar. Costa exhales.        A bundle of nerves.

                            BLACK MAN

             Go outside.
Costa eyes him.

                            COSTA

             What?

                           BLACK MAN

             We're calling it off.




EXT. ALLEY OUTSIDE CLUB - NIGHT

Costa bursts from the fire exit, fed up. He rips off the
wire, he struggles out of the body armor. Grace and
Laval watching.

                           COSTA

             I have a life. I can't play
             superhero for you. I don't handle
             stress very well. I have an art
             show to open tomorrow and I don't
             know what I'm putting on the walls
             yet.

                           GRACE

             I know you have a life. So did
             the people who have lost theirs.
             Someone else might die if you do
             not help us. Every time someone
             dies it affects forty, fifty
             lives.
Costa looks at her, arms on his hips.

                           COSTA

             Grace, I've been cooperating. I
             even drew you a picture. You
             can't put your responsibility on
             me. You have a badge, not me.

                           GRACE

             If somebody else dies, and you
             know you could have done more to
             stop it, you're going to feel like
             shit for a very long time, Mr.
             Costa.
A beat.   That resonates with Costa.

             listen to bad techno.



A beat.

                           GRACE

             It's okay to be scared.

                           COSTA

             Scared? I'm off-the-charts
             terrified. There's a pissed-off
             serial killer after me. I mean,
             what did I do to him?

                           GRACE

             You saw him and that's enough.
             Don't stop living your life.
             You'll be protected by armed
             officers twenty-four seven.

                           COSTA

             Until he's caught?

                           GRACE

                     (softly)
             I can't promise you that.
Costa is torn, Grace empathizes with him.

                           COSTA

             I have a lot of work to do.

                           GRACE

             A car is watching the gallery.
             You'll be okay.
Costa looking at Grace.     He decides to trust her.




INT. DIRECTOR GILLET'S OFFICE - DAY

Director Gillet leans against a wall, smoking a pipe.
Grace, Laval, Reynaud sit on the tired couches.

                           DIRECTOR GILLET

             So who was in Asher's grave?

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             Dan Soulsby. He went missing from
             the Alberta Military Institute two
             days before the accident.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                         59.





CONTINUED:





                           GRACE

             I'm sure Soulsby's death was a
             homicide, Asher saw the
             opportunity and took it. He
             became Soulsby and bummed around
             Seattle for a couple years.

                           DIRECTOR GILLET

             Why is Asher after Costa? Why
             isn't he in Mexico getting a new
             face?

                           GRACE

             Costa saw him. Costa caught him
             in the act, caught him being
             Martin Asher. Seen first by his
             mother, then by Costa. For the
             first time he's failed at taking a
             life, and since we found the
             apartment, he can't be Edwards.
             To be seen, to be recognized, is a
             horrifying thing to Asher. He has
             no identity and wants it that way.

                           DIRECTOR GILLET

             Where is the real Mr. Edwards?

                            GRACE

             Likely dead and buried south of
             the border somewhere.
                     (beat)
             South of the American border
             somewhere. Visa records put
             Asher, using Kohler's ID and
             Edwards at a Mexican surf resort.
             Edwards' last charge was sixteen
             hundred dollars at a 'no questions
             asked' facelift clinic in
             Guadalajara.
Director Gillet taps out his pipe.     Looks at a new, more
detailed portrait of Asher.

                           DIRECTOR GILLET

             Have you contacted the clinic?

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

             Yes. They are also 'no questions
             answered.' Mr. Kohler suddenly
             paid off his credit card bills,
             thanks to money from Edwards.

                           DIRECTOR GILLET

             Keep's the collection agencies off
             the trail. How do we flush Mr.
             Asher?




                           GRACE

             He's focused on Costa. Who fits
             the profile of Asher's victims.
             He went on Costa's computer and E-
             mailed copies of Costa's files to
             an E-mail account in Denmark.
             Constant threat of discovery,
             Asher will become more
             disorganized.
Laval and Reynaud agree.

                           DIRECTOR GILLET

             Okay. My office will arrange a
             press conference. I will tell a
             room full of correspondents we
             have a suspect who is dead and
             murder victims who are alive. And
             I'll sound like a madman.

                           GRACE

             It does sound crazy. That's what
             the press likes, sir.




INT. POLICE BUILDING LOBBY - NEWS VIDEO - DAY

Director Gillet stands tall before a podium. Blinded by
lights. A bouquet of microphones in his face. Beside
him is a haunting poster-sized portrait of Martin Asher.

                           DIRECTOR GILLET

             Mr. Asher, we know who you really
             are. We will find you and we will
             arrest you. You can hide no
             longer.







EXT. ART GALLERY - DAY

Posters advertise SUMMERFEST.     CITY WORKERS put up
barricades and porto-potties.




INT. ART GALLERY - DAY

Two CARPENTERS uncrate and hang paintings.




                                                       61.





ON COSTA




Lost in thought. He studies a series of vivid paintings
leaning against the wall. He crosses. Changes the
order. Steps back. Something isn't right.




                         CARPENTER

           Mr. Costa, some men in that car
           have been watching this place all
           morning.
The Carpenters looking out the window.

                         COSTA

           They're protecting the art. Go
           ahead and hang those. Be very
           careful.

                         CARPENTER

           Yessir.
Costa hears a POLICE RADIO. Spins around. Grace and
Reynaud have entered. Costa is apprehensive. What now?
Grace gives him a reassuring smile.

                         GRACE

           Security is going to be very solid
           tonight.
She waves him out of earshot of the Carpenters.     Their
faces are close. Grace gets butterflies.

                         COSTA

           Is he going to show up tonight?
           What do I do, offer him a drink?

                         GRACE

           He won't show. But we want to be
           here in case he does. Four
           plainclothes officers will form a
           perimeter watching the four
           corners.

                         COSTA

           A perimeter, excellent.

                         GRACE

           Yes. And four plainclothes
           officers will be in here.
           Mingling.

                         COSTA

           Mingling? I don't need four
           bruisers crashing through my
           clientele.

                                              (CONTINUED)

                           GRACE

             The officers will be very
             discreet. We won't interfere with
             your thing.




                             COSTA

             With my thing.    Will you be
             mingling?

                              GRACE

             Sure.     If you feel safer.

                             COSTA

             Much safer.




EXT. ART GALLERY - NIGHT

Summerfest, a street festival, is just warming up.       It
could be Mardi Gras, plastic cups and glowsticks.







INT. ART GALLERY - NIGHT (9:39 PM)

A cutting edge club feel. A DJ spins a captivating
mellow mix. The gallery is filled PATRONS ABUZZ with
chit-chat. Inspector Laval and Reynaud study the
patrons.

                           INSPECTOR LAVAL

                     (subtitled French)
             This painting costs more than my
             house.
Reynaud shakes his head.




FIND GRACE

She's stunning and shy about it. She examines a
painting. A gentle hand touches her back. She turns.
It's Costa. He hands her a highball.

                             GRACE

             Thanks.

                           COSTA

             You look a little anxious.

                            GRACE

                     (re: her dress)
             This isn't me.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                         63.





CONTINUED:





                             COSTA

             It's all you.
Grace gives Costa a look.       She sips her drink, nods at
the painting.

                           GRACE

             I'm trying to get into the show,
             but I mean. What is this? It
             looks like somebody napalmed the
             Garden of Eden.

                            COSTA

             Mangos.   Ripe mangos hanging on a
             branch.
Now she sees it.

                           GRACE

             Oh. Okay. Why the borders?
             Almost every painting has one.
             Was he in prison or something?
Costa REACTS, impressed by Grace.

                           COSTA

             Most people don't notice. This is
             from his prison series. He could
             see a mango grove through his cell
             window. He made some of the
             pigments himself. From flowers.
             From his own blood.

                           GRACE

             What was his crime?

                           COSTA

             He attacked his neighbor with a
             machete. There was a woman
             involved.

                             GRACE

             Always is.
Grace sips her drink, letting herself relax.       She enjoys
Costa's company.

                           GRACE

             He had a lot of lovers, didn't he?

                           COSTA

             Dozens. He was a consumer of
             life's pleasures.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                         64.





CONTINUED:





                           GRACE

             Now he's dead and you get rich?

                           COSTA

             His children formed a corporation,
             I take ten percent. I'm not a
             buccaneer, Grace.
Grace looks at Costa and smiles.

                             COSTA

             What?

                           GRACE

             I don't think I've ever met anyone
             quite like you.

                           COSTA

             You're very sensitive for...

                             GRACE

             An FBI agent?
The ELEGANT WOMAN spots Costa and crosses. She lays a
hand on Costa's shoulder. He turns and they kiss cheeks.

                           ELEGANT WOMAN

             John, it's amazing tonight. I
             want to cry, I'm so touched.
Grace watches her hand linger on Costa's arm. And is
amazed that she feels jealous. She catches Costa's eye.

                           GRACE

             Mr. Costa, I would like to discuss
             an arrangement for the series.
The Elegant Woman REACTS.

                           ELEGANT WOMAN

             Just a sec, John.
She crosses to the Older Man in b.g.       Costa is miffed.

                           COSTA

             What are you doing?

                           GRACE

             She's not writing the checks.
The Elegant Woman returns with the Older Man.       He grabs
Costa's hand.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                          65.

                           OLDER MAN

             John, it's incredible what you've
             put together.
                     (aside to Costa)
             The thing we were talking about
             the other day, well I'd like to
             proceed. Hell, I'm sick of making
             two percent in the market.

                           COSTA

             Dick, they're yours.
The Older Man smiles, shakes Costa's hand. The Elegant
Woman looking at Grace, arms crossed, enjoys her victory.
Grace plays along, stalks off, hiding a grin.




INT. ART GALLERY - NIGHT

A few minutes later Costa finds Grace at the turntables
looking through the DJ's records.

                           GRACE

             Don't you miss wax?

                           COSTA

             You helped me close the biggest
             sale of the night.

                             GRACE

             What's my cut?

                           COSTA

             What do you want?
Grace smiles coyly.

                             GRACE

             I don't know.
Costa looks at Grace for a long beat.      Not sure what her
game is, or if he wants to play.

                           COSTA

             Let me know when you do.   Excuse
             me.
Costa walks away.     Grace REACTS; she didn't want that.







INT. ART GALLERY - BATHROOM - NIGHT

Costa takes a leak.     He's in a good mood.

                                                 (CONTINUED)





                                                            66.





CONTINUED:




The window above the stalls is open. The noise of the
PARTYING CROWD on the sidewalks outside.
Costa finishes, washes his hands.        Pauses.    Smoothes his
hair.




SOMEONE BEHIND HIM

Costa looks in the mirror and REACTS.
MARTIN ASHER stares at him from the mirror. No doubt who
it is. Asher is wound tight, not at all happy.

                           ASHER

             Put your hands on the wall.
Asher jams a gun in Costa's back.        Costa is very scared.

                           ASHER

             Feel that?

                           COSTA

             Please be cool with that.    I don't
             wanna get hurt.

                           ASHER

             I should blow your spine out. My
             face is everywhere. I have to
             hide in the shadows like a fucking
             animal because of you.

                           COSTA

             Yessir. I apologize for
             everything you think I may have
             done.

                           ASHER

             We're moved past sorry. You
             ruined everything. John, soon to
             be dead, Costa.
Asher's eyes flash. WHAM! Asher slams Costa's face into
the mirror. Costa's nose bleeds.

                           COSTA

             Stop it!







INT. ART GALLERY - NIGHT

Reynaud stands near the bathroom. He heard that.          He
approaches the door, tests the knob.




                                                     67.





INT. ART GALLERY - BATHROOM - NIGHT




The door opens. Costa hits the deck. Asher spins, aims
at Reynaud and FIRES. POP-POP-POP-POP! Reynaud drops
and rolls out of the line of fire.







INT. ART GALLERY - NIGHT

Asher bursts from the bathroom, running right over
Reynaud, who draws his pistol.
Grace pulls a pistol, Laval too. Asher running through
the patrons. Grace takes a knee and aims. She doesn't
have a clear shot. Asher aims his gun straight ahead as
he runs. People hit the deck.

                           ASHER

          Out of my way!
POP! Asher SHOOTS a WINDOW, SHATTERING it. He shoulders
his way through the safety glass. Grace and Laval
follow.







EXT. ART GALLERY - NIGHT

Chaos. Summerfest is in full swing. A swirling, boiling
CROWD of shiny faces. Asher dives into their midst.
Grace plunges in after him. Inspector Laval follows.




INT. ART GALLERY - BATHROOM - NIGHT

Costa is stunned, Reynaud checks him for bullet holes.

                           COSTA

          I'm okay.
From Reynaud's radio:

                  (filtered, subtitled
                   French)
          Jean, he ran into the damn crowd.
Reynaud bolts out of there.




EXT. FESTIVAL STREET - NIGHT

Asher and his pursuers leave a wake of disturbed REVELERS
that Reynaud follows.
Asher running. Careening, rolling, bouncing off PEOPLE.
He has the tireless power of a soccer player.




                                                         68.





ON GRACE




Running.   Equally tireless.      Locked onto Asher like a
missile.
Grace is slowly gaining on Asher.



Laval behind her.      Running.   Screaming in his radio.

                          INSPECTOR LAVAL

                   (subtitled French)
           We're heading East. Form a line
           at Seychelles.
A dozen UNIFORMS charge through the crowd.




EXT. INTERSECTION - DAY

Police RADIOS busy with CHATTER. UNIFORMS clear a path
for two PATROL CARS. SIRENS WHOOP as they coast in, TAP
bumpers, blocking the intersection.
POLICE OFFICERS form a formidable skirmish line.
SHOUTING for REVELERS to move aside.







EXT. FESTIVAL STREET - NIGHT

Asher running. Gun in his pocket. Elbowing his way
through the crowd. Asher REACTS. He sees the gauntlet
of UNIFORMS and PATROL CARS blocking the intersection
ahead.
Asher shoves his hand in his pocket...

BOOM!   BOOM-BOOM!     POP-POP-POP!

Thunderous GUNFIRE. Grace hits the deck. The Uniforms
hit the deck. The CROWD SCREAMS, CLAPS and WHISTLES.
It's not gunfire...

TILT UP.

FIREWORKS unfold in the night sky like giant flowers of
fire. Rivers of sparks.
Grace recovers her feet with palpable relief, she thought
she was dead for a second. Grace looking around for
Asher. Laval reaches her.

                            GRACE

           Shit.     You see him?
POP-POP-BOOM! More fireworks.         Laval gestures for some
Uniforms to spread out.

A SHRILL SCREAM O.S.

From an apartment building. Grace runs into the
building. Laval follows her.







INT. APARTMENT - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Grace and Laval running.   More SCREAMING O.S.    They run
upstairs.







INT. APARTMENT - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION




An UPSET WOMAN is in the hall, standing by the just-been
kicked-in door of her apartment. Grace and Laval charge
inside.




INT. UPSET WOMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The SLIDING GLASS DOOR to the balcony has been shattered.
Below and beyond is a long rooftop.
Madly lit by a swirl of bright lights. A huge outdoor
dance floor throbs with energy in a park along the St.
Lawrence River.

GRACE SEES --

ASHER jump from the far end of the roof.




EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

Laval will go no further. Grace gets a running start,
jumps from the apartment window, tucks and rolls. On her
feet again, Grace sprints along the roof.
FIREWORKS BOOM and POP overhead.   THUMPING TECHNO.
Grace reaches the edge of the roof.     REACTS.   Reynaud has
caught up with her.




EXT. RIVER PARK - GRACE'S POV - NIGHT

Asher has vanished into a vast sea of DANCERS, adorned
with strobing and glowing jewelry. The BEAT dominates
all sound.




                                                         70.





EXT. RIVER PARK - NIGHT




Grace and Reynaud trade looks, tenacious street cops at
heart, they holster their guns and jump into the crowd.

FIND ASHER --




A dozen yards away. He stalks a dancing RAVER who wears
a huge bundle of glowing necklaces.
Asher snatches necklaces.   Disappears into a wall of

DANCERS.


FIND GRACE --

She and Reynaud scan the moving bodies for Asher. Grace
GLIMPSES the back of Asher's head. Grace and Reynaud
tear through the crowd like bulls, working together, a
bonding moment.
Asher is an arm's length ahead of Grace. She reaches
out, her fingers snag the cloth of his shirt. Asher
turns...

IT'S NOT ASHER.

Grace shoves him aside and moves on. She SEES a
disturbance up ahead. Grace shoulders her way through
the crowd.
Grace and Reynaud converge on the disturbance.    They
cleave through ONLOOKERS to reveal...




A FIGHT

Two drunk COLLEGE JOCKS slug it out. Grace looks around;
no Asher. Angry, frustrated, Grace grabs one of the
Jocks, hurls him to the ground. Six UNIFORMS swarm in
and arrest the two Jocks.
Reynaud throws up his arms in frustration.    He looks at
Grace, they know they've been beaten.







EXT. RIVER PARK - CRANE SHOT - NIGHT

PULL BACK to reveal Grace and Reynaud surrounded by an
ocean of bodies in motion.

CAMERA FINDS A DANCER.

Some dude with his shirt off grinds on three HOTTIES.

PUSH IN ON THE DANCER.

                                                        71.





CONTINUED:




It's Asher. His face is an evil green from his mane of
pilfered gel glow necklaces. Red plastic cup in hand,
Asher enjoys the boisterous anonymity.







ASHER'S EYES

Dangerous and cold.     They track Grace as she moves
through the crowd.
Asher grabs one of the hotties, begins making out with
her.
Grace searching the crowd.    Scanning faces.
Grace passes within feet of Asher.
Asher smirks.     Now another hottie wants a kiss.   Asher
complies.







INT. ART GALLERY - NIGHT

It's late. Costa has a beer, his nose bandaged.
INSPECTORS finish up questioning PATRONS. Grace enters,
crosses to Costa. She's tense, wound tight.

                           GRACE (O.S.)

             Need a ride home?
Costa looks at her. Despite everything, his face shows
he is glad to see Grace.




INT. UNMARKED CAR - MOVING - LATE NIGHT

Grace drives.     Costa in the passenger seat.

                           COSTA

             The night started out great.
             Everything gelled. Everyone was
             happy. You helped land a big fish
             and the feeding frenzy started.
             Six figure pieces were flying off
             the wall.
                     (shivers)
             He said he was going to blow out
             my spine. I was thinking surgery.
             Six months in bed. Exercise
             pools. Never walking again.
Grace looks at him.     Costa is worried.

                           COSTA

             He was in my bathroom and none of
             you could stop him. I need to
             leave town.




                           GRACE

             That might be a good idea. Until
             then I'll check under your bed for
             monsters.
Costa looks at her.     Grace gives him a warm, open stare.

                           COSTA

             I would appreciate that very much.
                     (a beat)
             Can I profile you? I read your
             book.

                           GRACE

             Please, don't.

                           COSTA

             Thirty-something, single white
             female. Best schools best grades.
             Discovers adrenaline policing the
             inner city.

                           GRACE

                     (cuts in)
             John, stop it. Please. Let's
             shift the conversation from me and
             my business onto something
             inbounds.

                           COSTA

             Okay. Are you going to my funeral
             when Martin Asher cuts my throat?
They both know she's been lowballing the threat. We can
tell Grace is truly concerned for Costa's welfare.

                           COSTA

             You let him get away.
Grace takes that hard.

                            GRACE

             No excuses.   I'm sorry.

                           COSTA

             I meant you in the general sense.
                     (a beat)
             Can you catch him?

                                                         73.





CONTINUED:





                           GRACE

             We got his name. We catch
             everyone sooner or later.




                           COSTA

             Sooner, please.




INT. COSTA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (3:33 A.M.)

Spacious, lofty.     Costa and Grace enter.

                           COSTA

             Careful.
Costa scoots aside a pile of clothing.       The newspapers.
Cool art, sketches, images all over the walls.
Reminiscent of Grace's hotel room. And a very cool view
of downtown.
Grace taking everything in. Art books, sketch pads.
Piled high on the desk. She looks at the ceiling. SEES
notes and sketches taped up. Grace laughs to herself.

                           COSTA

             I'm sorry. It's a sty.    Must be a
             profiling mother lode.

                           GRACE

             I'm done profiling you.   I got you
             figured out.

                           COSTA

             A failed healer, a failed artist.
Grace looking at a drawing on the wall.       Costa winces, he
didn't want her to notice it.

                           GRACE

             Is that how you see yourself?

                          COSTA

             No. That's you. I did it last
             night.

                           GRACE

             This is how you see me?

                          COSTA

             No. It's how I think you see
             yourself.

                                               (CONTINUED)

                           GRACE

             And how do you see me?
Costa licks his lips.




                           COSTA

             That would be out of bounds.
Grace looking at him. Costa looking at her. A staring
match. Costa and Grace try not to laugh. They end up
giggling.

                           COSTA

             What was that?

                           GRACE

             I don't know. John, games are
             fun. But head games are
             dangerous.

                           COSTA

             Then keep your head out of it.
A beat.   Grace shrugs, back to business.

                           GRACE

             The Justice minister is going to
             relocate you to another city until
             Mr. Asher is in custody.

                           COSTA

             I don't know what your deal is.
             One second you're so there, then
             all I get is the badge.

                           GRACE

             I apologize if you've been getting
             the wrong signal.

                            COSTA

             Yeah.   Relocate where?

                           GRACE

             Another province. They want you
             on a flight tomorrow morning.

                           COSTA

             This monster comes into my life
             and I have to leave?
A UNIFORM SERGEANT enters.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                           SERGEANT

             My people are in place.

                           GRACE

             Thank you, Sergeant.
The Sergeant exits.

                           COSTA

             This is surreal. What do I pack?

                            GRACE

             What you need.   Movers can get the
             rest.

                           COSTA

             I need tomorrow morning to finish
             up my business here.

                           GRACE

             I'll let them know.
This is goodbye.     Neither of them feels very good about
it.

                           COSTA

             I thought you were going to check
             under my bed.
Grace smiles, plays along, crosses, looks under the bed,
stretching for Costa. Driving him nuts.

                            GRACE

             No monsters.

                            COSTA

             Thank you.
Grace holds out her hand.      They shake.

                           GRACE

             I probably won't see you again
             until the trial. If there is a
             trial.

                            COSTA

             Goodbye, then.
Costa leans across her, braces himself against the wall.
A bold move. Now they are eye to eye. Grace kisses
Costa for a long beat.
Grace breaks the kiss. Holds a finger to her lips; shhh.
She turns and exits. The door shuts behind her. Costa
is going to miss Grace.




                                                         76.





EXT. COSTA'S APARTMENT - DAY




The next morning. Laval pulls up in UNMARKED #1, next to
the patrol car that has been guarding Costa's apartment.
With a wave the UNIFORM behind the wheel drives off.
Laval exits his car. Crosses to Costa's door.




NEW ANGLE

Reynaud and Grace have just pulled to the curb a half
block away.







INT. UNMARKED #2 - DAY

Reynaud behind the wheel, turns to Grace.

                          INSPECTOR REYNAUD

            You spent a lot of time with
            Costa.
Grace isn't sure if that's an accusation.

                           INSPECTOR REYNAUD

            I like him.   He's a good guy.
Grace smiles.




EXT. COSTA'S APARTMENT - DAY

Laval RINGING the bell.
A white PLUMBER'S VAN pulls up behind Laval's unmarked.
A PLUMBER gets out.    Coveralls, clipboard.    Crosses to
another apartment.
Costa opens the door. With two packed bags.       Laval takes
one. Costa takes one last look at his home.       Locks the
door.
Laval watches the plumber KNOCKING a couple doors down.
Costa and Laval cross to unmarked #1.
The plumber approaches them.     Costa looking at him,

REACTS.

The plumber is MARTIN ASHER. A gun in his hand.       Laval
drops Costa's bag, reaches for his holster...
POP-POP-POP!    Asher drops Laval with three to the face.

             You just shot a cop.

                            ASHER

             Let's go.   Go!
Costa hits the gas and pulls out.




EXT. COSTA'S APARTMENT - DAY

SCREECH! Reynaud slides to a stop. Leaps from the
still-moving car and checks his friend Laval. Who is no
more. Grace wants to get Asher.

                           GRACE

             You staying or going?

                           INSPECTOR REYNAUD

             I'm not leaving.
Grace slides behind the wheel.          And takes off in the
muscular cop car.




INT. UNMARKED #1 - MOVING - DAY

Costa driving. Scared to death. Asher has the gun in
his lap aimed at Costa's face. Asher looks exhausted.
Hounded.

                           ASHER

             Jesus, he was a cop. He's dead
             because of you, because you made
             the choice. The choice to fuck
             with me. That, John, was a very
             bad choice.
A T intersection ahead.

                            COSTA

             Which way?   Left, right?

                           ASHER

             Left.
Costa makes the turn.     It leads to a HIGHWAY.

                           ASHER

             You're dead, John Costa. You
             fucked with the wrong man,
             shitsmear.
Costa is shaking, looks in the rearview.      Asher rips the
rearview off the windshield.

                           ASHER

             Faster, asshole.

                           COSTA

             I'm flooring it.

                            ASHER

             Shut up.   Faster.
Costa pulls onto the highway, buckles his safety belt.
Asher scoffs at the gesture, then does likewise.

                           ASHER

             Give me your wallet.   Give it
             over. Right now.
Costa does. Asher looks through it, pockets it.      Costa
tries to focus on driving.

                           COSTA

             Are you going to kill me?

                           ASHER

Costa swings out to pass the truck.







AN ONCOMING TRUCK

A head-on imminent.    The Buick swerves onto the shoulder.
Just missing them.




INT. UNMARKED #2 - MOVING - DAY

Grace watches Costa's unmarked SCRAPE past the truck.        A
side mirror is knocked off.
The oncoming Buick swerves back onto the asphalt.
Overcompensates, now heading right for Grace...
Grace REACTS, swerves.
BAM!   The cars hit.   Grace gets a face full of airbag.




EXT. TWO LANE HIGHWAY - DAY

Grace's car spins off the road. Stops in a ditch.       A
beat. The Buick's hulk blocking the road.
Grace exits the unmarked. Dazed but unhurt. She crosses
to the Buick. Three HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS are in the car.

                         GRACE

           Is everyone okay?
They seem alright.

A POLICE CAR SCREECHES to a stop. Then another POLICE
CAR. Grace runs to one of the police cars.

             They're okay. Let's go.
                     (points up the road)
             He just shot a cop.
Grace jumps in the passenger seat.        The COP looking at
her.

             Let's go.   Bad guy's that way.
The Cop nods, PUNCHES IT.




INT. UNMARKED #1 - MOVING - DAY

Costa is driving towards the mountains.        Driving through
the pine forest.

             There.   Turn there.
A hard-to-see side road. Costa JAMS the BRAKES to make
the turn. Asher SLAPS him.

             Yes I do. John, do you have any
             idea how many people I have
             killed? It's always been
             business. This time is personal.

                           COSTA

             Please be cool. C'mon, we don't
             even know each other.

                           ASHER

             Shut up. Art Man. You are stupid
             or crazy or both. Will you drive
             faster? I'll shoot you in the
             thigh. Will that get your
             attention.
Costa speeds up.

                           COSTA

             Don't, man. I got money. You
             want money, I'll give you money.
             I got paintings. What do you
             want? Talk to me, Martin.

                           ASHER

             I am not Martin. There is no
             Martin.

                          COSTA

             Of course. No Martin. What do
             you want? What's my life worth to
             you?

                           ASHER

             Nothing. And everything. This is
             deeper than money. Shut up. Talk
             is done. Talk is over.
             Understand that. You are over.
             Just shut the fuck up.
Asher lights a cigarette.     A sharp turn ahead.    Costa
speeding up.

                           COSTA

             Okay, please, Martin.   Martin.   Be
             cool.
Asher aims his pistol at Costa's head.

                           ASHER

                     (really pissed)
             Who the fuck is Martin?
Costa sets his brow in determination; he is driving
straight at a large tree...
Asher REACTS.
Costa jams his thumb into the release button of Asher's
seatbelt...
Asher angrily pulls the trigger of his pistol.

                                                (CONTINUED)

The unmarked car hits the tree...
POW!   Airbags deploy.



Costa's body is slammed by crash forces but stays put...
Asher goes over his airbag.     Asher's head goes through
the windshield.




INT. POLICE CAR - MOVING - DAY

The Cop GUNS it into the mountains.       A fork in the road.

                           COP

             Which way do I turn?

                           GRACE

             Which way's the river?   Go to the
             river.
The Cop makes a right.







EXT. FOREST CRASH SITE - DAY

Oil smoke and steam pour from the unmarked #1.       Costa is
alive, cut bad. He looks at Asher.

                           COSTA

             Rot in hell, Martin Asher.




INT. UNMARKED #1 - COSTA'S POV - DAY

Asher's head is stuck through the windshield, his throat
cut bad by glass. He's alive. Asher panic-sucks deep
breaths.




EXT. FOREST CRASH SITE - DAY

Costa undoes his safety belt.       Grabs the door handle.
The door pops open.
Costa pulls himself from the wreck.       Flames spread under
the car.




EXT./INT. UNMARKED #2 - MOVING - DAY

They race along a mountain road with a view of the St.
Lawrence River below. They can see far up the road, no
sign of the unmarked #1.
Grace looks behind them, reacts.

EXT. FOREST CRASH SITE - DAY

Costa lays by the road.     Motionless, he may be hurt bad.







UNMARKED #1

is now Martin Asher's funeral pyre. Flames engulf
everything. Even the glass is melting.

BOOM!   A TIRE EXPLODES.

Costa stirs, crawls on his hands and knees, into the road
away from the wreck.
POP-POP-POP!   AMMUNITION in the unmarked EXPLODES from
the heat.
A police car arrives.    SCREECHES to a stop alongside
Costa.
Grace leaps from the passenger side. She grabs Costa,
helps him into the back. POP-POP-POP! More AMMO COOKING

OFF.


                           GRACE

          Let's go!




INT. POLICE CAR - MOVING - DAY

The Cop backs up fast.     BOOM!   Another tire.   Now the
tree has caught fire.
Grace examines Costa, running her hands over Costa's
battered body.

                        GRACE

          Nothing broken?

                        COSTA

          I think my hand is broken.

Grace looks at it.      There is no doubt.

                           GRACE

             Don't move, okay.



Presses his split scalp.

                           GRACE

             This hurt?

                            COSTA

             God yes.   Stop that.

                           GRACE

             You're going to the hospital.
             You'll be fine.

                           COSTA

             Is he dead?

                           GRACE

             Very dead.
Costa relaxes significantly. He realizes Grace is
holding him in his arms. So does Grace. It feels good.
A FIRE ENGINE heading to the crash passes them.




EXT. FOREST CRASH SITE - DAY

Crime scene tape. POLICEMEN form a perimeter. The fire
is out. A Fire Truck pumps water for a three-man HOSE
TEAM cooling the hot metal. A plume of steam rises up
the scorched tree trunk.
The car is nothing more than blackened sheet metal.
Asher has been reduced to a charred torso.







INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

Reynaud sits by himself, his head between his knees.
Mourning Laval, dead on a nearby gurney. Director Gillet
crosses to him. Lays a comforting hand on Reynaud's
shoulder. Reynaud sees who it is, stands crisply, wipes
his tears, embarrassed.

                           INSPECTOR REYNAUD

             I am sorry, sir.

                           DIRECTOR GILLET

             Please, Jean. I called your wife.
             I'm having someone take you home
             to her. There is nothing left to
             do here.
Reynaud doesn't want to leave his dead comrade.

                           DIRECTOR GILLET

             I'm ordering you home.
Reynaud acquiesces.     A Uniform escorts him out of there.
Director Gillet crosses to Grace, who was watching him.
She sips coffee, an icepack on her ankle.

                           GRACE

             You're really good with people.
Gillet shrugs.

                           DIRECTOR GILLET

             How's Mr. Costa?

                           GRACE

             He got off light. With a broken
             wrist and fifty stitches. Lucky
             man.

                           DIRECTOR GILLET

             My luck has run out. Until today
             I have never had to bury a friend.
Grace squeezes his arm.

                           GRACE

             I'm sorry, Director.

                           DIRECTOR GILLET

             Thankfully it's over. We have our
             man. Asher's DNA matched the
             hairs recovered on Ford's body and
             in the apartment.




INT. HOSPITAL - EXAM ROOM - DAY

Costa's scalp is being stitched shut. Costa's wrist is
in a splint. She watches the DOCTOR sew flesh for a
beat.
A KNOCK.     Grace enters.   Grace smiles warmly at Costa.

Grace leans against the wall, smiles.

             morgue?
Grace is hurt by that.

             It's going to   take a couple days

INT. SUPERKOOL LOUNGE - NIGHT




Ultra mellow. Grace and Costa chill on throw-pillows and
tapestries. Persian trip-hop and hookahs.
Grace and Costa have melted into a corner where they sip
tea. Nobody has been more comfortable. Costa pours beer
from a pitcher.

                        COSTA

          I'm happy to be alive but it's
          like this door has been opened.      I
          don't think I was naive. But
          everything is different now.

                        GRACE

          You'll fold this experience into
          your life and be stronger for it.

                        COSTA

          How do you deal with it? All the
          misery and pain and violence.

                        GRACE

          I can stop monsters, John.     And
          because I can, I have to.

                        COSTA

          So is it a calling or a curse?

                         GRACE

          Neither.   It's just my job.

                        COSTA

          When I was in med school I saw a
          guy on a Harley get T-boned by a
          Daihatsu. He was screaming in
          pain and needed help and I knew
          what to do, I had all my certs,
          but I saw all this blood and
          froze. I failed the big test.
          Bye-bye, med school. Hello,

             You threw me in a tiger cage like
             a piece of meat.

                           GRACE

             That's right. You were the cheese
             in the trap. We stopped a monster.
             That's what matters.
Grace is utterly unapologetic.      It makes Costa like her
even more.




INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Grace is in manic cleaning mode. She pulls papers off
the walls. Shoves a pile of clothing in the closet.
Sweeps coffee cups into a wastebasket.
She opens the door for Costa. He enters.        The room is
still a mess, but it feels safe, cozy.

                            GRACE

             I'm sorry.   I'm a pig.

                           COSTA

             I don't trust anyone who's too
             organized.
Grace puts some MUSIC ON the CLOCK RADIO.

                            GRACE

             Want a beer?

                            COSTA

             Gung-ho people like you. And you
             know what I mean. People like you

Grace looks at Costa.

             You are a trip, John Costa.
He's not letting her off the hook.       She plays along.

                          GRACE

             Okay. I guess I'm running and
             chasing.
Costa REACTS.

                            COSTA

             I'm sorry.   I didn't know.

                           GRACE

             Growing up I quit speaking after
             that. I didn't say a word for
             three years. When you're not in
             the conversation, you get
             forgotten real quick. So I'd
             watch people. Study them. The
             mouth can say anything, but the
             body doesn't lie. The tilt of the
             head, the way the hands move.
Grace draws closer.       Costa watching her mouth.

                           COSTA

             How'd you get your voice back?

                           GRACE

             The day my Uncle died. The truth
             exploded out of me like a vision.
             My Uncle and Father had been
             arguing, there was a gunshot and
             my father was dead.

                           COSTA

             You are very intense, you know
             that?

                           GRACE

             I remember my Uncle telling me not
             to say anything. And I didn't.

                            GRACE (CONT'D)

             I made myself forget why. The day
             he died my voice and my memory
             came back. I screamed for an
             hour. Very primal. I haven't
             shut up since.

                           COSTA

             Why did your Uncle do it?

                           GRACE

             Land. Great-grandpa owned half of
             Pennsylvania. My Uncle wanted
             control and sold it all. All
             that's left is an old farmhouse
             and a horse pasture.
                     (sadly)
             My father's murderer got away with
             it because I couldn't open my
             mouth.

                           COSTA

             That's a hell of a lot of
             responsibility for you to put on
             the shoulders of an eight-year-old
             girl.

             Something good game out of it.
             The dead can't speak. Now I'm
             their voice.
Costa cups her face and kisses her. Grace breaks away, a
little hesitant. Something is bothering her.

                           GRACE

             Martin Asher is dead, right?
Costa REACTS.

                           COSTA

             Can we please forget about him?

                            GRACE

             That's the point. He's dead, so
             there won't be a trial where you
             or I would have to admit under
             oath that we did anything
             inappropriate.

                           COSTA

             We haven't done anything.
That's about to change. Grace stands, pulls him off the
couch. Begins undressing him.
She finds horrible dog-bite scars.

                           GRACE

             Jesus.

                           COSTA

             In college we tried to make my
             friend's German Shepherd take a
             bong hit.

                            GRACE

             How mean.   Serves you right.
Costa pulls Grace to her feet.
Grace retreating. Step by step across the room. Costa.
Pursuing. Slowly. Determined. The heat. The immediacy
building.
Costa grabs her. Pushing her. Up against the wall.            The
phone CLATTERS to the floor. Grace's eyes widen.
Two mouths. Inches apart. Costa's hand reaches up her
skirt. Exploring. Grace swallows. His hand reaching
into her panties.
Grace's eyes looking away. As she grabs his arm.
Pulling. Pushing. Wanting. Her mouth. Avoiding his.
Their breath mingling. Until. Costa's lips crush down
on hers. The kiss devouring. Knocking pictures off the
walls. Grace's hands pulling him closer.
Costa picks her up. Throws her on the bed. He tears at
her blouse. Her white lace bra. Grace's back arching.
Her legs wrapping around him. As her eyes flutter open.
Looking up at the ceiling, she gasps.
Costa stops. Turns. To see what she's looking at.
Surprised to see pictures of Asher's victims, the crime
scenes. Staring down at them.
Costa turns to Grace, whispers.

                           COSTA

             Let them watch.
Grace looking deep into Costa's eyes.        Nods her head.
Costa flips her onto her stomach...




                                                          92.





INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY (5:41 A.M.)




Grace and Costa spoon. Grace stirs.       Kisses the back of
Costa's head. He's utterly still.







INT. BATHROOM - DAY

Grace enters, groggy.      Turns on the sink.   Flips on the
light.
Grace reacts, stumbles back.
She's covered with blood.      Grace panics, feels herself
for wounds.







INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Grace shakes Costa.     Tears well in her eyes.

                           GRACE

          John.    John.
Costa stirs.

                         COSTA

          Mmmmm.   Morning.
He sees the blood.    Doesn't really react.

                        COSTA

          My stitches must have ripped.
Grace hands him a towel.      Presses it against his
shoulder.

                        GRACE

          I thought you were scared of
          blood?

                        COSTA

          You better take a shower.




INT. AUTOPSY ROOM - NIGHT (4:30 A.M.)

Mrs. Asher looking at Martin Asher's remains.       The
charred torso, blackened thighbones.
Mrs. Asher reaches for Asher's red swollen face.

                        MEDICAL EXAMINER

          Please don't touch the remains.

                                                (CONTINUED)

She gives him a withering look.

                           MRS. ASHER

             Nineteen years ago I stood in this
             same room and your predecessor
             showed me a washtub full of blood
             and guts and told me it was my
             son. I will touch anything I
             want, Doctor. I'm not going
             through this a third time.
He hands her a pair of rubber gloves. Mrs. Asher SNAPS
them on, she reaches for an eyelid, peels it back.
Stares into the clouded eye. Mrs. Asher REACTS, quickly
withdraws her hand.

                           MRS. ASHER

             It's not him. That's not my
             blood. You people are incredible.
The Medical Examiner SIGHS, thinks she's a kook.

                           MEDICAL EXAMINER

             I'll swab your cheek and test your
             DNA against the body. Will that
             do it?

                           MRS. ASHER

             Good idea, Doctor. He's smarter
             than all of you, do you know that?




INT. EXAM ROOM - DAY

The Doctor staples Costa's scalp.

                           COSTA

             Is that going to hold?   I'm not
             coming back.
Grace enters, in a serious mood.

                             COSTA

             What's wrong?

                           GRACE

             That was my boss. I'm going back
             to Quantico tomorrow.
Suddenly that seems like the end of the world.       Costa
looks at her.

                                                (CONTINUED)





                                                        94.

                           COSTA

             Washington, DC has some of the
             best art in the world. Georgetown
             would be a great place to open a
             gallery.
Grace realizes what he's saying.     Smiles.

                           GRACE

             Staple his mouth too, Doc.
Grace's CELL RINGS.     She exits to take the call.




INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - DAY

Grace leans against a wall.

                            GRACE

             Vanderholt.

                           MEDICAL EXAMINER (V.O.)

             Grace. I ran Mrs. Asher's DNA
             against the suspect down here. No
             way it's her son.
A beat.

                            GRACE

             Not her son?   You're sure?

                           MEDICAL EXAMINER (V.O.)

             Lab ran the test twice.

                           GRACE

             That's weird. Was he adopted,
             switched at birth?

                           MEDICAL EXAMINER (V.O.)

             Listen for a minute. There was a
             match. John Costa is Mrs. Asher's
             biological son.
Grace laughs.     It's a joke.

                           GRACE

             So John Costa is really Martin
             Asher?

                           MEDICAL EXAMINER (V.O.)

             Dear God, I wish I was joking.
Grace turns and REACTS.

                                               (CONTINUED)





                                                               95.





CONTINUED:




Costa has been standing there. Listening. He tries to
read Grace's expression, worry etching his face.
Grace is looking at Costa, her mind racing a million
miles an hour.
Grace's world crumbles as she puts it together.

                           GRACE

             Are you Martin?
Costa gasps.        The very thought is painful.

                           COSTA

             Grace, I'm John. Okay?      I'm John.
Costa hoping against hope everything is okay.          But it's
not okay. Grace has a calamitous expression.

                             GRACE

             Holy shit.
Costa takes a step toward her. The street cop motions
for Costa to stay back. Costa REACTS.




INT. HOSPITAL - COSTA'S POV - DAY

Grace's purse sits on a chair in the exam room.          Her
pistol visible.







INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - DAY

Costa takes the gun from her purse, pockets it, along
with her FBI credentials and car keys.
Costa backs away from Grace.
Costa's physicality transforms from hip art dealer to
something much more menacing. The monster Martin Asher.
Grace looks him dead in the eye, more angry than scared.
(NOTE:   Costa will now be called ASHER.)

                           ASHER

             She screwed it up, didn't she?

                             GRACE

             Who?

CONTINUED:





                           ASHER

             I should have cut her throat when
             I saw her on the ferry. That's
             the least she deserves. Please
             don't do anything, Grace. It
             would hurt me so much if I had to
             hurt you.

                            GRACE

             Good idea.   Don't hurt me.
Costa shakes his head, his brow set with a grim
determination. He turns, enters a stairwell and exits
the building. Grace's heart is breaking.

                           GRACE

             Shit!
She kicks the wall and gives chase, runs into the
stairwell.




EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY

Asher gets into Grace's unmarked.      And drives away.
Grace exits the building, watches him go.
Grace has no way to follow.     Then...
She sees a COP talking to a cute NURSE by his patrol car.

                           GRACE

             Police emergency. We need to
             pursue him. He's a murder
             suspect.
The Cop cocks his head, looks at Grace like she's a
nutcase. Grace dials her cell phone.

                           GRACE

             Director Gillet, there's an
             emergency, can you please tell
             this officer to cooperate with me?
Grace hands the cell phone to the Cop.







EXT. NICE HOTEL - DAY

A patrol car stops in front. Grace leaps out and runs
into the building. An Unmarked pulls up. Reynaud jumps
out and enters the building.




                                                            97.





INT. NICE HOTEL - HALLWAY - DAY




Grace running.   Reading room numbers.     Reynaud appears in
the hall.
Grace finds the right room.    Reynaud joins her, gun
drawn.
The door is ajar.     Grace pushes it open.




INT. HOTEL ROOM - GRACE'S POV - DAY

A MAID changes the sheets.    Mrs. Asher is gone.







INT. ASHER HOUSE - DAY

Mrs. Asher answers a KNOCK at her door.       Mrs. Asher

REACTS.


                          ASHER

          Hello, Mother.
Asher forces his way inside.      Mrs. Asher SCREAMS.




EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

SIRENS SCREAMING, flashing lights as six police cars zip
by at 90.




INT. UNMARKED - DAY

Grace over the shock and harder than steel.       Reynaud
drives fast. Grace on her cell.

                           GRACE

          No answer.     She turns her phone
          off.




INT. ASHER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Mrs. Asher sits on her couch. Asher stands.        The teeny
Doberman walks into the room, sniffs Asher.

                        ASHER

          What happened to Rex?     He was a
          real dog, right, Mom?
Rolls up his sleeve, revealing the dog bite scars.

                           MRS. ASHER

             Don't show me that, Martin. I had
             Rex put down after you ran away.
             Martin, sit.



Asher looks at her defiantly.     Mrs. Asher stands, gets in
his face.

                           MRS. ASHER

             How dare you defy me. You will
             sit down on that couch and you
             will do it now. Martin.
Asher sits. Mrs. Asher lays a hand on his, leans
forward, her eyes intense and earnest.

                           MRS. ASHER

             Martin, you have severe emotional
             problems. I know you're in a lot
             of pain. There's hope and help,
             Martin. Look at me, Martin. I
             love you very much.

                           MARTIN

             I know now that what you did to me
             was not love.




INT. ASHER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Asher sitting on the couch.     Then stands.

                           ASHER

             I'll stand if I want to stand. I
             can do anything I want to do. And
             I've done some great things,
             Mother. I'm not a scared little
             boy you can push around anymore.







NEW ANGLE

Mrs. Asher's head neatly adorns a silver platter.




INT. POLICE CAR - MOVING - DAY

Grace holds on as Reynaud slaloms around a corner in
Asher's neighborhood.

                           INSPECTOR REYNAUD

             I hope the son of a bitch doesn't
             shoot me with the gun you gave
             him. What else did you give
             Asher?

CONTINUED:




An accusing look.

                           GRACE

             Shut up and focus. That kind of
             shit helps no one right now.




EXT. ASHER HOUSE - DAY

Reynaud's car SLIDES to a stop. Police cars take
position around the block, forming a perimeter around the
house.
Grace and Reynaud exit the car. Grace has a shotgun.
Four UNIFORMS, also with shotguns, join them.
The ad hoc entry team runs up the steps, onto the porch.

                           GRACE

             Get right, I got left.
WHAM!   Reynaud KICKS the door.      Grace is first in.







INT. ASHER HOUSE - DAY

Grace, Reynaud and the four Uniforms enter.        Weapons
sweep for targets and clear sectors.
Grace moving down the hallway.       Slowly, breathing hard.




INT. ASHER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Grace enters, approaching the couch. SOMEONE is there.
Grace sidesteps quickly, raises the shotgun.

                             GRACE

             Don't move!
It's Mrs. Asher. Sans head, sitting on the couch.         Grace
turns away, REACTS.
She sees Mrs. Asher's head.

                             GRACE

             Omigod.
Reynaud enters.        Sees Mrs. Asher's head.

                             INSPECTOR REYNAUD

             He's gone.
Reynaud looks at Grace.        Grace feels hollow, miserable.




                                                        100.





INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY




Grace's hotel room is now a crime scene. CRIMINOLOGISTS
process the scene. The sheets are bagged as evidence.







ANGLE ON GRACE

watching this.   Reynaud crosses to her.   SLAPS her.

                        INSPECTOR REYNAUD

          My best friend died protecting a
          serial killer so you could get
          laid. Very nice.
Grace REACTS.    The cat is out of the bag.

                        GRACE

          That's none of your business.

                          INSPECTOR REYNAUD

          No?    It's my case.

                        GRACE

          Back off, Reynaud. Asher fooled
          you too.

                        INSPECTOR REYNAUD

          At least I didn't fuck him.
Grace walks off.   Reynaud intercepts her.

                        GRACE

          Touch me again and I will kick
          your ass.

                        INSPECTOR REYNAUD

          I am taking you to the Director.







INT. DIRECTOR'S GILLET'S OFFICE - DAY

Gillet sits at her desk across from Grace.     His eyes are
harder than normal.

                        DIRECTOR GILLET

          They're on their way from the
          airport.
Grace nods, chews a nail.

          Your old life is over. There is

             You're still young. Whatever

             Director, I'm the last person you
             should be discussing the case with
             at this point.

                             DIRECTOR GILLET

             Grace.    You know his mind, and his
             heart.    Where is he?
A beat.

                           GRACE

             Not here. This city no longer has
             the psychic gravity to hold him
             here. Try Mexico, getting a
             facelift.

                           DIRECTOR GILLET

             We ID'd the remains in the morgue.
             The real ID.
He hands her a picture of the man whom we thought was
Asher.

                           GRACE

                     (reads)
             Richard Hart.




FLASHBACK - INT. HART'S APARTMENT - DAY

Hart rolls painting canvases into a tight cylinder.
Inserts it into a fancy lamp. A hypodermic stands by to
reward his work.

                           DIRECTOR GILLET (V.O.)

             He was an addict. And a thief.
             An art thief. He hits galleries
             in Europe and North America.
             Traveled back and forth smuggling
             and selling stolen canvasses.




                                                      102.





INT. DIRECTOR GILLET'S OFFICE - DAY (PRESENT)




Grace puts it together.

                        GRACE

          Let me guess, Costa was selling
          stolen art for Hart and never gave
          him the money. Now Hart is just
          another one of Asher's victims.
Director Gillet.

                        DIRECTOR GILLET

          Costa owed him eight thousand.
          Those are E-mails off Hart's
          computer.

                        GRACE

                  (reading)
          Go to hell. I won't pay you a
          dime. I'm not scared of you.




FLASHBACK - INT. INTERNET CAFE - NIGHT

Richard Hart checks his E-mail and nearly has a heart
attack.

                        GRACE (V.O.)

          Come and get me. I will never pay
          you, dumbass.
                  (thinks a beat)
          Asher taunted Hart into a
          confrontation. Jesus. It was
          right there in my face. I was
          interpreting behavior from two
          different suspects.







BACK TO SCENE (PRESENT)


                        DIRECTOR GILLET

          He had us all fooled, Grace. All
          of us. If Asher can do that, what
          else can he do?

                        GRACE

          Anything he wants.
KNOCKING. Gillet stands, crosses, opens his door. Two
FBI SUPERVISORS enter. Grim, silver-haired. Grace
stands.

                         GRACE

          Ah, the undertakers have arrived
          for my career.

                                             (CONTINUED)





                                                          103.





CONTINUED:




Grace hugs Gillet.     And the FBI Men escort her out of
Gillet's office.







INT. FBI CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Grace is on the spot.     Her LAWYER by her side.
Facing a panel of seven SENIOR AGENTS.     Microphones,
water pitchers.

                           SENIOR AGENT

             Have your rights been explained to
             you and has an indication to that
             effect been made in your employee
             record?

                           GRACE

             Yessir.







INT. FBI CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

Grace is exhausted, but holding up well.     The questions
don't stop.

                           SENIOR AGENT

             Agent Vanderholt. Why would Asher
             kill Ford, if nobody knew he was
             Costa. If he wasn't going to use
             Ford's identity?

                           GRACE

             He needed a murder he could link
             not only Richard Hart to but also
             to his past victims.




FLASHBACK - INT. HART'S APARTMENT - DAY

Upscale Euro-hip. Hart SLAMS down the phone.        Shoves a
gun in his belt and exits.

                           GRACE (V.O.)

             Hart's behavior was consistent
             with a disorganized drug addict
             following the rules of the
             criminal road by attempting to
             kill a debtor who won't pay. He
             had no idea he was being
             manipulated by a serial killer.




                                                     104.





INT. HART'S APARTMENT - NIGHT




Asher enters through the front door.   Hart isn't home.




INT. HART'S BATHROOM - NIGHT




Asher steals floss from the garbage can.   Takes Hart's
toothbrush. Some dirty laundry.

                        GRACE (V.O.)

          Asher wasn't becoming disorganized
          and decomposing into madness, he
          was evolving.







EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Asher, his face obscured with a sweatshirt hood, pulls
Todd Ford from the trunk.

                        GRACE (V.O.)

          The Ford murder was staged and I
          missed it. Asher drove Ford's car
          there with Ford unconscious in the
          car. Ether maybe, GHB. Something
          that disappears. Asher works out,
          heads to the parking lot. Pulls
          Ford out of the trunk. And
          strangles him. He left a couple
          of Hart's hairs on the body.
Asher leans over Todd Ford, strangling the unconscious
man with the garotte.
Asher places a couple of Hart's hairs on the body.




INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

Asher drawing the sketch of who we now know was Hart.     Is
that a sly grin Asher has?

                        GRACE (V.O.)

          He draws a nice portrait of Mr.
          Hart and he's now inside the heart
          of Montreal PD's investigation.




INT. ASHER'S APARTMENT - DAY

In the bathroom, Asher, wearing surgical gloves, places
Hart's comb in the medicine cabinet. Puts Hart's trash
in the wastebasket.

                                            (CONTINUED)





                                                    105.





CONTINUED:





                           GRACE (V.O.)

             Evidence at the Ford crime scene
             led to an apartment with more of
             Hart's DNA. And evidence linking
             Hart to Asher's crimes. Hart
             never set food in that apartment.
             Asher staged everything.




EXT. FESTIVAL STREET - NIGHT

Grace chasing Hart.

                           SENIOR AGENT (V.O.)

             Mr. Hart, not Asher, murdered the
             Montreal Inspector, correct?

                           GRACE (V.O.)

             Yes. Hart thought Costa was
             systematically destroying his
             life. Hart's violent explosion
             was inevitable.

                           SENIOR AGENT (V.O.)

             How could Asher plan on Hart
             snapping like that?

                           GRACE (V.O.)

             He couldn't. My guess is Asher
             intended to kill Hart and make it
             look like suicide. The
             authorities would find the body
             and close the Martin Asher file.







INT. FBI CONFERENCE ROOM - THE NEXT DAY (PRESENT)

Things are wrapping up.

                           SENIOR AGENT

             This ethics panel has no choice
             but to recommend terminating you
             for misconduct. Do you wish to
             make a statement?
Grace shakes her head: no.

                           SENIOR AGENT

             Please speak up for the record.
Grace leans into her mike.

                            GRACE

             No.   I have nothing to say.




                                                    106.





INT. FBI BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE UNIT - DAY




Grace does the walk of shame in front of her former
COLLEAGUES. She carries a cardboard box full of personal
stuff from her office. Two GSA POLICE escort her.







EXT. QUANTICO PARKING LOT - DAY

Grace heaves the box into the back of her Audi.   A GSA
police car stands by.
DICK COLTON, her ex-boss intercepts her before she gets
in.

                       COLTON

          Grace. This is a bitter loss to
          the unit.

                           GRACE

          You'll manage.

                        COLTON

          Want some good news? RCMP closed
          their investigation and the
          Minister isn't indicting you.
          This could have been a real train
          wreck for you, Grace.

                           GRACE

          It wasn't?
Grace gets in her car.

                        COLTON

          No one has any clue where Asher
          is. That son of a bitch might
          fixate on you. Please watch your
          back, Grace.

                        GRACE

          I'll dig a hole and hide in it.

                        COLTON

          Don't fade away, Grace.   You're
          still my friend, okay?
Grace pulls out.   Heads for the road that will take her
out of Quantico.







EXT. RURAL HIGHWAY - DAY

Grace has the top down. The WIND snatching papers from
her box. Grace doesn't care.




                                                         107.





INT. ECONOMY MOTEL - NIGHT




Grace watches TV in the dark.      Drinking a beer.
Her CELL RINGS. Grace looks at it.        Sees OUT OF AREA on
the caller ID. She answers.




                           GRACE

           Hello?

                           ASHER (V.O.)

           I'm sorry.    I'm sorry you lost
           your job.
A beat.   Grace grabs the big .45 by her thigh.

                           ASHER (V.O.)

           Hello?

                           GRACE

           I'm here.

                           ASHER (V.O.)

           I miss you.

                         GRACE

           Why don't you come and see me. I
           miss you, too. I'm at the
           Gainesville Virginia. The Motel 6
           off Highway 29. Stop by.
There is a strange tension in her voice. She hangs up.
Turns off the TV. She gets off the bed, crosses to a
corner. She sits, settles in for a long vigil.




INT. ECONOMY MOTEL - DAY

The rising sun reveals Grace has not moved. She is now
realizing Asher isn't going to show. Grace drops the .45
and begins to cry.







EXT. MEDICAL CLINIC - DAY

Grace exits the clinic reading a test result.      She
freezes in her tracks, returns inside.




INT. WAREHOUSE STORE - DAY

Grace shopping. She has a quarter ton bag of dog food.
Gallons of spaghetti sauce. Stocking up.




                                                     108.





EXT. WAREHOUSE STORE PARKING LOT - NIGHT




Wintertime. It's an ice storm. Freezing rain
accumulates on existing snow and ice. Grace loading her
supplies into her truck. It's miserable out and getting
worse.



HONKING. Grace turns to watch a car slowly sliding
helpless across the ice. It stops just short of hitting
a parked car.




INT. POST OFFICE - NIGHT

Ten minutes later Grace checks her P.O. Box. Finds some
baby catalogs. A local PREGNANT WOMAN enters.

                        PREGNANT WOMAN

          Wow, you know the question?

                           GRACE

          Six months.

WIDER TO REVEAL:

Grace is very pregnant.

                           PREGNANT WOMAN

          That's it?

                           GRACE

          Twins.

                        PREGNANT WOMAN

          Good luck, sweetheart. Get
          yourself home, it's miserable out.
Grace smiles, exits.







EXT. OLD PRIVATE ROAD - NIGHT

Old and falling apart. Overgrown with branches. The
wind picking up. Grace's truck slowly navigating the
ice. The only vehicle around.




INT. GRACE'S TRUCK - MOVING - NIGHT

The accumulating ice is beautiful but deadly. Grace
drives with extreme caution, picking through the ice in
low gear. She drives around a fallen tree branch.

                                            (CONTINUED)





                                                         109.

                           RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)

             The State Police have said to stay
             off the road unless it's an
             absolute emergency. Several of
             their cruisers have already been
             damaged. There is ice everywhere.
             On the way in tonight I saw the
             snowplow slipping and sliding.
             Everybody, stay where you are.
             This is only the beginning.
Grace turns OFF the RADIO.     Turns on the defroster.

SOMETHING MOVING.


WHAM!

Her WINDSHIELD SHATTERS.     Grace REACTS.
A tree branch overburdened with ice has fallen on her
truck.
The truck slides across the ice. Grace fights to regain
control, to keep it out of the ditch.
Grace stops.     Gets out.   Pulls the branch off the hood.




EXT. OLD FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

The last remnant of the once-proud Vanderholt holdings.
Grace pulls open a large garage door.
Assaulted by rain and sleet. She slips on the ice.
Regains her feet, finishes opening the door.
She gets back in her truck and parks it inside the garage.







INT. OLD FARMHOUSE - DAY

Restored. Filled with family heirlooms.      Another family
that has decayed from glory.
Grace enters. Dripping wet. She turns OFF the ALARM.
Then hangs up her heavy jacket. Bone tired.
Grace crosses to the kitchen.




INT. OLD FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Grace takes a Glock from her pocket and sets it on the
counter. She pours water into a kettle.

                                           (CONTINUED)





                                                           110.





CONTINUED:




Puts the kettle on the stove. Turns on the stove.         Grace
notices water on the kitchen floor. Wait. Wet
footprints.



Grace REACTS.     Reaches for the Glock.
A hand lands on top of her hand.      It's MARTIN ASHER.

                             ASHER

             Hi, Grace.
CLICK!   He snaps a handcuff around Grace's wrist.
Asher has the upper hand, he spins her, pulls her down
into a chair. She throws a punch. Asher blocks it.
Asher yanks on her cuffed arm.       SMACK!   Grace slaps him.
Asher pulls her into a chair. CLICK! Grace is now
cuffed to the chair. She struggles futilely against the
cuffs.
Asher catches his breath.

                             ASHER

             Knock it off.    You're not going
             anywhere.
Grace stop struggling.       Asher looking at her huge belly.

                           ASHER

             I'm not going to hurt you.

                           GRACE

             You're so full of shit your eyes
             turned brown.
Asher is happy to see her.

                           ASHER

             They're contacts. You're glowing.
Grace looking at him. Still astonished to see him.         Her
arms behind her back, her belly is so vulnerable.

                           GRACE

             How the fuck did you find me?

                           ASHER

             You told me everything I had to
             know.

             Get it over with. Just get it
             over with.




                           ASHER

             Ever since I met you, you're all I
             can think about. I had a way of
             life. And I can't go back to
             because of you. I want you in my
             life, Grace. Please listen to me,
             Grace. I have a proposal.
Asher takes out a couple passports, a pair of driver's
licenses.

                           ASHER

             You become her. I become him.    We
             are married, see?
Asher slides a woman's wedding ring across the table.
Already inscribed.

                           ASHER

             We have the babies. We raise
             them. However you want. I just
             want to be with you.
Grace looking at Asher, not sure whether to laugh out
loud or start crying. He seems edgy; he needs her
decision quick.

                           GRACE

             What happens if I don't want to
             assume this woman's identity and
             raise my babies with a serial
             killer?

                           ASHER

             Grace, don't be morbid. If anyone
             can deal with this, you can. I
             know you felt what I felt. It's
             real.

                           GRACE

             Answer my question.

                           ASHER

             I'll shoot you in the head and
             burn this place down.
Grace reacts. She can respect that. Grace looking at
Asher. He's scary, feeding off some fantasy about her.

                           GRACE

             You'll do what you have to do. I
             can respect that. How do you know
             it's still real? Maybe it's gone.
             What we felt.
Grace tilts her lips, looking in his eyes. Asher leans
over to kiss her. Slow, delicate. Asher kneels beside
her, the kisses become hungry, desperate.
Grace's eyes are so open, so vulnerable.

                           GRACE

             God, I missed you so much.
Asher leans in to kiss her...
Grace head-butts him.    CRUNCH!   Smashes his nose.
She drives her feet down and her shoulder into his chest.
Asher, already on his knees, falls back.
Grace scrambles over him, gets out of the chair.       She
shoulders over the kitchen table...
There is a holster mounted underneath the table.
Grace turns her back so she can grab the gun from it.
Grace REACTS.     There is no gun in the holster.
Asher looking at her, matter of fact:

                           ASHER

             I searched everything.
Asher stands, reaches for the Glock on the counter.
Grace can't let him get it. She lunges at Asher,
collides into his knees, hurting him.

                          ASHER

             Damn you!
Asher grabs a large knife from the butcher's block.
THWACK!   Plunges it into Grace's belly.
Grace GASPS, looking at the knife embedded in her stomach.
A beat as Grace and Asher stare at the knife.
Grace uses the pause to kick away from Asher.       She gets
on her feet and runs from the kitchen.




                                                     113.





EXT. OLD FARMHOUSE - NIGHT




Grace exits the kitchen door, running with her hands
cuffed behind her. Running for her life.
She runs for the nearby woods. Her shoes CRUNCHING
through a layer of fresh ice over old snow. Fighting for
balance.
POP-POP-POP! Asher OPENS FIRE on her from the house.
BULLETS HIT the ice around her.
Grace runs into the woods.   Branches sheathed in ice.
Smacking her face.
Asher exits the house, FIRING -- POP-POP-POP-POP!
BULLETS EXPLODE the ice around Grace. She dives to the
ground. She takes the opportunity to move her handcuffs
from behind to in front.
She unties and removes the heavy prosthetic belly she
wears. Grace is not pregnant. She pulls the knife out.
Grace runs deeper into the woods.
Asher running in the woods behind her. The gun in his
hand at the ready. Asher is hunting. He intends to kill
her.

                         ASHER

           Keep fucking running, Grace,
           you're only going to die tired!




ON GRACE

Running. Batting away ice-covered branches.     Drenched
with sleet. Hypothermic conditions.







EXT. OLD PRIVATE ROAD - NIGHT

Grace emerges from the woods. Running along the icy
road. She slips and falls. Cuts her hand on the ice.
Grace stands, and keeps running, her hand bleeding, the
knife getting slippery.




ON ASHER

Gaining on her. Grace slips again, scrabbling on the
ice, trying to keep moving. A slow motion nightmare.
Here comes Asher.   No mercy.   He aims the gun at her
face...

                                             (CONTINUED)





                                                           114.





CONTINUED:




Grace raises her hands to protect her face...
POP! Asher FIRES. DING! The BULLET intended for
Grace's forehead hits the knife -- RICOCHETS into the
trees.
A beat.   Grace looking at the now-creased knife.
Asher's gun is out of rounds.     The slide is locked back
on an empty chamber.
SWICK! Grace slices Asher's legs with the knife.          Slices
each shin deeply.

                          ASHER

             Shit!
Asher kicks the knife from her hand. Then kicks her in
the face. He tries to kick her again but she grabs his
leg.
WHAM! Asher slips, hits the ice hard. Grace is on top
of him, wraps the handcuffs around his neck. Wraps her
legs around his body.
Grace chokes Asher for all he's worth. His eyes bulge,
his face reddens as he meets the same fate as his
victims. Asher has a seizure as his oxygen depleted
brain dies.
Grace doesn't let go. A long death embrace. Finally,
when she is sure, Grace releases from Martin Asher's
body.
She checks his pulse.    He's dead.    Grace stands.
The rain falling on her. Ice and moonlight. Grace spits
blood, looks around. Looks at Asher's corpse.

                           GRACE

             Better you than me, asshole.
Walks back toward the house.      Alone.   Strong.   Whole.




                                              FADE OUT.

          FADE IN: (BEFORE TITLES)

          EXT. NEW YORK CITY - BLOOMINGDALE'S - DAY

          The busy block between 59th and 60th-Streets in the
          middle of a weekday afternoon. Buses, taxis, trucks;
          shoppers, messengers, teenagers. In one corner of the
          screen the time is SUPERIMPOSED:

                         "1:52"
          Now a man (GREEN) is ZOOMED IN on -- little of his actual
          face is visible because of his thick white hair, large
          bushy white mustache, dark glasses and slouch hat. The
          rest of him is encased in a knee-length raincoat. He
          wears gloves and is carrying a large, brown-paper-covered
          package by a wooden handle attached to the twine securing
           it. The box has been addressed in black felt marker --
          "Everest Printing Corp., 826. Lafayette St." -- and appears
          quite heavy. But Green has the gait of a man. younger than
          he appears. As he turns and heads down a flight of stairs,
          CAMERA ZOOMS IN even more to the single word on a sign:

          "SUBWAY."

          INT. SUBWAY - 59TH ST. CHANGE BOOTH - DAY

          A level above the locals, two above the express trains.
          Green appears and joins the line waiting to buy tokens.
          Wordlessly he shoves two coins under the grille, receives
          his token, moves on, drops it into the slot, pushes
          through the turnstile and heads for one of the descending
          stairways. CAMERA HOLDS on a sign identifying his choice:

          "IRT. LEX. AVE. LOCAL. DOWNTOWN.."

          INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - 59TH ST. DOWNTOWN LOCAL - DAY

          Green comes off the stairs and arrives on a line with a
          placard that hangs over the edge of the platform bearing
          the number "10", black on a white ground, indicating the
          point where the front of a ten-car train stops. Now the
          sound of a distant rumbling, growing louder, makes Green
          turn,.cross to the platform's edge, lean out over the
          track and peer into the darkness of the tunnel beyond the
          far end of the platform.

          SUBWAY TUNNEL - GREEN'S POV
          as the four lights -- amber and white markers over white
          sealed-beam headlights -- come into view and the train
          roars and clatters into the station. CAMERA PANS with
          the head car as it stops, its breaks sighing, and a pair
          of doors in EXTREME FOREGROUND, rattles open. CAMERA now
          MOVES forward, into the car, then TURNS and through the
          still-open door, focuses on the T.A. Cop, still standing
          on the platform, regarding Green (CAMERA).

          MED. SHOT - FIFTH CAR
           From the platform, featuring the conductor (BUD CARMODY)
          as he leans out of his window surveying the station. He
          has a young, boyish face surrounded by long, curly red
          hair.

          INT. FIFTH CAR

          The door to the conductor's cab is open as Bud continues to
          lean out the window. Directly, behind him is MATSON, an
          older Conductor of retirement age who is busy instructing
          the younger man.

                         MATSON
          C'mon, kid -- out loud so's I can
          hear what you're doin'.

                         BUD
          I'm checking the passengers getting
          on and off -- front and back --
          okay, it's all clear -- I'm shut-
          ting the doors; -.rear section

                         FIRST --
          (pushes a button)
          -- then the front section --

                         (PUSHES ANOTHER)
          -- and -- the doors are closed.
          He pulls his head in and checks a row of lights on a panel.

                         BUD
          Now I 'm checking the indicator box
          to make sure that the doors are
          all locked -- okay.
          The train starts with a jerk.

                         BUD
          Igo back out the window --

                         (HE DOES)
          -- for a distance of three car-
          lengths to see that nobody's
          being dragged --

                         (RETURNING)
          -- I remove my door key -- and
          then the skate key -- and then
          I hit the transmitter button.
          (into a mike)
          Fifty-first Street' next stop --
          the next stop is Fifty-first Street.
          (turning to Matson)
          How'd I do?

                         MATSON
          How come you wanna be a conductor,
          anyway? Don't you know the con-
          ductor's sittin' in the goddam
          hotseat?

                         BUD
          What do you mean, Mr. Matson?

                         MATSON
          You're visible, for God's sake!
          Anything goes wrong -- anyone's
          got a gripe -- you're the one they
          see. Hell, in my twen'y-nine years
          o' stickin' my head out there I
          been slugged, spit on, hit by
          purses, fruit, rolled-up newspapers,
          baseball mitts -- an'.I been god-
          dam lucky! I never been puked on
          by a drunk like Charlie Boltzen was
          on the Parkchester line -- or
          stabbed in the neck like I heard
          one fella was on the Astoria BMT --

                         BUD

                         (QUIETLY)
          Jesus.

                         MATSON
          You take my advice, kid -- serve
          your six months an' then put in
          for Motorman. Watch it, we're
          cumin' in.
          Bud looks quickly off, sees the approaching station and
          hits his transmitter button.

                         BUD

                         BUD

                         (CORRECTING)
          Fifty-first Street, sorry
          the station is Fifty-first Street.

                         MATSON
          Never say you're sorry, kid --
          somebody'll come back here an'
          bust your goddam nose.

                          CONTINUED - 2
           Bud sticks his head out the window, remembers what Matson
           told him and pulls it partially back in.

           51ST ST. STATION - BUD'S POV
           SHOOTING THROUGH the conductor's window as the train
           enters the station. We flash by the "rear-enders" (those
          I waiting for the last car) and gradually slow until we
          stop -- and we are looking right into the face of a man
          (GREY) whose frame and features, while entirely different
          from Green's, are covered by the same identical externals
          -- thick white hair, bushy white mustache, dark glasses,
          slouch hat, gloves and raincoat. He looks at the conduc-
          tor (CAMERA) for an instant, then darts away.

          PLATFORM - GREY
          RIDERS entering and exiting the train as Grey heads down-
          track. He carries a large tan valise trimmed in dark
          brown.

          INT. FOURTH CAR

          Grey just makes it to the car as the doors close, holding
          them back until he's squeezed through. The train starts
          with a lurch as he heads for the rear of the car and takes
          up a position, leaning his back against the storm door and
          placing his valise on the floor, between his feet. He
          surveys the car with cold, heavy-lidded eyes.

          INT. FIRST CAR

          Green has a seat opposite the shut steel door of the
          motorman's cab. His package is on the floor, between
          his knees, his arms resting on its top. TWO BOYS, ten
          and twelve, brothers, are at the window of the front storm
          door, their eyes glued to the track and tunnel before
          them, playing.: at driving the train.

          INT. FIFTH CAR - CONDUCTOR'S CAB

          Bud is removing his key and activating his mike.

                         MATSON
          Yeah -- if I was you I'd start
          studyin' for that motorman's exam
          right now.

          To tell you the.;truth, Mr. Matson,
          I have been. Want to hear some-
          thing?

                         (RECITING)
          Every car on the IRT is seventy-two
           feet long, cost $250,000 and weighs
          75,000 pounds. It holds 44 seats
          with room for 136 standing.

                         MATSON
          'Cept at rush hour when you can
          push in another 20, at least.
          Honest to God, I. know personally
          of a case where this guy on a number
          5 train dies of a heart attack at
          Union Square and he has t' wait
          until the Grand Concourse in the
          Bronx before enough people get off
          so's he can fall down.

                         (A PAUSE)

                         BUD
          Mr. D'Agostino who rode with me
          last week said that happened on a
          double -A train on the West Side.

                         MATSON
          Yeah? Who y' gonna believe? A
          wop or an American?

                         (LOOKING OUT)
          Here's where I'm gettin' off --

          Stick with it, kid -- you're doin'
          great. See ya t'morrow.
          He crosses to the nearest door as the train decelerates.
          Bud activates. his mike and announces, waving to Matson
          as he does.

                         BUD
          Grand Central Station -- change
          for the express. This is Grand
          Central.

                         IN
          The train stops, the doors open and Matson steps out,
          colliding with a very large man (BROW^?PN) who is in a hurry
          to get aboard. His face is adorned with a large, white,
          bushy mustache, dark glasses, a lot of white hair, a slouch
          hat and, covering the rest of him, a raincoat. He carries
          an outsized florist's box, big enough for several dozen-
          long-stemmed roses, under his. arm, and wears gloves.

                         MATSON
          What's your hurry, chief? We
          won't leave without you.
          Brown says nothing to Matson, does not look at him, does
          not even seem aware of their cohtact. Matson goes off
          into the crowd on the platform and Brown heads for the
          front of the car.

          INT. FIRST CAR - GREEN

          Still sitting, still facing the motorman's cab. The two
          boys continue to play at the front window. The doors can
          be heard slamming shut and the train jerks into motion.

          a sigh of relief, ' then notices that his left leg is vibrat-

          Leaning back against the storm door. Now he picks up his
          valise, turns and.looks through the door, across the
          platform between the cars, into the fifth car, and catches
          sight of Brown who nods, almost imperceptively.
          Grey makes no sign of recognition at all. He turns and
          starts forward through the car, heading for the third car.
          At the far end a MAN is standing in front of the door,
          leaning down to talk to a seated GIRL. Grey stops and
          waits a moment. Finally:

          The man looks around and surveys Grey.

          sound is heard, building, until a train roars through on
          the northbound express track, its lights flashing between
          the pillars. In a moment it is gone and the sound dies.

          He hangs back until everyone has gotten on or off the
          train, then, without haste, carrying the valpac in one
          hand and the trombone in the other, he approaches the
          front of the first car. The Motorman (DENNY DOYLE), a
          middle-aged man with a ruddy face and wearing pin-striped
          overalls, is leaning far gut of his window, looking back
          along the platform. Blue puts down his bags, puts his
          right hand into his raincoat pocket and leans against the
          train with his left shoulder, blocking Doyle's view of
          the rest of the train.

          He stops, suddenly aware that Blue has removed a very
          large army automatic from his raincoat pocket and has
          placed the muzzle against his (Doyle's) head. Doyle
          jerks his head back, suddenly, banging it hard against

          and now places the gun against the Motorman's cheek,
          directly under his right eye.

          reverse key out of his pocket -- it is five inches long,
          with a shiny surface, and a wrench-type handle that fits
          into a receptacle on the flat portion of the controller --
          and finally inserts the cutting key -- similar to the reverse
          key but with a slightly smaller head, and turns it.

          INT. TOWER ROOM

          A long, unadorned room with a row of desks with phones, and
          a door marked "TOILET". Several TOWERMEN (and MRS. JENKINS,
          a black Towerwoman) sit at the desks before the flashing
          phone consoles, talking to dispatchers, trainmasters and
          other Towers. The predominant feature of the room, however,
          i is the electronic Model Board, stretched high across one
          wall, recording in colored slashes of light the movements
          of every train that passes through the sector, all of it
          superimposed on a painted map showing the line's track
          routes and stations. One of the Towermen, MARINO, rushes
          over to Caz as he and the Plumber enter.

                         MARINO
          Jesus Christ, Cazâ¢, you picked a
          helluva day to be late --

                         CAZ
          You wanted a plumber down here,
          didn't you? Whose goddam wedding

          Who else? Mrs. Jenkins.

          MRS. JENKINS
          I'm sorry, Mr. Dolowicz -- it just
          slipped off.

                         CAZ
          What were you doin'r with your hand
          in the john, anyway?

          MRS. JENKINS
          (indignant).
          My hand-wasn't in the john, Mr.
          Dolowicz -- it was over the john.

                         CAZ
          What's the difference?
          (to the Plumber)
          Go fish it out, will ya?
          As the Plumber heads off, Caz turns to Marino.

          He's laying down between 28th and

          Center's been trying to raise him
          but so far he don't answer the
          radio. Jesus, Caz -- why don't
          he answer the radio?

                         CAZ
          Take it easy, Marino -- there's
          lots o' reasons. Maybe he jumped
          a ball and hadda leave the cab to
          reset a tripper -- or a door got
          hung and he hadda go fix it. Any-
          thing more serious and he'd'a
          called in for a car knocker.

          It's been too long, Caz --

                         CAZ
          Then maybe his radio's busted and

          at the metal door and Blue opens it. Green squeezes in.

          As the. six or seven passengers in the rear section rise
          and move forward, the cab door opens and Doyle comes out,
          i followed by Green who is covering him with his gun.

                         BLUE
          Get going, Mr. Green.
          Green nods and goes to the front, uses a key to slide open
          the storm door, steps out and closes it again, then jumps
          down onto the tracks.

          Yes. What's happening is that

          dangerous men with machine guns.

          The fluorescent lights suddenly go out and the emergency,
          incandescent bulbs immediately go on, thereby diminishing
          the brightness in the car by half. There's a general
          stirring among the Passengers as they look around them,
          their alarm peaking again.

          going to happen if you do as
          you're told. Get going, Motorman.
          As Doyle leaves at one end of the train, Green reappears
          at the other.

          SECRETARY emerges, followed by FOUR JAPANESE in business
          suits.

                         SECRETARY
          Ah, Lieut. Prescott -- it was nice
          of you to leave your duties long

                         PRESCOTT
          I sure will.
          She smiles at the Japanese and walks back to the elevators,
          pressing the UP button. Prescott looks at the four men
          for a moment, uncertainly, then goes after the Secretary
          and speaks to her in low tones.

          assumption that they do.

          The door closes. Prescott shrugs, then turns and smiles
          at the visitors. They smile back. He takes a deep
          breath, then begins.

          The New York City Subway System
          is the largest'in the world, with
          237 miles of track and seven
          thousand cars that carry over a
          billion and a third passengers
          every year, making it also the
          busiest railroad in,the world.
          I can see that this last fact
          surprises you.
          The Japanese look anything but surprised. Prescott goes
          on, resolutely.

          Yes. Well- Grand Central is
          the busiest station passenger-wise
          -- train-wise, it's West 4th St.
          on the I.N.D. line. Now, if you'll
          step this way, gentlemen -
          They step no way at all. Prescott gestures broadly.

                         PRES COTT
          This way --
          He hurries ahead of them to open the door and hold it for
          them as they finally follow.

                         PRES COTT
          We are entering the headquarters

          yellow -- are continually changing and flickering.

                         PRESCOTT'S VOICE
          The Status Board pinpoints the
          disposition of every Transit
          Authority policeman presently in
          the field. Things are usually
          jumping pretty good in here.
          CAMERA begins to ZOOM BACK, revealing the scene: a large
          room, cut. up by glass dividers into a maze of squares and
          rectangles manned by uniformed T.A. POLICEMEN, sitting at
          desks with telephone consoles. The place is absolutely
          dead -- some reading, some eating, some sleeping.

                         PRESCOTT'S VOICE
          We have one of our own T.A. cops

          in the entire system between the
          hours of eight P.M. and four A.M.
          Since we instituted this watch,

          I'm sure you have your own share
          of crime on the Tokyo subway, right?
          They merely stare at Prescott and smile.

                         PRESCOTT
          Right.
          He.clears his throat, loosens his tie and looks around for
          help.

          Prescott has stopped beside a desk. GARBER, 40, stocky,
          dour, with a dark stubble that requires shaving twice a
          day, is absorbed reading the Village Voice.

          I do say. I -- uh -- told them
          things are usually jumping. like
          crazy in here.

          lately, Sol --

                         GARBER
          Yeah, well -- we had a bomb scare
          in the Bronx yesterday -- but it
          turned out to be a cantaloupe.
          He and Prescott look at the Japanese. Nothing.

          up its rear-end with the narrow opening of a loading
          bay, in preparation for backing into it. Now the truck
          starts backing, and while there is still some space open
          (on the sidewalk) it is closing fast. The cycles screech
          to a stop but it is clear that the truck doesn't intend to
          as it bumps up onto the sidewalk, and starts for the
          opening. But it is now too narrow. The screeching brakes
          of the truck are heard as it starts to skid around, the

          Hello, Prescott -- the truck's
          been wrecked -- somewhere on
          Lafayette Street. Their radio's
          gone dead --

                         PRESCOTT
          what the hell are you talking
          about?! It can't be wrecked --
          we're out of time, goddammit!

          They're just about to shoot some

          sharply and sits back in his chair, exhausted. The SUPER-

          You still there, Prescott?

                         PRESCOTT
          Yeah. I'm still here. Tell me
          something -- if we were a couple
          of seconds late -- you'd have
          knocked off an innocent person?
          Affirmative. Now if you're ready,
          I'll give you instructions for
          the delivery of the money. Again,
          I'll have to insist you follow
          them to the letter.

                         PRESCOTT
          Go ahead.
          Two unarmed policemen will walk
          down the track -- one with the
          money, the other with a light which
          he'll flash continuously from side
          to side in a sweeping motion.
          When they reach the car the rear
          door will open and the one with
          the money will throw it in onto
          the floor. Then they will both
          turn and walk back to the 28th
          Street Station. Acknowledge.

                         PRESCOTT
          I've got it. Is that all?
          For now. But keep it in mind
          that the same ground rules apply
          -- any wrong move by anyone and
          we'll kill a hostage.

                         PRESCOTT
          I could've. guessed that part.
          You have ten minutes to deliver the
          money. If it isn't here by then --

                         PRESCOTT
          Yeah, I know -- -it's getting mono-
          tonous. I don't suppose you'll give
          us longer than ten minutes --
          Ten's more than enough, Prescott

          When we have the money in hand
          I'll call you with the final set

          One driver alights and goes to help the other remove the
          canvas sack of money off the back of the second bike. They
          carry it together to the Borough Commander.

          They take the sack from. the cyclists, hike it up onto
          O'Keefe's shoulder and hurry off, running down the steps
          into the subway.

          The Mayor, wrapped in a blanket, is smiling and nodding
          as he passes through the crowd, led by a wedge of COPS,
          flanked on one side by the Commissioner, and on the other
          by Warren LaSalle. The BoroughrCommander waits for him,
          shaking his head in disgust.

          The Commander looks at the Commissioner who stares right

          I appreciate your wanting to
          help, sir, but you've come at

          A FIGURE in the shadows, standing behind a pillar, seen
          only in silhouette as CAMERA PASSES him -- his helmet, his
          high-powered rifle, etc. -- looking very menacing.

          MED. SHOT - MISKOWSKY & O'KEEFE (TRAVELLING)

                          MIS KOWSKY
          You realize we got four submachine
          guns ahead of us and all those

          The lone car, lit from within -- and the silhouette of Brown
          at the rear storm door.

          MED. CLOSE SHOT - JAMES
          Standing behind his pillar. Now he turns his peaked cap
          around and, turning his face to the pillar, slowly moves
          his head to one side.

          SHOOTING from behind the pillar. As the CAMERA slowly
          CRABS, the subway car comes into view -- and we see Brown
          standing at the rear door, much more clearly than before..

          MED. CLOSE SHOT - JAMES
          as he. peeks around the pillar. Now, slowly, he brings his
          right hand up and, pointing his index finger.like a gun,
          "fires."

          Shiiiiiit.

          From the other side of the pillar as James ducks back behind
          it, turns his back to it and looks around for another way
          of amusing himself. He notices his real gun in a holster
          at his belt and unbuttons the strap, freeing it. Then he
          assumes the stance of a gunfighter, hand poised over it,
          knees slightly bent. Then, moving suddenly, he slaps his
          holster, wheels, fires without aiming -- and there's a
          reverberating BANG, the shattering of glass and the figure
          in the subway car reels back. James looks at his hand in
          amazement -- there's no gun in it. Then, at the same-time,
          Brown has recovered his balance and begins firing his
          submachine gun, the bullets ricocheting off the metal
          pillars.

          MED. SHOT - MISKOWSKY & O'KEEFE
          as they drop onto the roadbed, bullets whining all around

          press flat behind it.

          Blue is hurrying from the Conductor's cab to the rear of the
          car, passing between the two rows of stunned passengers
          who watch in silence. The storm door window has been smashed

          and there is glass all over the floor nearby. Brown is
          just in the process of sitting heavily in the single
          isolated seat near the door, a dark red patch blossoming
          on his sleeve, just below the right shoulder, his sub-
          machine gun resting in his lap. He begins examining his
          wound with his left hand. Grey s--ands at the rear door,
          pressed flat against the wall, peering out.

          went right through.

                         I
          Blue spots something, bends and picks up a lump of metal
          which he tosses to Brown who watches it in his bloodied left
          hand, glances at it, then throws it away.

                         BLUE
          How does it feel?

          BROWN.
          Okay -- I never feel pain too much.

                         BLUE
          How many shots were there?

                         BROWN
          Just one -- the rest was me. I
          didn't see anything -- I guess I
          just got mad -- no sense to it --

                          BLUE

                         (THINKING)
          Somebody got nervc..us -- or bored
          -- they've been out there a long

          Daniels, I've got Lieutenant Garber
          of the Transit Police on the line
          with us. I have the latest instructions
          from the hijackeraâ¢. They want power
          restored, the tracks cleared, all
          signals green as far as South Ferry,
          and no cops anywhere. Okay, so we
          go along -- we have to -- but then
          what? What do you think they've
          got in mind?

          Power restored and the track cleared
          -- so they're gonna move their
          car, obviously. But why South

          If I remember right it comes

          loops around and heads back uptown.

          All they'll do is bottle themselves
          up. That's no good.

          what if they're not on the train?
          What if they set the throttle and
          jumped off? While we're chasing
          the train they're sneaking out an
          emergency exit somewhere behind us.

          A.little gizmo called the-dead
          man's feature. It was built into
          the controller handle in case a
          motorman should ever drop dead.
          It has to have a man's hand
          pressing down on it at all times
          in order to work. Otherwise the

          I want this train moving in
          thirty seconds. Tell Mr. Brown
          and Mr. Grey they.rcan cut the
          emergency brake cords.
          Green leaves the cab. Blue examines the gimmick one
          last time, then follows Green out.

          CLOSE SHOT - EMERGENCY BRAKE CORD
          as the rope with the red wooden handle, which dangles
          some six inches from a hole in the ceiling of the car,
          is cut by a pair of clippers inserted into the hole.
          CAMERA PULLS BACK to include Brown, standing on a seat
          behind the Motorman's cab.

                         WIDER ANGLE
          Including Grey who is cutting the brake cord at the other
          end of the car. Now, submachine gun in hand, Brown opens
          the front storm door, crouches and drops out of sight.
          Then Grey starts for the rear door, hesitates, returns
          to the Hooker and bends to whisper something in her ear.

                         HOOKER
          You and what army?
          Snickering, he returns to the rear door, opens it and
          disappears. At the front of.the car, Green backs out of
          the door, closing it after him, and is helped down to the
          roadbed by Brown from below. Only Blue is left. He holds
          his submachine gun easily cradled in one arm as he moves
          through the car.

                         BLUE
          You will remain in your seats.

          He has reached the rear, walking backwards, and now gropes
          behind him for the door handle.

                         OLD MAN
          Aren't you going to tell us
          what a great bunch of hostages
          we've been?
          Blue doesn't answer as he opens the door and backs out onto
          the metal landing. Then he closes the door and drops down
          to the track. The Passengers, left alone, look at one
          another uncertainly.

          INT. TUNNEL

          The four hijackers are deployed along the side of the car
          -- Green in front with Brown, Blue in back with Grey.

                         BLUE
          All right, Mr. Green --
          Green, a hand on the protruding pipe connected to the
          controller handle inside the Motorman's cab, now grabs it
          with both hands and pushes inward, toward the train.

          The train starts to move. As it does, Green tugs sharply
          back on the pipe and the two longer sections, angled
          together, disengage and come loose in his hand. He starts
          to lose his balance but Brawn grabs him and pulls him back
          to the tunnel wall. The train it picking up speed rapidly
          as it slides by them.

          as it accelerates. The Passengers continue looking around,
          not sure what's happening. Suddenly, without warning, the
          Hippie jumps to his feet and, running in a crouch toward
          the rear of the car, draws a revolver.

          conscious, fairly bloody.

          All of them pick up their submachine guns but only three
          remove the magazines and then place the guns back dcwn again.
          Grey merely watches the other three,. continuing to hold his
          gun under his arm, a slight smile on his face.

                         BLUE
          Did you hear me, Mr. Grey? Disarm
          your gun and put it down so we can
          I get out of here.

                         GREY
          I'm not leaving it -- it goes out
          with me.

          What if something's gone wrong?
          What if they're waiting for us up
          there? I want more'n just a dinky
          pea-shooter!

                         BLUE
          Nothing's gone wrong. The plan
          depends on our walking away un-
          noticed. You can't do that carry-
          ing a submachine gun.

                         GREY
          I won't just carry it -- I'll hold
          it under my coat --

          Without any warning, Blue, whose Wright hand has been in
          his pocket, fires his pistol through his coat, catching
          f Grey full in the chest. He staggers back, bumps against
          the tunnel wall and collapses, landing on his side. Blue
          bends, pries the submachine gun 'Loose from Grey's death
          grip, removes the magazine, pockets it, and tosses the gun
          away. Green has watched all this in near panic.

          Oh my God --
          Brown watches with a detachment bordering on disinterest.

          Some of the Passengers have gone to the front of the car.
          The W.A.S.P. is trying to open the door to the Motorman's
          cab, but there's no outside handle so all he can do is pound
          impotently against it. The Mother remains in her seat
          holding her two boys pressed against her. Now the Old Man
          starts pushing his way up front.

          right now we're on a run-away train,
          but it's only temporary --
          The car careens into a curve and sways wildly as the metal
          wheels scrape and screech. There's a good deal of scream-
          ing and shouting from the Passengers as several fall down.
          The Old Man starts to topple but the Pimp steadies him.

          THE TUNNEL (UNDERCRANKED)
          SHOOTING straight ahead from the-front of the train.
          Nothing but green lights ahead as the train races along.

          INT. TUNNEL - HIPPIE

          Propped up now against a pillar, straining to look at
          something, off.

          HIJACKERS - HIPPIE'S POV
          Blue and Brown are tying the second money vest on Green,
          then help him on with his shirt 4nd coat.

          MED. SHOT - HIPPIE
          He returns his attention to the business of locating his
          gun. He scrapes the heel of an extended leg (to his extreme
          discomfort) along the ground hoping to discover it -- and
          does. Seeing it, he now goes through the painful exercise
          of reaching for it -- finally managing this, too. Now,
          lifting one knee as a gun mount, he holds the revolver in
          both hands and starts to take aim.

          HIJACKERS - HIPPIE'S POV
          with the gun in the foreground, its sight being shifted as
          the three men are preparing to leave through the emergency
          exit. Now the Hippie's vision (FOCUS) blurs for a moment,
          and when it clears, Green has already disappeared through
          the door and Brown is right behind him. The gunsight centers
          on Brown's broad back -- and the gun fires. Brown convulses
          and topples backwards.

          INT. TUNNEL

          Blue stands behind a pillar, his gun in hand, peering into
          the darkness, trying to locate the marksman. Green is in
          the well of the emergency exit, beside the metal ladder
          that leads up through a grate and out onto the street.
          Between them, before the open doorway to the well, Brown's
          body lies face up on the ground. Green now gestures for
          Blue to come across the open area separating then.

          Green hesitates, looks up the ladder, looks back at Blue.

          I -- I'll wait for you -- 1
          Blue looks at him fora moment, then checks his pistol and,
          slowly, steps out from behind the pillar. A shot rings out
          immediately and the ricochet off the pillar zings loudly.
          Blue calmly fires twice at the muzzle flash.

          MED. SHOT - HIPPIE
          Both shots have connected, one hitting his arm and sending
          the pistol flying away, the other into his upper chest,
          below the right shoulder. He topples over, sprawling
          across one rail, onto the roadbed.

          ICED, SHOT - BLUE
          He has stepped back behind his pillar again to listen.
          Silence.

          downtrack to the next where he again waits and listens,

          MED. SHOT - HIPPIE
          Inadvertently, he groans.

          MED. SHOT - BLUE
          He has heard. Now he steps out from behind the pillar and

          Then coming into FOCUS -- a group of men (the Mayor, the
          Commissioner, Warren LaSalle and a DOCTOR) are standing
          looking down at the Hippie (CAMERA) lying in bed.

                         DOCTOR

          Shake his hand, Nate --
          The Mayor reaches out to shake hands, but the Hippie is too
          weak to lift his -- so the Mayor picks it up from atop the
          covers and pumps it. A flashbulb pops from the Photo-
          grapher's camera. Then the Mayor sneezes again.

                         COMMISSIONER

          Most of the stores closed, their iron grills drawn, as Pres-

     1958

     PROLOGUE:  INT. RIPLEY'S CABIN. EVENING.

     Fade up on Ripley, as in the final scene of the film,
     sitting, desolate in a ship's cabin. The camera rotates
     around his face, which begins in light and ends in darkness.

                         RIPLEY (O/S)
               If I could just go back.  If I could rub
               everything out.  Starting with myself.
               Starting with borrowing a jacket.

     EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST TERRACE. EARLY EVENING.

     Ripley is at the piano, accompanying FRAN, a young soprano.
     CREDITS begin.

                         FRAN (SINGS)
               Ah, such fleeting paradise
               such innocent delight
               to love,
               be loved,
               a lullabye,
               then silence.

     The song finishes.  Applause.  They're the entertainment at a
     cocktail party to celebrate a silver wedding anniversary.
     Some partygoers congratulate Fran on her performance. A
     distinguished looking man, pushing his wife in a wheelchair,
     approaches Ripley, offers his hand.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Most enjoyable. Herbert Greenleaf.

                         RIPLEY
               Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
                   (pointing at Ripley's borrowed
                    jacket)
               I see you were at Princeton.
               Then you'll most likely know our son,
               Dick. Dickie Greenleaf...

                         EMILY GREENLEAF
               We couldn't help noticing your jacket.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Yes.

                         EMILY GREENLEAF
               Class of '56?

                         RIPLEY
                   (hesitating)
               How is Dickie?

     INT. ELEVATOR OPENING OUT INTO LOBBY. EARLY EVENING.

     Fran, Ripley, Mr and Mrs Greenleaf and others emerge from an
     elevator. Emily talks to Fran, Herbert to Ripley.

                         EMILY GREENLEAF
                   (to Fran)
               I hope you'll come and see us...

                         FRAN
               That's very kind.

                         EMILY GREENLEAF
               Both of you...

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Of course, Dickie's idea of music is
               Jazz. He has a saxophone.  To my ear Jazz
               is just noise, just an insolent noise.

     EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST. EARLY EVENING.

     Ripley shakes hands with Herbert Greenleaf as he gets into
     his Rolls Royce. They are making an appointment. Ripley
     crosses the street to Fran, pecks her cheek. She hands him
     his share of their fee.

                         RIPLEY
               Gotta run. I'm so late.
                   (he hands Fran's boyfriend the
                    jacket he's been wearing)
               Thanks for the jacket.

                         BOYFRIEND
               Sure.  Thanks for filling in for me.

     From Greenleaf's point of view he sees a couple embracing.

                         EMILY GREENLEAF
               Darling couple, aren't they?

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Yes.  An exceptional young man.

     From another vantage point Ripley hurries on as Fran gets
     into her boyfriend's car. A piano quartet starts up.

     EXT. THEATER. EVENING.

     Ripley runs past the droves of arriving concert-goers and
     heads for the theater. Music continues.

     INT. MEN'S ROOM, THEATER. NIGHT.

     The interval: A thick mass of men in tuxedoes grooming
     themselves at the basins. Ripley turns on faucets, offers
     towels, brushes off dandruff. Men talk over, round, and
     through him.  Put coins in a bowl.

     INT. A BOX AT THE THEATER. NIGHT

     The concert continues. Ripley peers through the curtain at
     the performances.  A haughty woman in the box turns round and
     he closes the curtain.

     INT. BACKSTAGE. 1:30 A.M.

     An empty auditorium. Ripley plays Bach in the blue
     ghostlight.  A caretaker emerges from his rounds, flips on
     the house lights.  Ripley jerks up from his playing, waves
     apologetically.

                         RIPLEY
               Sorry, sorry.  I know.  Sorry.

     EXT. GREENLEAF SHIPYARDS, BROOKLYN. DAY.

     Greenleaf and Ripley walk through one of the drydocks.  A
     huge void in the shape of a boat, swarming with workers
     preparing the shell of a new liner.  If Central Park is where
     the money is spent, this is clearly where it's made.  And a
     lot of it. Workers nod deferentially to the man with his name
     over the buildings behind them.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Mongibello. Tiny place. South of Naples.
               Marge, his uh, the young lade is
               supposedly writing some kind of book. God
               knows what he does. By all accounts they
               spend the whole time on the beach. Or his
               sailboat. That's my son's talent,
               spending his allowance.

     Ripley, in his green corduroy jacket the very model of a
     sober young man, listens attentively.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF (cont'd)
               Could you ever conceive of going to
               Italy, Tom, persuade my son to come home?
                   (Ripley looks doubtful)
               I'd pay you.  I'd pay you 1000 dollars.

                         RIPLEY
               I've always wanted to go to Europe, sir,
               but...

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Good. Now you can go for a reason.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT, NEW YORK. DAY.

     A vinyl RECORD revolves in close up.  An exuberant and
     mysterious VOICE is scat singing. Wild. Then the sound slides
     into a raucous big band jazz number:  Dizzy Gillespie's The
     Champ. A HAND ejects the record. When the camera finds the
     man's face it is BLINDFOLDED. He's hot. He's wearing an
     undershirt. He's trying to identify the recording.

                         RIPLEY (O/S)
               I don't know. Count Basie?  Duke
               Ellington. I don't know. Count Basie.

     The man pulls of the blindfold, examines the record cover of
     the disc he's been trying to learn, needs to put on glasses
     to do so, is irritated by his mistake. He ejects the record.

     A pile of other jazz records are strewn across a cluttered
     table which includes classical sheet music and a paper
     keyboard. One hand idly mimes at the keys.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. DAY.

     Another song for Ripley to identify is on the gramophone.
     Chet Baker's My Funny Valentine.  Signs everywhere of
     packing. A suitcase. Books about Italy.  Ripley paces in this
     BASEMENT room, which is bathroom, kitchen, living room and
     bedroom all in one.  Tiny, tidy, squalid and sad. The windows
     give onto bars and a wall.

                         RIPLEY
               Don't even know if this is a man or a
               woman.

     There's a violent row going on in the room above his head. He
     flinches.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. DAY.

     Ripley, shining his shoes, packing almost done, is testing
     himself on another piece of music. Free jazz saxophone:
     Charlie Parker's Koko.  He listens hard, recognizes the
     track.

                         RIPLEY
               That's Charlie Parker. Bird.

     He skips over to the gramophone, checks the record. He's
     right, he smiles.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. DAY.

     Ripley studies an old photograph of Dickie Greenleaf in a
     Princeton Yearbook. He shoves the book in a bag, picks up
     his suitcase and takes a last look around the dingy apartment
     before closing the door behind him.

     EXT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. DAY.

     Ripley hauls his luggage up the stairs and into the sunlight.
     He is met at the top of the stairs by Mr Greenleaf's
     chauffeur.

                         CHAUFFEUR
               Here.  I'll take that.

                         RIPLEY
               Thanks.

                         CARETAKER
                   (nodding towards the apartment)
               That thousand bucks should come in handy.

                         RIPLEY
               Yes, sir.

                         CHAUFFEUR
                   (interupts Ripley, who is
                    about to open the car door)
               I'll get that.

                         RIPLEY
               Thanks.

                         CHAUFFEUR
                   (as he holds open the door for
                    Ripley)
               Sir.
                   (Ripley laughs excitedly)
               You're gonna have a great trip.  Mr
               Greenleaf is personal friends with the
               Cunard people.

     INT. HERBERT GREENLEAF'S CAR. DAY.

     Ripley luxuriates in the back of the Greenleaf limousine. He
     opens up an envelope he's carrying with Greenleaf stationery.
     Inside a First Class Cunard Ticket, some traveler's checks
     and dollars.

                         CHAUFFEUR
               I can tell you.  The Greenleaf name opens
               a lot of doors.

     EXT. QUEEN MARY, MANHATTAN SKYLINE. DAY.

     The liner leaves New York en route to Italy.  END CREDITS.

     INT. NAPLES HARBOR, CUSTOMS & IMMIGRATION HALL. DAY.

     ITALY. Brilliant sunshine. The Queen Mary has just docked.
     Passengers can be seen disembarking through the huge windows.
     Coming from the First Class gangways they are greeted,
     escorted, fussed over into the hall.  Their bags have been
     unloaded ahead of them, and are now being sorted in the hall
     under the initials of their owners.  STANDS WITH THE LETTERS
     OF THE ALPHABET CHALKED ON THEM are dotted about, and trunks
     and suitcases of all shapes and sizes form small hills around
     them. Ripley enters and an Italian Porter approaches, wants
     his name.  Ripley. Ripley. Ripley! he repeats in the hubbub
     and joins the crowd around the letter R.  A striking young
     woman (MEREDITH) is nearby. She notices him.

     Ripley proceeds to the Customs area, where he's held in a
     line as a large suitcase is opened and searched. Meredith
     catches up with him. Her luggage a mountain next to his.

                         MEREDITH
               What's your secret?

                         RIPLEY
               Excuse me?

                         MEREDITH
               No, it's just - you are American, aren't
               you? - no, I just, I have so much
               luggage, and you're so, uh, streamlined.
               It's humiliating.

     Ripley shrugs.  Now they're opening a second case of the
     passenger ahead.  Hard not to converse.

                         MEREDITH (cont'd)
               I'm Meredith, by the way. Meredith
               Randall.

                         RIPLEY
               Dickie, Dickie Greenleaf. Hello.

                         MEREDITH
               Hello.

     They are passed through immigration, head down the long
     stairs towards the street.  Meredith catches up with Ripley.

                         MEREDITH (cont'd)
               You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's?

                         RIPLEY
                   (thinking quickly)
               Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.

                         MEREDITH
               So now, did they put your suitcase in the
               wrong pile? It's just - upstairs -
               weren't you under the R stand? I thought
               I saw you there.

                         RIPLEY
               My father wants me in New York. He builds
               boats. I'd rather sail them.  I travel
               under my mother's name.

                         MEREDITH
               Which is?

                         RIPLEY
               Emily.
                   (Meredith's bewildered)
               Just kidding.

                         MEREDITH
               The funny thing is, I'm not Randall
               either. I'm Logue.

                         RIPLEY
                   (nods, recognizing the name)
               As in the...?

                         MEREDITH
               As in the Textile Logues. Trying to shrug
               off the dress. I travel under my mother's
               name, too.

                         RIPLEY
               Randall.

                         MEREDITH
               Right.

     They've arrived at a crossroads on the stairs - graphic signs
     explain the choices: one way for Buses, Taxis and exits - the
     other for Trains: ROMA, VENEZIA, MILANO.  They're going in
     different directions.

                         MEREDITH (cont'd)
                   (offering her hand)
               So - partners in disguise.
                   (looks at the signs)
               Bye.

     EXT. COASTAL ROAD FROM NAPLES. LATE AFTERNOON.

     A BUS rolls around a coastal road cut into the side of a
     cliff, mountain above, blue sea below.

     INT. BUS. LATE AFTERNOON.

     Ripley sits surrounded by teeming life. The bus slows at a
     new town. People get off.

     INT/EXTERIOR. BUS ARRIVES MONGIBELLO. LATE DAY.

     Later, the day ending. Ripley looks out as they continue on
     their journey. Arriving at a small fishing port they wind
     down through a square, passing the local church.

     EXT. MONGIBELLO, FISHERMAN'S WHARF. LATE DAY.

     And then the bus is in the heart of a wharf. On one side
     there's evidence of the fisherman's life, nets, old men
     working. Opposite there's a tiny cafe spilling out onto the
     street, young guys hang out, play table football, lounge on
     their Vespas. The Driver chants -

                         DRIVER
               MONGIBELLO!

     Ripley gets out, lugging his cases, as the bus continues on
     its way. He looks around him. He feels completely foreign.

     EXT. MIRAMARE HOTEL/BOAT AT SEA. MORNING.

     A SAILBOAT has slid into his view, now drops anchor, drops
     the sail.  A couple dive off and swim towards shore.

     ALL OF THIS IS FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF RIPLEY, who's
     watching the events through binoculars from his tiny balcony
     in the Miramare Hotel. An Italian Vocabulary Book is perched
     on his knees and, during this, he continues his study,
     mouthing the Italian words.

                         RIPLEY
                   (looking at a long, lean girl
                    about to dive)
               La fidanzata a una faccia.  The fiancÈe
               has a face.  La fidanzata e Marge.

     Her partner, DICKIE GREENLEAF, dives too. They're brown,
     beautiful, perfect. Ripley notices the name of the boat:
     "BIRD".

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
               Questo e la mia faccia.....

     The golden couple emerge from the sea. Dickie shakes off the
     water, grins.

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
               This is my face.

     He double-checks himself with the vocabulary book.

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
               Questa...e la mia faccia. Questa e la
               faccia di Dickie.

     EXT. MONGIBELLO. DAY.

     Ripley emerges from one of the beach cabins, and stands on
     the edge of the sand on a wooden walkway. He's wearing A TINY
     LIME-GREEN BATHING SUIT. He loathes beaches. A couple of boys
     turn laconically and watch him.

     Ripley puts on his shoes and scurries to the sea. He feels
     ridiculous, his skin alabaster against the brown bodies.
     Finally, the shame is too great and he pulls off his shoes
     and dashes to the water, where he luxuriates in the coolness
     of it before wading out of the sea, and walking straight up
     to Dickie.

                         RIPLEY
               Dickie Greenleaf?

     Dickie squints at Ripley, who holds his shoes, lamely.

                         DICKIE
               Who's this?

                         RIPLEY
               It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at
               Princeton together.

                         DICKIE
               Okay.
                   (he sits up)
               And did we know each other?

                         RIPLEY
               Well, I knew you, so I suppose you must
               have known me.

                         DICKIE
                   (to Marge)
               Princeton is like a fog, America's like a
               fog.
                   (to Ripley)
               This is Marge Sherwood. Tom - sorry, what
               was it?

                         RIPLEY
               Ripley. Hullo. How do you do.

                         MARGE
               How do you do.

                         DICKIE
               What are you doing in Mongi?

                         RIPLEY
               Nothing. Nothing much. Passing through.

                         DICKIE
                   (finds this idea absurd)
               Passing through! You're so white. Did you
               ever see a guy so white, Marge?  Gray,
               actually.

                         RIPLEY
               It's just an undercoat.
                   (Marge laughs)

                         DICKIE
               Say again?

                         RIPLEY
               You know, a primer.

                         DICKIE
               That's funny.

     He shares some intimacy with Marge, makes her laugh.  Ripley
     stands as they wrestle around him. Marge looks up.

                         MARGE
               You should come and have lunch with us,
               before you go - Dickie?

                         DICKIE
               Sure.  Any time.

                         MARGE
               And be careful in the sun. Your gray's in
               danger of turning a little pink.

                         RIPLEY
               Thanks. Well, a coincidence.

     EXT. MONGIBELLO. EARLY MORNING.

     ANOTHER DAY.  Church Bells ringing. Dickie, dressed in
     shorts, comes bumping up the cobbled path towards the square
     on his MOTORSCOOTER. He stops by a steep flight of steps.
     RIPLEY, a book in hand, unseen, walking up a hill, catches
     all this and, intrigued, watches as a young Italian beauty,
     SILVANA, has a spikey, flirtatious exchange with Dickie, then
     climbs on the scooter, behind him.

                         DICKIE
               I've been looking for you everywhere.

                         SILVANA
               Ah, today you're looking for me.  And
               where have you been the rest of the week?
               Pig.  With your American girl?  I hate
               you, you know?

                         DICKIE
               What?

                         SILVANA
               I hate you.

     And RIPLEY watches them as they rattle down the hill towards
     the sea.

     EXT. MARGE'S HOUSE. AFTERNOON.

     Dickie appears in Marge's garden, the sea behind his head.
     Marge is sitting at her outside table surrounded by some of
     the remnants of lunch.  Dickie's sheepish, showered, late.

                         DICKIE
               Sorry, sorry, sorry. I know, I'm late,
               I'm a swine.

                         MARGE
               Did you forget where I live? It's four
               o'clock.

                         DICKIE
               I just woke up.  I'm sorry.

                         MARGE
               You just woke up!

                         DICKIE
               Fausto and I - we took the boat out, we
               were fishing, and then it was dawn and
               we'd caught absolutely nothing.

                         MARGE
               Well, we ate everything without you.

                         DICKIE
               We?

                         MARGE
               Yes, Tom Ripley's here.

     As Ripley appears with the tray to collect more dishes.

                         DICKIE
               Who? Oh, Tom, hello, how are you? We
               thought you'd disappeared. We were going
               to send out a search party.

                         RIPLEY
               No, still here.

                         MARGE
               Tom was telling me about his trip over.
               Made me laugh so much I got a nosebleed.

                         DICKIE
               Is that good?

                         MARGE
               Shut up!

     Marge flicks him with a napkin. They start to wrestle,
     excluding Tom.

                         RIPLEY
               I'm intruding.

                         DICKIE
               Can you mix a martini?

                         RIPLEY
                   (hesitant)
               Sure.

                         MARGE
                   (going inside)
               I'll do it. I make a fabulous martini.

                         DICKIE
               Everybody should have one talent.
                   (to Ripley)
               What's yours?

                         RIPLEY
                   (without a beat)
               Forging signatures. Telling lies.
               Impersonating practically anybody.

                         DICKIE
                   (enjoying this banter)
               That's three. Nobody should have more
               than one talent. Okay, do an impression.

                         RIPLEY
               Now?  Okay.  Wait a minute.  Talent -
                   (his voice ages, his face
                    changes)
               The only talent my son has is for cashing
               his allowance.

                         DICKIE
                   (absolutely thrown)
               What? What's this?

                         RIPLEY
               I like to sail, believe me, I love to
               sail! Instead I make boats and other
               people sail them.

                         DICKIE
                   (incredibly impressed)
               Stop! It's too much!  You're making all
               the hairs on my neck stand up!

                         RIPLEY
                   (relishing it)
               Jazz, let's face it, it's just an
               insolent noise.

                         DICKIE
               I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the
               old bastard is here right now!  That's
               brilliant!  How do you know him?

                         RIPLEY
               I met him in New York.

                         DICKIE
               Marge! You've got to hear this!

                         MARGE
                   (returning with the drinks)
               What?  What?

                         DICKIE
               Meet my father, Herbert Richard Greenleaf
               1st.

                         RIPLEY
               Pleasure to meet you, Dickie's made a
               fine catch. I know Emily thinks so.

                         MARGE
               What's going on?

                         DICKIE
               Uncanny!

                         MARGE
               I don't get it.

                         RIPLEY
               Could you ever conceive of going there,
               Tom, and bringing him back?

                         DICKIE
               What?

                         RIPLEY
               I'd pay you. If you would go to Italy and
               persuade my son to come home. I'd pay you
               $1000.

     INT/EXT. MONGIBELLO CHURCH AND SQUARE. DUSK.

     A christening is over and now the whole village is pouring
     out of Church for the Passeggiata in Sunday best. Girls arm
     in arm parade. Boys arm in arm evaluate. New babies are
     compared and fussed over. Old people smoke, talk, shrug.
     Dickie is walking with Ripley, seething about his father's
     scheming.

                         DICKIE
               I'm never going back. To actually hire
               somebody to come all the way here to drag
               me back home - got to be insane, hasn't
               he?

     SILVANA comes out of church arm in arm with a man, her
     fiancee, as part of a foursome which includes Dickie's pal
     FAUSTO. Silvana's eyes flick towards Dickie, otherwise
     there's no acknowledgement as they all greet each other.
     Dickie introduces Tom, then they move on.

                         DICKIE (cont'd)
               I'm never going back!

                         RIPLEY
               No, I think your mother, her illness -

                         DICKIE
               It's got nothing to do with my mother!
               She's had leukemia for - ! This is what
               makes me boil about him! HE wants me
               back! - it's got nothing to do with my
               mother.

                         RIPLEY
               I don't know, Dickie, I'm just telling
               you what I -

                         DICKIE
                   (interrupting)
               Go back!  Go back to New York or call him
               if you can find a telephone that works,
               and tell him wild horses wouldn't drag me
               back to him or his shipyard.

     EXT. DICKIE'S HOUSE, MONGIBELLO. AFTERNOON.

     Ripley appears, with his meagre luggage at Dickie's front
     door. He's carrying his tote bag under his arm, the bottom of
     which seems to be unstitched and held together only by his
     fingers. Marge is on the terrace, she looks down to see Tom
     talking with Dickie.

                         MARGE
               Hi Tom.

                         DICKIE
                   (looks up)
               Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye.

                         MARGE
               I'll come down.

                         DICKIE
                   (to Ripley)
               Did you speak to my father?

                         RIPLEY
               You were right about the telephones.
               There are no lines, there's some problem.

                         MARGE
                   (coming out of the front door)
               Hello Tom. You're off? What are your
               plans?

                         RIPLEY
               Back, I suppose, slowly as I can.

     He goes to shake her hand and as he releases the tote bag the
     seam splits and records spill to the ground, scattering. He
     bends down, starts gathering them up. Marge helps.

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
               Oh, damn, sorry, this bag's -

     Dickie's delighted when he sees the Jazz titles.

                         DICKIE
               You like jazz!

                         RIPLEY
                   (gathering up the records)
               I love jazz.

                         DICKIE
                   (holding up a Chet Baker)
               This is the best. Marge says she likes
               jazz, but she things Glenn Miller is
               jazz.

                         MARGE
               I never said that!

                         RIPLEY
               Bird. That's jazz.

                         DICKIE
               Bird! Ask me the name of my sailboat -

                         RIPLEY
               I don't know. What's the name of your
               sailboat?

                         DICKIE
               Bird!

                         MARGE
               Which is ridiculous. Boats are female,
               everyone knows you can't call a boat
               after a man.

                         RIPLEY
               He's not a man, he's a god.

                         DICKIE
                   (excited)
               Okay, we're going to Naples. There's a
               club, it's not a club, it's a cellar.

                         MARGE
               It's vile.

                         DICKIE
               Yes, it's vile. Don't worry, you don't
               have to come.
                   (to Ripley)
               It's great.  You're going to love it.

     INT. JAZZ CLUB, NAPLES. NIGHT.

     A cavern blue with smoke. A surprisingly good QUINTET blast
     out their version of MOANIN'. Dickie and Ripley arrive and
     make their way to a table where Fausto is sitting with
     friends. It's too noisy for conversation, but Dickie shouts
     introductions and they shake Ripley's hand.  Dickie is
     instantly absorbed in the music, Ripley absorbed in Dickie.
     An attractive Italian Girl, DAHLIA, comes over, kisses
     Dickie, pulls off his hat, puts it on, there's no room for
     her to sit, so she sits on Dickie's lap, smoking his
     cigarette.  Dickie raises his eyebrow at Tom, but it's
     clearly no hardship. Then the band strikes up the intro to Tu
     vuo' fa' L'Americano - a hit which reflects the current craze
     for all things American - and Fausto pulls a protesting Dickie
     up onto the stage.

                         FAUSTO
                   (improvising in Italian)
               Ladies and Gentlemen. Dickie Greenleaf,
               all the way from America... etc.

     Fausto starts to sing. Dickie joins in the chorus. Everybody
     claps. Dickie talks off-mic to Fausto.

                         FAUSTO (cont'd)
               And a big round of applause for a new
               friend from New York - Tom Ripley!

     Ripley's mortified, but Dickie jumps off the stage and pulls
     him up.  The song continues and now, at the chorus, it's
     Dickie and Ripley who have to sing. Ripley, of course, can
     sing well, if not confident in this arena. Soon the audience
     is clapping, standing on tables, dancing, Dahlia prominent.

                         DICKIE (O/S)
                   (reading)
               I have bumped into an old friend from
               Princeton - a fellow named Tom Ripley.
               He says he's going to haunt me until I
               agree to come back to New York with
               him...

     INT. DICKIE'S HOUSE. NOON.

     Dickie, in his new dressing gown, is sitting at the table,
     typing. Ripley's head emerges from behind the couch on which
     he has been enjoying a blissful sleep.

                         DICKIE
                   (grins)
               Good afternoon!

                         RIPLEY
               What time is it?
                   (puts on his glasses and checks
                    his watch)
               Oh God!  Do you always type your letters?
                   (points at the letter)
               That should be two Ts.

                         DICKIE
               I can't write and I can't spell.  That's
               the privilege of a first-class education.
               You're upstairs at the back. I think
               Ermelinda made the bed up.

                         RIPLEY
               This is so good of you.

                         DICKIE
               Don't say it again. Now you're a Double
               Agent and we're going to string my Dad
               alone, I was thinking we might buy a
               little car with the expense money he's
               sending you. What do you think, Marge...a
               little Cinquecento with my Dad's money?

     Marge has appeared, carrying Camparis.

                         MARGE
               Dickie, you can't even drive a car!  No,
               what we need urgently is an icebox. What
               do you think, Tom? Agree with me and I'll
               be your friend for life.

                         RIPLEY
               I absolutely agree with Marge.

     INT. DICKIE'S HOUSE, UPSTAIRS. DAY.

     Ripley locates his room, puts down his luggage in what is a
     comfortable and simple room, then heads back downstairs only
     to be tempted by the open door of Dickie's bedroom.

     INT. DICKIE'S BEDROOM. DAY.

     Ripley explores the casual elegance of Dickie's bedroom - the
     Louis Vuitton chest, the closet's open door spilling out
     shirts, ties. On the dressing table there are toiletries,
     cufflinks scattered, a silk tie.  Ripley picks up the tie and
     walks towards the open window below which is a terrace where
     lunch is being laid. Marge and Dickie are chatting. Shreds of
     conversation float up to Ripley.

                         DICKIE
               It'll just be for a little while.  He can
               be... he makes me laugh.

                         MARGE
               Okay, darling.

                         DICKIE
               You'd say if you mind?

                         MARGE
               No, I like him.

                         DICKIE
               Marge, you like everybody.

                         MARGE
               I don't like you.

                         DICKIE
               Then I'll go to your place and you can
               move in with Tom.

     Above them, Ripley repeats these phrases, carefully, testing
     the cadences, No, I like him. Marge, you like everybody,
     until he's as accurate as a taperecorder.

     EXT. TERRACE OF DICKIE'S HOUSE. DAY.

     Ermelinda is clearing away lunch. Ripley is changed and
     sitting at the table with Marge while Dickie works on the
     coffee. Ripley watches him, studying everything: the way he
     uses the expresso machine, the way he wears no socks, his
     pants, his rings.

                         DICKIE
               Now you know why Miss Sherwood always
               shows up for breakfast.  It's not love
               it's the coffee machine.

                         MARGE
               It's the one task Dickie can do on his
               own - make coffee.

                         DICKIE
               Shut up.

                         MARGE
               Oh darling - is that for me?

                         DICKIE
               No it's for Tom as he didn't complain.

                         RIPLEY
                   (as Dickie hands him his cup)
               That ring's so great. The green one.

                         MARGE
                   (delighted)
               Tom, I love you!
                   (to Dickie)
               See!
                   (to Ripley)
               I bought it for him, for his birthday.

                         RIPLEY
               It's superb.

                         DICKIE
               I had to promise, capital P, never to
               take it off - otherwise I'd give it to
               you.

                         MARGE
                   (flicking a crumb at him)
               Bastard!
                   (to Ripley)
               Isn't it great, Tom? I found it in
               Naples.  I bargained for about two weeks.

                         DICKIE
               I hope it wasn't cheap.

                         MARGE
               Oh, it was.

                         RIPLEY
                   (to Marge)
               I have to find a birthday present for
               Frances. Perhaps you can help me?

                         MARGE
               Frances?

                         RIPLEY
               My fiancÈe.

                         DICKIE
               You're a dark horse, Ripley. Engaged?

                         RIPLEY
               Your parents met her.

                         DICKIE
               Oh God - I can just imagine - if only
               Dickie would settle down... doesn't every
               parent deserve a grandchild?  Never! I
               swear on your ring, Marge.  I am never
               going back.

     EXT. BIRD SAILBOAT. DAY.

     The Bird is sailing off the coast of Mongibello. There's a
     manoeuvre going on with the sail.  Captain Dickie supervises
     his crew of Marge and a painfully awkward anxious-to-please
     Ripley.  Dickie goes over to help him.

                         RIPLEY
               I'm doing this wrong, aren't I?

                         DICKIE
               You're doing great. We'll make a sailor
               of you yet. You're doing really well.

                         MARGE
               Dubious but special honor, Tom - crewing
               Dickie's boat.  Alright, bar's open.

                         DICKIE
               Yes please!

     She heads for the cabin. Dickie settles down beside Ripley.

                         RIPLEY
               Could we sail to Venice?

                         DICKIE
               Sure.  I love Venice.

                         RIPLEY
               I have to go to Venice.

                         DICKIE
               See Venice and die, isn't that right? Or
               is it Rome? You do something and die,
               don't you?  Okay, Venice is on the list.

                         RIPLEY
               And Rome.

                         DICKIE
               Do you ski?
                   (Ripley frowns)
               Don't tell me - you're a lost cause!
               That's the next thing to deal with. We're
               planning to go to Cortina at Christmas.
               Excellent skiing. Excellent.
                   (as Marge reappears)
               Marge - Ripley can't ski.  We'll have to
               teach him that, too. Have you ever known
               such low class?

                         MARGE
               Poor Tom. Good thing we're not getting
               married. We might have to invite him on
               our honeymoon.

     EXT. MONGIBELLO. LATE DAY.

     Marge and Ripley are on a shopping expedition. They walk down
     the hill towards the grocery shop, next to the bar in the
     little square. Ripley has asked Marge how she and Dickie met.

                         MARGE
               Oh I hated New York - that Park Avenue
               crowd - so I fled to Paris to work on my
               book, and I was always going to this cafe
               with Jean-Jacques, and Dickie used to
               play his saxophone outside and I would
               see him and he would see me, and he would
               play My Funny Valentine. It was only
               later that I realised he only knows about
               six songs.

     They've arrived at the Grocery Store. Alessandra, the woman
     who owns the store greets them.  Silvana, who's her daughter,
     is also there, and less comfortable. She waits for Marge's
     order.

                         MARGE (cont'd)
                   (to Silvana, in Italian)
               Buono Sera, Silvana. Por favore: arance e
               pane, e del prosciutto.

                         SILVANA
               E fichi?  Come sempre?

                         MARGE
               Si.  Come sempre.  Grazie.

     Silvana goes inside for the meat and bread. Marge frowns.

                         MARGE (cont'd)
                   (back to Ripley)
               Anyway, then one day, we go in, I see
               Dickie, he starts playing My Funny
               Valentine, and then all of a sudden he
               just walks into the cafe, right in front
               of Jean-Jacques, and grabs me! Now I had
               never spoken to him in my life - he said
               I'm going to Italy, tomorrow, and I want
               you to come with me. So I did.

     At the edge of the square there's A BOCCE AREA, where men
     throw metal balls along a track, aiming to get closest to a
     small cue. Dickie is there, playing intensely with Fausto and
     two other guys, one of whom we've seen before with Silvana.
     Ripley and Marge loop back towards home, taking in the Bocce
     en route. Dickie waves. They wave back. Marge calls to him.

                         MARGE (cont'd)
               If you're not at my place by 7.00, Tom
               and I are running off together.

                         DICKIE
               Okay.

     EXT. MARGE'S HOUSE. EARLY EVENING.

     Dickie and Ripley are leaving.  They're fooling around.
     Dickie jumps on Ripley's shoulders. Marge watches from the
     top of the garden.

     EXT. MONGIBELLO SQUARE. EARLY EVENING.

     Dickie and Ripley, still horsing about, pass Silvana's
     grocery store.  Dickie dismounts, goes over to Silvana, who's
     tense, a little troubled. They huddle, Ripley isolated.

                         SILVANA
               Did you get my message?  I want to talk
               to you.

                         DICKIE
               I want to talk to you too...Smile for me.

     And Dickie's already gone, back to Ripley feinting to box him
     then dancing, satyr-like, down the hill.

     EXT. COASTAL ROAD TO NAPLES. EVENING.

     Dickie and Ripley on the Vespa. There's a steep incline where
     the road winds down towards Naples and, as the Vespa gains
     speed, Ripley is happy to cling to Dickie.

                         DICKIE
               You're breaking my ribs!

                         RIPLEY
               What?

                         DICKIE
               You're breaking my ribs!

     INT. JAZZ CLUB, NAPLES. NIGHT.

     Ripley's really singing, carrying the burden of My Funny
     Valentine in a flawless imitation of Chet Baker. Dickie is
     playing some sax. After a verse, there's spontaneous
     applause. Dickie, impressed beams at Ripley.

     INT. DICKIE'S HOUSE. NIGHT.

     A NEW ICEBOX, incongruous in pride of place in the living
     room, casts its glow on a delighted Dickie as he pulls out a
     couple of beers, handing one to Ripley who is paging through
     his copy of the Collected Works of Shakespeare.

                         DICKIE
               I could fuck this icebox I love it so
               much.
                   (considering Ripley)
               What were you actually doing in New York?

                         RIPLEY
               I played piano in a few places.

                         DICKIE
               That's one job, you told me a lot of
               jobs.

                         RIPLEY
               A few places - that's a few jobs. Anyway,
               I don't want to think about New York.

                         DICKIE
               The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I
               spend hours speculating.
                   (drinking)
               Cold beer. Thank you Dad.

                         RIPLEY
               Copy out from here...

     He hands the book to Dickie, pointing out the lines.

                         DICKIE
                   (staring to write on the back
                    of a postcard)
               I love the fact you brought Shakespeare
               with you and no clothes.  Ermelinda says
               you wash the same shirt out every night.
               Is that true?

                         RIPLEY
               No! I've got more than one shirt!

                         DICKIE
               She can do that stuff for you. Anyway,
               just wear some of my things, wear
               anything you want, most of it's ancient.
                   (he's finished writing)

                         RIPLEY
               Now your signature.
                   (watching him write)
               Not "Dickie". Your signature.

     Dickie writes his signature at the bottom of the postcard.
     Ripley studies the writing, takes off his glasses to clean
     them. Dickie looks at him.

                         DICKIE
               Without the glasses you're not even ugly.
                   (takes them, tries them on)
               I don't need them because I never read.
               How do I look.

                         RIPLEY
               Like Clark Kent.
                   (takes them back, puts them on
                    beaming at Dickie)
               Now Superman.

     Dickie cuffs him.  Ripley looks down at the postcard.

                         DICKIE
               I know. I write like a child.

                         RIPLEY
               Pretty vile. See this: The S and the T,
               do you see? - fine, vulnerable - that's
               pain, that's secret pain.

                         DICKIE
               It must be a deep secret, cause I don't
               know about it.

                         RIPLEY
               Your handwriting - nothing more naked.
               See - nothing's quite touching the line -
               that's vanity.

                         DICKIE
                   (flattered)
               Well we certainly know that's true.

     INT. DICKIE'S BATHROOM. NIGHT.

     Dickie's in the bath. Ripley, dressed, sits on the stool next
     to the bath. They're in the middle of playing chess, the
     board propped on the bath tray. Ripley puts his hand in the
     water, checking the temperature. He turns on the faucet for a
     burst of hot. Ripley is absurdly happy. He pours some wine.

                         DICKIE
               Do you have any brothers?

                         RIPLEY
               No, no brothers, no sisters.

                         DICKIE
               me neither. Nor does Marge. All only
               children - what does that mean?

     He looks at Ripley who looks at him, a little too long.

                         RIPLEY
               Means we never shared a bath.
               I'm cold. Can I get in?

                         DICKIE
               No!

                         RIPLEY
               I didn't mean with you in it.

                         DICKIE
                   (standing)
               Okay, you get in. I'm like a prune
               anyway.

     He gets out, walks past Ripley, who doesn't turn around. But
     Dickie's reflected in the mirror. Ripley looks, then Dickie
     turns, holds his look momentarily before flicking him with
     his towel.

     INT/EXT. AMERICAN EXPRESS OFFICE, NAPLES. DAY.

     An OFFICIAL is studying Dickie's passport photograph. It's
     not a recent picture. The official looks suspicious. Dickie
     is used to it.

                         DICKIE
               It is me. It's an old picture.
                   (sighs at Ripley)
               Every time - 'is it you?  Doesn't look
               like you'.

     He's signing for his allowance. He has a smart document case
     with his initials prominently embossed.  Ripley watches him
     sign and collect a large wad of notes.

                         CLERK
               Letters - Greenleaf, and for Ripley.

     Ripley collects and studies his mail. As they walk outside he
     holds up one letter to Dickie.

                         RIPLEY
               Fran.
                   (anticipating her letter)
               I miss you, where are you coming home?
               Stop telling me what a great time you're
               having, how you love Dickie... and Marge
               and...
                   (the next letter)
               And this one, I think, is your dad...

     INT. TRAIN TO ROME. DAY.

     Ripley sits reading the LETTER from Herbert Greenleaf.  He
     frowns, stops reading, looks out of the window.

                         DICKIE
               What does he say?

                         RIPLEY
               He's getting impatient. He wants me to
               reassure him you'll be home by
               Thanksgiving.

                         DICKIE
               You've got to get a new jacket. Really.
               You must be sick of the same clothes. I'm
               sick of seeing you in them.

                         RIPLEY
               I can't. I can't keep spending your
               father's money.

                         DICKIE
               I love how responsible you are. My Dad
               should make you Chief Accountant or
               something.  Let me buy you a jacket.
               There's a great place when we get to
               Rome, Batistoni.

     Ripley loves this idea and mouths the word, "Batistoni".

                         DICKIE (cont'd)
               Andiamo a Roma.  We're taking Tom to
               Roma!

     EXT. ARCARI'S CAFE, PIAZZA NAVONA, ROME. DAY.

     Ripley and Dickie sit outside at a Cafe in the Piazza Navona.
     Very smart, very sophisticated, very young crowd.  There are
     already several empty coffee cups and a half empty bottle of
     Frascati.  Ripley has his guide book out and is incredibly
     impatient. Dickie, meanwhile, has stretched out for the
     duration.

                         RIPLEY
               Where do we find a carozza for the Forum,
               or can we hire any of them - ?

                         DICKIE
               Relax.

                         RIPLEY
               It's just there's so much to do in a
               single day.

                         DICKIE
               Relax. The most important question is
               where to eat. I hope Freddie made a
               reservation.

                         RIPLEY
               Freddie?

                         DICKIE
               Freddie Miles.  You know - he's
               organizing the Cortina skiing trip.

     Ripley hates the idea of having this special day invaded. A
     horn makes him look up as FREDDIE MILES illegally parks his
     open top sports car opposite the cafe, sees Dickie and
     bustles over.  He's a heavy-set American with a reddish
     crewcut. Ripley finds him disgusting to look at. Dickie is
     delighted.

                         DICKIE (cont'd)
               Frederico!

                         FREDDIE
               Ciao bello.
                   (noticing a beautiful woman in
                    an open-topped car)
               Don't you want to fuck every woman you
               see.  Just once.

     They kiss cheeks, continental-style.

                         DICKIE
               This is Tom Ripley. Freddie Miles.

                         FREDDIE
                   (mugging)
               Hey, if I'm late, think what her
               husband's saying!

     He fills Dickie's glass with wine and drinks it standing up.

                         FREDDIE (cont'd)
               So let's go. I got us a table outside at
               Fabrizio's.

     And Dickie's up, leaving Ripley to pick up all the tiny
     checks to work out the bill and pay it.

                         DICKIE
               I'll tell you - I am so cabin-crazy with
               Mongi.

     Freddie and Dickie link arms Italian-style and cross the
     street to Freddie's car.

                         FREDDIE
               I know.  I was there.
                   (looks back to see Ripley
                    struggling to settle the
                    check)
               Tommy!  It's S.R.O.  Two seater.
               Standing Room Only.  Chop, chop, Tommy!

     Ripley, abandoned, goes over. There's no room in the car. He
     has to crouch in the rear.

                         FREDDIE (cont'd)
               You're going to have to sit between us.
               But don't put your shoes on the seat,
               know what I mean, put them one on top of
               the other.  Okay?

     INT. A JAZZ RECORD STORE. LATE AFTERNOON.

     This record store is hidden away down a cobbled alley, and
     stuffed with the trendiest Romans, all of whom rifle the
     stacks under a fog of cigarette smoke.  There are two
     LISTENING BOOTHS, one of which has Freddie and Dickie crammed
     into it, sharing a set of headphones.  Ripley stands outside
     the booth, holding both of their jackets like a manservant,
     while inside and behind the glass doors they chat animatedly.
     He looks longingly at the street, where the light is fading.
     Dickie catches his hangdog expression and pushes open the
     accordion doors.

                         DICKIE
               Look, Tom, we've got to go to a club and
               meet some friends of Freddie's. The best
               thing is - if you want to be a tourist -
               grab a cab and we can meet up at the
               railway station.

                         RIPLEY
                   (absolutely crestfallen)
               What club?

                         DICKIE
               Freddie's arranged it with some of the
               skiing crowd. Come if you want but I
               thought you wanted to see the Forum...?

                         RIPLEY
               I did. And then maybe get the jacket and
               what have you...

                         FREDDIE
                   (from inside the booth)
               Dick - you've got to hear this!

                         DICKIE
                   (oblivious to Ripley's pain)
               Listen, just take one of mine when we get
               back. Don't worry about it.  I did the
               Forum with Marge and, frankly, once is
               enough in anyone's life.

     Ripley hands him the coats, turns away.

                         DICKIE
               Ciao.  Have fun.

     Ripley heads for the door, then comes back, raps on the
     booth.  Dickie pushes it open.

                         RIPLEY
               You said to make sure you didn't miss the
               train. It leaves at eight.

     EXT. THE CAPITOL. LATE AFTERNOON.

     Ripley hikes up Michelangelo's Arcoeli Steps. Then he's
     looking down from the Campodoglio at the Forum below. Then
     he's walking by the oversized fragments of the Colossus. This
     is the real Ripley, the lover of beauty, inspired by art, by
     antiquity. He's awed. He's cold. He so much wishes he weren't
     alone.

     INT. ROME RAILWAY STATION. NIGHT.

     It's past eight, Ripley stands, one foot on the guard step of
     the Naples train, waiting forlornly for Dickie, then giving
     up as the train pulls away. He pulls the door to his
     compartment closed, and sits inside the train alone.

     INT. DICKIE'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

     There's music playing, Bing Crosby's "May I". Very loud.
     Ripley dances to the mirror, SPECTACLES ABANDONED and DRESSED
     AS DICKIE IN HIS TUXEDO, MINUS TROUSERS. He adjusts his hair,
     catches one of Dickie's expressions.  There are clothes
     abandoned everywhere.  He's been having a big dressing-up
     session. He sings along with Bing.

                         DICKIE (O/S)
               What are you doing?

     Ripley turns, horrified, to see Dickie standing in the
     doorway.  The music thumps away.

                         RIPLEY
               Oh - just amusing myself.  Sorry, Dickie.
                   (pause)
               I didn't think you were coming back.

     Dickie turns off the record player.

                         DICKIE
               I wish you'd get out of my clothes.

     Ripley starts undressing, his fingers clumsy with
     mortification and shock.  Dickie looks at his feet, shakes
     his head.

                         DICKIE (cont'd)
               Shoes too?

                         RIPLEY
                   (lame, ashamed)
               You said I could pick out a jacket and I
               just... Sorry.

                         DICKIE
               Get undressed in your own room, would
               you?

                         RIPLEY
               I thought you'd missed the train.

                         DICKIE
               Freddie drove me back in his car.

                         RIPLEY
                   (horrified)
               Is Freddie here?

                         DICKIE
               He's downstairs.

                         RIPLEY
               I was just fooling around. Don't say
               anything. Sorry.

     Dickie lets him leave and then sits amongst the debris of the
     dressing-up session, not amused.

     EXT. DICKIE'S TERRACE. DAY.

     Ripley comes down, apprehensive, to find Marge and Dickie and
     Freddie having a jolly breakfast on the terrace. Dickie looks
     perfectly happy.

                         MARGE
               Hi, Tom.  Come join us.

                         FREDDIE
               I want this job of yours, Tommy. I was
               just saying - You live in Italy, sleep in
               Dickie's house, eat Dickie's food, wear
               his clothes, and his father picks up the
               tab. If you get bored, let me know, I'll
               do it!

     EXT. THE OCEAN, ABOARD THE BIRD. DAY.

     The boat is drifting.  Freddie and Dickie and Marge are
     swimming, then Marge climbs back onto the boat, where Ripley
     is sitting alone, reading.

                         MARGE
               You really should go in, it's marvellous.

                         RIPLEY
               I'm fine.

     She approaches him, conscious of his isolation. She's in a
     red bikini, and she towels herself dry as they speak.

                         MARGE
               Are you okay?

                         RIPLEY
               Sure.

     They watch Dickie and Freddie fooling around in the water.

                         MARGE
               The thing with Dickie - it's like the sun
               shines on you and it's glorious, then he
               forgets you and it's very very cold.

                         RIPLEY
               So I'm learning.

                         MARGE
               He's not even aware of it. When you've
               got his attention you feel like you're
               the only person in the world. That's why
               everybody loves him. Other times...

     There's a yell from Dickie as Freddie wrestles with him.

                         DICKIE
                   (laughing and choking)
               He's drowning me!

                         MARGE
               It's always the same whenever someone new
               comes into his life - Freddie, Fausto,
               Peter Smith-Kingsley - he's wonderful -
               did you meet him, he's a musician? -
               ... and especially you, of course... and
               that's only the boys.

     They watch as Freddie pushes Dickie under the surface.

                         MARGE (cont'd)
               Tell me, why is it when men play they
               always play at killing each other...?
               I'm sorry about Cortina by the way.

                         RIPLEY
               What about Cortina?

                         MARGE
               Didn't Dick say? - he talked to
               Freddie... apparently it's not going to
               work out -
                   (Ripley's devastated, Marge
                    notices, can't look at him)
               Freddie says there aren't enough rooms.

     EXT. OCEAN, ABOARD THE BIRD. DUSK.

     LATER and now the boat is sailing again. Ripley is sitting in
     his spot. Dickie and Freddie are at the tiller.

                         DICKIE
               Come on, Frederico, do you really have
               to go back?  At least stick around for
               the Festival of the Madonna.

                         FREDDIE
               I don't think so. Come back with me to
               Rome. There's this great new club.  Have
               some drinks, lotta ladies...

     Marge, still in her bikini, disappears into the cabin. Dickie
     makes a face at Freddie.

                         DICKIE
               Do you think you can steer this thing?

                         FREDDIE
               Sure.

                         DICKIE
               Just point her at Capri and avoid the
               rocks.

                         FREDDIE
               What are you doing?

                         DICKIE
               Marge-maintenance.

                         FREDDIE
               Aye, aye.

     Dickie heads towards the cabin. Freddie takes over the
     tiller. There's a breeze and the sailboat cuts through the
     water.

     From where Ripley sits he can see Capri in the distance, but
     he can also look down into the cabin, its porthole offering
     him a restricted view.  He looks down and there's a flash of
     flesh, then nothing.  Then as the boat swings with the waves,
     he glimpses the bikini top flung over a chair, and then
     Marge's bare foot kicking out rhythmically, the red-painted
     toes straining.  Ripley's mesmerized, aroused, and absolutely
     betrayed.

                         FREDDIE (cont'd)
               Tommy - How's the peeping? Come on Tommy,
               you were looking.  Tommy Tommy Tommy.

     Shamed, Ripley looks away. He stares at the water, parting
     before the boat, its turmoil reflecting his.

     EXT. DICKIE'S MOORING. DAY.

     The Bird returns to the mooring by Dickie's House.  Dickie as
     ever Captain of the Ship, clambering around, shouting
     instructions, with Ripley, Marge and Freddie as crew.  Ripley
     looks back at shore. Silvana stands watching, staring.
     Dickie notices her too.

     EXT. MONGIBELLO SLIPWAY. LATE DAY.

     A WOMAN'S HEAD suddenly breaks the surface of the water.

     It's a statue of the Virgin Mary, life size, adorned with
     flowers and a lace veil.  As she is revealed, wooden,
     staring, four men emerge, lifting the statue on a palette,
     wading towards the shore, the Madonna aloft on their
     shoulders.

     The whole town of Mongibello is in attendance for this Annual
     Festival of the Madonna del Mare, either standing in their
     fishing boats, or on shore and flanking the Parish Priest and
     altar boys and incense. RIPLEY, DICKIE and MARGE watch from
     Dickie's terrace. There are hymns and, as the statue is
     carried to the shore, the men's heads barely above the waves,
     the congregation applauds at the illusion that the Madonna is
     walking on water.

     Suddenly ANOTHER HEAD appears on the surface of the water,
     about fifty yards from the statue. There's a scream from
     among the crowd as someone notices the body. It's SILVANA.
     One of the MEN carrying the statue turns first towards the
     direction of the scream and then towards the floating corpse.
     It's Silvana's fiancee, and in a second he has let go of the
     palette, CAUSING IT TO TOPPLE, and - in absolute grief -
     wades, swims, splashes towards the body.

     PANDEMONIUM in the crowd, which breaks up, with other people
     splashing, fully clothed, into the water. From the terrace,
     Ripley turns and looks at Dickie, catching his eye.

     EXT. DICKIE'S TERRACE. LATE DAY.

     Marge and Ripley and Dickie watch from the terrace as below
     them an AMBULANCE takes away the body. It seems as if the
     whole town looks on - fiancee, parents, brothers, sisters,
     police, priest, etc. As the corpse is loaded into the vehicle
     A BRIEF SCUFFLE occurs between Silvana's fiancee and her
     brother. They are pulled apart. Then the ambulance pulls
     away.

                         RIPLEY
               What's the fight about? That's her
               fiancÈ, isn't it?  Are they blaming him?

                         DICKIE
                   (sharp)
               I don't know! Why are you asking me?
                   (agitated)
               How can it take an hour to find an
               ambulance?

                         MARGE
                   (conciliatory)
               Well, she was already dead, darling,
               wasn't she, so I suppose -

                         DICKIE
               I don't know why people say this
               country's civilised. It isn't. It's
               fucking primitive.

     And with that HE KICKS OUT VIOLENTLY AT A CHAIR SUPPORTING
     THE RECORDPLAYER. Records, machine, chair go flying across
     the terrace. Dickie storms inside.

                         MARGE
               Dickie!

                         RIPLEY
               I'll go and see what's the matter.

                         MARGE
               I'll go.

     INT. DICKIE'S HOUSE. LATE AFTERNOON.

     Later, Dickie is slumped in an armchair at the open window
     overlooking the slipway. He's playing sax. A forlorn, keening
     phrase from YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT LOVE IS. Ripley appears,
     begins tidying the mess in the living room.  He picks up
     empty bottles, an abandoned bikini top.

                         RIPLEY
               I know why you're upset.
                   (Dickie continues playing)
               I know about Silvana, Dickie. About you
               and Silvana.

     Dickie stops playing.

                         DICKIE
               What about us?

     He now has an armful of dishes and glasses and bottles.

                         DICKIE (cont'd)
                   (losing his temper)
               You don't have to clean up! Really!

     Ripley disappears into the kitchen.

                         DICKIE (cont'd)
                   (as Ripley returns)
               She was pregnant. Did you know that? Do
               you know what that means in a place like
               this?

                         RIPLEY
               I'm prepared to take the blame.

                         DICKIE
               What are you talking about?

                         RIPLEY
               You've been so good to me. You're the
               brother I never had. I'm the brother you
               never had.

                         DICKIE
               She came to me for help, she needed
               money, and I didn't help her. I didn't
               help her. Now she's dead and it's my
               fault.

                         RIPLEY
               I'm not going to say anything - to Marge,
               or anybody, the police - It's a secret
               between us and I'll keep it.

     And he disappears again, leaving Dickie to resume the sax,
     somehow in thrall to Ripley.

                         RIPLEY (O/S)
               Dear Tom, I think the time has come to
               discontinue your expense checks...

     EXT. AMERICAN EXPRESS, NAPLES. DAY.

     Ripley and Dickie are walking out of the American Express
     Office, Dickie pushing the rest of his money into his case,
     Ripley - despondent - reading aloud extracts from a letter
     from Herbert Greenleaf -

                         RIPLEY
               ...The thousand dollars, of course, was
               only due in the event that you succeeded
               in bringing Dickie home. Naturally, I
               hope the trip has afforded you some
               pleasure despite the failure of its main
               objective you need no longer consider
               yourself obligated to us in any way...

                         DICKIE
               You can't blame him.  You could hardly
               expect this to go on forever.

                         RIPLEY
               I thought you might write again. Now that
               we're brothers...

                         DICKIE
               I can't, how can I, in all decency? We've
               had a good run, haven't we?

                         RIPLEY
                   (increasingly miserable)
               What about Venice? Can we stick to that
               plan at least?

                         DICKIE
               I don't think so, Tom. You can't stay on
               here without money.  It's time we all
               moved on.  Besides I'm sick of Mongi.
               Especially now with everything - I really
               want to move to the North. I need to
               check out San Remo next week, find
               somewhere new to keep the boat.
               But it would be great, though, if you
               came with me.  Our last trip before you
               leave. There's a jazz festival - we could
               say goodbye in style.  What do you think?
               A last trip?

     INT. TRAIN TO SAN REMO. AFTERNOON.

     Dickie and Ripley travel up to San Remo. They sit next to
     each other. Dickie's asleep. Ripley lays his head on Dickie's
     shoulder, but as he does that, the ticket inspector announces
     the San Remo stop, taps on the window and Dickie stirs. Then
     Ripley plays his familiar game of studying his face in the
     reflection of the train window, so that he can move his head
     and see his reflection, then back and see Dickie's.  Dickie
     suddenly catches him staring. Ripley looks away.

                         DICKIE
                   (terse)
               Why do you do that thing - with your
               neck? On trains you always do that thing,
               it's so spooky.

     EXT. HOTEL TERRACE RESTAURANT, SAN REMO. NIGHT.

     Dickie and Ripley walk through the terrace of an hotel which
     lips out towards the sea. There's a restaurant and palms and
     a JAZZ QUINTET playing, American. Very cool. They pass the
     band. Dickie's captivated as they head for their table. They
     pass some girls at a table. Dickie smiles greedily.

                         DICKIE
               This is more like it. Didn't I tell you
               San Remo was crazy!

     They're shown to a good table. Dickie watches the band while
     their glasses are filled with champagne. Ripley looks happy.
     He's got Dickie all to himself.

                         RIPLEY
               To Mongibello and the happiest days of my
               life.

                         DICKIE
               To Mongi.  You're cheerful tonight.

                         RIPLEY
               I'm suddenly quite happy to be going
               back.

                         DICKIE
               That's good.

                         RIPLEY
               I've got plans!

                         DICKIE
               Ripley's plans.

                         RIPLEY
               Esatto. I'm always planning.

                         DICKIE
               Did I know you at Princeton, Tom? I
               didn't, did I?

                         RIPLEY
               Why are you asking all of a sudden?

                         DICKIE
               No reason. Because you're leaving, I
               guess. I don't think you were there, were
               you?

                         RIPLEY
               Why?

                         DICKIE
               I mean it as a compliment. You've got
               such great taste, I don't know. Most of
               the thugs at Princeton had tasted
               everything and had no taste. Used to say,
               the cream of America: rich and thick.
               Freddie's the perfect example.

                         RIPLEY
               Then I'll take it as a compliment.

                         DICKIE
               I knew it! I had a bet with Marge!

                         RIPLEY
                   (a beat)
               Ha.

                         DICKIE
               Do you even like jazz - or was that
               something for my benefit?

                         RIPLEY
                   (conceding, without guile)
               I've gotten to like it. I've gotten to
               like everything about the way you live.
               It's one big love affair. If you knew my
               life back home in New York...

     Dickie's distracted by the drummer who's playing an extrovert
     solo, doesn't hear the confession of love.

                         DICKIE
               I'm thinking of giving up the sax, what
               do you think about drums?

                         RIPLEY
               What?

                         DICKIE
               So cool.

     He mimes a high-hat and snare. Ripley can't quite credit this
     - it's superficiality.

     EXT. MID OCEAN. DAY.

     The bay of San Remo. DICKIE and RIPLEY have hired a motor 
     boat.

                         DICKIE
               That's how I found my place in Mongi.
               Took a boat out round the bay.  The first
               place I liked, I got it.

     The motor boat is ploughing the waves. Dickie exhilarated by
     the speed.

                         RIPLEY
               Dickie, slow down, come on!

     Ripley grips the oar, his knuckles white. Dickie cuts the
     motor, and the boat slows to a crawl, miles from the shore.

                         DICKIE
                   (ecstatic)
               I love it here! Gonna live here!

     Dickie takes off his jacket, then drums against the edge of
     the boat, developing a rhythm with his lighter and fingers,
     already on the way to becoming Buddy Rich.

                         RIPLEY
               I wanted to tell you my plan.

                         DICKIE
               So tell me.

                         RIPLEY
               I thought I might come back. In the New
               Year. Under my own steam.

                         DICKIE
                   (suddenly tight)
               Really?  To Italy?

                         RIPLEY
               Of course. Let's say, for argument's
               sake, you were here - perhaps we could
               split the rent on a house - I'll get a
               job - or, better still, I could get a
               place in Rome and when we're there we
               could be there and if we're here we could
               be here -

                         DICKIE
               Oh God, I don't think so.

                         RIPLEY
               - you see, particularly with the Marge
               problem, you can just blame me.

                         DICKIE
               Marge and I are getting married.

                         RIPLEY
                   (appalled)
               How?

                         DICKIE
               How?

                         RIPLEY
               Yesterday you're ogling girls on the
               terrace, today you're getting married.
               It's absurd.

                         DICKIE
               I love Marge.

                         RIPLEY
               You love me and you're not marrying me.

                         DICKIE
                   (cold)
               Tom, I don't love you.

                         RIPLEY
               No, no, it's not a threat, I've explained
               all of that.

                         DICKIE
               I'm actually a little relieved you're
               going, to be honest. I think we've seen
               enough of each other for a while.

     Ripley stares at him, his eyes suddenly reptilian.

                         RIPLEY
               What?

                         DICKIE
               You can be a leech - you know this - and
               it's boring. You can be quite boring.

                         RIPLEY
                   (volcanic)
               The funny thing - I'm not pretending to
               be somebody else and you are. I'm
               absolutely honest with you. I've told you
               my feelings. But you, first of all I know
               there's something - that evening when we
               played chess, for instance, it was
               obvious -

                         DICKIE
                   (incredulous)
               What evening?

                         RIPLEY
               Sure - I know, that's too dangerous for
               you, fair enough, hey! we're brothers,
               fine, then you do this sordid thing with
               Marge, fucking her on the boat while we
               all have to listen, which was
               excruciating, frankly, plus you follow
               your cock around like a - and now you're
               getting married! I'm bewildered, forgive
               me...you're lying to Marge then getting
               married to her, you're knocking up
               Silvana, you've got to play sax, you've
               got to play drums, which is it, Dickie,
               what do you really play?

     Dickie, furious, gets up, and lurches towards Ripley.

                         DICKIE
                   (attacking him, administering
                    tiny slaps as punctuation to
                    his tirade)
               Who are you - some imposter, some third
               class mooch - who are you to tell me
               anything? Actually, I really really
               really don't want to be on this boat with
               you, I can't move without you moving,
               which is exactly how it feels and it
               gives me the creeps.
                   (he goes to rev up the engine)
               I can't move without - "Dickie, Dickie,
               Dickie" - like a little girl.  You give
               me the -

     RIPLEY SMASHES HIM ACROSS THE HEAD WITH THE OAR. DICKIE SLIPS
     OFF THE WOODEN SEAT, HIS EYES ROLLING IN GROGGY SURPRISE.

                         RIPLEY
               Shut up! Just shut up! Just shut up!

     The boat slows as Dickie releases the tiller.  Dickie looks
     up at Ripley wearily and slides onto his back.

                         DICKIE
               For God's sake.

     Ripley, shocked at himself, goes to Dickie, rocking the boat,
     catches him up, then is horrified to see Dickie's face,
     apparently unmarked, SUDDENLY SPLIT OPEN, a line of blood and
     then a peeling like a fruit bursting. Ripley's appalled.  A
     terrible roar issues from Dickie as he launches himself at
     Ripley.

                         DICKIE (cont'd)
               I'll kill you!

     Ripley finds himself pushing him away, picking up the oar,
     kicking off Dickie's hand around his ankle. The boat is
     rocking and swerving crazily as Dickie falls against the
     tiller. Ripley almost loses his balance. His glasses come
     off. They struggle, locked together in a life or death
     wrestle to get control of the oar. Dickie's blinded by his
     own blood, loses his grip.

     Ripley, terrified, hits Dickie again and again, the oar like
     a carpet-beater banging down flat, blood on the blade, blood
     on Ripley, until he's on his knees, heaving for breath,
     letting his arm drop, then realizing, disgusted, that he's
     let it rest in a pool of blood. He starts to sob, sprawls
     there, sobbing, next to Dickie, horrified by what he's done.

     Nobody's in sight.  The boat rocks, gently, the sun sparkling
     indifferently on the waves.  Ripley lies by Dickie in the
     bottom of the boat, in the embrace he's always wanted.

     The pretty blue-and-white boat rocks peacefully.  The sea
     calms.

     EXT. A COVE NEAR SAN REMO. AFTERNOON.

     A deserted cove, several miles along the coast. Ripley
     clambers onto a rock over the shore.  He's watching the boat
     slowly sinking. Shuddering from the exertion, the cold, he
     finds Dickie's jacket, puts it on and watches as the boat
     disappears under the surface.

     EXT. SAN REMO. DUSK.

     Ripley walks back towards the hotel, still wearing Dickie's
     jacket, cold and wet, his bag over his shoulder.

     INT. HOTEL LOBBY. EARLY EVENING.

     Ripley approaches the front desk.  He's shivering.  He's not
     wearing his glasses.

                         RIPLEY
               Can I have my key, please?

                         RECEPTIONIST
                   (at the key rack)
               Of course - But you must be very cold?
               Signor Greenleaf?  Yes? -

                         RIPLEY
                   (mind racing)
               No, it's - I'm...

     EXT. ROAD BETWEEN NAPLES AND MONGIBELLO. DAY.

     Ripley sits on the bus as it rumbles towards Mongi.  He
     stares out of the window, full of what he's done. No idea
     what to do.

     EXT. MONGIBELLO, FISHERMAN'S WHARF. DAY.

     The BUS comes into town. Ripley gets out, looks calm, very
     together.

     INT. DICKIE'S LIVING ROOM, MONGIBELLO. DAY.

     Ripley walks into the living room, slowly approaches
     Dickie's saxophone which is on its stand on the table.  He
     can't get close to it, it evokes Dickie too much.

     INT. DICKIE'S LIVING ROOM. DAY.

     Ripley has Dickie's Hermes Baby typewriter on the desk and is
     busy writing letters. He has finished a letter to the
     Greenleafs, now he's at the end of one to Marge. We can read
     part of it - C/O American Express, Rome 9 November 1958. Dear
     Marge, this is a difficult letter for me to write... Ripley
     produces the Shakespeare and Signature page and COPIES
     DICKIE'S SIGNATURE at the end of the letter.

     EXT. MARGE'S GARDEN, MONGIBELLO. DAY.

     Ripley stands at the entrance to Marge's garden where she is
     working at her book on the outside table, surrounded by
     references and notes, held down by bricks. He looks at her
     until she looks at him. She's startled, gasps.

                         RIPLEY
               Hello Marge.

                         MARGE
               Tom, you startled me!  You're back.

                         RIPLEY
               How are you? Sorry. Is your book going
               well?

                         MARGE
               Yes - I'm on a good streak, thanks.

                         RIPLEY
               I was just looking at you -
                   (looking at her tenderly)
               - so quiet.

                         MARGE
               Where's Dickie?

                         RIPLEY
               I think he's planning on staying in Rome
               for a few days.

                         MARGE
                   (looks at him)
               Ha. Did he say why?

                         RIPLEY
               I don't know. I don't understand Dickie,
               Marge, so your guess is as good as mine.

                         MARGE
               What does that mean?

                         RIPLEY
               Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the
               next day I'm not, one day we're all one
               family, the next day he wants to be
               alone. You tell me.

                         MARGE
               Is that what he said - he wanted to be
               alone?

                         RIPLEY
               He was thinking of you, Marge - he asked
               me to deliver this.

     He hands her a package. She pulls at it, it's perfume.

                         MARGE
               Thanks. he knows I love this, although
               why it couldn't have waited...

                         RIPLEY
               Errand number one - deliver Marge's
               perfume. Errand number two, pack some
               clothes and his precious saxophone.

                         MARGE
                   (alarmed)
               How long's he staying for?

                         RIPLEY
               Search me. I guess we're abandoned.

     EXT. MONGIBELLO, BEACH. EARLY MORNING.

     Marge is walking along the beach and out onto the jetty,
     forlorn, a bleached figure on this winter morning.

     INT. OFF FROM DICKIE'S LIVING ROOM. MORNING.

     As Ripley walks down the stairs, Marge is at the icebox in
     the living room. She's fixing herself a drink, has the icebox
     open for ice. She's ashen, and might have been weeping, walks
     back into the kitchen area.

                         MARGE
               There was a letter from Dickie in with my
               perfume. You realize it's more than a few
               days? He's thinking of moving to Rome.

     She bangs out the ice onto the counter, cubes falling
     everywhere. Ripley drops to the floor and starts to clear
     them up.  She's got the letter, shows it to Ripley. He puts
     fresh ice into her glass.

                         MARGE (cont'd)
               The thing is, the night before he left,
               we talked about moving, together, going
               North - and I suppose I put some pressure
               on him, about getting married, I just
               might have scared him off. There's a side
               to him, when our heads are on the pillow,
               I know no-one else sees it, which is
               really tender.
                   (unravelling)
               I think I should come with you to Rome
               and just confront him.

     Ripley lights a cigarette.  Marge loses confidence.

                         MARGE (cont'd)
               He hates being confronted.

                         RIPLEY
               I think you're right.

     INT. ALBERGO GOLDONI, ROME. DAY.

     RIPLEY'S BATTERED CASES are carried into the tiny lobby of
     this small hotel. He exchanges his passport at the desk for
     his room key, then makes his way, carrying his own luggage to
     the metal cage elevator. THIS SCENE INTERCUTS WITH:

     INT. HOTEL GRAND. DAY.

     DICKIE'S ARRAY OF LEATHER LUGGAGE is pulled along on a 
     baggage trolley by a liveried PORTER.

     Dickie's passport slides across the marble desk. A key comes
     back, collected by a hand sporting Dickie's two distinctive
     rings.  As ALDO, the Front Desk Manager, inspects the
     passport, he looks at the owner.  Ripley wears a terrific
     suit, his hair parted in the Greenleaf style, no glasses. His
     voice, when he speaks, has the same, lazy, confident drawl.

                         ALDO
               Welcome back, Signor Greenleaf.

                         RIPLEY
                   (walking away)
               Thank you.

     INT. RIPLEY'S SUITE, GRAND. DAY.

     The PORTER takes the cases and opens them as Ripley walks
     around the suite. It's large and splendid. Ripley breathes in
     its opulence.  He immediately picks up the telephone.

                         RIPLEY
               Yes, I'd like you to telephone the Hotel
               Goldoni. Yes. I want to speak to Signor
               Thomas Ripley - No Ripley, R, yes.
               Grazie.

     He produces Dickie's pen and signs the blotter quickly - H R
     Greenleaf.  Then he pulls out a postcard from the writing
     case to reveal Dickie's Stars, hide your fires handwriting
     specimen. He compares the two signatures, is pleased.

     The telephone rings.

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
               Pronto? Signor Ripley is not there? I'd
               like to leave a message. Yes. Please call
               Dickie - Dickie Greenleaf - at the Grand.

     INT. RIPLEY'S HOTEL ROOM, GOLDONI. DAY.

     A tiny, cell of a room, single bed. Ripley on the phone.

                         RIPLEY
               He's not there?  Very well. I'll leave a
               message - Got your call. Dinner tonight
               sounds fine. Ripley.
                   (listens as it's read back)
               Dinner tonight, yes, is okay. Yes, thank
               you.

     INT. GUCCI STORE, ROME. DAY.

     Ripley has bought some more LEATHER GOODS - a briefcase and
     overnight bag. He is at the counter, signing checks.

                         RIPLEY
               I'd like these to have my initials -
               embossed, I don't know the word in
               Italian ...embossed?

                         GUCCI ASSISTANT
               Embossed, of course, Signor Greenleaf.

     There's an excited rap on the window and a shout of DICKIE!
     Shocked, Ripley looks over to find MEREDITH LOGUE outside,
     alone and delighted to see him.  He grins and mouths hello.

                         MEREDITH
                   (entering the shop)
               Dickie! Oh my God!  Ciao.

     EXT. ACROSS PIAZZA NAVONA TO ARCARI'S CAFE. DAY.

     Ripley and Meredith walk across the Piazza towards the cafe.

                         MEREDITH
               But you're going skiing with us Yankees,
               aren't you?

                         RIPLEY
               What?

                         MEREDITH
               At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie
               Miles and -

                         RIPLEY
                   (interrupting, astonished)
               How did you know that?

                         MEREDITH
               Everybody knows Freddie Miles.

                         RIPLEY
                   (unsettled)
               Is Freddie in Rome?

                         MEREDITH
               Now? I don't think so. But I've met him,
               of course, and we've chatted and I know
               about you and Marge and Mongi and what an
               unreliable rat you are. Freddie said you
               were a rat and I thought to myself now I
               know why he travels under R.

                         RIPLEY
               I've left Marge, Meredith. And Mongi. So
               the rat's here now, in Rome.

                         MEREDITH
               Sorry, I wouldn't have made a joke if -

                         RIPLEY
               Don't be sorry. I've never been happier.
               I feel like I've been handed a new life.

     EXT. AMERICAN EXPRESS OFFICE, ROME. DAY.

     Meredith and Ripley walk down the Spanish Steps and head
     inside the office.

                         MEREDITH
               The truth is if you've had money your
               entire life, even if you despise it,
               which we do - agreed? - you're only truly
               comfortable around other people who have
               it and despise it.

                         RIPLEY
               I know.

                         MEREDITH
               I've never admitted that to anyone.

     INT. AMERICAN EXPRESS OFFICE, ROME. DAY.

     Ripley's signing Dickie's allowance receipt. Meredith is with
     him, signing her own counterfoil. He is, of course, endorsed
     by her presence.  She goes to the window ahead of him.

     She takes her money, turns to him.

     He hands over his documents. The Clerk compares Ripley's
     signature with the one on the passport and then looks up at
     him. Ripley is cool as a cucumber.

                         RIPLEY
               I don't want too many large bills. Nobody
               will change them.

     INT. RIPLEY'S SUITE, GRAND. ANOTHER DAY.

     Where A TAILOR is finishing the fitting of a cashmere jacket
     for Ripley. Bolts of cloth everywhere as Meredith adjudicates
     the possible materials, which the tailor holds up against
     Ripley.

                         MEREDITH
               Show me the other one again.
                   (the Tailor obliges)
               I like them both.

                         RIPLEY
               I'll take them both.

     Ripley goes inside the bedroom to change. While he's inside,
     Meredith shows the Tailor out.  As she returns she notices
     the open sax case, peers inside.

                         MEREDITH (O/S)
               I know you're a jazz fiend but do you
               absolutely hate the Opera?  I've been
               trying to give my tickets away, it's
               tomorrow, but if you were prepared to be
               dragged...

     She looks up to catch him bare-chested. She's intoxicated by
     him, the romance she feels to be in the air.

                         RIPLEY
                   (emerging)
               You could drag me.

     INT. THE OPERA HOUSE, ROME.

     On stage is Act Two of Eugene Onegin.  Lensky sings his aria
     before the duel with Onegin.

     Ripley's in a tuxedo, in a box which includes a glamorous
     Meredith and her AUNT AND UNCLE.  He knows what comes next.
     Lensky is shot by Onegin. Blood pours from his neck into the
     snow.  Onegin, horrified at the death of his friend, goes
     over, wraps Lensky in his cloak, the silk lining flashing,
     kneels holding him... Ripley can barely hide his emotion...
     Meredith watches her sensitive friend, entranced.

     INT. OUTSIDE THE BOXES, OPERA HOUSE, ROME.

     The Interval.  Ripley and Meredith exit their box with
     Meredith's Aunt and Uncle (who heads for the interval
     drinks).

                         RIPLEY
               Thanks so much for inviting me tonight.

                         JOAN
               Can you bear it?  We hear you're a friend
               of Freddie's - he has I hate Opera
               tattooed on his chest.

                         RIPLEY
               There's room for a whole libretto on
               Freddie's chest.

                         JOAN
                   (laughs)
               I'm sure we've met.

     They reach the console where Uncle Ted has their drinks.

                         JOAN (cont'd)
               I was sure we'd met, weren't you, Ted?
               This is Herbert Greenleaf's boy.

                         RIPLEY
               Thanks, yes, I think we did.

                         JOAN
               One minute you people are children and
               the next you're getting tattooed.

     INT. OPERA HOUSE, FOYER. NIGHT.

     Ripley heads past the Beautiful People on his hunt for the
     Men's Room, and walks straight into a young and cultured
     Englishman.  They greet each other and suddenly MARGE is
     beside them.

                         MARGE
                   (as if she's seen a ghost)
               Oh my God. Tom.

                         RIPLEY
               Marge, how are you? What are you doing in
               Rome?

                         MARGE
               Is he here? Are you with Dickie?

                         RIPLEY
               No.
                   (to Smith-Kingsley)
               Hello, I'm Tom Ripley.

                         PETER
               Peter Smith-Kingsley. I've heard about
               you, of course - from Marge, and Dickie.

                         MARGE
                   (works out what's strange)
               No glasses.

     He fishes out the glasses.

                         RIPLEY
                   (to Peter)
               Ditto.

                         PETER
               Where are you hiding him? He's
               impossible, isn't he?

                         MARGE
               Is he really not here?

                         RIPLEY
               Marge, you know Dickie has I hate Opera
               tattooed on his chest.

                         MARGE
               You were going to Venice.

                         PETER
               Yes, what happened? I heard you were
               desperate to come. I was looking forward
               to rowing you around.

                         RIPLEY
               I am.  I really am. And I've been
               travelling. I just can't seem to get that
               far north.

                         PETER
               Well hurry, before we sink.
                   (reaches into his jacket)
               Should I give you my telephone number in
               Venice?

                         RIPLEY
               Thanks.

     The INTERVAL BELL'S ringing. Peter hands over his card to
     Ripley, sees Meredith.

                         PETER
               Look there's Meredith thingy - who's
               that, Marge? - they're in textiles...
               Meredith -
                   (embarrassed at not
                    remembering)
               God, how awful, I've spent Christmas in
               her house...!

                         MARGE
               I don't know her.
                   (to Ripley)
               He hasn't called, he's hardly written,
               just these cryptic notes. You don't just
               dump people.

     The last INTERVAL BELL. There's a mini-stampede to return.

                         PETER
               Will we see you later?

                         RIPLEY
               I can't later.

                         PETER
               And tomorrow?

                         RIPLEY
               Tomorrow's possible. Do you know
               Dinelli's? Piazza di Spagna?

                         PETER
               I know the Piazza di Spagna. What time?

                         RIPLEY
               Ten thirty?

                         PETER
               We'll be there.

                         RIPLEY
               Okay. Marge, see you tomorrow.
                   (to Peter)
               It's really good to meet you.

     INT. BOX, OPERA HOUSE. NIGHT.

     Ripley goes straight to Meredith and grabs her.

                         RIPLEY
               Let's go.

                         MEREDITH
               I thought you were enjoying yourself?

                         RIPLEY
               Let's take a Carozza and look at the
               moon.

                         MEREDITH
               You're crazy! It's freezing out there.

     He's looking past her, where a mirror reflects Marge wading
     through the audience, Peter's elegant head getting
     dangerously near as they approach their seats.

                         RIPLEY
               C'mon, I need to talk to you. Just the
               two of us.

                         MEREDITH
                   (quite taken)
               Okay then, you're crazy.

     EXT. CAROZZA, ROME. NIGHT.

     Meredith shivers in the raw night as they cross the Tiber.
     Ripley as Dickie is confessing his heart belongs to Marge.

                         MEREDITH
               Don't worry. Really. Don't worry.

                         RIPLEY
               You're such a pal to understand. It's as
               if Marge is here now - I look at you and
               I see her face - and I can't, whatever
               I'm feeling towards you - I just can't...

                         MEREDITH
               No, I absolutely understand. Of course.

                         RIPLEY
               Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.

                         MEREDITH
               Beating you away.

     EXT. MEREDITH'S APARTMENT, ROME.

     They arrive at the courtyard outside Meredith's Apartment
     Building. Ripley jumps down, collects her. She makes to go
     inside, then looks at him.

                         MEREDITH
               Will you meet me tomorrow?  Just to say
               goodbye in the daylight, properly? So
               it's not just this, it's too...you should
               always save pain for daylight...

                         RIPLEY
               Oh Meredith, I'm sorry. Of course I'll
               meet you. Let's have coffee in the
               morning at Dinelli's.

                         MEREDITH
                   (fluttering)
               I don't - is that by the Spanish Steps?

                         RIPLEY
               Exactly. 10.30 -
                   (instantly correcting himself)
               10.15.

     He gets back into the carozza. It moves off.

     EXT. DINELLI'S CAFE, PIAZZA DI SPAGNA. MORNING.

     Meredith sits waiting in a cafe at the bottom of the Spanish
     Steps. Ripley, dressed as Ripley, is at the top of the steps,
     among early tourists, watching as she drinks her coffee at an
     outside table. Then Marge and Peter appear walking up the Via
     Condotti, head for another table, don't see Meredith.  She
     acknowledges Peter who hasn't noticed her.

                         MEREDITH
               Peter? Hello, it's Meredith Logue.

                         PETER
               Of course it is, Meredith, hello, I'm
               sorry, half-asleep, how are you? This is
               Marge Sherwood. Meredith Logue.

                         MARGE
               Hello.

     Hearing Marge's name Meredith reacts, freezes.

                         PETER
               Join us, won't you? We're just waiting
               for a friend. Do you know, I wonder did
               we see you at the Opera last night?

                         MEREDITH
               I won't actually, although I think this
               might - are you waiting for Dickie?

                         PETER
               Well no, as it happens, although...

                         MARGE
                   (stunned at the mention of his
                    name)
               Dickie? Do you know Dickie?

                         MEREDITH
               You were at the Opera? Well, that
               explains - yes I was there. I was there
               with Dickie.

                         MARGE
                   (to Peter)
               I told you! I knew it!

                         MEREDITH
                   (moving over to them)
               Marge, I don't know you, so I have no
               right, but Dickie loves you.  He's - I
               think you'll find he's coming home to
               you.

                         MARGE
                   (proprietorial)
               How would you know that?

                         MEREDITH
               He told me everything. I was supposed to
               meet him fifteen minutes ago, so I...I'm
               going to go now, I think. Unless he meant
               us to meet - which would be a little
               cruel, wouldn't it?

                         PETER
               No, we're meeting another friend. Tom
               Ripley.

                         MARGE
               Do you know Tom?

                         MEREDITH
               Ripley? No. I heard about him, of course,
               but no, I didn't meet him.

     The WAITER has arrived to take orders. Meredith indicates
     she's leaving.

                         MEREDITH (cont'd)
               Not for me. No, grazie.

     Marge is on the edge. Peter lays a hand to comfort her.

                         MEREDITH (cont'd)
               I hope I didn't complicate matters, but
               nothing, nothing untoward happened,
               nothing to prevent you from welcoming him
               back, from marrying him...Goodbye.
               Goodbye Peter, please don't get up.

     Peter gets up. Ripley, from his vantage point at the top of
     the steps, watches Meredith leave and walk off into the
     crowd. He begins the slow walk down towards the square. As he
     becomes visible to the cafe, he starts to hurry. He's
     apologising to Marge and Peter as they see him, in his
     element, lying and believing in his lie.

                         RIPLEY
               Sorry, sorry. Had to renew my papers.
               Italian bureaucracy - never one stamp
               when they can make you line up for three.
               Have you been waiting long?

                         PETER
               Not at all. Morning Tom.

                         RIPLEY
               Hi.
                   (to Marge)
               Sorry. You okay? You look as if you've
               seen a ghost...

                         MARGE
               Dickie was at the Opera last night.

                         RIPLEY
               I don't believe it. Wild horses wouldn't
               drag Dickie to -

                         MARGE
               He was there with someone. So I suppose
               she must have dragged him - that's not
               fair.  I'm going back to Mongi. I think
               Dickie's coming home.
                   (to Peter)
               I'm going to go home.

                         RIPLEY
               Really? That's swell. No, I was just -
               you're way ahead of me! Great!

                         PETER
               We think he's had a change of heart.
                   (to Marge)
               So we should be celebrating.

                         MARGE
               I hope so.

                         PETER
                   (to Marge)
               That was moving, wasn't it? When Meredith
               said -
                   (to Ripley)
               Meredith's the American girl I saw last
               night, I know her, at the Opera, she's
               been seeing something of Dickie -

                         RIPLEY
               My God.

                         PETER
               But the point is Dickie - well we know
               this - Dickie loves Marge and he misses
               her and apparently he's come to his
               senses...

                         RIPLEY
               It's fantastic.
                   (to Peter)
               I feel guilty. Marge doesn't understand
               this, but anytime Dickie does something I
               feel guilty.

     INT. APARTMENT, PALAZZA GIOIA. DAY.

     Ripley is being shown an APARTMENT FOR RENT in the Palazzo
     Gioia by a dry-witted older woman, SIGNORA BUFFI. Ripley
     explores, relishing the decor.

                         SIGNORA BUFFI
               Accendo il riscaldamento.
               (I'll turn the heating on.)

                         RIPLEY
                   (mimes playing sax)
               Mi piace suonare.
               (I like to play music.)

                         SIGNORA BUFFI
                   (shrugs)
               Io sono sorda. Quelli di sotto, una
               coppia, sono sordi. Allora, ti piace?
               (I'm deaf. The couple below are deaf. So,
               do you like it?)

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. AFTERNOON.

     Ripley is in the apartment, fire burning, wearing pyjamas.
     There's a small Christmas tree. He kneels on the floor with
     some festive, gift-wrapped packages. He opens a package. It's
     a marble head of Hadrian. A gasp from Ripley. He picks up a
     glass, pours himself a drink.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. LATE AFTERNOON.

     Ripley plunges into Bach's Italian Concerto on his new and
     precious toy, a STEINWAY GRAND. His doorbell rings. He stops
     playing. He doesn't get visitors. He rises, a little nervous.

                         RIPLEY
               Hello?

                         FREDDIE (O/S)
               Dickie?

                         RIPLEY
               Who is it?

                         FREDDIE (O/S)
               It's Freddie. Let me in.

     RIPLEY ALMOST COLLAPSES. He's faint.

                         FREDDIE (O/S)
               Dickie, come on, it's me.

     Ripley can't think what to hide, where to hide. He opens the
     door.

                         RIPLEY
               Hello, Freddie, it's Tom, Tom Ripley.

                         FREDDIE
                   (confused, not pleasantly)
               Oh hello, where's Dickie? How are you?

                         RIPLEY
               Yes, I'm good, thank you. Dickies at
               dinner. He's at Otello's. Do you know it?

                         FREDDIE
               I don't think he's at dinner at 6.30pm.
               If you said he was still at lunch I'd
               believe you. Incredible. The guy has
               disappeared off the face of the earth.

                         RIPLEY
               I guess.

                         FREDDIE
               The landlady - as far as I could tell,
               the landlady said he was here right now.

                         RIPLEY
               He's gone to dinner! Search the place. I
               can't think why you would imagine Dickie
               would hide from you.

                         FREDDIE
               Because he's been hiding from me - what
               happened at Christmas?

                         RIPLEY
               What about Christmas?

                         FREDDIE
               He was supposed to come skiing. I didn't
               get a cable or a call or a note or,
               frankly, a fart.

     Ripley has his hands behind his back. HE'S TUGGING
     FRANTICALLY AT DICKIE'S RINGS. Ripley wanders into the
     kitchen, turns on the tap to sluice his fingers.

                         RIPLEY (O/S)
               Of course, he's been very involved in his
               music, hasn't he? I think his theory is,
               you know, you have to go into a cocoon
               before you can become a butterfly.

                         FREDDIE
               Which is horseshit.  Have you heard him
               play that thing?
                   (gesturing at the sax on its
                    stand)
               He can't.

                         RIPLEY (O/S)
                   (casually)
               How did you find him? It's such an out of
               the way apartment. Can I fix you a drink?

                         FREDDIE
               No thanks.
                   (explaining his detective work)
               Some kid at the American Express Office.
                   (he starts to explore)
               Are you living here?

     Now he starts to hammer a nasty boogie-woogie on the piano.

                         RIPLEY
                   (returning, flinching)
               No. No, I'm staying here for a few days,
               in Rome.  That's a new piano, so you prob -

                         FREDDIE (O/S)
               Did this place come furnished? It doesn't
               look like Dickie. Horrible isn't it? - so
               bourgeois.

     Now he's poking at the Hadrian bust.

                         RIPLEY
               You should watch that!

                         FREDDIE
               In fact the only thing which looks like
               Dickie is you.

                         RIPLEY
               Hardly.

                         FREDDIE
               Have you done something to your hair?

     Ripley starts to smile, his eyes darting around the room.

                         RIPLEY
               Freddie, do you have something to say?

                         FREDDIE
               What? I think I'm saying it. Something's
               going on. He's either converted to
               Christianity - or to something else.

                         RIPLEY
               I suggest you ask Dickie that yourself.
               Otello's is on delle Croce, just off the
               Corso.

                         FREDDIE
               Is it on "delle Croce, just off the
               Corso"? You're a quick study, aren't you?
               Last time you didn't know your ass from
               your elbow, now you're giving me
               directions. That's not fair, you probably
               do know your ass from your elbow. I'll
               see you.

     AND HE'S GONE. Ripley shuts the door, smooths the silk runner
     on the table where Freddie's hand had rucked it. He goes back
     to the door, opens it and looks over the rail.

     INT. LANDING AND STAIRS, RIPLEY'S BUILDING. LATE DAY.

     FREDDIE IS BACK IN CONVERSATION WITH SIGNORA BUFFI. Ripley
     can't make out the text but there's some discussion about
     Signor Greenleaf and Signor Ripley. Ripley hurries inside as
     Freddie's heavy shoes start to clump up the stairs again.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT, ROME. LATE DAY.

     Freddie knocks on the door which pushes open. As he marches
     in, he launches into his interrogation.

                         FREDDIE
               Ripley? There's someth -

     - AND WALKS STRAIGHT INTO THE HEAD OF HADRIAN WHICH RIPLEY
     SWINGS AT HIM, HOLDING ON AWKWARDLY WITH BOTH HANDS TO THE
     HEAVY MARBLE SCULPTURE.

     Freddie falls like an ox, first to his knees, groaning, then
     to the floor as Ripley brings the head down again, beating
     him downwards. As Freddie slumps away, Ripley loses his
     balance and the head sends Freddie a glancing blow before
     slipping from Ripley's grasp and smashing on to the floor.
     THE NOSE IS CHIPPED OFF.

     EXT. PALAZZO GIOIA. NIGHT.

     It's deserted. Ripley hauls Freddie out of the shadows
     towards the car. A couple walk across the square. Ripley
     talks to Freddie, berating him for his drunken stupor. He
     pushes him over the door and into the passenger seat.

                         RIPLEY
                   (mimicking Freddie's voice)
               Hey, if I'm drunk, think what her
               husband's saying.

     EXT. VIA APPIA ANTICA. NIGHT.

     The Fiat noses along THE APPIAN WAY. Black fragments of tombs
     punctuate either side of the poorly lit road. Inside the car,
     Ripley looks to left and right for a place to dump the body.
     He slows near a clump of trees.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT, ROME. EVENING.

     Someone is KNOCKING urgently at the door. Ripley opens it,
     finds himself face to face with Signora Buffi and TWO
     POLICEMEN. One of them offers his hand.

                         ROVERINI
               Dickie Greenleaf?

                         RIPLEY
               Yes?

                         ROVERINI
               Inspector Roverini. Can we come in?

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. EVENING.

     Ripley sits with his head in his hands at the table. Roverini
     and his sergeant, BAGGIO, watch patiently.

                         ROVERINI
               It's a terrible shock, eh? What time did
               Signor Miles leave yesterday?

                         RIPLEY
               I can't be absolutely sure - 8? 9? We'd
               both taken on far too many drinks - but
               it was dark, it was certainly dark when I
               walked him down to his car.

                         ROVERINI
               So Signor Miles drove away and you did
               what?

                         RIPLEY
               I went to bed. Freddie's a big man, but
               I'm in trouble after a couple of drinks.
               I've suffered all day. Who found him?

     Roverini has walked over to the bust of Hadrian.

                         ROVERINI
               Senta.  We have to ask you to stay in
               Rome.

                         RIPLEY
               Yes, if it's going to help, certainly.

                         ROVERINI
               So, the Doctor, he has to make the -
                   (looks at Baggio)
               - come se dice?

                         RIPLEY
               Postmortem?

                         ROVERINI
               Yes, exactly, but his first, his first
               conclusion was that Signor Miles was
               killed not later than seven o'clock
               yesterday evening.

                         RIPLEY
               Well, he certainly wasn't dead when he
               drove off in his car.

                         ROVERINI
               No.

     EXT. NARROW STREET, THE GHETTO, ROME. MORNING.

     Ripley comes through a dark tunnel in the Ghetto on his
     scooter. He drives past a furniture store, DRESSING TABLES
     AND MIRRORS spilling out onto the street. He glances
     sideways, sees his reflection fractured into several images
     and, for an instant, it seems AS IF DICKIE'S THERE
     WATCHING HIM. Ripley screams and swerves, crashing into the
     pavement, the scooter falling onto him and pulling him along
     the cobbled passage. The man he thought to be Dickie, an
     Italian, runs up concerned.

     EXT. AMERICAN EXPRESS, PIAZZA DI SPAGNA. DAY.

     Ripley emerges from the American Express Office. Across the
     street at the cafe, as once before, sits Marge. Ripley slips
     Dickie's bag into his knapsack as he approaches his scooter.
     Marge spots him and strides across the piazza. She is in no
     mood for pleasantries.

                         MARGE
               Did he kill Freddie?

                         RIPLEY
               Marge, when did you get here?

                         MARGE
               Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?

                         RIPLEY
               I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.

                         MARGE
               I tried again, waiting here, watching for
               him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look
               for Dickie I find you.

                   (focusing on Ripley's cuts and
                    bruises)
               What happened to your face?

                         RIPLEY
               Dickie did it.

                         MARGE
                   (suddenly tense)
               Dickie?

                         RIPLEY
               My face! There was an argument. I said
               some things I shouldn't have.  About you.
               About the appalling way he's treating
               you, all of us.  And the next thing I
               know he's launched himself at me.
                   (he pulls the scooter off the
                    stand)
               Are you getting on?

                         MARGE
               What?

                         RIPLEY
               Get on. I'll take you to him.

     EXT. SQUARE OF THE PALAZZO GIOIA. DAY.

     Ripley and Marge come round the corner on the scooter. The
     entrance to the Palazzo is blocked by a couple of police cars.
     Inspector Roverini emerges from one of them. Ripley,
     startled, drives straight past the entrance.

     EXT. ROME STREET, BY THE RIVER. DAY.

     Ripley pulls up several hundred yards later, in a different
     piazza full of book stalls.  Marge is confused.

                         MARGE
               Where does Dickie live?

                         RIPLEY
               We passed it a few blocks back, where the
               police were. The Palazzo Gioia. They
               don't even know I'm in Rome and I'm not
               going to incriminate Dickie -

                         MARGE
               Perhaps I shouldn't go either.

                         RIPLEY
                   (thinking hard, distracted)
               No, well go if you want to, but don't
               talk to the Police about my face - they
               find out he hit me - he's got a temper - he
               could've hit Freddie.
                   (sincerely)
               Good luck, Marge. I'll catch up with you
               later.

     And he drives off. At the first opportunity HE DOUBLES BACK
     and roars towards the Palazzo.

     EXT. SQUARE OF THE PALAZZO GIOIA. AFTERNOON.

     Ripley drives towards the entrance.  As Ripley gets off and
     pushes his scooter through the doorway SOME JOURNALISTS,
     LOITERING INSIDE A BARBER'S SHOP come running out and swarm
     around him with questions about Freddie. One of them gets off
     a photograph.  It's chaos, a Police Officer shouts him away
     as Ripley puts up a protective hand and runs inside.

     INT. ENTRANCE AND STAIRS, PALAZZO GIOIA. CONTINUOUS.

     As Ripley hurries inside he encounters officers conducting
     more thorough forensic investigations in the stairwell. On a
     landing is Roverini. Ripley hurries towards him.

                         RIPLEY
               Can we go up? Do you mind?

                         ROVERINI
               Of course. What happened to your face?

                         RIPLEY
               My scooter. I fell off. Getting chased by
               photographers.

     He hurries up the stairs, Roverini in tow.

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
                   (agitated)
               The telephone, the press, I've been, I'm
               feeling hounded - do you think you could
               not give out my address?

                         ROVERINI
               Never. We've had many requests and, of
               course, we say no - even to your fiancÈe.

                         RIPLEY
               I really don't want to see anybody.

                         ROVERINI
               Even your fiancÈe...?

                         RIPLEY
               Even her.

                         ROVERINI
               What about Thomas Ripley?

                         RIPLEY
               What about Ripley?

     Ripley's way ahead and has reached the door of his apartment.
     He waits nervously for Roverini. He unlocks the door and can
     barely wait for Roverini to catch up.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. AFTERNOON.

     Roverini follows Ripley inside, Baggio hurries in behind him.

                         ROVERINI
               You and Signor Ripley went to San Remo,
               is that right?

     Ripley is appalled. He smiles.

                         RIPLEY
               Yes, sure, we did go to San Remo. That
               was months ago.

                         ROVERINI
               November, I thought.

                         RIPLEY
               Was it? Did you speak to Tom?

                         ROVERINI
               November 7th is my information.

                         RIPLEY
               I don't remember the exact date.

                         ROVERINI
               And when did you last see Signor Ripley?

                         RIPLEY
               A few days ago.

                         ROVERINI
               Does he stay with you here?

                         RIPLEY
               No!

                         ROVERINI
               No.  Here is a pattern. Two days ago
               Freddie Miles is dead - he leaves your
               apartment and is murdered. Yesterday a
               little boat is found in San Remo full of
               rocks, and the owner tells the Police it
               was stolen on November 7th. We look at
               hotel records and we see oh! Dickie
               Greenleaf is staying in San Remo and then
               our boatman remembers two Americans
               taking a boat.

                         RIPLEY
               It's not a pattern, it's a coincidence.
               There must be fifty hotels in San Remo,
               there must have been a hundred people
               renting a boat on that day.

                         ROVERINI
               31 people.

                         RIPLEY
               31 people.

     Baggio appears. Speaks to Roverini. Ripley is getting cranky.

                         ROVERINI
               That is Miss Sherwood now. Marge
               Sherwood.

                         RIPLEY
                   (appalled, defeated)
               Let her in, what's the difference?  Let
               her in.
                   (Baggio is on his way to the
                    door.)
               No, actually, no, I'd like it very much
               if you would ask her to come back later.

     Roverini nods, mutters to Baggio, who heads out.

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
               Thank you.

                         ROVERINI
                   (watching him)
               May I ask...why would you speak to your
               friend and not your fiancÈe?

                         RIPLEY
               I think I just said. Ripley was handling
               some business for me, nor does Mr Ripley
               want to marry me.  Nor did he ask me
               every day if I would marry him. And when.

                         ROVERINI
               Do you have a photograph of Signor
               Ripley?

                         RIPLEY
               I'm not in the habit of carrying around
               photographs of my male friends.

                         ROVERINI
               Now I think I have upset you. My English
               perhaps is coarse.

                         RIPLEY
               It is a little coarse, yes.

                         ROVERINI
               Sorry.  No-one has seen Signor Ripley
               since San -

                         RIPLEY
               I have!

                         ROVERINI
               You have, yes.

                         RIPLEY
               No, I have and so has Miss Sherwood, ask
               her! and if I could remember which hotel
               he was staying at - the Goldoni! - Tom
               was staying at the Goldoni.

                         ROVERINI
               Good. The Goldoni. Yes - you're right. A
               coincidence.
                   (he gets up to leave)
               I look forward to our next meeting when I
               will be more careful with my English and
               persuade you to play me your saxophone.
               Alto.

                         RIPLEY
               Absolutely.

                         ROVERINI
                   (suddenly turning)
               I have a witness who thinks they saw two
               men getting into Mr Miles' car. She
               wants to identify you in a - confronto -
               line-up.
                   (ominously)
               Tomorrow then?

                         RIPLEY
                   (thrown, scrabbling)
               Tomorrow.

     Ripley lets them out, heaves a heavy sigh, then peeps through
     the door, looks down to see Roverini speaking to Marge on the
     stairs.

                         ROVERINI (O/S)
               Buongiorno, Miss Sherwood.  He's in but I
               really don't think he wants to see
               anyone.

     Ripley leans against the door, the noose tightening, then
     suddenly a voice shocks him upright.

                         MARGE
               Dick? Dickie? I know you can hear me.
               What am I doing, chasing you around...?
               I was going to say I would count to three
               and if you didn't open the door, but I
               won't count any more. On you. I won't
               count on you any more. Whatever it is,
               whatever you've done or haven't done,
               you've broken my heart. That's one thing
               I know you're guilty of, and I don't know
               why, I don't know why, I just don't know
               why...

     Ripley listens, there's a silence, then Marge's footsteps as
     they ring out on the stone stairs. The tapping sound resolves
     into the tap-tap of a manual typewriter.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT, PALAZZO GIOIA. NIGHT.

     Ripley's at the typewriter, he begins to type.

                         RIPLEY (O/S)
               My dear Tom, I'm getting out of this.
               Freddie's death, Silvana. I've thought
               about going to the police, but I can't do
               it, I can't face it.  I can't face
               anything anymore...

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT, PALAZZO GIOIA. NIGHT.

     CHAOS.  Ripley is working quickly, selecting clothes,
     dividing them into TWO PILES - one for Dickie's trunk, one
     for his own battered suitcase. He puts the license plates
     from Freddie's car in Dickie's luggage. He has placed one
     shirt on the Ripley pile then checks again, and - on seeing
     Dickie's initials, places it with the bigger pile, then picks
     it up again and holds it briefly against his cheek.

     He takes Dickie's rings, opens up a LITTLE BOX of buttons and
     needles and cufflinks and sadly tosses them in. Dickie's
     leather writing case goes on the big pile, too, as do cuff
     links, ties, the Mont Blanc, Dickie's passport, which he
     opens to scratch at the photograph, obliterating the face.

                         RIPLEY (O/S)
               ...I wish I could give you the life I
               took for granted. You've always
               understood what's at the heart of me,
               Tom. Marge never could. I suppose that's
               why I'm writing this to you, the brother
               I never had. The only true friend I ever
               had. In all kinds of ways you're much
               more like the son my father always
               wanted. I realise you can change the
               people, change the scenery, but you can't
               change your own rotten self. Now I can't
               think what to do, or where to go. I'm
               haunted by everything I've done, and
               can't undo. I'm sorry, I can't go on.
               I've made a mess of being Dickie
               Greenleaf haven't I?

     He's finished the letter, signs it, puts it in an envelope
     marked Tom Ripley and places the letter on top of the piano
     next to Dickie's passport. His head is reflected in the
     distorting curve of the lid. As he puts on his glasses
     there's a moment when there are two heads slowly separating,
     as Ripley leaves behind his brief life as Dickie Greenleaf.

     INT. BASEMENT, PALAZZO GIOIA. NIGHT.

     Ripley carries Dickie's luggage down into THE COMMUNAL
     BASEMENT of the Gioia, a wretched place full of shadows and
     gloom and the overflow from thirty apartments. A red plush
     couch sits on top of a mound of furniture.  He finds some
     dustsheets and shoves the cases under them. Then Dickie's
     saxophone.

     Outside the small window, Ripley sees uniformed feet and the
     revolving blue light of a Police Car. He shrinks back, turns
     off the light and disappears into the dark, illuminated
     fitfully by the strobe of cold blue.

     EXT. BY THE PALAZZO GIOIA, ROME. NIGHT.

     Ripley, familiar battered luggage in tow, appears at the
     entrance of the building next to his own, glances at the
     police car parked opposite the big doors, then hurries off
     into the darkness.

     EXT. BY THE PALAZZO GIOIA. NIGHT.

     Ripley's briefly silhouetted as he scuttles down an alley,
     hurrying towards a gate, and disappears behind it.

     EXT. PIAZZALE ROMA, VENICE. DAWN.

     Ripley sits next to his battered luggage at the prow of a
     MOTOR TAXI as it surges towards Venice at dawn. Peter Smith-
     Kingsley waits on the quay. Ripley waves. Peter waves back.

                         PETER
                   (indicating the taxi stop)
               I'll see you over there!

     EXT. PIAZZA SAN MARCO, VENICE. EARLY MORNING.

     Ripley and Peter walk through the square, the pigeons
     scattering. Ripley breathes in the atmosphere, the beautiful
     grey.

                         RIPLEY
               Peter, I'm really sorry to put you
               through this. I just couldn't face going
               to the police by myself when my Italian's
               so rotten.

                         PETER
               Don't be daft. It's fine. I'm delighted
               you finally made it to Venice. I'm
               delighted, contrary to rumour, you're
               still in one piece?

                         RIPLEY
               What rumour?

                         PETER
               That Dickie murdered you and is
               travelling under your passport. I know,
               ridiculous.

     INT. POLICE STATION, VENICE. LATE DAY.

     Later.  Ripley sits in the middle of a bustling Police Station,
     where thefts, tourists, thieves and complaints are being
     processed.  The Station is in an old brewery or armory. It's a
     horrible, monochrome, oppressive place. Peter is in
     conversation at a desk, turns and walks over to where Ripley
     waits.

                         PETER
               Welcome to Venice.  This place reeks,
               doesn't it? Can you smell it?  Ugh.
               Sorry. Not the best way to spend your
               first day.

                         RIPLEY
               It's okay.

                         PETER
               Anyway I've got to the bottom of the
               delay. Finally.  We're waiting for
               someone from Rome.

                         RIPLEY
                   (completely thrown)
               What do you mean?  They're sending
               someone from Rome?

                         PETER
               That's good, isn't it?

                         RIPLEY
                   (as if suffocating)
               No, but I thought that didn't happen in
               Italy, that each region was completely
               separate! I was sure that was the -

                         PETER
               You've seen the papers, you know what a
               big deal it's been here. American tourist
               murdered -

                         RIPLEY
               It's ridiculous but now you've mentioned
               the stench I can hardly breathe.

     A door opens. COLONEL VERRECCHIA, fresh from Rome, and a
     sullen wedge of a man, comes in, scowling at the couple.
     Ripley dare not look up in case it's Roverini.  A POLICEMAN
     introduces him.

                         POLICEMAN
               Colonelo Verrecchia della Polizia di
               Roma.

                         VERRECCHIA
                   (to Peter, in Italian)
               Qui e Ripley?  Who is Ripley?

                         PETER
                   (in Italian)
               Lui. Him.

     Verrecchia strides past them and into a smaller, interview
     room at the back of the station.  His manner is ominous.

     INT. POLICE STATION, INTERVIEW ROOM, VENICE. LATE DAY.

     This room is not at all friendly. There is evidence of a
     locked area for cells at one wall.  A small, sour window
     gives onto a canal.  The main station is glimpsed through
     some internal windows. Peter and Ripley come through.

     Verrecchia sits down.  Verrecchia talks in staccato Italian,
     during which Peter translates.

                         VERRECCHIA
               Ho assunto io la guida delle indagini in
               seguito alla negativa valutazione delle
               disdicevoli circostanze verificatesi con
               il mio predecessore Roverini che come e
               noto non e riuscito a impedire il
               verificarsi della scomparsa del signor
               Greenleaf, il quale era l'unica persona
               al momento passibile di incriminazione
               del reato di omicidio del signor Miles.

                         PETER
                   (translating)
               He's taken over the case because...
               they're annoyed the previous chap let
               Dickie...disappear when he was the only,
               he was the only suspect in Freddie's
               murder.

                         VERRECCHIA
               Quando e stata l'ultima volta che il
               signor Ripley ha visto il signor
               Greenleaf?
               (When was the last time Ripley saw
               Greenleaf?)

     Ripley forgets he's not supposed to have much Italian and
     answers.

                         RIPLEY
               In Rome, about three weeks ago.
                   (shrugs)
               I knew that one.

                         PETER
                   (giving Ripley a look)
               A Roma, circa tre settimane fa.

                         VERRECCHIA
               Dove e stato il signor Ripley da allora?

                         PETER
                   (translating)
               Where have you been since then?

                         RIPLEY
               I've been backpacking.

                         PETER
               I don't know how to translate that.
                   (he tries)
               E difficile....il signor Ripley
               ....dormiva all'aperto, con un...

                         VERRECCHIA
               All'aperto? Col freddo che ha fatto?

                         PETER
               He thinks it's very cold to be sleeping
               outside.

                         VERRECCHIA
               Il signor Ripley ha sviluppate tendenze
               omosessuali?

                         PETER
               Are you a homosexual?
                   (then as himself)
               Interesting non-sequitur.

                         RIPLEY
               No.

                         PETER
                   (translates for him)
               No.
                   (as Peter, drily)
               By the way, officially there are no
               Italian homosexuals. Makes Leonardo,
               Michelangelo very inconvenient.

                         RIPLEY
               Tell him I have a fiancÈe, Dickie has a
               fiancÈe and Freddie Miles probably had a
               string of them.

                         PETER
                   (translating)
               Il signor Ripley ha una fidanzata, il
               signor Dickie ha una fidanzata e
               probabilmente il signor Freddie Miles ha
               molte fidanzate.

                         VERRECCHIA
                   (laughs)
               Mamma mia, quante fidanzate!

     They all laugh.

                         RIPLEY
               What did he say?

                         PETER
               He says so many fiancÈes.

                         VERRECCHIA
                   (suddenly very tough)
               Lei ha ucciso prima Freddie Miles e dopo
               Dickie Greenleaf! Vero?

     As Peter translates Verrecchia watches intently.

                         PETER
               He wants to know if you killed Freddie
               Miles and then killed Dickie Greenleaf?

                         RIPLEY
                   (outraged)
               No I did not. I did not kill Freddie
               Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf.  Is
               he accusing me?
                   (Peter clearly doesn't ask)
               Ask him if he's accusing me!

                         PETER
               He's already angry, I don't think -

                         RIPLEY
                   (interrupting, heated)
               Just because he doesn't like Americans!

                         VERRECCHIA
               Non e questo il luogo per le vostre
               conversazioni private!  (This is not the
               place for your private conversations)

                         PETER
                   (appeasing him)
               A ragione.  A ragione.  (You're right.
               You're right.)

                         VERRECCHIA
               Hmm. C'e questa...  (There's this...)

     Verrecchia hands over a letter. It's opened. Ripley's name on
     the outside. Ripley stares at it.

                         VERRECCHIA
                         (cont'd)
               Questa lettera e stata trovata
               nell'abitazione del signor Richard
               Greenleaf a Roma.

                         PETER
               They found this in Dickie's place in
               Rome.

                         RIPLEY
               You opened this?

                         VERRECCHIA
               Of course!

     He stands and takes the letter out.  Begins to read. He has
     the look of a man whose privacy has been violated.

                         RIPLEY
                   (to Peter)
               It's a suicide note.
                   (to Verrecchia)
               You ask me all these questions and you've
               already read this suicide note?

     INT. PETER SMITH-KINGSLEY'S APARTMENT. DAY.

     There's music everywhere - and stands - and posters of
     performances and PHOTOGRAPHS OF PETER CONDUCTING. Peter is an
     opera repetiteur. Ripley is sitting at Peter's piano, playing
     from the score of Vivaldi's Stabat Mater. Peter's made supper.
     He's setting the table.

                         PETER
               Can you imagine, if Dickie did kill
               Freddie, what must that be like? To wake
               up every morning, how can you? Just wake
               up and be a person, drink a coffee...?

                         RIPLEY
               Whatever you do, however terrible,
               however hurtful - it all makes sense,
               doesn't it? inside your head. You never
               meet anybody who thinks they're a bad
               person or that they're cruel.

                         PETER
               But you're still tormented, you must be,
               you've killed somebody...

                         RIPLEY
               Don't you put the past in a room, in the
               cellar, and lock the door and just never
               go in there? Because that's what I do.

                         PETER
               Probably. In my case it's probably a
               whole building.

                         RIPLEY
               Then you meet someone special and all you
               want to do is toss them the key, say open
               up, step inside, but you can't because
               it's dark and there are demons and if
               anybody saw how ugly it was...

     Peter's come over, stands behind him over the piano.

                         PETER
               That's the music talking. Harder to be
               bleak if you're playing Knees up Mother
               Brown.

     He vamps this vaudeville song over Ripley's shoulder.

                         RIPLEY
               I keep wanting to do that - fling open
               the door - let the light in, clean
               everything out. If I could get a huge
               eraser and rub everything out...starting
               with myself...the thing is, Peter, if...

                         PETER
                   (as Ripley falls silent)
               No key, huh?

     INT. SANTA MARIA DELLA PIETA, BRIDGE OF SIGHS. DAY.

     A YOUNG BOY SINGS the soprano part of Vivaldi's STABAT MATER.
     A piercingly pure sound in Vivaldi's own church.  The
     orchestra - rehearsing - is conducted by Peter from the
     organ.

     Ripley slips in at the back of the church. He stands and
     listens. Peter sees him, smiles.  Ripley smiles back.

     EXT. VENICE, S.LUCIA RAILWAY STATION. DAY.

     MARGE appears on the steps, carrying an overnight bag. Ripley
     and Peter have come to meet her.

                         MARGE
                   (kissing him warmly)
               Hello Peter, so good to see you.

                         RIPLEY
               Hello Marge!

                         MARGE
                   (coolly)
               Tom.

     They walk towards the Vaporetto.

                         MARGE (cont'd)
               So you found Peter...

                         PETER
               I think we sort of found each other.

     Marge smiles enigmatically. Ripley registers.

                         PETER (cont'd)
               Where's Dickie's father?

                         MARGE
               He's not coming till the morning.
               Evidently his stomach - I don't think the
               food here is agreeing with him.

                         RIPLEY
               I was looking forward to seeing him.

                         MARGE
               Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of
               that. There's a private detective on the
               case now - a Mr MacCarron - Dickie's
               father's employing him.

                         RIPLEY
               That's a terrific idea.

                         MARGE
               He's American. He's already discovered
               Dickie cashed checks for $1000 the day
               before he disappeared.

     They step onto the Vaporetto.

                         MARGE (cont'd)
               Is that what you do before you jump in
               the Tiber?  I don't think so.

     EXT. RIPLEY'S HOUSE, VENICE. DAY.

     The boat arrives at the entrance to the house. Peter opens
     the door as Ripley collects Marge's bags.

                         MARGE
                   (to Peter)
               Is this you?

                         PETER
               No, it's Tom's. Splendid, eh?

                         MARGE
               Golly. Who's paying for this?

                         RIPLEY
               Peter found it for me. I can afford it
               because it's damp and, and falling down.

     INT. RIPLEY'S HOUSE, VENICE. DAY.

     Marge, entering the living room, is astonished at its
     grandeur. She walks around as Ripley heads for the bar.

                         MARGE
               This is spectacular.

                         PETER
               That's why Tom wanted you to stay.  It's
               better than squeezing into my room, and I
               know how you hate hotels.

                         MARGE
               A hotel would've been fine.
                   (to Ripley)
               We'll have to tell Mr Greenleaf how far
               his dollar has stretched.

     Ripley is shaking a martini. Marge laughs, helpless, somehow
     raging. Peter turns

                         PETER
               What's funny?

                         MARGE
               No, nothing. I'm just thinking about when
               Tom arrived in Mongi.
                   (to Ripley)
               And now look at you.

                         RIPLEY
               Look at me what?

                         MARGE
               To the manner born.

     EXT. PIAZZA SAN MARCO, VENICE. DAY.

     St Mark's Square is buzzing with life - tourists, balloon
     sellers - a man playing saxophone. HERBERT GREENLEAF sits out
     in the colonade on one of the many tables at Florian's Cafe,
     cradling a glass of hot water. He gets up as Marge and Ripley
     arrive.

                         RIPLEY
               Mr Greenleaf.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Tom. How are you?  You look well.

                         RIPLEY
               I'm well, thank you.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Far cry from New York.

                         RIPLEY
               Yes it is.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Marge, good morning.  Unusual weather.

                         MARGE
               Very.

                         RIPLEY
               And you, sir?  Any better?

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Pretty good.  Sticking with hot water.

                         MARGE
               Where's Mr MacCarron?

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               San Remo. The police are amateurs. Well,
               my boy, it's come to a pretty pass,
               hasn't it?

                         RIPLEY
               Yes.  What's the detective hoping to
               find in San Remo?

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               He's being thorough, that's all. I'm
               learning about my son, Tom, now he's
               missing. I'm learning a great deal about
               him. I hope you can fill in some more
               blanks for me. Marge has been good enough
               to do that, about Mongibello.

                         RIPLEY
               I'll try my best, sir. Obviously I'll do
               anything to help Dickie.

     Marge looks at him in contempt.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               This theory, the letter he left for you,
               the Police think that's a clear
               indication he was planning on doing
               something...to himself.

                         MARGE
               I just don't believe that!

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               You don't want to, dear. I'd like to talk
               to Tom alone - perhaps this afternoon?
               Would you mind? Marge, what a man may say
               to his sweetheart and what he'll admit to
               another fellow -

                         MARGE
               Such as?

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               What a waste of lives and opportunities
               and -

     A saxophonist is blaring away in the piazza. Greenleaf
     suddenly explodes.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
                         (cont'd)
               - I'd pay that fellow a hundred dollars
               right now to shut up!

     INT. RIPLEY'S HOUSE. AFTERNOON.

     Herbert Greenleaf sits on a chair, Ripley pours him some tea.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
                   (reading, plunging into gloom)
               No, Marge doesn't know the half of it.

                         RIPLEY
               I think it might hurt her to know.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               And his passport photo? Did you hear? To
               scratch out your own face like that - can
               you imagine - the frame of mind you'd
               have to be in?
                   (reading)
               I've thought about going to the police
               but I can't face it. I can't face
               anything anymore.

                         RIPLEY
               I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him
               away. I spoke and he heard you.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
                   (such a disappointed father)
               Well, if we all pushed him away what
               about him pushing us away? You've been a
               great friend to my son. Everything is
               someone else's fault. We all want to sow
               wild oars. Somebody's got to - what's the
               word?
                   (Ripley shakes his head)
               The moment someone confronts him he
               lashes out.  He lashes out. You know,
               people always say you can't choose your
               parents, but you can't choose your
               children.

     INT. RIPLEY'S HOUSE, VENICE. DUSK.

     Ripley wakes up from an awful, chilling nightmare, his head
     full of ghosts. He's cramped up in an armchair, his arms in
     sine foetal protection. HIS DOOR KNOCKER IS BEING REPEATEDLY
     SHAKEN. He surfaces thickly, stumbles to the door. It's Peter
     and Marge.

                         RIPLEY
               I'm sorry. I was asleep. I must have
               fallen asleep.

                         PETER
               You look ghastly, Tom. Are you okay?

                         MARGE
               Did Dickie's Dad go?

                         RIPLEY
               He's having an early night.

                         MARGE
               Poor man.
                   (she heads to her room)
               We were knocking on that door for ever.
                   (she fiddles inside the sleeve
                    of her dress)
               I think I've broken my strap.

                         PETER
               Not guilty.

                         RIPLEY
               I'll fix some drinks.

                         MARGE
               You walk in Venice!

     She takes off her shoe, examining her feet for wear and tear,
     then disappears into the bedroom. Peter walks over to Ripley,
     a little concerned.

                         PETER
               Are you okay?

                         RIPLEY
               I'm fine.

                         PETER
                   (a hand on his shoulder)
               Do you want me to stick around?

                         RIPLEY
               It's okay.

                         PETER
               Or I could come back.

     Ripley looks at him. That's never happened. He digs in his
     pocket, finds his key, gives it to Peter. Peter smiles.

                         PETER (cont'd)
               Your key.

     INT. RIPLEY'S BATHROOM, VENICE. NIGHT.

     Ripley's in the bath. Marge knocks on his door.

                         MARGE (O/S)
               Tom?

                         RIPLEY
               Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.

                         MARGE (O/S)
               Tom, I need to talk to you. It's urgent.

     Ripley, irritated, opens the door, his towel wrapped around
     his waist. Marge is white. She's wearing a robe. She's
     slightly breathless.

                         MARGE
               I found Dickie's rings.

                         RIPLEY
               What?

                         MARGE
               You've got Dickie's rings.

                         RIPLEY
               I can explain.

     He can't. His eyes dart. Marge holds up the evidence.

                         MARGE
               Dickie promised me he would never take
               off this ring.

                         RIPLEY
               Let me put on some clothes and then we
               can talk about this.

                         MARGE
               I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to
               tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr
               Greenleaf.

                         RIPLEY
               Marge, calm down, you're being
               hysterical.

                         MARGE
               He promised me. I swear I'll never take
               off this ring until the day -

                         RIPLEY
               Shut up! Shut up!

     His towel slips off from his waist.

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
               I'm wet, Marge, I've lost my towel, I'd
               really like to put my clothes on. So go
               and pour us both a drink, will you?

     She goes off obediently, a zombie. He shuts the door.
     Immediately he starts looking for something, anything, to
     kill Marge with. He's got a shoe but it feels too light. He
     opens cabinets, drawers - nail scissors, nothing - then
     picks up his straight razor and considers it in the mirror.

     INT. RIPLEY'S SITTING ROOM, VENICE. NIGHT.

     Marge is leaving, coat on, as Ripley comes out of the
     bathroom.

                         RIPLEY
               Marge?  Where are you going?

                         MARGE
                   (like a creature caught in
                    headlights)
               I was looking for a needle and thread. I
               wasn't snooping. I was looking for a
               needle and thread to mend my bra.

                         RIPLEY
               The scent you're wearing. I bought it for
               you, not Dickie. The thing about Dickie.
               So many things. The day he was late back
               from Rome - I tried to tell you this - he
               was with another girl. I'm not talking
               about Meredith, another girl we met in a
               bar. He couldn't be faithful for five
               minutes. So when he makes a promise it
               doesn't mean what it means when you make
               a promise. Or I do. He has so many
               realities, Dickie, and he believes them
               all. He lies. He lies, that's his... half
               the time he doesn't even realize.

     A SMALL RED STAIN is appearing on the pocket of his robe. As
     he speaks the stain spreads. He looks at it absently.

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
               Today, for the first time, I've even
               wondered whether he might have killed
               Freddie. He would get so crazy if anybody
               contradicted him - well, you know that.
               Marge. I loved you - you might as well
               know - I loved you, and because he knew I
               loved you, he let you think I loved him.
               Didn't you see, couldn't you see? I don't
               know, maybe it's grotesque to say this
               now, so just write it on a piece of paper
               or something, and keep it in your purse
               for a rainy day. Tom loves me.

                         MARGE
                   (as if she'd heard nothing)
               Why do you have Dickie's rings?

     His hand goes to his pocket. HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO DO IT.

                         RIPLEY
               I told you. He gave them to me.

                         MARGE
               Why? When?

                         RIPLEY
               I feel as if you haven't heard anything
               I've been saying to you.

                         MARGE
               I don't believe you.

                         RIPLEY
               It's all true.

                         MARGE
               I don't believe a single word you've
               said.

     Marge is shivering. Ripley, ominous, advances, she retreats.

                         RIPLEY
               You're shivering, Marge. Can I hold you?
               Would you let me hold you?

     Marge panics, backed up against the door. She screams and
     turns straight into the arms of a startled PETER who's come
     back to visit Ripley, and is unlocking the door.

                         MARGE
                   (sobbing uncontrollably)
               Oh Peter! Get me out of here.

     Ripley storms off. His hand comes out of his pocket COVERED
     IN BLOOD from the razor. Peter notices, appalled.

                         PETER
               Tom, are you okay?

                         RIPLEY
               You try. You try talking to her.

                         PETER
                   (calls after him)
               Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on?

                         RIPLEY
                   (not turning around)
               I give up.

     INT. RIPLEY HOUSE, LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.

     Peter has just put a band-aid over Ripley's cut hand.

                         PETER
               You can't be angry with her.  She's upset
               and needs someone to blame. So she blames
               you.  I'll go home and talk to her.  As
               for you - either get a safety razor or
               grow a beard.

     INT. LOBBY, EUROPA REGINA HOTEL, VENICE. MORNING.

     Ripley hurries through the gleaming marble entrance.

     INT. HERBERT GREENLEAF'S SUITE, EUROPA REGINA. DAY.

     Ripley knocks on the door. It's opened by a face he doesn't
     recognize. A middle-aged heavy set man. It's MacCARRON, the
     private investigator.

                         RIPLEY
               Is Mr Greenleaf here?

                         MACCARRON
               Mr Ripley? I'm Alvin MacCarron.

                         MARGE (O/S)
               I don't know, I don't know, I just know
               it.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
                         (O/S)
               Marge, there's female intuition, and
               then there are facts -

     Greenleaf sits with a scrubbed Marge, her hair pulled back,
     as if newly-widowed. THE RINGS SIT GLINTING ON THE COFFEE
     TABLE.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Tom.

                         RIPLEY
               Hello, sir.
                   (smiles thinly at Marge)
               Marge, you should have waited, didn't
               Peter tell you I'd come by and pick you
               up?

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Marge has been telling us about the
               rings.

                         RIPLEY
               You know I feel ridiculous I didn't
               mention them yesterday - I clean forgot -
               ridiculous.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Perhaps you didn't mention them because
               there's only one conclusion to be drawn.

     Ripley worries about what that conclusion is as Mr Greenleaf
     heads into his bedroom.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
                         (cont'd)
               I'm going to take Marge for a little
               walk, Tom.  Mr MacCarron wants to talk
               with you.

                         RIPLEY
                   (feeling caged in)
               We could go down to the bar - no need for
               you to -

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               No, he should talk to you alone.

     He helps Marge to her feet and leads her out. RIPLEY IS
     PARALYSED. He waits for the door to shut. Aimlessly he walks
     out onto the terrace, with its staggering, beautiful and
     indifferent view.

     EXT. EUROPA REGINA, THE GREENLEAF TERRACE. DAY.

     Ripley stands, steels himself for MacCarron's charges.

                         RIPLEY
               I could probably see my bedroom from
               here. I can see my house. When you see
               where you live from a distance it's like
               a dream, isn't it?

                         MACCARRON
                   (coming out)
               I don't care for B.S. I don't care to
               hear it. I don't care to speak it.

                         RIPLEY
               Okay.

                         MACCARRON
               Why do you think Dickie's father sent him
               to Europe in the first place? Did you
               know at Princeton Dickie Greenleaf half-
               killed a boy?

     Ripley turns, shocked.

                         MACCARRON
                         (cont'd)
               At a party. Over some girl. He kicked the
               kid several times in the head. Put him in
               the hospital. The boy had a wire fixed in
               his jaw. The Rome Police didn't think to
               ask Mr Greenleaf.

     MacCarron gets up.

                         MACCARRON
                         (cont'd)
               Nor did they think to check whether a
               Thomas Ripley had ever been a student at
               Princeton University. I turned up a Tom
               Ripley who'd been a piano tuner in the
               music department.

     Ripley's head drops.

                         MACCARRON
                         (cont'd)
               See - in America we're taught to check a
               fact before it becomes a fact. We're
               taught to nose around when a girl drowns
               herself, find out if that girl was
               pregnant, find out if Dickie had an
               embarrassment there.

     Ripley doesn't know where this barrage is going.

                         MACCARRON
                         (cont'd)
               Mr Greenleaf appreciates your loyalty.
               He really does. Marge, she's got a
               hundred theories, but there are a few
               things she doesn't know. We hope she
               never knows.

                         RIPLEY
               I hope she never knows.

                         MACCARRON
               Three different people saw Dickie get
               into Freddie Miles' car. A man who won't
               identify himself because he was jumping
               someone else's wife at the time saw
               Dickie removing license plates from a red
               sports car. The Police know about this
               man because he happens to be a Policeman.

     He walks out of the room, returns carrying THE LICENSE PLATES
     from Freddie's car.

                         MACCARRON
                         (cont'd)
               I found these in the basement of Dickie's
               apartment. They belonged to Freddie's
               car. Mr Greenleaf has asked me to lose
               them in the canal this evening.

     Ripley can't believe what he's hearing. It's like a dream.

                         MACCARRON
                         (cont'd)
               Mr Greenleaf also feels there was a
               silent promise in Dickie's letter to you
               which he intends to honor. He intends to
               transfer a good part of Dickie's income
               from his trust into your name. He doesn't
               intend to give the Italian police any
               information about Dickie's past. He's
               rather hoping you'll feel the same.

     There is a silence in which this strange compact is agreed.

     EXT. EUROPA REGINA MOORING. DAY.

     Ripley stands with Marge, Mr Greenleaf and MacCarron at the
     water's edge - MOTOR LAUNCH growling. They shake hands, and
     then MacCarron and Mr Greenleaf get into the launch. Herbert
     Greenleaf carries the saxophone case.

                         RIPLEY
                   (to Marge)
               I feel I never should have said those
               things to you the other evening. I was
               pretty flustered, the rings and - and you
               looked so, I don't know.

     Marge shakes her head to silence him.

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
               But I hope that note goes to New York in
               your purse, for a rainy day.

                         MARGE
               What are you going to do now, Tom?

                         RIPLEY
               I don't know. Peter has a concert in
               Athens next month - and he's asked if I
               want to go along, help out. He says
               goodbye by the way - he's in rehearsal,
               otherwise -

                         MARGE
               Why do I think there's never been a
               Ripley rainy day?

                         RIPLEY
               What?

                         MARGE
                   (lunging at him)
               I know it was you - I know it was you,
               Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed
               Dickie. I know it was you.

                         RIPLEY
               Oh Marge.

     He puts his hand out to control her. She pushes it away.
     STARTS TO LASH OUT AT HIM, the frustration too much, so that
     Ripley has to cover his face. MacCarron comes off the boat to
     restrain her.  Ripley looks at him as if to say: what can you
     do, she's hysterical. MacCarron nods, pulls her on to the
     boat. Greenleaf catches Ripley's eye, guiltily. Turns away.
     They stand silhouetted as the launch revs up and surges off
     towards open waters, passing the little fleets of gondolas.

     EXT. FERRY FOR ATHENS, NAPLES. DAY.

     A week later and Peter and Ripley are on the deck of the
     ferry, the HELLENES, as it sails towards Greece.  They're
     laughing.

                         RIPLEY
               Ask me what I want to change about this
               moment.

                         PETER
               What do you want to change about this
               moment?

                         RIPLEY
               Nothing.

     INT. PETER'S CABIN. DUSK.

     Peter's in a bathrobe organising his currency, his
     traveller's cheques. Ripley knocks on the door, comes in.

                         PETER
               Hello.  What are you up to?

                         RIPLEY
               All kinds of things. Making plans.

                         PETER
               Plans - good, plans for tonight or plans
               for the future?

                         RIPLEY
               I don't know. Both. My plan right now is
               to go up on deck, look at the sunset.
               Come with me.

                         PETER
               You go. I don't want to get dressed yet.
               Come back though.  Come back.
                   (smiles at him)
               You know, you look so relaxed, like a
               completely different person.

                         RIPLEY
               Well, that's entirely your fault.  And,
               if I fall overboard, that'll be your
               fault too.

     EXT. DECK OF THE HELLENES. SUNSET.

     Ripley stands on deck, staring at the magnificent sunset.
     Then a voice shakes him from his reverie.

                         MEREDITH
               Dickie?  Dickie?

     He turns. He's caught. Suddenly he's Dickie.

                         MEREDITH (cont'd)
               Dickie, my God!

                         RIPLEY
               Hello Meredith.

                         MEREDITH
               I was looking at you, your clothes, I
               wouldn't have known you...

                         RIPLEY
               Well, you've spotted me and so you get
               the reward.

                         MEREDITH
               What?

                         RIPLEY
               Just kidding. Are you alone?

                         MEREDITH
               Hardly. I couldn't be less alone.

     Meredith points to the UPPER DECK BALCONY where TWO OLDER
     COUPLES are walking around the deck.

                         RIPLEY
               Of course.  Aunt Joan.

                         MEREDITH
               And co. A lot of co. Oh, God, I've
               thought about you so much.

                         RIPLEY
               I've thought about you.

     And now he's thinking I can't kill them all...

                         MEREDITH
               When I thought about you I was mostly
               hating you. Where've you been hiding?

                         RIPLEY
               I haven't been hiding. I've been in
               Police custody. They've been trying to
               flush out Freddie's killer.

                         MEREDITH
               You're kidding.

                         RIPLEY
               They're letting me have this vacation.
               Which is why the get-up. Which is why you
               haven't heard from me.

                         MEREDITH
               You know, the whole world thinks you
               killed Freddie? It's terrible.

                         RIPLEY
               I know. Look, I can't talk now. Later.
               Later?

     He kisses her.  Full of future.

                         MEREDITH
               So - are you travelling under R?

                         RIPLEY
               You know what - I am.

                         MEREDITH
               Dickie, are you with Peter Smith-
               Kingsley?  I bet you are. My aunt thought
               she saw him.

                         RIPLEY
                   (horrified)
               Peter Smith-Kingsley? I haven't seen him
               in months.  No, I'm alone.
                   (and he understands this is not
                    any kind of lie)

     INT. PETER'S CABIN. NIGHT.

     Peter's working on his score, lying on his front, apparently
     engrossed. Ripley knocks and enters. Looks long at Peter.

                         PETER
               How was it?

                         RIPLEY
               Good. But I think we should stay in here
               for the rest of the trip.

                         PETER
               Was that Meredith?

                         RIPLEY
                   (sighs)
               Was who Meredith?

                         PETER
               Meredith Logue. You were kissing
               somebody. Looked like Meredith.

                         RIPLEY
               Hardly kissing. Kissing off.

                         PETER
               Didn't look that way - you know - from a
               distance.

                         RIPLEY
               I lied. To her. She thought she'd seen
               you.

                         PETER
               Why lie?

                         RIPLEY
               Dickie and Peter, that's just too good
               gossip, isn't it?

                         PETER
               Or Tom and Peter even.

                         RIPLEY
               Well that would be even better gossip.

                         PETER
               Really, why?
                   (completely lost)
               Sorry, I'm completely lost.

                         RIPLEY
               I know. I'm lost, too. I'm going to be
               stuck in the basement, aren't I, that's
               my, that's my - terrible and alone and
               dark - and I've lied about who I am, and
               where I am, and so nobody can ever find
               me.

                         PETER
               What do you mean lied about who you are?

                         RIPLEY
               I suppose I always thought - better to be
               a fake somebody than a real nobody.

                         PETER
               What are you talking about - you're not a
               nobody! That's the last thing you are.

                         RIPLEY
               Peter, I... I...

                         PETER
                   (conciliatory)
               And don't forget. I have the key.

                         RIPLEY
               You have the key. Tell me some good
               things about Tom Ripley. Don't get up.
               Just tell me some nice things.

     He sits on the bed, leans against Peter. His eyes are
     brimming with tears.  He takes the cord from Peter's robe and
     begins twisting it in his hands.

                         PETER
               Good things about Tom Ripley?  Could take
               some time!... Tom is talented. Tom is
               tender... Tom is beautiful...

                         RIPLEY
                   (during this, and tender)
               You're such a liar...

                         PETER
               ...Tom is a mystery...

     Ripley is pressing against him, moving up his body, kisses
     his shoulder, the cord wrapped tight in his hands...

     INT. RIPLEY'S CABIN. NIGHT.

     Ripley returns to his cabin. Sits on the bed, desolate.

                         PETER (O/S)
                   (cont'd)
               ...Tom is not a nobody. Tom has secrets
               he doesn't want to tell me, and I wish he
               would. Tom has nightmares. That's not a
               good thing. Tom has someone to love him.
               That is a good thing!
                   (feeling Ripley's weight on
                    him)
               Tom is crushing me. Tom is crushing me.
                   (suddenly alarmed)
               Tom, you're crushing me!

     The door of his closet flips open with the swell and he
     catches his reflection. It swings shut. Open then shut.
     Through the porthole the weather's changing as the light
     dies. There's a swell as the horizon rises and falls in the
     round glass. Ripley, alone, in a nightmare of his own making.

     THE END.






     Lullaby for Cain

     From the silence
     from the night
     comes a distant lullabye

     Cry, remembering that first cry
     Your brother standing by
     and loved
     both loved
     beloved sons of mine
     sing a lullabye
     mother is close by
     innocent eyes
     such innocent eyes

     Envy stole your brother's life
     came home murdered peace of mind
     left you nightmares on the pillow
     sleep now

     Soul, surrendering your soul
     the heart of you not whole
     for love
     but love
     what toll

     Cast into the dark
     branded with the mark
     of shame
     of Cain

     From the garden of God's light
     to a wilderness of light
     sleep now

     sleep now.
THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY

     1958

     PROLOGUE:  INT. RIPLEY'S CABIN. EVENING.

     Fade up on Ripley, as in the final scene of the film,
     sitting, desolate in a ship's cabin. The camera rotates
     around his face, which begins in light and ends in darkness.

                         RIPLEY (O/S)
               If I could just go back.  If I could rub
               everything out.  Starting with myself.
               Starting with borrowing a jacket.

     EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST TERRACE. EARLY EVENING.

     Ripley is at the piano, accompanying FRAN, a young soprano.
     CREDITS begin.

                         FRAN (SINGS)
               Ah, such fleeting paradise
               such innocent delight
               to love,
               be loved,
               a lullabye,
               then silence.

     The song finishes.  Applause.  They're the entertainment at a
     cocktail party to celebrate a silver wedding anniversary.
     Some partygoers congratulate Fran on her performance. A
     distinguished looking man, pushing his wife in a wheelchair,
     approaches Ripley, offers his hand.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Most enjoyable. Herbert Greenleaf.

                         RIPLEY
               Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
                   (pointing at Ripley's borrowed
                    jacket)
               I see you were at Princeton.
               Then you'll most likely know our son,
               Dick. Dickie Greenleaf...

                         EMILY GREENLEAF
               We couldn't help noticing your jacket.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Yes.

                         EMILY GREENLEAF
               Class of '56?

                         RIPLEY
                   (hesitating)
               How is Dickie?

     INT. ELEVATOR OPENING OUT INTO LOBBY. EARLY EVENING.

     Fran, Ripley, Mr and Mrs Greenleaf and others emerge from an
     elevator. Emily talks to Fran, Herbert to Ripley.

                         EMILY GREENLEAF
                   (to Fran)
               I hope you'll come and see us...

                         FRAN
               That's very kind.

                         EMILY GREENLEAF
               Both of you...

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Of course, Dickie's idea of music is
               Jazz. He has a saxophone.  To my ear Jazz
               is just noise, just an insolent noise.

     EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST. EARLY EVENING.

     Ripley shakes hands with Herbert Greenleaf as he gets into
     his Rolls Royce. They are making an appointment. Ripley
     crosses the street to Fran, pecks her cheek. She hands him
     his share of their fee.

                         RIPLEY
               Gotta run. I'm so late.
                   (he hands Fran's boyfriend the
                    jacket he's been wearing)
               Thanks for the jacket.

                         BOYFRIEND
               Sure.  Thanks for filling in for me.

     From Greenleaf's point of view he sees a couple embracing.

                         EMILY GREENLEAF
               Darling couple, aren't they?

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Yes.  An exceptional young man.

     From another vantage point Ripley hurries on as Fran gets
     into her boyfriend's car. A piano quartet starts up.

     EXT. THEATER. EVENING.

     Ripley runs past the droves of arriving concert-goers and
     heads for the theater. Music continues.

     INT. MEN'S ROOM, THEATER. NIGHT.

     The interval: A thick mass of men in tuxedoes grooming
     themselves at the basins. Ripley turns on faucets, offers
     towels, brushes off dandruff. Men talk over, round, and
     through him.  Put coins in a bowl.

     INT. A BOX AT THE THEATER. NIGHT

     The concert continues. Ripley peers through the curtain at
     the performances.  A haughty woman in the box turns round and
     he closes the curtain.

     INT. BACKSTAGE. 1:30 A.M.

     An empty auditorium. Ripley plays Bach in the blue
     ghostlight.  A caretaker emerges from his rounds, flips on
     the house lights.  Ripley jerks up from his playing, waves
     apologetically.

                         RIPLEY
               Sorry, sorry.  I know.  Sorry.

     EXT. GREENLEAF SHIPYARDS, BROOKLYN. DAY.

     Greenleaf and Ripley walk through one of the drydocks.  A
     huge void in the shape of a boat, swarming with workers
     preparing the shell of a new liner.  If Central Park is where
     the money is spent, this is clearly where it's made.  And a
     lot of it. Workers nod deferentially to the man with his name
     over the buildings behind them.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Mongibello. Tiny place. South of Naples.
               Marge, his uh, the young lade is
               supposedly writing some kind of book. God
               knows what he does. By all accounts they
               spend the whole time on the beach. Or his
               sailboat. That's my son's talent,
               spending his allowance.

     Ripley, in his green corduroy jacket the very model of a
     sober young man, listens attentively.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF (cont'd)
               Could you ever conceive of going to
               Italy, Tom, persuade my son to come home?
                   (Ripley looks doubtful)
               I'd pay you.  I'd pay you 1000 dollars.

                         RIPLEY
               I've always wanted to go to Europe, sir,
               but...

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Good. Now you can go for a reason.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT, NEW YORK. DAY.

     A vinyl RECORD revolves in close up.  An exuberant and
     mysterious VOICE is scat singing. Wild. Then the sound slides
     into a raucous big band jazz number:  Dizzy Gillespie's The
     Champ. A HAND ejects the record. When the camera finds the
     man's face it is BLINDFOLDED. He's hot. He's wearing an
     undershirt. He's trying to identify the recording.

                         RIPLEY (O/S)
               I don't know. Count Basie?  Duke
               Ellington. I don't know. Count Basie.

     The man pulls of the blindfold, examines the record cover of
     the disc he's been trying to learn, needs to put on glasses
     to do so, is irritated by his mistake. He ejects the record.

     A pile of other jazz records are strewn across a cluttered
     table which includes classical sheet music and a paper
     keyboard. One hand idly mimes at the keys.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. DAY.

     Another song for Ripley to identify is on the gramophone.
     Chet Baker's My Funny Valentine.  Signs everywhere of
     packing. A suitcase. Books about Italy.  Ripley paces in this
     BASEMENT room, which is bathroom, kitchen, living room and
     bedroom all in one.  Tiny, tidy, squalid and sad. The windows
     give onto bars and a wall.

                         RIPLEY
               Don't even know if this is a man or a
               woman.

     There's a violent row going on in the room above his head. He
     flinches.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. DAY.

     Ripley, shining his shoes, packing almost done, is testing
     himself on another piece of music. Free jazz saxophone:
     Charlie Parker's Koko.  He listens hard, recognizes the
     track.

                         RIPLEY
               That's Charlie Parker. Bird.

     He skips over to the gramophone, checks the record. He's
     right, he smiles.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. DAY.

     Ripley studies an old photograph of Dickie Greenleaf in a
     Princeton Yearbook. He shoves the book in a bag, picks up
     his suitcase and takes a last look around the dingy apartment
     before closing the door behind him.

     EXT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. DAY.

     Ripley hauls his luggage up the stairs and into the sunlight.
     He is met at the top of the stairs by Mr Greenleaf's
     chauffeur.

                         CHAUFFEUR
               Here.  I'll take that.

                         RIPLEY
               Thanks.

                         CARETAKER
                   (nodding towards the apartment)
               That thousand bucks should come in handy.

                         RIPLEY
               Yes, sir.

                         CHAUFFEUR
                   (interupts Ripley, who is
                    about to open the car door)
               I'll get that.

                         RIPLEY
               Thanks.

                         CHAUFFEUR
                   (as he holds open the door for
                    Ripley)
               Sir.
                   (Ripley laughs excitedly)
               You're gonna have a great trip.  Mr
               Greenleaf is personal friends with the
               Cunard people.

     INT. HERBERT GREENLEAF'S CAR. DAY.

     Ripley luxuriates in the back of the Greenleaf limousine. He
     opens up an envelope he's carrying with Greenleaf stationery.
     Inside a First Class Cunard Ticket, some traveler's checks
     and dollars.

                         CHAUFFEUR
               I can tell you.  The Greenleaf name opens
               a lot of doors.

     EXT. QUEEN MARY, MANHATTAN SKYLINE. DAY.

     The liner leaves New York en route to Italy.  END CREDITS.

     INT. NAPLES HARBOR, CUSTOMS & IMMIGRATION HALL. DAY.

     ITALY. Brilliant sunshine. The Queen Mary has just docked.
     Passengers can be seen disembarking through the huge windows.
     Coming from the First Class gangways they are greeted,
     escorted, fussed over into the hall.  Their bags have been
     unloaded ahead of them, and are now being sorted in the hall
     under the initials of their owners.  STANDS WITH THE LETTERS
     OF THE ALPHABET CHALKED ON THEM are dotted about, and trunks
     and suitcases of all shapes and sizes form small hills around
     them. Ripley enters and an Italian Porter approaches, wants
     his name.  Ripley. Ripley. Ripley! he repeats in the hubbub
     and joins the crowd around the letter R.  A striking young
     woman (MEREDITH) is nearby. She notices him.

     Ripley proceeds to the Customs area, where he's held in a
     line as a large suitcase is opened and searched. Meredith
     catches up with him. Her luggage a mountain next to his.

                         MEREDITH
               What's your secret?

                         RIPLEY
               Excuse me?

                         MEREDITH
               No, it's just - you are American, aren't
               you? - no, I just, I have so much
               luggage, and you're so, uh, streamlined.
               It's humiliating.

     Ripley shrugs.  Now they're opening a second case of the
     passenger ahead.  Hard not to converse.

                         MEREDITH (cont'd)
               I'm Meredith, by the way. Meredith
               Randall.

                         RIPLEY
               Dickie, Dickie Greenleaf. Hello.

                         MEREDITH
               Hello.

     They are passed through immigration, head down the long
     stairs towards the street.  Meredith catches up with Ripley.

                         MEREDITH (cont'd)
               You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's?

                         RIPLEY
                   (thinking quickly)
               Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.

                         MEREDITH
               So now, did they put your suitcase in the
               wrong pile? It's just - upstairs -
               weren't you under the R stand? I thought
               I saw you there.

                         RIPLEY
               My father wants me in New York. He builds
               boats. I'd rather sail them.  I travel
               under my mother's name.

                         MEREDITH
               Which is?

                         RIPLEY
               Emily.
                   (Meredith's bewildered)
               Just kidding.

                         MEREDITH
               The funny thing is, I'm not Randall
               either. I'm Logue.

                         RIPLEY
                   (nods, recognizing the name)
               As in the...?

                         MEREDITH
               As in the Textile Logues. Trying to shrug
               off the dress. I travel under my mother's
               name, too.

                         RIPLEY
               Randall.

                         MEREDITH
               Right.

     They've arrived at a crossroads on the stairs - graphic signs
     explain the choices: one way for Buses, Taxis and exits - the
     other for Trains: ROMA, VENEZIA, MILANO.  They're going in
     different directions.

                         MEREDITH (cont'd)
                   (offering her hand)
               So - partners in disguise.
                   (looks at the signs)
               Bye.

     EXT. COASTAL ROAD FROM NAPLES. LATE AFTERNOON.

     A BUS rolls around a coastal road cut into the side of a
     cliff, mountain above, blue sea below.

     INT. BUS. LATE AFTERNOON.

     Ripley sits surrounded by teeming life. The bus slows at a
     new town. People get off.

     INT/EXTERIOR. BUS ARRIVES MONGIBELLO. LATE DAY.

     Later, the day ending. Ripley looks out as they continue on
     their journey. Arriving at a small fishing port they wind
     down through a square, passing the local church.

     EXT. MONGIBELLO, FISHERMAN'S WHARF. LATE DAY.

     And then the bus is in the heart of a wharf. On one side
     there's evidence of the fisherman's life, nets, old men
     working. Opposite there's a tiny cafe spilling out onto the
     street, young guys hang out, play table football, lounge on
     their Vespas. The Driver chants -

                         DRIVER
               MONGIBELLO!

     Ripley gets out, lugging his cases, as the bus continues on
     its way. He looks around him. He feels completely foreign.

     EXT. MIRAMARE HOTEL/BOAT AT SEA. MORNING.

     A SAILBOAT has slid into his view, now drops anchor, drops
     the sail.  A couple dive off and swim towards shore.

     ALL OF THIS IS FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF RIPLEY, who's
     watching the events through binoculars from his tiny balcony
     in the Miramare Hotel. An Italian Vocabulary Book is perched
     on his knees and, during this, he continues his study,
     mouthing the Italian words.

                         RIPLEY
                   (looking at a long, lean girl
                    about to dive)
               La fidanzata a una faccia.  The fiancÈe
               has a face.  La fidanzata e Marge.

     Her partner, DICKIE GREENLEAF, dives too. They're brown,
     beautiful, perfect. Ripley notices the name of the boat:
     "BIRD".

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
               Questo e la mia faccia.....

     The golden couple emerge from the sea. Dickie shakes off the
     water, grins.

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
               This is my face.

     He double-checks himself with the vocabulary book.

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
               Questa...e la mia faccia. Questa e la
               faccia di Dickie.

     EXT. MONGIBELLO. DAY.

     Ripley emerges from one of the beach cabins, and stands on
     the edge of the sand on a wooden walkway. He's wearing A TINY
     LIME-GREEN BATHING SUIT. He loathes beaches. A couple of boys
     turn laconically and watch him.

     Ripley puts on his shoes and scurries to the sea. He feels
     ridiculous, his skin alabaster against the brown bodies.
     Finally, the shame is too great and he pulls off his shoes
     and dashes to the water, where he luxuriates in the coolness
     of it before wading out of the sea, and walking straight up
     to Dickie.

                         RIPLEY
               Dickie Greenleaf?

     Dickie squints at Ripley, who holds his shoes, lamely.

                         DICKIE
               Who's this?

                         RIPLEY
               It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at
               Princeton together.

                         DICKIE
               Okay.
                   (he sits up)
               And did we know each other?

                         RIPLEY
               Well, I knew you, so I suppose you must
               have known me.

                         DICKIE
                   (to Marge)
               Princeton is like a fog, America's like a
               fog.
                   (to Ripley)
               This is Marge Sherwood. Tom - sorry, what
               was it?

                         RIPLEY
               Ripley. Hullo. How do you do.

                         MARGE
               How do you do.

                         DICKIE
               What are you doing in Mongi?

                         RIPLEY
               Nothing. Nothing much. Passing through.

                         DICKIE
                   (finds this idea absurd)
               Passing through! You're so white. Did you
               ever see a guy so white, Marge?  Gray,
               actually.

                         RIPLEY
               It's just an undercoat.
                   (Marge laughs)

                         DICKIE
               Say again?

                         RIPLEY
               You know, a primer.

                         DICKIE
               That's funny.

     He shares some intimacy with Marge, makes her laugh.  Ripley
     stands as they wrestle around him. Marge looks up.

                         MARGE
               You should come and have lunch with us,
               before you go - Dickie?

                         DICKIE
               Sure.  Any time.

                         MARGE
               And be careful in the sun. Your gray's in
               danger of turning a little pink.

                         RIPLEY
               Thanks. Well, a coincidence.

     EXT. MONGIBELLO. EARLY MORNING.

     ANOTHER DAY.  Church Bells ringing. Dickie, dressed in
     shorts, comes bumping up the cobbled path towards the square
     on his MOTORSCOOTER. He stops by a steep flight of steps.
     RIPLEY, a book in hand, unseen, walking up a hill, catches
     all this and, intrigued, watches as a young Italian beauty,
     SILVANA, has a spikey, flirtatious exchange with Dickie, then
     climbs on the scooter, behind him.

                         DICKIE
               I've been looking for you everywhere.

                         SILVANA
               Ah, today you're looking for me.  And
               where have you been the rest of the week?
               Pig.  With your American girl?  I hate
               you, you know?

                         DICKIE
               What?

                         SILVANA
               I hate you.

     And RIPLEY watches them as they rattle down the hill towards
     the sea.

     EXT. MARGE'S HOUSE. AFTERNOON.

     Dickie appears in Marge's garden, the sea behind his head.
     Marge is sitting at her outside table surrounded by some of
     the remnants of lunch.  Dickie's sheepish, showered, late.

                         DICKIE
               Sorry, sorry, sorry. I know, I'm late,
               I'm a swine.

                         MARGE
               Did you forget where I live? It's four
               o'clock.

                         DICKIE
               I just woke up.  I'm sorry.

                         MARGE
               You just woke up!

                         DICKIE
               Fausto and I - we took the boat out, we
               were fishing, and then it was dawn and
               we'd caught absolutely nothing.

                         MARGE
               Well, we ate everything without you.

                         DICKIE
               We?

                         MARGE
               Yes, Tom Ripley's here.

     As Ripley appears with the tray to collect more dishes.

                         DICKIE
               Who? Oh, Tom, hello, how are you? We
               thought you'd disappeared. We were going
               to send out a search party.

                         RIPLEY
               No, still here.

                         MARGE
               Tom was telling me about his trip over.
               Made me laugh so much I got a nosebleed.

                         DICKIE
               Is that good?

                         MARGE
               Shut up!

     Marge flicks him with a napkin. They start to wrestle,
     excluding Tom.

                         RIPLEY
               I'm intruding.

                         DICKIE
               Can you mix a martini?

                         RIPLEY
                   (hesitant)
               Sure.

                         MARGE
                   (going inside)
               I'll do it. I make a fabulous martini.

                         DICKIE
               Everybody should have one talent.
                   (to Ripley)
               What's yours?

                         RIPLEY
                   (without a beat)
               Forging signatures. Telling lies.
               Impersonating practically anybody.

                         DICKIE
                   (enjoying this banter)
               That's three. Nobody should have more
               than one talent. Okay, do an impression.

                         RIPLEY
               Now?  Okay.  Wait a minute.  Talent -
                   (his voice ages, his face
                    changes)
               The only talent my son has is for cashing
               his allowance.

                         DICKIE
                   (absolutely thrown)
               What? What's this?

                         RIPLEY
               I like to sail, believe me, I love to
               sail! Instead I make boats and other
               people sail them.

                         DICKIE
                   (incredibly impressed)
               Stop! It's too much!  You're making all
               the hairs on my neck stand up!

                         RIPLEY
                   (relishing it)
               Jazz, let's face it, it's just an
               insolent noise.

                         DICKIE
               I feel like he's here. Horrible. Like the
               old bastard is here right now!  That's
               brilliant!  How do you know him?

                         RIPLEY
               I met him in New York.

                         DICKIE
               Marge! You've got to hear this!

                         MARGE
                   (returning with the drinks)
               What?  What?

                         DICKIE
               Meet my father, Herbert Richard Greenleaf
               1st.

                         RIPLEY
               Pleasure to meet you, Dickie's made a
               fine catch. I know Emily thinks so.

                         MARGE
               What's going on?

                         DICKIE
               Uncanny!

                         MARGE
               I don't get it.

                         RIPLEY
               Could you ever conceive of going there,
               Tom, and bringing him back?

                         DICKIE
               What?

                         RIPLEY
               I'd pay you. If you would go to Italy and
               persuade my son to come home. I'd pay you
               $1000.

     INT/EXT. MONGIBELLO CHURCH AND SQUARE. DUSK.

     A christening is over and now the whole village is pouring
     out of Church for the Passeggiata in Sunday best. Girls arm
     in arm parade. Boys arm in arm evaluate. New babies are
     compared and fussed over. Old people smoke, talk, shrug.
     Dickie is walking with Ripley, seething about his father's
     scheming.

                         DICKIE
               I'm never going back. To actually hire
               somebody to come all the way here to drag
               me back home - got to be insane, hasn't
               he?

     SILVANA comes out of church arm in arm with a man, her
     fiancee, as part of a foursome which includes Dickie's pal
     FAUSTO. Silvana's eyes flick towards Dickie, otherwise
     there's no acknowledgement as they all greet each other.
     Dickie introduces Tom, then they move on.

                         DICKIE (cont'd)
               I'm never going back!

                         RIPLEY
               No, I think your mother, her illness -

                         DICKIE
               It's got nothing to do with my mother!
               She's had leukemia for - ! This is what
               makes me boil about him! HE wants me
               back! - it's got nothing to do with my
               mother.

                         RIPLEY
               I don't know, Dickie, I'm just telling
               you what I -

                         DICKIE
                   (interrupting)
               Go back!  Go back to New York or call him
               if you can find a telephone that works,
               and tell him wild horses wouldn't drag me
               back to him or his shipyard.

     EXT. DICKIE'S HOUSE, MONGIBELLO. AFTERNOON.

     Ripley appears, with his meagre luggage at Dickie's front
     door. He's carrying his tote bag under his arm, the bottom of
     which seems to be unstitched and held together only by his
     fingers. Marge is on the terrace, she looks down to see Tom
     talking with Dickie.

                         MARGE
               Hi Tom.

                         DICKIE
                   (looks up)
               Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye.

                         MARGE
               I'll come down.

                         DICKIE
                   (to Ripley)
               Did you speak to my father?

                         RIPLEY
               You were right about the telephones.
               There are no lines, there's some problem.

                         MARGE
                   (coming out of the front door)
               Hello Tom. You're off? What are your
               plans?

                         RIPLEY
               Back, I suppose, slowly as I can.

     He goes to shake her hand and as he releases the tote bag the
     seam splits and records spill to the ground, scattering. He
     bends down, starts gathering them up. Marge helps.

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
               Oh, damn, sorry, this bag's -

     Dickie's delighted when he sees the Jazz titles.

                         DICKIE
               You like jazz!

                         RIPLEY
                   (gathering up the records)
               I love jazz.

                         DICKIE
                   (holding up a Chet Baker)
               This is the best. Marge says she likes
               jazz, but she things Glenn Miller is
               jazz.

                         MARGE
               I never said that!

                         RIPLEY
               Bird. That's jazz.

                         DICKIE
               Bird! Ask me the name of my sailboat -

                         RIPLEY
               I don't know. What's the name of your
               sailboat?

                         DICKIE
               Bird!

                         MARGE
               Which is ridiculous. Boats are female,
               everyone knows you can't call a boat
               after a man.

                         RIPLEY
               He's not a man, he's a god.

                         DICKIE
                   (excited)
               Okay, we're going to Naples. There's a
               club, it's not a club, it's a cellar.

                         MARGE
               It's vile.

                         DICKIE
               Yes, it's vile. Don't worry, you don't
               have to come.
                   (to Ripley)
               It's great.  You're going to love it.

     INT. JAZZ CLUB, NAPLES. NIGHT.

     A cavern blue with smoke. A surprisingly good QUINTET blast
     out their version of MOANIN'. Dickie and Ripley arrive and
     make their way to a table where Fausto is sitting with
     friends. It's too noisy for conversation, but Dickie shouts
     introductions and they shake Ripley's hand.  Dickie is
     instantly absorbed in the music, Ripley absorbed in Dickie.
     An attractive Italian Girl, DAHLIA, comes over, kisses
     Dickie, pulls off his hat, puts it on, there's no room for
     her to sit, so she sits on Dickie's lap, smoking his
     cigarette.  Dickie raises his eyebrow at Tom, but it's
     clearly no hardship. Then the band strikes up the intro to Tu
     vuo' fa' L'Americano - a hit which reflects the current craze
     for all things American - and Fausto pulls a protesting Dickie
     up onto the stage.

                         FAUSTO
                   (improvising in Italian)
               Ladies and Gentlemen. Dickie Greenleaf,
               all the way from America... etc.

     Fausto starts to sing. Dickie joins in the chorus. Everybody
     claps. Dickie talks off-mic to Fausto.

                         FAUSTO (cont'd)
               And a big round of applause for a new
               friend from New York - Tom Ripley!

     Ripley's mortified, but Dickie jumps off the stage and pulls
     him up.  The song continues and now, at the chorus, it's
     Dickie and Ripley who have to sing. Ripley, of course, can
     sing well, if not confident in this arena. Soon the audience
     is clapping, standing on tables, dancing, Dahlia prominent.

                         DICKIE (O/S)
                   (reading)
               I have bumped into an old friend from
               Princeton - a fellow named Tom Ripley.
               He says he's going to haunt me until I
               agree to come back to New York with
               him...

     INT. DICKIE'S HOUSE. NOON.

     Dickie, in his new dressing gown, is sitting at the table,
     typing. Ripley's head emerges from behind the couch on which
     he has been enjoying a blissful sleep.

                         DICKIE
                   (grins)
               Good afternoon!

                         RIPLEY
               What time is it?
                   (puts on his glasses and checks
                    his watch)
               Oh God!  Do you always type your letters?
                   (points at the letter)
               That should be two Ts.

                         DICKIE
               I can't write and I can't spell.  That's
               the privilege of a first-class education.
               You're upstairs at the back. I think
               Ermelinda made the bed up.

                         RIPLEY
               This is so good of you.

                         DICKIE
               Don't say it again. Now you're a Double
               Agent and we're going to string my Dad
               alone, I was thinking we might buy a
               little car with the expense money he's
               sending you. What do you think, Marge...a
               little Cinquecento with my Dad's money?

     Marge has appeared, carrying Camparis.

                         MARGE
               Dickie, you can't even drive a car!  No,
               what we need urgently is an icebox. What
               do you think, Tom? Agree with me and I'll
               be your friend for life.

                         RIPLEY
               I absolutely agree with Marge.

     INT. DICKIE'S HOUSE, UPSTAIRS. DAY.

     Ripley locates his room, puts down his luggage in what is a
     comfortable and simple room, then heads back downstairs only
     to be tempted by the open door of Dickie's bedroom.

     INT. DICKIE'S BEDROOM. DAY.

     Ripley explores the casual elegance of Dickie's bedroom - the
     Louis Vuitton chest, the closet's open door spilling out
     shirts, ties. On the dressing table there are toiletries,
     cufflinks scattered, a silk tie.  Ripley picks up the tie and
     walks towards the open window below which is a terrace where
     lunch is being laid. Marge and Dickie are chatting. Shreds of
     conversation float up to Ripley.

                         DICKIE
               It'll just be for a little while.  He can
               be... he makes me laugh.

                         MARGE
               Okay, darling.

                         DICKIE
               You'd say if you mind?

                         MARGE
               No, I like him.

                         DICKIE
               Marge, you like everybody.

                         MARGE
               I don't like you.

                         DICKIE
               Then I'll go to your place and you can
               move in with Tom.

     Above them, Ripley repeats these phrases, carefully, testing
     the cadences, No, I like him. Marge, you like everybody,
     until he's as accurate as a taperecorder.

     EXT. TERRACE OF DICKIE'S HOUSE. DAY.

     Ermelinda is clearing away lunch. Ripley is changed and
     sitting at the table with Marge while Dickie works on the
     coffee. Ripley watches him, studying everything: the way he
     uses the expresso machine, the way he wears no socks, his
     pants, his rings.

                         DICKIE
               Now you know why Miss Sherwood always
               shows up for breakfast.  It's not love
               it's the coffee machine.

                         MARGE
               It's the one task Dickie can do on his
               own - make coffee.

                         DICKIE
               Shut up.

                         MARGE
               Oh darling - is that for me?

                         DICKIE
               No it's for Tom as he didn't complain.

                         RIPLEY
                   (as Dickie hands him his cup)
               That ring's so great. The green one.

                         MARGE
                   (delighted)
               Tom, I love you!
                   (to Dickie)
               See!
                   (to Ripley)
               I bought it for him, for his birthday.

                         RIPLEY
               It's superb.

                         DICKIE
               I had to promise, capital P, never to
               take it off - otherwise I'd give it to
               you.

                         MARGE
                   (flicking a crumb at him)
               Bastard!
                   (to Ripley)
               Isn't it great, Tom? I found it in
               Naples.  I bargained for about two weeks.

                         DICKIE
               I hope it wasn't cheap.

                         MARGE
               Oh, it was.

                         RIPLEY
                   (to Marge)
               I have to find a birthday present for
               Frances. Perhaps you can help me?

                         MARGE
               Frances?

                         RIPLEY
               My fiancÈe.

                         DICKIE
               You're a dark horse, Ripley. Engaged?

                         RIPLEY
               Your parents met her.

                         DICKIE
               Oh God - I can just imagine - if only
               Dickie would settle down... doesn't every
               parent deserve a grandchild?  Never! I
               swear on your ring, Marge.  I am never
               going back.

     EXT. BIRD SAILBOAT. DAY.

     The Bird is sailing off the coast of Mongibello. There's a
     manoeuvre going on with the sail.  Captain Dickie supervises
     his crew of Marge and a painfully awkward anxious-to-please
     Ripley.  Dickie goes over to help him.

                         RIPLEY
               I'm doing this wrong, aren't I?

                         DICKIE
               You're doing great. We'll make a sailor
               of you yet. You're doing really well.

                         MARGE
               Dubious but special honor, Tom - crewing
               Dickie's boat.  Alright, bar's open.

                         DICKIE
               Yes please!

     She heads for the cabin. Dickie settles down beside Ripley.

                         RIPLEY
               Could we sail to Venice?

                         DICKIE
               Sure.  I love Venice.

                         RIPLEY
               I have to go to Venice.

                         DICKIE
               See Venice and die, isn't that right? Or
               is it Rome? You do something and die,
               don't you?  Okay, Venice is on the list.

                         RIPLEY
               And Rome.

                         DICKIE
               Do you ski?
                   (Ripley frowns)
               Don't tell me - you're a lost cause!
               That's the next thing to deal with. We're
               planning to go to Cortina at Christmas.
               Excellent skiing. Excellent.
                   (as Marge reappears)
               Marge - Ripley can't ski.  We'll have to
               teach him that, too. Have you ever known
               such low class?

                         MARGE
               Poor Tom. Good thing we're not getting
               married. We might have to invite him on
               our honeymoon.

     EXT. MONGIBELLO. LATE DAY.

     Marge and Ripley are on a shopping expedition. They walk down
     the hill towards the grocery shop, next to the bar in the
     little square. Ripley has asked Marge how she and Dickie met.

                         MARGE
               Oh I hated New York - that Park Avenue
               crowd - so I fled to Paris to work on my
               book, and I was always going to this cafe
               with Jean-Jacques, and Dickie used to
               play his saxophone outside and I would
               see him and he would see me, and he would
               play My Funny Valentine. It was only
               later that I realised he only knows about
               six songs.

     They've arrived at the Grocery Store. Alessandra, the woman
     who owns the store greets them.  Silvana, who's her daughter,
     is also there, and less comfortable. She waits for Marge's
     order.

                         MARGE (cont'd)
                   (to Silvana, in Italian)
               Buono Sera, Silvana. Por favore: arance e
               pane, e del prosciutto.

                         SILVANA
               E fichi?  Come sempre?

                         MARGE
               Si.  Come sempre.  Grazie.

     Silvana goes inside for the meat and bread. Marge frowns.

                         MARGE (cont'd)
                   (back to Ripley)
               Anyway, then one day, we go in, I see
               Dickie, he starts playing My Funny
               Valentine, and then all of a sudden he
               just walks into the cafe, right in front
               of Jean-Jacques, and grabs me! Now I had
               never spoken to him in my life - he said
               I'm going to Italy, tomorrow, and I want
               you to come with me. So I did.

     At the edge of the square there's A BOCCE AREA, where men
     throw metal balls along a track, aiming to get closest to a
     small cue. Dickie is there, playing intensely with Fausto and
     two other guys, one of whom we've seen before with Silvana.
     Ripley and Marge loop back towards home, taking in the Bocce
     en route. Dickie waves. They wave back. Marge calls to him.

                         MARGE (cont'd)
               If you're not at my place by 7.00, Tom
               and I are running off together.

                         DICKIE
               Okay.

     EXT. MARGE'S HOUSE. EARLY EVENING.

     Dickie and Ripley are leaving.  They're fooling around.
     Dickie jumps on Ripley's shoulders. Marge watches from the
     top of the garden.

     EXT. MONGIBELLO SQUARE. EARLY EVENING.

     Dickie and Ripley, still horsing about, pass Silvana's
     grocery store.  Dickie dismounts, goes over to Silvana, who's
     tense, a little troubled. They huddle, Ripley isolated.

                         SILVANA
               Did you get my message?  I want to talk
               to you.

                         DICKIE
               I want to talk to you too...Smile for me.

     And Dickie's already gone, back to Ripley feinting to box him
     then dancing, satyr-like, down the hill.

     EXT. COASTAL ROAD TO NAPLES. EVENING.

     Dickie and Ripley on the Vespa. There's a steep incline where
     the road winds down towards Naples and, as the Vespa gains
     speed, Ripley is happy to cling to Dickie.

                         DICKIE
               You're breaking my ribs!

                         RIPLEY
               What?

                         DICKIE
               You're breaking my ribs!

     INT. JAZZ CLUB, NAPLES. NIGHT.

     Ripley's really singing, carrying the burden of My Funny
     Valentine in a flawless imitation of Chet Baker. Dickie is
     playing some sax. After a verse, there's spontaneous
     applause. Dickie, impressed beams at Ripley.

     INT. DICKIE'S HOUSE. NIGHT.

     A NEW ICEBOX, incongruous in pride of place in the living
     room, casts its glow on a delighted Dickie as he pulls out a
     couple of beers, handing one to Ripley who is paging through
     his copy of the Collected Works of Shakespeare.

                         DICKIE
               I could fuck this icebox I love it so
               much.
                   (considering Ripley)
               What were you actually doing in New York?

                         RIPLEY
               I played piano in a few places.

                         DICKIE
               That's one job, you told me a lot of
               jobs.

                         RIPLEY
               A few places - that's a few jobs. Anyway,
               I don't want to think about New York.

                         DICKIE
               The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I
               spend hours speculating.
                   (drinking)
               Cold beer. Thank you Dad.

                         RIPLEY
               Copy out from here...

     He hands the book to Dickie, pointing out the lines.

                         DICKIE
                   (staring to write on the back
                    of a postcard)
               I love the fact you brought Shakespeare
               with you and no clothes.  Ermelinda says
               you wash the same shirt out every night.
               Is that true?

                         RIPLEY
               No! I've got more than one shirt!

                         DICKIE
               She can do that stuff for you. Anyway,
               just wear some of my things, wear
               anything you want, most of it's ancient.
                   (he's finished writing)

                         RIPLEY
               Now your signature.
                   (watching him write)
               Not "Dickie". Your signature.

     Dickie writes his signature at the bottom of the postcard.
     Ripley studies the writing, takes off his glasses to clean
     them. Dickie looks at him.

                         DICKIE
               Without the glasses you're not even ugly.
                   (takes them, tries them on)
               I don't need them because I never read.
               How do I look.

                         RIPLEY
               Like Clark Kent.
                   (takes them back, puts them on
                    beaming at Dickie)
               Now Superman.

     Dickie cuffs him.  Ripley looks down at the postcard.

                         DICKIE
               I know. I write like a child.

                         RIPLEY
               Pretty vile. See this: The S and the T,
               do you see? - fine, vulnerable - that's
               pain, that's secret pain.

                         DICKIE
               It must be a deep secret, cause I don't
               know about it.

                         RIPLEY
               Your handwriting - nothing more naked.
               See - nothing's quite touching the line -
               that's vanity.

                         DICKIE
                   (flattered)
               Well we certainly know that's true.

     INT. DICKIE'S BATHROOM. NIGHT.

     Dickie's in the bath. Ripley, dressed, sits on the stool next
     to the bath. They're in the middle of playing chess, the
     board propped on the bath tray. Ripley puts his hand in the
     water, checking the temperature. He turns on the faucet for a
     burst of hot. Ripley is absurdly happy. He pours some wine.

                         DICKIE
               Do you have any brothers?

                         RIPLEY
               No, no brothers, no sisters.

                         DICKIE
               me neither. Nor does Marge. All only
               children - what does that mean?

     He looks at Ripley who looks at him, a little too long.

                         RIPLEY
               Means we never shared a bath.
               I'm cold. Can I get in?

                         DICKIE
               No!

                         RIPLEY
               I didn't mean with you in it.

                         DICKIE
                   (standing)
               Okay, you get in. I'm like a prune
               anyway.

     He gets out, walks past Ripley, who doesn't turn around. But
     Dickie's reflected in the mirror. Ripley looks, then Dickie
     turns, holds his look momentarily before flicking him with
     his towel.

     INT/EXT. AMERICAN EXPRESS OFFICE, NAPLES. DAY.

     An OFFICIAL is studying Dickie's passport photograph. It's
     not a recent picture. The official looks suspicious. Dickie
     is used to it.

                         DICKIE
               It is me. It's an old picture.
                   (sighs at Ripley)
               Every time - 'is it you?  Doesn't look
               like you'.

     He's signing for his allowance. He has a smart document case
     with his initials prominently embossed.  Ripley watches him
     sign and collect a large wad of notes.

                         CLERK
               Letters - Greenleaf, and for Ripley.

     Ripley collects and studies his mail. As they walk outside he
     holds up one letter to Dickie.

                         RIPLEY
               Fran.
                   (anticipating her letter)
               I miss you, where are you coming home?
               Stop telling me what a great time you're
               having, how you love Dickie... and Marge
               and...
                   (the next letter)
               And this one, I think, is your dad...

     INT. TRAIN TO ROME. DAY.

     Ripley sits reading the LETTER from Herbert Greenleaf.  He
     frowns, stops reading, looks out of the window.

                         DICKIE
               What does he say?

                         RIPLEY
               He's getting impatient. He wants me to
               reassure him you'll be home by
               Thanksgiving.

                         DICKIE
               You've got to get a new jacket. Really.
               You must be sick of the same clothes. I'm
               sick of seeing you in them.

                         RIPLEY
               I can't. I can't keep spending your
               father's money.

                         DICKIE
               I love how responsible you are. My Dad
               should make you Chief Accountant or
               something.  Let me buy you a jacket.
               There's a great place when we get to
               Rome, Batistoni.

     Ripley loves this idea and mouths the word, "Batistoni".

                         DICKIE (cont'd)
               Andiamo a Roma.  We're taking Tom to
               Roma!

     EXT. ARCARI'S CAFE, PIAZZA NAVONA, ROME. DAY.

     Ripley and Dickie sit outside at a Cafe in the Piazza Navona.
     Very smart, very sophisticated, very young crowd.  There are
     already several empty coffee cups and a half empty bottle of
     Frascati.  Ripley has his guide book out and is incredibly
     impatient. Dickie, meanwhile, has stretched out for the
     duration.

                         RIPLEY
               Where do we find a carozza for the Forum,
               or can we hire any of them - ?

                         DICKIE
               Relax.

                         RIPLEY
               It's just there's so much to do in a
               single day.

                         DICKIE
               Relax. The most important question is
               where to eat. I hope Freddie made a
               reservation.

                         RIPLEY
               Freddie?

                         DICKIE
               Freddie Miles.  You know - he's
               organizing the Cortina skiing trip.

     Ripley hates the idea of having this special day invaded. A
     horn makes him look up as FREDDIE MILES illegally parks his
     open top sports car opposite the cafe, sees Dickie and
     bustles over.  He's a heavy-set American with a reddish
     crewcut. Ripley finds him disgusting to look at. Dickie is
     delighted.

                         DICKIE (cont'd)
               Frederico!

                         FREDDIE
               Ciao bello.
                   (noticing a beautiful woman in
                    an open-topped car)
               Don't you want to fuck every woman you
               see.  Just once.

     They kiss cheeks, continental-style.

                         DICKIE
               This is Tom Ripley. Freddie Miles.

                         FREDDIE
                   (mugging)
               Hey, if I'm late, think what her
               husband's saying!

     He fills Dickie's glass with wine and drinks it standing up.

                         FREDDIE (cont'd)
               So let's go. I got us a table outside at
               Fabrizio's.

     And Dickie's up, leaving Ripley to pick up all the tiny
     checks to work out the bill and pay it.

                         DICKIE
               I'll tell you - I am so cabin-crazy with
               Mongi.

     Freddie and Dickie link arms Italian-style and cross the
     street to Freddie's car.

                         FREDDIE
               I know.  I was there.
                   (looks back to see Ripley
                    struggling to settle the
                    check)
               Tommy!  It's S.R.O.  Two seater.
               Standing Room Only.  Chop, chop, Tommy!

     Ripley, abandoned, goes over. There's no room in the car. He
     has to crouch in the rear.

                         FREDDIE (cont'd)
               You're going to have to sit between us.
               But don't put your shoes on the seat,
               know what I mean, put them one on top of
               the other.  Okay?

     INT. A JAZZ RECORD STORE. LATE AFTERNOON.

     This record store is hidden away down a cobbled alley, and
     stuffed with the trendiest Romans, all of whom rifle the
     stacks under a fog of cigarette smoke.  There are two
     LISTENING BOOTHS, one of which has Freddie and Dickie crammed
     into it, sharing a set of headphones.  Ripley stands outside
     the booth, holding both of their jackets like a manservant,
     while inside and behind the glass doors they chat animatedly.
     He looks longingly at the street, where the light is fading.
     Dickie catches his hangdog expression and pushes open the
     accordion doors.

                         DICKIE
               Look, Tom, we've got to go to a club and
               meet some friends of Freddie's. The best
               thing is - if you want to be a tourist -
               grab a cab and we can meet up at the
               railway station.

                         RIPLEY
                   (absolutely crestfallen)
               What club?

                         DICKIE
               Freddie's arranged it with some of the
               skiing crowd. Come if you want but I
               thought you wanted to see the Forum...?

                         RIPLEY
               I did. And then maybe get the jacket and
               what have you...

                         FREDDIE
                   (from inside the booth)
               Dick - you've got to hear this!

                         DICKIE
                   (oblivious to Ripley's pain)
               Listen, just take one of mine when we get
               back. Don't worry about it.  I did the
               Forum with Marge and, frankly, once is
               enough in anyone's life.

     Ripley hands him the coats, turns away.

                         DICKIE
               Ciao.  Have fun.

     Ripley heads for the door, then comes back, raps on the
     booth.  Dickie pushes it open.

                         RIPLEY
               You said to make sure you didn't miss the
               train. It leaves at eight.

     EXT. THE CAPITOL. LATE AFTERNOON.

     Ripley hikes up Michelangelo's Arcoeli Steps. Then he's
     looking down from the Campodoglio at the Forum below. Then
     he's walking by the oversized fragments of the Colossus. This
     is the real Ripley, the lover of beauty, inspired by art, by
     antiquity. He's awed. He's cold. He so much wishes he weren't
     alone.

     INT. ROME RAILWAY STATION. NIGHT.

     It's past eight, Ripley stands, one foot on the guard step of
     the Naples train, waiting forlornly for Dickie, then giving
     up as the train pulls away. He pulls the door to his
     compartment closed, and sits inside the train alone.

     INT. DICKIE'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

     There's music playing, Bing Crosby's "May I". Very loud.
     Ripley dances to the mirror, SPECTACLES ABANDONED and DRESSED
     AS DICKIE IN HIS TUXEDO, MINUS TROUSERS. He adjusts his hair,
     catches one of Dickie's expressions.  There are clothes
     abandoned everywhere.  He's been having a big dressing-up
     session. He sings along with Bing.

                         DICKIE (O/S)
               What are you doing?

     Ripley turns, horrified, to see Dickie standing in the
     doorway.  The music thumps away.

                         RIPLEY
               Oh - just amusing myself.  Sorry, Dickie.
                   (pause)
               I didn't think you were coming back.

     Dickie turns off the record player.

                         DICKIE
               I wish you'd get out of my clothes.

     Ripley starts undressing, his fingers clumsy with
     mortification and shock.  Dickie looks at his feet, shakes
     his head.

                         DICKIE (cont'd)
               Shoes too?

                         RIPLEY
                   (lame, ashamed)
               You said I could pick out a jacket and I
               just... Sorry.

                         DICKIE
               Get undressed in your own room, would
               you?

                         RIPLEY
               I thought you'd missed the train.

                         DICKIE
               Freddie drove me back in his car.

                         RIPLEY
                   (horrified)
               Is Freddie here?

                         DICKIE
               He's downstairs.

                         RIPLEY
               I was just fooling around. Don't say
               anything. Sorry.

     Dickie lets him leave and then sits amongst the debris of the
     dressing-up session, not amused.

     EXT. DICKIE'S TERRACE. DAY.

     Ripley comes down, apprehensive, to find Marge and Dickie and
     Freddie having a jolly breakfast on the terrace. Dickie looks
     perfectly happy.

                         MARGE
               Hi, Tom.  Come join us.

                         FREDDIE
               I want this job of yours, Tommy. I was
               just saying - You live in Italy, sleep in
               Dickie's house, eat Dickie's food, wear
               his clothes, and his father picks up the
               tab. If you get bored, let me know, I'll
               do it!

     EXT. THE OCEAN, ABOARD THE BIRD. DAY.

     The boat is drifting.  Freddie and Dickie and Marge are
     swimming, then Marge climbs back onto the boat, where Ripley
     is sitting alone, reading.

                         MARGE
               You really should go in, it's marvellous.

                         RIPLEY
               I'm fine.

     She approaches him, conscious of his isolation. She's in a
     red bikini, and she towels herself dry as they speak.

                         MARGE
               Are you okay?

                         RIPLEY
               Sure.

     They watch Dickie and Freddie fooling around in the water.

                         MARGE
               The thing with Dickie - it's like the sun
               shines on you and it's glorious, then he
               forgets you and it's very very cold.

                         RIPLEY
               So I'm learning.

                         MARGE
               He's not even aware of it. When you've
               got his attention you feel like you're
               the only person in the world. That's why
               everybody loves him. Other times...

     There's a yell from Dickie as Freddie wrestles with him.

                         DICKIE
                   (laughing and choking)
               He's drowning me!

                         MARGE
               It's always the same whenever someone new
               comes into his life - Freddie, Fausto,
               Peter Smith-Kingsley - he's wonderful -
               did you meet him, he's a musician? -
               ... and especially you, of course... and
               that's only the boys.

     They watch as Freddie pushes Dickie under the surface.

                         MARGE (cont'd)
               Tell me, why is it when men play they
               always play at killing each other...?
               I'm sorry about Cortina by the way.

                         RIPLEY
               What about Cortina?

                         MARGE
               Didn't Dick say? - he talked to
               Freddie... apparently it's not going to
               work out -
                   (Ripley's devastated, Marge
                    notices, can't look at him)
               Freddie says there aren't enough rooms.

     EXT. OCEAN, ABOARD THE BIRD. DUSK.

     LATER and now the boat is sailing again. Ripley is sitting in
     his spot. Dickie and Freddie are at the tiller.

                         DICKIE
               Come on, Frederico, do you really have
               to go back?  At least stick around for
               the Festival of the Madonna.

                         FREDDIE
               I don't think so. Come back with me to
               Rome. There's this great new club.  Have
               some drinks, lotta ladies...

     Marge, still in her bikini, disappears into the cabin. Dickie
     makes a face at Freddie.

                         DICKIE
               Do you think you can steer this thing?

                         FREDDIE
               Sure.

                         DICKIE
               Just point her at Capri and avoid the
               rocks.

                         FREDDIE
               What are you doing?

                         DICKIE
               Marge-maintenance.

                         FREDDIE
               Aye, aye.

     Dickie heads towards the cabin. Freddie takes over the
     tiller. There's a breeze and the sailboat cuts through the
     water.

     From where Ripley sits he can see Capri in the distance, but
     he can also look down into the cabin, its porthole offering
     him a restricted view.  He looks down and there's a flash of
     flesh, then nothing.  Then as the boat swings with the waves,
     he glimpses the bikini top flung over a chair, and then
     Marge's bare foot kicking out rhythmically, the red-painted
     toes straining.  Ripley's mesmerized, aroused, and absolutely
     betrayed.

                         FREDDIE (cont'd)
               Tommy - How's the peeping? Come on Tommy,
               you were looking.  Tommy Tommy Tommy.

     Shamed, Ripley looks away. He stares at the water, parting
     before the boat, its turmoil reflecting his.

     EXT. DICKIE'S MOORING. DAY.

     The Bird returns to the mooring by Dickie's House.  Dickie as
     ever Captain of the Ship, clambering around, shouting
     instructions, with Ripley, Marge and Freddie as crew.  Ripley
     looks back at shore. Silvana stands watching, staring.
     Dickie notices her too.

     EXT. MONGIBELLO SLIPWAY. LATE DAY.

     A WOMAN'S HEAD suddenly breaks the surface of the water.

     It's a statue of the Virgin Mary, life size, adorned with
     flowers and a lace veil.  As she is revealed, wooden,
     staring, four men emerge, lifting the statue on a palette,
     wading towards the shore, the Madonna aloft on their
     shoulders.

     The whole town of Mongibello is in attendance for this Annual
     Festival of the Madonna del Mare, either standing in their
     fishing boats, or on shore and flanking the Parish Priest and
     altar boys and incense. RIPLEY, DICKIE and MARGE watch from
     Dickie's terrace. There are hymns and, as the statue is
     carried to the shore, the men's heads barely above the waves,
     the congregation applauds at the illusion that the Madonna is
     walking on water.

     Suddenly ANOTHER HEAD appears on the surface of the water,
     about fifty yards from the statue. There's a scream from
     among the crowd as someone notices the body. It's SILVANA.
     One of the MEN carrying the statue turns first towards the
     direction of the scream and then towards the floating corpse.
     It's Silvana's fiancee, and in a second he has let go of the
     palette, CAUSING IT TO TOPPLE, and - in absolute grief -
     wades, swims, splashes towards the body.

     PANDEMONIUM in the crowd, which breaks up, with other people
     splashing, fully clothed, into the water. From the terrace,
     Ripley turns and looks at Dickie, catching his eye.

     EXT. DICKIE'S TERRACE. LATE DAY.

     Marge and Ripley and Dickie watch from the terrace as below
     them an AMBULANCE takes away the body. It seems as if the
     whole town looks on - fiancee, parents, brothers, sisters,
     police, priest, etc. As the corpse is loaded into the vehicle
     A BRIEF SCUFFLE occurs between Silvana's fiancee and her
     brother. They are pulled apart. Then the ambulance pulls
     away.

                         RIPLEY
               What's the fight about? That's her
               fiancÈ, isn't it?  Are they blaming him?

                         DICKIE
                   (sharp)
               I don't know! Why are you asking me?
                   (agitated)
               How can it take an hour to find an
               ambulance?

                         MARGE
                   (conciliatory)
               Well, she was already dead, darling,
               wasn't she, so I suppose -

                         DICKIE
               I don't know why people say this
               country's civilised. It isn't. It's
               fucking primitive.

     And with that HE KICKS OUT VIOLENTLY AT A CHAIR SUPPORTING
     THE RECORDPLAYER. Records, machine, chair go flying across
     the terrace. Dickie storms inside.

                         MARGE
               Dickie!

                         RIPLEY
               I'll go and see what's the matter.

                         MARGE
               I'll go.

     INT. DICKIE'S HOUSE. LATE AFTERNOON.

     Later, Dickie is slumped in an armchair at the open window
     overlooking the slipway. He's playing sax. A forlorn, keening
     phrase from YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT LOVE IS. Ripley appears,
     begins tidying the mess in the living room.  He picks up
     empty bottles, an abandoned bikini top.

                         RIPLEY
               I know why you're upset.
                   (Dickie continues playing)
               I know about Silvana, Dickie. About you
               and Silvana.

     Dickie stops playing.

                         DICKIE
               What about us?

     He now has an armful of dishes and glasses and bottles.

                         DICKIE (cont'd)
                   (losing his temper)
               You don't have to clean up! Really!

     Ripley disappears into the kitchen.

                         DICKIE (cont'd)
                   (as Ripley returns)
               She was pregnant. Did you know that? Do
               you know what that means in a place like
               this?

                         RIPLEY
               I'm prepared to take the blame.

                         DICKIE
               What are you talking about?

                         RIPLEY
               You've been so good to me. You're the
               brother I never had. I'm the brother you
               never had.

                         DICKIE
               She came to me for help, she needed
               money, and I didn't help her. I didn't
               help her. Now she's dead and it's my
               fault.

                         RIPLEY
               I'm not going to say anything - to Marge,
               or anybody, the police - It's a secret
               between us and I'll keep it.

     And he disappears again, leaving Dickie to resume the sax,
     somehow in thrall to Ripley.

                         RIPLEY (O/S)
               Dear Tom, I think the time has come to
               discontinue your expense checks...

     EXT. AMERICAN EXPRESS, NAPLES. DAY.

     Ripley and Dickie are walking out of the American Express
     Office, Dickie pushing the rest of his money into his case,
     Ripley - despondent - reading aloud extracts from a letter
     from Herbert Greenleaf -

                         RIPLEY
               ...The thousand dollars, of course, was
               only due in the event that you succeeded
               in bringing Dickie home. Naturally, I
               hope the trip has afforded you some
               pleasure despite the failure of its main
               objective you need no longer consider
               yourself obligated to us in any way...

                         DICKIE
               You can't blame him.  You could hardly
               expect this to go on forever.

                         RIPLEY
               I thought you might write again. Now that
               we're brothers...

                         DICKIE
               I can't, how can I, in all decency? We've
               had a good run, haven't we?

                         RIPLEY
                   (increasingly miserable)
               What about Venice? Can we stick to that
               plan at least?

                         DICKIE
               I don't think so, Tom. You can't stay on
               here without money.  It's time we all
               moved on.  Besides I'm sick of Mongi.
               Especially now with everything - I really
               want to move to the North. I need to
               check out San Remo next week, find
               somewhere new to keep the boat.
               But it would be great, though, if you
               came with me.  Our last trip before you
               leave. There's a jazz festival - we could
               say goodbye in style.  What do you think?
               A last trip?

     INT. TRAIN TO SAN REMO. AFTERNOON.

     Dickie and Ripley travel up to San Remo. They sit next to
     each other. Dickie's asleep. Ripley lays his head on Dickie's
     shoulder, but as he does that, the ticket inspector announces
     the San Remo stop, taps on the window and Dickie stirs. Then
     Ripley plays his familiar game of studying his face in the
     reflection of the train window, so that he can move his head
     and see his reflection, then back and see Dickie's.  Dickie
     suddenly catches him staring. Ripley looks away.

                         DICKIE
                   (terse)
               Why do you do that thing - with your
               neck? On trains you always do that thing,
               it's so spooky.

     EXT. HOTEL TERRACE RESTAURANT, SAN REMO. NIGHT.

     Dickie and Ripley walk through the terrace of an hotel which
     lips out towards the sea. There's a restaurant and palms and
     a JAZZ QUINTET playing, American. Very cool. They pass the
     band. Dickie's captivated as they head for their table. They
     pass some girls at a table. Dickie smiles greedily.

                         DICKIE
               This is more like it. Didn't I tell you
               San Remo was crazy!

     They're shown to a good table. Dickie watches the band while
     their glasses are filled with champagne. Ripley looks happy.
     He's got Dickie all to himself.

                         RIPLEY
               To Mongibello and the happiest days of my
               life.

                         DICKIE
               To Mongi.  You're cheerful tonight.

                         RIPLEY
               I'm suddenly quite happy to be going
               back.

                         DICKIE
               That's good.

                         RIPLEY
               I've got plans!

                         DICKIE
               Ripley's plans.

                         RIPLEY
               Esatto. I'm always planning.

                         DICKIE
               Did I know you at Princeton, Tom? I
               didn't, did I?

                         RIPLEY
               Why are you asking all of a sudden?

                         DICKIE
               No reason. Because you're leaving, I
               guess. I don't think you were there, were
               you?

                         RIPLEY
               Why?

                         DICKIE
               I mean it as a compliment. You've got
               such great taste, I don't know. Most of
               the thugs at Princeton had tasted
               everything and had no taste. Used to say,
               the cream of America: rich and thick.
               Freddie's the perfect example.

                         RIPLEY
               Then I'll take it as a compliment.

                         DICKIE
               I knew it! I had a bet with Marge!

                         RIPLEY
                   (a beat)
               Ha.

                         DICKIE
               Do you even like jazz - or was that
               something for my benefit?

                         RIPLEY
                   (conceding, without guile)
               I've gotten to like it. I've gotten to
               like everything about the way you live.
               It's one big love affair. If you knew my
               life back home in New York...

     Dickie's distracted by the drummer who's playing an extrovert
     solo, doesn't hear the confession of love.

                         DICKIE
               I'm thinking of giving up the sax, what
               do you think about drums?

                         RIPLEY
               What?

                         DICKIE
               So cool.

     He mimes a high-hat and snare. Ripley can't quite credit this
     - it's superficiality.

     EXT. MID OCEAN. DAY.

     The bay of San Remo. DICKIE and RIPLEY have hired a motor 
     boat.

                         DICKIE
               That's how I found my place in Mongi.
               Took a boat out round the bay.  The first
               place I liked, I got it.

     The motor boat is ploughing the waves. Dickie exhilarated by
     the speed.

                         RIPLEY
               Dickie, slow down, come on!

     Ripley grips the oar, his knuckles white. Dickie cuts the
     motor, and the boat slows to a crawl, miles from the shore.

                         DICKIE
                   (ecstatic)
               I love it here! Gonna live here!

     Dickie takes off his jacket, then drums against the edge of
     the boat, developing a rhythm with his lighter and fingers,
     already on the way to becoming Buddy Rich.

                         RIPLEY
               I wanted to tell you my plan.

                         DICKIE
               So tell me.

                         RIPLEY
               I thought I might come back. In the New
               Year. Under my own steam.

                         DICKIE
                   (suddenly tight)
               Really?  To Italy?

                         RIPLEY
               Of course. Let's say, for argument's
               sake, you were here - perhaps we could
               split the rent on a house - I'll get a
               job - or, better still, I could get a
               place in Rome and when we're there we
               could be there and if we're here we could
               be here -

                         DICKIE
               Oh God, I don't think so.

                         RIPLEY
               - you see, particularly with the Marge
               problem, you can just blame me.

                         DICKIE
               Marge and I are getting married.

                         RIPLEY
                   (appalled)
               How?

                         DICKIE
               How?

                         RIPLEY
               Yesterday you're ogling girls on the
               terrace, today you're getting married.
               It's absurd.

                         DICKIE
               I love Marge.

                         RIPLEY
               You love me and you're not marrying me.

                         DICKIE
                   (cold)
               Tom, I don't love you.

                         RIPLEY
               No, no, it's not a threat, I've explained
               all of that.

                         DICKIE
               I'm actually a little relieved you're
               going, to be honest. I think we've seen
               enough of each other for a while.

     Ripley stares at him, his eyes suddenly reptilian.

                         RIPLEY
               What?

                         DICKIE
               You can be a leech - you know this - and
               it's boring. You can be quite boring.

                         RIPLEY
                   (volcanic)
               The funny thing - I'm not pretending to
               be somebody else and you are. I'm
               absolutely honest with you. I've told you
               my feelings. But you, first of all I know
               there's something - that evening when we
               played chess, for instance, it was
               obvious -

                         DICKIE
                   (incredulous)
               What evening?

                         RIPLEY
               Sure - I know, that's too dangerous for
               you, fair enough, hey! we're brothers,
               fine, then you do this sordid thing with
               Marge, fucking her on the boat while we
               all have to listen, which was
               excruciating, frankly, plus you follow
               your cock around like a - and now you're
               getting married! I'm bewildered, forgive
               me...you're lying to Marge then getting
               married to her, you're knocking up
               Silvana, you've got to play sax, you've
               got to play drums, which is it, Dickie,
               what do you really play?

     Dickie, furious, gets up, and lurches towards Ripley.

                         DICKIE
                   (attacking him, administering
                    tiny slaps as punctuation to
                    his tirade)
               Who are you - some imposter, some third
               class mooch - who are you to tell me
               anything? Actually, I really really
               really don't want to be on this boat with
               you, I can't move without you moving,
               which is exactly how it feels and it
               gives me the creeps.
                   (he goes to rev up the engine)
               I can't move without - "Dickie, Dickie,
               Dickie" - like a little girl.  You give
               me the -

     RIPLEY SMASHES HIM ACROSS THE HEAD WITH THE OAR. DICKIE SLIPS
     OFF THE WOODEN SEAT, HIS EYES ROLLING IN GROGGY SURPRISE.

                         RIPLEY
               Shut up! Just shut up! Just shut up!

     The boat slows as Dickie releases the tiller.  Dickie looks
     up at Ripley wearily and slides onto his back.

                         DICKIE
               For God's sake.

     Ripley, shocked at himself, goes to Dickie, rocking the boat,
     catches him up, then is horrified to see Dickie's face,
     apparently unmarked, SUDDENLY SPLIT OPEN, a line of blood and
     then a peeling like a fruit bursting. Ripley's appalled.  A
     terrible roar issues from Dickie as he launches himself at
     Ripley.

                         DICKIE (cont'd)
               I'll kill you!

     Ripley finds himself pushing him away, picking up the oar,
     kicking off Dickie's hand around his ankle. The boat is
     rocking and swerving crazily as Dickie falls against the
     tiller. Ripley almost loses his balance. His glasses come
     off. They struggle, locked together in a life or death
     wrestle to get control of the oar. Dickie's blinded by his
     own blood, loses his grip.

     Ripley, terrified, hits Dickie again and again, the oar like
     a carpet-beater banging down flat, blood on the blade, blood
     on Ripley, until he's on his knees, heaving for breath,
     letting his arm drop, then realizing, disgusted, that he's
     let it rest in a pool of blood. He starts to sob, sprawls
     there, sobbing, next to Dickie, horrified by what he's done.

     Nobody's in sight.  The boat rocks, gently, the sun sparkling
     indifferently on the waves.  Ripley lies by Dickie in the
     bottom of the boat, in the embrace he's always wanted.

     The pretty blue-and-white boat rocks peacefully.  The sea
     calms.

     EXT. A COVE NEAR SAN REMO. AFTERNOON.

     A deserted cove, several miles along the coast. Ripley
     clambers onto a rock over the shore.  He's watching the boat
     slowly sinking. Shuddering from the exertion, the cold, he
     finds Dickie's jacket, puts it on and watches as the boat
     disappears under the surface.

     EXT. SAN REMO. DUSK.

     Ripley walks back towards the hotel, still wearing Dickie's
     jacket, cold and wet, his bag over his shoulder.

     INT. HOTEL LOBBY. EARLY EVENING.

     Ripley approaches the front desk.  He's shivering.  He's not
     wearing his glasses.

                         RIPLEY
               Can I have my key, please?

                         RECEPTIONIST
                   (at the key rack)
               Of course - But you must be very cold?
               Signor Greenleaf?  Yes? -

                         RIPLEY
                   (mind racing)
               No, it's - I'm...

     EXT. ROAD BETWEEN NAPLES AND MONGIBELLO. DAY.

     Ripley sits on the bus as it rumbles towards Mongi.  He
     stares out of the window, full of what he's done. No idea
     what to do.

     EXT. MONGIBELLO, FISHERMAN'S WHARF. DAY.

     The BUS comes into town. Ripley gets out, looks calm, very
     together.

     INT. DICKIE'S LIVING ROOM, MONGIBELLO. DAY.

     Ripley walks into the living room, slowly approaches
     Dickie's saxophone which is on its stand on the table.  He
     can't get close to it, it evokes Dickie too much.

     INT. DICKIE'S LIVING ROOM. DAY.

     Ripley has Dickie's Hermes Baby typewriter on the desk and is
     busy writing letters. He has finished a letter to the
     Greenleafs, now he's at the end of one to Marge. We can read
     part of it - C/O American Express, Rome 9 November 1958. Dear
     Marge, this is a difficult letter for me to write... Ripley
     produces the Shakespeare and Signature page and COPIES
     DICKIE'S SIGNATURE at the end of the letter.

     EXT. MARGE'S GARDEN, MONGIBELLO. DAY.

     Ripley stands at the entrance to Marge's garden where she is
     working at her book on the outside table, surrounded by
     references and notes, held down by bricks. He looks at her
     until she looks at him. She's startled, gasps.

                         RIPLEY
               Hello Marge.

                         MARGE
               Tom, you startled me!  You're back.

                         RIPLEY
               How are you? Sorry. Is your book going
               well?

                         MARGE
               Yes - I'm on a good streak, thanks.

                         RIPLEY
               I was just looking at you -
                   (looking at her tenderly)
               - so quiet.

                         MARGE
               Where's Dickie?

                         RIPLEY
               I think he's planning on staying in Rome
               for a few days.

                         MARGE
                   (looks at him)
               Ha. Did he say why?

                         RIPLEY
               I don't know. I don't understand Dickie,
               Marge, so your guess is as good as mine.

                         MARGE
               What does that mean?

                         RIPLEY
               Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the
               next day I'm not, one day we're all one
               family, the next day he wants to be
               alone. You tell me.

                         MARGE
               Is that what he said - he wanted to be
               alone?

                         RIPLEY
               He was thinking of you, Marge - he asked
               me to deliver this.

     He hands her a package. She pulls at it, it's perfume.

                         MARGE
               Thanks. he knows I love this, although
               why it couldn't have waited...

                         RIPLEY
               Errand number one - deliver Marge's
               perfume. Errand number two, pack some
               clothes and his precious saxophone.

                         MARGE
                   (alarmed)
               How long's he staying for?

                         RIPLEY
               Search me. I guess we're abandoned.

     EXT. MONGIBELLO, BEACH. EARLY MORNING.

     Marge is walking along the beach and out onto the jetty,
     forlorn, a bleached figure on this winter morning.

     INT. OFF FROM DICKIE'S LIVING ROOM. MORNING.

     As Ripley walks down the stairs, Marge is at the icebox in
     the living room. She's fixing herself a drink, has the icebox
     open for ice. She's ashen, and might have been weeping, walks
     back into the kitchen area.

                         MARGE
               There was a letter from Dickie in with my
               perfume. You realize it's more than a few
               days? He's thinking of moving to Rome.

     She bangs out the ice onto the counter, cubes falling
     everywhere. Ripley drops to the floor and starts to clear
     them up.  She's got the letter, shows it to Ripley. He puts
     fresh ice into her glass.

                         MARGE (cont'd)
               The thing is, the night before he left,
               we talked about moving, together, going
               North - and I suppose I put some pressure
               on him, about getting married, I just
               might have scared him off. There's a side
               to him, when our heads are on the pillow,
               I know no-one else sees it, which is
               really tender.
                   (unravelling)
               I think I should come with you to Rome
               and just confront him.

     Ripley lights a cigarette.  Marge loses confidence.

                         MARGE (cont'd)
               He hates being confronted.

                         RIPLEY
               I think you're right.

     INT. ALBERGO GOLDONI, ROME. DAY.

     RIPLEY'S BATTERED CASES are carried into the tiny lobby of
     this small hotel. He exchanges his passport at the desk for
     his room key, then makes his way, carrying his own luggage to
     the metal cage elevator. THIS SCENE INTERCUTS WITH:

     INT. HOTEL GRAND. DAY.

     DICKIE'S ARRAY OF LEATHER LUGGAGE is pulled along on a 
     baggage trolley by a liveried PORTER.

     Dickie's passport slides across the marble desk. A key comes
     back, collected by a hand sporting Dickie's two distinctive
     rings.  As ALDO, the Front Desk Manager, inspects the
     passport, he looks at the owner.  Ripley wears a terrific
     suit, his hair parted in the Greenleaf style, no glasses. His
     voice, when he speaks, has the same, lazy, confident drawl.

                         ALDO
               Welcome back, Signor Greenleaf.

                         RIPLEY
                   (walking away)
               Thank you.

     INT. RIPLEY'S SUITE, GRAND. DAY.

     The PORTER takes the cases and opens them as Ripley walks
     around the suite. It's large and splendid. Ripley breathes in
     its opulence.  He immediately picks up the telephone.

                         RIPLEY
               Yes, I'd like you to telephone the Hotel
               Goldoni. Yes. I want to speak to Signor
               Thomas Ripley - No Ripley, R, yes.
               Grazie.

     He produces Dickie's pen and signs the blotter quickly - H R
     Greenleaf.  Then he pulls out a postcard from the writing
     case to reveal Dickie's Stars, hide your fires handwriting
     specimen. He compares the two signatures, is pleased.

     The telephone rings.

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
               Pronto? Signor Ripley is not there? I'd
               like to leave a message. Yes. Please call
               Dickie - Dickie Greenleaf - at the Grand.

     INT. RIPLEY'S HOTEL ROOM, GOLDONI. DAY.

     A tiny, cell of a room, single bed. Ripley on the phone.

                         RIPLEY
               He's not there?  Very well. I'll leave a
               message - Got your call. Dinner tonight
               sounds fine. Ripley.
                   (listens as it's read back)
               Dinner tonight, yes, is okay. Yes, thank
               you.

     INT. GUCCI STORE, ROME. DAY.

     Ripley has bought some more LEATHER GOODS - a briefcase and
     overnight bag. He is at the counter, signing checks.

                         RIPLEY
               I'd like these to have my initials -
               embossed, I don't know the word in
               Italian ...embossed?

                         GUCCI ASSISTANT
               Embossed, of course, Signor Greenleaf.

     There's an excited rap on the window and a shout of DICKIE!
     Shocked, Ripley looks over to find MEREDITH LOGUE outside,
     alone and delighted to see him.  He grins and mouths hello.

                         MEREDITH
                   (entering the shop)
               Dickie! Oh my God!  Ciao.

     EXT. ACROSS PIAZZA NAVONA TO ARCARI'S CAFE. DAY.

     Ripley and Meredith walk across the Piazza towards the cafe.

                         MEREDITH
               But you're going skiing with us Yankees,
               aren't you?

                         RIPLEY
               What?

                         MEREDITH
               At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie
               Miles and -

                         RIPLEY
                   (interrupting, astonished)
               How did you know that?

                         MEREDITH
               Everybody knows Freddie Miles.

                         RIPLEY
                   (unsettled)
               Is Freddie in Rome?

                         MEREDITH
               Now? I don't think so. But I've met him,
               of course, and we've chatted and I know
               about you and Marge and Mongi and what an
               unreliable rat you are. Freddie said you
               were a rat and I thought to myself now I
               know why he travels under R.

                         RIPLEY
               I've left Marge, Meredith. And Mongi. So
               the rat's here now, in Rome.

                         MEREDITH
               Sorry, I wouldn't have made a joke if -

                         RIPLEY
               Don't be sorry. I've never been happier.
               I feel like I've been handed a new life.

     EXT. AMERICAN EXPRESS OFFICE, ROME. DAY.

     Meredith and Ripley walk down the Spanish Steps and head
     inside the office.

                         MEREDITH
               The truth is if you've had money your
               entire life, even if you despise it,
               which we do - agreed? - you're only truly
               comfortable around other people who have
               it and despise it.

                         RIPLEY
               I know.

                         MEREDITH
               I've never admitted that to anyone.

     INT. AMERICAN EXPRESS OFFICE, ROME. DAY.

     Ripley's signing Dickie's allowance receipt. Meredith is with
     him, signing her own counterfoil. He is, of course, endorsed
     by her presence.  She goes to the window ahead of him.

     She takes her money, turns to him.

     He hands over his documents. The Clerk compares Ripley's
     signature with the one on the passport and then looks up at
     him. Ripley is cool as a cucumber.

                         RIPLEY
               I don't want too many large bills. Nobody
               will change them.

     INT. RIPLEY'S SUITE, GRAND. ANOTHER DAY.

     Where A TAILOR is finishing the fitting of a cashmere jacket
     for Ripley. Bolts of cloth everywhere as Meredith adjudicates
     the possible materials, which the tailor holds up against
     Ripley.

                         MEREDITH
               Show me the other one again.
                   (the Tailor obliges)
               I like them both.

                         RIPLEY
               I'll take them both.

     Ripley goes inside the bedroom to change. While he's inside,
     Meredith shows the Tailor out.  As she returns she notices
     the open sax case, peers inside.

                         MEREDITH (O/S)
               I know you're a jazz fiend but do you
               absolutely hate the Opera?  I've been
               trying to give my tickets away, it's
               tomorrow, but if you were prepared to be
               dragged...

     She looks up to catch him bare-chested. She's intoxicated by
     him, the romance she feels to be in the air.

                         RIPLEY
                   (emerging)
               You could drag me.

     INT. THE OPERA HOUSE, ROME.

     On stage is Act Two of Eugene Onegin.  Lensky sings his aria
     before the duel with Onegin.

     Ripley's in a tuxedo, in a box which includes a glamorous
     Meredith and her AUNT AND UNCLE.  He knows what comes next.
     Lensky is shot by Onegin. Blood pours from his neck into the
     snow.  Onegin, horrified at the death of his friend, goes
     over, wraps Lensky in his cloak, the silk lining flashing,
     kneels holding him... Ripley can barely hide his emotion...
     Meredith watches her sensitive friend, entranced.

     INT. OUTSIDE THE BOXES, OPERA HOUSE, ROME.

     The Interval.  Ripley and Meredith exit their box with
     Meredith's Aunt and Uncle (who heads for the interval
     drinks).

                         RIPLEY
               Thanks so much for inviting me tonight.

                         JOAN
               Can you bear it?  We hear you're a friend
               of Freddie's - he has I hate Opera
               tattooed on his chest.

                         RIPLEY
               There's room for a whole libretto on
               Freddie's chest.

                         JOAN
                   (laughs)
               I'm sure we've met.

     They reach the console where Uncle Ted has their drinks.

                         JOAN (cont'd)
               I was sure we'd met, weren't you, Ted?
               This is Herbert Greenleaf's boy.

                         RIPLEY
               Thanks, yes, I think we did.

                         JOAN
               One minute you people are children and
               the next you're getting tattooed.

     INT. OPERA HOUSE, FOYER. NIGHT.

     Ripley heads past the Beautiful People on his hunt for the
     Men's Room, and walks straight into a young and cultured
     Englishman.  They greet each other and suddenly MARGE is
     beside them.

                         MARGE
                   (as if she's seen a ghost)
               Oh my God. Tom.

                         RIPLEY
               Marge, how are you? What are you doing in
               Rome?

                         MARGE
               Is he here? Are you with Dickie?

                         RIPLEY
               No.
                   (to Smith-Kingsley)
               Hello, I'm Tom Ripley.

                         PETER
               Peter Smith-Kingsley. I've heard about
               you, of course - from Marge, and Dickie.

                         MARGE
                   (works out what's strange)
               No glasses.

     He fishes out the glasses.

                         RIPLEY
                   (to Peter)
               Ditto.

                         PETER
               Where are you hiding him? He's
               impossible, isn't he?

                         MARGE
               Is he really not here?

                         RIPLEY
               Marge, you know Dickie has I hate Opera
               tattooed on his chest.

                         MARGE
               You were going to Venice.

                         PETER
               Yes, what happened? I heard you were
               desperate to come. I was looking forward
               to rowing you around.

                         RIPLEY
               I am.  I really am. And I've been
               travelling. I just can't seem to get that
               far north.

                         PETER
               Well hurry, before we sink.
                   (reaches into his jacket)
               Should I give you my telephone number in
               Venice?

                         RIPLEY
               Thanks.

     The INTERVAL BELL'S ringing. Peter hands over his card to
     Ripley, sees Meredith.

                         PETER
               Look there's Meredith thingy - who's
               that, Marge? - they're in textiles...
               Meredith -
                   (embarrassed at not
                    remembering)
               God, how awful, I've spent Christmas in
               her house...!

                         MARGE
               I don't know her.
                   (to Ripley)
               He hasn't called, he's hardly written,
               just these cryptic notes. You don't just
               dump people.

     The last INTERVAL BELL. There's a mini-stampede to return.

                         PETER
               Will we see you later?

                         RIPLEY
               I can't later.

                         PETER
               And tomorrow?

                         RIPLEY
               Tomorrow's possible. Do you know
               Dinelli's? Piazza di Spagna?

                         PETER
               I know the Piazza di Spagna. What time?

                         RIPLEY
               Ten thirty?

                         PETER
               We'll be there.

                         RIPLEY
               Okay. Marge, see you tomorrow.
                   (to Peter)
               It's really good to meet you.

     INT. BOX, OPERA HOUSE. NIGHT.

     Ripley goes straight to Meredith and grabs her.

                         RIPLEY
               Let's go.

                         MEREDITH
               I thought you were enjoying yourself?

                         RIPLEY
               Let's take a Carozza and look at the
               moon.

                         MEREDITH
               You're crazy! It's freezing out there.

     He's looking past her, where a mirror reflects Marge wading
     through the audience, Peter's elegant head getting
     dangerously near as they approach their seats.

                         RIPLEY
               C'mon, I need to talk to you. Just the
               two of us.

                         MEREDITH
                   (quite taken)
               Okay then, you're crazy.

     EXT. CAROZZA, ROME. NIGHT.

     Meredith shivers in the raw night as they cross the Tiber.
     Ripley as Dickie is confessing his heart belongs to Marge.

                         MEREDITH
               Don't worry. Really. Don't worry.

                         RIPLEY
               You're such a pal to understand. It's as
               if Marge is here now - I look at you and
               I see her face - and I can't, whatever
               I'm feeling towards you - I just can't...

                         MEREDITH
               No, I absolutely understand. Of course.

                         RIPLEY
               Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.

                         MEREDITH
               Beating you away.

     EXT. MEREDITH'S APARTMENT, ROME.

     They arrive at the courtyard outside Meredith's Apartment
     Building. Ripley jumps down, collects her. She makes to go
     inside, then looks at him.

                         MEREDITH
               Will you meet me tomorrow?  Just to say
               goodbye in the daylight, properly? So
               it's not just this, it's too...you should
               always save pain for daylight...

                         RIPLEY
               Oh Meredith, I'm sorry. Of course I'll
               meet you. Let's have coffee in the
               morning at Dinelli's.

                         MEREDITH
                   (fluttering)
               I don't - is that by the Spanish Steps?

                         RIPLEY
               Exactly. 10.30 -
                   (instantly correcting himself)
               10.15.

     He gets back into the carozza. It moves off.

     EXT. DINELLI'S CAFE, PIAZZA DI SPAGNA. MORNING.

     Meredith sits waiting in a cafe at the bottom of the Spanish
     Steps. Ripley, dressed as Ripley, is at the top of the steps,
     among early tourists, watching as she drinks her coffee at an
     outside table. Then Marge and Peter appear walking up the Via
     Condotti, head for another table, don't see Meredith.  She
     acknowledges Peter who hasn't noticed her.

                         MEREDITH
               Peter? Hello, it's Meredith Logue.

                         PETER
               Of course it is, Meredith, hello, I'm
               sorry, half-asleep, how are you? This is
               Marge Sherwood. Meredith Logue.

                         MARGE
               Hello.

     Hearing Marge's name Meredith reacts, freezes.

                         PETER
               Join us, won't you? We're just waiting
               for a friend. Do you know, I wonder did
               we see you at the Opera last night?

                         MEREDITH
               I won't actually, although I think this
               might - are you waiting for Dickie?

                         PETER
               Well no, as it happens, although...

                         MARGE
                   (stunned at the mention of his
                    name)
               Dickie? Do you know Dickie?

                         MEREDITH
               You were at the Opera? Well, that
               explains - yes I was there. I was there
               with Dickie.

                         MARGE
                   (to Peter)
               I told you! I knew it!

                         MEREDITH
                   (moving over to them)
               Marge, I don't know you, so I have no
               right, but Dickie loves you.  He's - I
               think you'll find he's coming home to
               you.

                         MARGE
                   (proprietorial)
               How would you know that?

                         MEREDITH
               He told me everything. I was supposed to
               meet him fifteen minutes ago, so I...I'm
               going to go now, I think. Unless he meant
               us to meet - which would be a little
               cruel, wouldn't it?

                         PETER
               No, we're meeting another friend. Tom
               Ripley.

                         MARGE
               Do you know Tom?

                         MEREDITH
               Ripley? No. I heard about him, of course,
               but no, I didn't meet him.

     The WAITER has arrived to take orders. Meredith indicates
     she's leaving.

                         MEREDITH (cont'd)
               Not for me. No, grazie.

     Marge is on the edge. Peter lays a hand to comfort her.

                         MEREDITH (cont'd)
               I hope I didn't complicate matters, but
               nothing, nothing untoward happened,
               nothing to prevent you from welcoming him
               back, from marrying him...Goodbye.
               Goodbye Peter, please don't get up.

     Peter gets up. Ripley, from his vantage point at the top of
     the steps, watches Meredith leave and walk off into the
     crowd. He begins the slow walk down towards the square. As he
     becomes visible to the cafe, he starts to hurry. He's
     apologising to Marge and Peter as they see him, in his
     element, lying and believing in his lie.

                         RIPLEY
               Sorry, sorry. Had to renew my papers.
               Italian bureaucracy - never one stamp
               when they can make you line up for three.
               Have you been waiting long?

                         PETER
               Not at all. Morning Tom.

                         RIPLEY
               Hi.
                   (to Marge)
               Sorry. You okay? You look as if you've
               seen a ghost...

                         MARGE
               Dickie was at the Opera last night.

                         RIPLEY
               I don't believe it. Wild horses wouldn't
               drag Dickie to -

                         MARGE
               He was there with someone. So I suppose
               she must have dragged him - that's not
               fair.  I'm going back to Mongi. I think
               Dickie's coming home.
                   (to Peter)
               I'm going to go home.

                         RIPLEY
               Really? That's swell. No, I was just -
               you're way ahead of me! Great!

                         PETER
               We think he's had a change of heart.
                   (to Marge)
               So we should be celebrating.

                         MARGE
               I hope so.

                         PETER
                   (to Marge)
               That was moving, wasn't it? When Meredith
               said -
                   (to Ripley)
               Meredith's the American girl I saw last
               night, I know her, at the Opera, she's
               been seeing something of Dickie -

                         RIPLEY
               My God.

                         PETER
               But the point is Dickie - well we know
               this - Dickie loves Marge and he misses
               her and apparently he's come to his
               senses...

                         RIPLEY
               It's fantastic.
                   (to Peter)
               I feel guilty. Marge doesn't understand
               this, but anytime Dickie does something I
               feel guilty.

     INT. APARTMENT, PALAZZA GIOIA. DAY.

     Ripley is being shown an APARTMENT FOR RENT in the Palazzo
     Gioia by a dry-witted older woman, SIGNORA BUFFI. Ripley
     explores, relishing the decor.

                         SIGNORA BUFFI
               Accendo il riscaldamento.
               (I'll turn the heating on.)

                         RIPLEY
                   (mimes playing sax)
               Mi piace suonare.
               (I like to play music.)

                         SIGNORA BUFFI
                   (shrugs)
               Io sono sorda. Quelli di sotto, una
               coppia, sono sordi. Allora, ti piace?
               (I'm deaf. The couple below are deaf. So,
               do you like it?)

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. AFTERNOON.

     Ripley is in the apartment, fire burning, wearing pyjamas.
     There's a small Christmas tree. He kneels on the floor with
     some festive, gift-wrapped packages. He opens a package. It's
     a marble head of Hadrian. A gasp from Ripley. He picks up a
     glass, pours himself a drink.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. LATE AFTERNOON.

     Ripley plunges into Bach's Italian Concerto on his new and
     precious toy, a STEINWAY GRAND. His doorbell rings. He stops
     playing. He doesn't get visitors. He rises, a little nervous.

                         RIPLEY
               Hello?

                         FREDDIE (O/S)
               Dickie?

                         RIPLEY
               Who is it?

                         FREDDIE (O/S)
               It's Freddie. Let me in.

     RIPLEY ALMOST COLLAPSES. He's faint.

                         FREDDIE (O/S)
               Dickie, come on, it's me.

     Ripley can't think what to hide, where to hide. He opens the
     door.

                         RIPLEY
               Hello, Freddie, it's Tom, Tom Ripley.

                         FREDDIE
                   (confused, not pleasantly)
               Oh hello, where's Dickie? How are you?

                         RIPLEY
               Yes, I'm good, thank you. Dickies at
               dinner. He's at Otello's. Do you know it?

                         FREDDIE
               I don't think he's at dinner at 6.30pm.
               If you said he was still at lunch I'd
               believe you. Incredible. The guy has
               disappeared off the face of the earth.

                         RIPLEY
               I guess.

                         FREDDIE
               The landlady - as far as I could tell,
               the landlady said he was here right now.

                         RIPLEY
               He's gone to dinner! Search the place. I
               can't think why you would imagine Dickie
               would hide from you.

                         FREDDIE
               Because he's been hiding from me - what
               happened at Christmas?

                         RIPLEY
               What about Christmas?

                         FREDDIE
               He was supposed to come skiing. I didn't
               get a cable or a call or a note or,
               frankly, a fart.

     Ripley has his hands behind his back. HE'S TUGGING
     FRANTICALLY AT DICKIE'S RINGS. Ripley wanders into the
     kitchen, turns on the tap to sluice his fingers.

                         RIPLEY (O/S)
               Of course, he's been very involved in his
               music, hasn't he? I think his theory is,
               you know, you have to go into a cocoon
               before you can become a butterfly.

                         FREDDIE
               Which is horseshit.  Have you heard him
               play that thing?
                   (gesturing at the sax on its
                    stand)
               He can't.

                         RIPLEY (O/S)
                   (casually)
               How did you find him? It's such an out of
               the way apartment. Can I fix you a drink?

                         FREDDIE
               No thanks.
                   (explaining his detective work)
               Some kid at the American Express Office.
                   (he starts to explore)
               Are you living here?

     Now he starts to hammer a nasty boogie-woogie on the piano.

                         RIPLEY
                   (returning, flinching)
               No. No, I'm staying here for a few days,
               in Rome.  That's a new piano, so you prob -

                         FREDDIE (O/S)
               Did this place come furnished? It doesn't
               look like Dickie. Horrible isn't it? - so
               bourgeois.

     Now he's poking at the Hadrian bust.

                         RIPLEY
               You should watch that!

                         FREDDIE
               In fact the only thing which looks like
               Dickie is you.

                         RIPLEY
               Hardly.

                         FREDDIE
               Have you done something to your hair?

     Ripley starts to smile, his eyes darting around the room.

                         RIPLEY
               Freddie, do you have something to say?

                         FREDDIE
               What? I think I'm saying it. Something's
               going on. He's either converted to
               Christianity - or to something else.

                         RIPLEY
               I suggest you ask Dickie that yourself.
               Otello's is on delle Croce, just off the
               Corso.

                         FREDDIE
               Is it on "delle Croce, just off the
               Corso"? You're a quick study, aren't you?
               Last time you didn't know your ass from
               your elbow, now you're giving me
               directions. That's not fair, you probably
               do know your ass from your elbow. I'll
               see you.

     AND HE'S GONE. Ripley shuts the door, smooths the silk runner
     on the table where Freddie's hand had rucked it. He goes back
     to the door, opens it and looks over the rail.

     INT. LANDING AND STAIRS, RIPLEY'S BUILDING. LATE DAY.

     FREDDIE IS BACK IN CONVERSATION WITH SIGNORA BUFFI. Ripley
     can't make out the text but there's some discussion about
     Signor Greenleaf and Signor Ripley. Ripley hurries inside as
     Freddie's heavy shoes start to clump up the stairs again.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT, ROME. LATE DAY.

     Freddie knocks on the door which pushes open. As he marches
     in, he launches into his interrogation.

                         FREDDIE
               Ripley? There's someth -

     - AND WALKS STRAIGHT INTO THE HEAD OF HADRIAN WHICH RIPLEY
     SWINGS AT HIM, HOLDING ON AWKWARDLY WITH BOTH HANDS TO THE
     HEAVY MARBLE SCULPTURE.

     Freddie falls like an ox, first to his knees, groaning, then
     to the floor as Ripley brings the head down again, beating
     him downwards. As Freddie slumps away, Ripley loses his
     balance and the head sends Freddie a glancing blow before
     slipping from Ripley's grasp and smashing on to the floor.
     THE NOSE IS CHIPPED OFF.

     EXT. PALAZZO GIOIA. NIGHT.

     It's deserted. Ripley hauls Freddie out of the shadows
     towards the car. A couple walk across the square. Ripley
     talks to Freddie, berating him for his drunken stupor. He
     pushes him over the door and into the passenger seat.

                         RIPLEY
                   (mimicking Freddie's voice)
               Hey, if I'm drunk, think what her
               husband's saying.

     EXT. VIA APPIA ANTICA. NIGHT.

     The Fiat noses along THE APPIAN WAY. Black fragments of tombs
     punctuate either side of the poorly lit road. Inside the car,
     Ripley looks to left and right for a place to dump the body.
     He slows near a clump of trees.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT, ROME. EVENING.

     Someone is KNOCKING urgently at the door. Ripley opens it,
     finds himself face to face with Signora Buffi and TWO
     POLICEMEN. One of them offers his hand.

                         ROVERINI
               Dickie Greenleaf?

                         RIPLEY
               Yes?

                         ROVERINI
               Inspector Roverini. Can we come in?

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. EVENING.

     Ripley sits with his head in his hands at the table. Roverini
     and his sergeant, BAGGIO, watch patiently.

                         ROVERINI
               It's a terrible shock, eh? What time did
               Signor Miles leave yesterday?

                         RIPLEY
               I can't be absolutely sure - 8? 9? We'd
               both taken on far too many drinks - but
               it was dark, it was certainly dark when I
               walked him down to his car.

                         ROVERINI
               So Signor Miles drove away and you did
               what?

                         RIPLEY
               I went to bed. Freddie's a big man, but
               I'm in trouble after a couple of drinks.
               I've suffered all day. Who found him?

     Roverini has walked over to the bust of Hadrian.

                         ROVERINI
               Senta.  We have to ask you to stay in
               Rome.

                         RIPLEY
               Yes, if it's going to help, certainly.

                         ROVERINI
               So, the Doctor, he has to make the -
                   (looks at Baggio)
               - come se dice?

                         RIPLEY
               Postmortem?

                         ROVERINI
               Yes, exactly, but his first, his first
               conclusion was that Signor Miles was
               killed not later than seven o'clock
               yesterday evening.

                         RIPLEY
               Well, he certainly wasn't dead when he
               drove off in his car.

                         ROVERINI
               No.

     EXT. NARROW STREET, THE GHETTO, ROME. MORNING.

     Ripley comes through a dark tunnel in the Ghetto on his
     scooter. He drives past a furniture store, DRESSING TABLES
     AND MIRRORS spilling out onto the street. He glances
     sideways, sees his reflection fractured into several images
     and, for an instant, it seems AS IF DICKIE'S THERE
     WATCHING HIM. Ripley screams and swerves, crashing into the
     pavement, the scooter falling onto him and pulling him along
     the cobbled passage. The man he thought to be Dickie, an
     Italian, runs up concerned.

     EXT. AMERICAN EXPRESS, PIAZZA DI SPAGNA. DAY.

     Ripley emerges from the American Express Office. Across the
     street at the cafe, as once before, sits Marge. Ripley slips
     Dickie's bag into his knapsack as he approaches his scooter.
     Marge spots him and strides across the piazza. She is in no
     mood for pleasantries.

                         MARGE
               Did he kill Freddie?

                         RIPLEY
               Marge, when did you get here?

                         MARGE
               Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?

                         RIPLEY
               I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.

                         MARGE
               I tried again, waiting here, watching for
               him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look
               for Dickie I find you.

                   (focusing on Ripley's cuts and
                    bruises)
               What happened to your face?

                         RIPLEY
               Dickie did it.

                         MARGE
                   (suddenly tense)
               Dickie?

                         RIPLEY
               My face! There was an argument. I said
               some things I shouldn't have.  About you.
               About the appalling way he's treating
               you, all of us.  And the next thing I
               know he's launched himself at me.
                   (he pulls the scooter off the
                    stand)
               Are you getting on?

                         MARGE
               What?

                         RIPLEY
               Get on. I'll take you to him.

     EXT. SQUARE OF THE PALAZZO GIOIA. DAY.

     Ripley and Marge come round the corner on the scooter. The
     entrance to the Palazzo is blocked by a couple of police cars.
     Inspector Roverini emerges from one of them. Ripley,
     startled, drives straight past the entrance.

     EXT. ROME STREET, BY THE RIVER. DAY.

     Ripley pulls up several hundred yards later, in a different
     piazza full of book stalls.  Marge is confused.

                         MARGE
               Where does Dickie live?

                         RIPLEY
               We passed it a few blocks back, where the
               police were. The Palazzo Gioia. They
               don't even know I'm in Rome and I'm not
               going to incriminate Dickie -

                         MARGE
               Perhaps I shouldn't go either.

                         RIPLEY
                   (thinking hard, distracted)
               No, well go if you want to, but don't
               talk to the Police about my face - they
               find out he hit me - he's got a temper - he
               could've hit Freddie.
                   (sincerely)
               Good luck, Marge. I'll catch up with you
               later.

     And he drives off. At the first opportunity HE DOUBLES BACK
     and roars towards the Palazzo.

     EXT. SQUARE OF THE PALAZZO GIOIA. AFTERNOON.

     Ripley drives towards the entrance.  As Ripley gets off and
     pushes his scooter through the doorway SOME JOURNALISTS,
     LOITERING INSIDE A BARBER'S SHOP come running out and swarm
     around him with questions about Freddie. One of them gets off
     a photograph.  It's chaos, a Police Officer shouts him away
     as Ripley puts up a protective hand and runs inside.

     INT. ENTRANCE AND STAIRS, PALAZZO GIOIA. CONTINUOUS.

     As Ripley hurries inside he encounters officers conducting
     more thorough forensic investigations in the stairwell. On a
     landing is Roverini. Ripley hurries towards him.

                         RIPLEY
               Can we go up? Do you mind?

                         ROVERINI
               Of course. What happened to your face?

                         RIPLEY
               My scooter. I fell off. Getting chased by
               photographers.

     He hurries up the stairs, Roverini in tow.

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
                   (agitated)
               The telephone, the press, I've been, I'm
               feeling hounded - do you think you could
               not give out my address?

                         ROVERINI
               Never. We've had many requests and, of
               course, we say no - even to your fiancÈe.

                         RIPLEY
               I really don't want to see anybody.

                         ROVERINI
               Even your fiancÈe...?

                         RIPLEY
               Even her.

                         ROVERINI
               What about Thomas Ripley?

                         RIPLEY
               What about Ripley?

     Ripley's way ahead and has reached the door of his apartment.
     He waits nervously for Roverini. He unlocks the door and can
     barely wait for Roverini to catch up.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. AFTERNOON.

     Roverini follows Ripley inside, Baggio hurries in behind him.

                         ROVERINI
               You and Signor Ripley went to San Remo,
               is that right?

     Ripley is appalled. He smiles.

                         RIPLEY
               Yes, sure, we did go to San Remo. That
               was months ago.

                         ROVERINI
               November, I thought.

                         RIPLEY
               Was it? Did you speak to Tom?

                         ROVERINI
               November 7th is my information.

                         RIPLEY
               I don't remember the exact date.

                         ROVERINI
               And when did you last see Signor Ripley?

                         RIPLEY
               A few days ago.

                         ROVERINI
               Does he stay with you here?

                         RIPLEY
               No!

                         ROVERINI
               No.  Here is a pattern. Two days ago
               Freddie Miles is dead - he leaves your
               apartment and is murdered. Yesterday a
               little boat is found in San Remo full of
               rocks, and the owner tells the Police it
               was stolen on November 7th. We look at
               hotel records and we see oh! Dickie
               Greenleaf is staying in San Remo and then
               our boatman remembers two Americans
               taking a boat.

                         RIPLEY
               It's not a pattern, it's a coincidence.
               There must be fifty hotels in San Remo,
               there must have been a hundred people
               renting a boat on that day.

                         ROVERINI
               31 people.

                         RIPLEY
               31 people.

     Baggio appears. Speaks to Roverini. Ripley is getting cranky.

                         ROVERINI
               That is Miss Sherwood now. Marge
               Sherwood.

                         RIPLEY
                   (appalled, defeated)
               Let her in, what's the difference?  Let
               her in.
                   (Baggio is on his way to the
                    door.)
               No, actually, no, I'd like it very much
               if you would ask her to come back later.

     Roverini nods, mutters to Baggio, who heads out.

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
               Thank you.

                         ROVERINI
                   (watching him)
               May I ask...why would you speak to your
               friend and not your fiancÈe?

                         RIPLEY
               I think I just said. Ripley was handling
               some business for me, nor does Mr Ripley
               want to marry me.  Nor did he ask me
               every day if I would marry him. And when.

                         ROVERINI
               Do you have a photograph of Signor
               Ripley?

                         RIPLEY
               I'm not in the habit of carrying around
               photographs of my male friends.

                         ROVERINI
               Now I think I have upset you. My English
               perhaps is coarse.

                         RIPLEY
               It is a little coarse, yes.

                         ROVERINI
               Sorry.  No-one has seen Signor Ripley
               since San -

                         RIPLEY
               I have!

                         ROVERINI
               You have, yes.

                         RIPLEY
               No, I have and so has Miss Sherwood, ask
               her! and if I could remember which hotel
               he was staying at - the Goldoni! - Tom
               was staying at the Goldoni.

                         ROVERINI
               Good. The Goldoni. Yes - you're right. A
               coincidence.
                   (he gets up to leave)
               I look forward to our next meeting when I
               will be more careful with my English and
               persuade you to play me your saxophone.
               Alto.

                         RIPLEY
               Absolutely.

                         ROVERINI
                   (suddenly turning)
               I have a witness who thinks they saw two
               men getting into Mr Miles' car. She
               wants to identify you in a - confronto -
               line-up.
                   (ominously)
               Tomorrow then?

                         RIPLEY
                   (thrown, scrabbling)
               Tomorrow.

     Ripley lets them out, heaves a heavy sigh, then peeps through
     the door, looks down to see Roverini speaking to Marge on the
     stairs.

                         ROVERINI (O/S)
               Buongiorno, Miss Sherwood.  He's in but I
               really don't think he wants to see
               anyone.

     Ripley leans against the door, the noose tightening, then
     suddenly a voice shocks him upright.

                         MARGE
               Dick? Dickie? I know you can hear me.
               What am I doing, chasing you around...?
               I was going to say I would count to three
               and if you didn't open the door, but I
               won't count any more. On you. I won't
               count on you any more. Whatever it is,
               whatever you've done or haven't done,
               you've broken my heart. That's one thing
               I know you're guilty of, and I don't know
               why, I don't know why, I just don't know
               why...

     Ripley listens, there's a silence, then Marge's footsteps as
     they ring out on the stone stairs. The tapping sound resolves
     into the tap-tap of a manual typewriter.

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT, PALAZZO GIOIA. NIGHT.

     Ripley's at the typewriter, he begins to type.

                         RIPLEY (O/S)
               My dear Tom, I'm getting out of this.
               Freddie's death, Silvana. I've thought
               about going to the police, but I can't do
               it, I can't face it.  I can't face
               anything anymore...

     INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT, PALAZZO GIOIA. NIGHT.

     CHAOS.  Ripley is working quickly, selecting clothes,
     dividing them into TWO PILES - one for Dickie's trunk, one
     for his own battered suitcase. He puts the license plates
     from Freddie's car in Dickie's luggage. He has placed one
     shirt on the Ripley pile then checks again, and - on seeing
     Dickie's initials, places it with the bigger pile, then picks
     it up again and holds it briefly against his cheek.

     He takes Dickie's rings, opens up a LITTLE BOX of buttons and
     needles and cufflinks and sadly tosses them in. Dickie's
     leather writing case goes on the big pile, too, as do cuff
     links, ties, the Mont Blanc, Dickie's passport, which he
     opens to scratch at the photograph, obliterating the face.

                         RIPLEY (O/S)
               ...I wish I could give you the life I
               took for granted. You've always
               understood what's at the heart of me,
               Tom. Marge never could. I suppose that's
               why I'm writing this to you, the brother
               I never had. The only true friend I ever
               had. In all kinds of ways you're much
               more like the son my father always
               wanted. I realise you can change the
               people, change the scenery, but you can't
               change your own rotten self. Now I can't
               think what to do, or where to go. I'm
               haunted by everything I've done, and
               can't undo. I'm sorry, I can't go on.
               I've made a mess of being Dickie
               Greenleaf haven't I?

     He's finished the letter, signs it, puts it in an envelope
     marked Tom Ripley and places the letter on top of the piano
     next to Dickie's passport. His head is reflected in the
     distorting curve of the lid. As he puts on his glasses
     there's a moment when there are two heads slowly separating,
     as Ripley leaves behind his brief life as Dickie Greenleaf.

     INT. BASEMENT, PALAZZO GIOIA. NIGHT.

     Ripley carries Dickie's luggage down into THE COMMUNAL
     BASEMENT of the Gioia, a wretched place full of shadows and
     gloom and the overflow from thirty apartments. A red plush
     couch sits on top of a mound of furniture.  He finds some
     dustsheets and shoves the cases under them. Then Dickie's
     saxophone.

     Outside the small window, Ripley sees uniformed feet and the
     revolving blue light of a Police Car. He shrinks back, turns
     off the light and disappears into the dark, illuminated
     fitfully by the strobe of cold blue.

     EXT. BY THE PALAZZO GIOIA, ROME. NIGHT.

     Ripley, familiar battered luggage in tow, appears at the
     entrance of the building next to his own, glances at the
     police car parked opposite the big doors, then hurries off
     into the darkness.

     EXT. BY THE PALAZZO GIOIA. NIGHT.

     Ripley's briefly silhouetted as he scuttles down an alley,
     hurrying towards a gate, and disappears behind it.

     EXT. PIAZZALE ROMA, VENICE. DAWN.

     Ripley sits next to his battered luggage at the prow of a
     MOTOR TAXI as it surges towards Venice at dawn. Peter Smith-
     Kingsley waits on the quay. Ripley waves. Peter waves back.

                         PETER
                   (indicating the taxi stop)
               I'll see you over there!

     EXT. PIAZZA SAN MARCO, VENICE. EARLY MORNING.

     Ripley and Peter walk through the square, the pigeons
     scattering. Ripley breathes in the atmosphere, the beautiful
     grey.

                         RIPLEY
               Peter, I'm really sorry to put you
               through this. I just couldn't face going
               to the police by myself when my Italian's
               so rotten.

                         PETER
               Don't be daft. It's fine. I'm delighted
               you finally made it to Venice. I'm
               delighted, contrary to rumour, you're
               still in one piece?

                         RIPLEY
               What rumour?

                         PETER
               That Dickie murdered you and is
               travelling under your passport. I know,
               ridiculous.

     INT. POLICE STATION, VENICE. LATE DAY.

     Later.  Ripley sits in the middle of a bustling Police Station,
     where thefts, tourists, thieves and complaints are being
     processed.  The Station is in an old brewery or armory. It's a
     horrible, monochrome, oppressive place. Peter is in
     conversation at a desk, turns and walks over to where Ripley
     waits.

                         PETER
               Welcome to Venice.  This place reeks,
               doesn't it? Can you smell it?  Ugh.
               Sorry. Not the best way to spend your
               first day.

                         RIPLEY
               It's okay.

                         PETER
               Anyway I've got to the bottom of the
               delay. Finally.  We're waiting for
               someone from Rome.

                         RIPLEY
                   (completely thrown)
               What do you mean?  They're sending
               someone from Rome?

                         PETER
               That's good, isn't it?

                         RIPLEY
                   (as if suffocating)
               No, but I thought that didn't happen in
               Italy, that each region was completely
               separate! I was sure that was the -

                         PETER
               You've seen the papers, you know what a
               big deal it's been here. American tourist
               murdered -

                         RIPLEY
               It's ridiculous but now you've mentioned
               the stench I can hardly breathe.

     A door opens. COLONEL VERRECCHIA, fresh from Rome, and a
     sullen wedge of a man, comes in, scowling at the couple.
     Ripley dare not look up in case it's Roverini.  A POLICEMAN
     introduces him.

                         POLICEMAN
               Colonelo Verrecchia della Polizia di
               Roma.

                         VERRECCHIA
                   (to Peter, in Italian)
               Qui e Ripley?  Who is Ripley?

                         PETER
                   (in Italian)
               Lui. Him.

     Verrecchia strides past them and into a smaller, interview
     room at the back of the station.  His manner is ominous.

     INT. POLICE STATION, INTERVIEW ROOM, VENICE. LATE DAY.

     This room is not at all friendly. There is evidence of a
     locked area for cells at one wall.  A small, sour window
     gives onto a canal.  The main station is glimpsed through
     some internal windows. Peter and Ripley come through.

     Verrecchia sits down.  Verrecchia talks in staccato Italian,
     during which Peter translates.

                         VERRECCHIA
               Ho assunto io la guida delle indagini in
               seguito alla negativa valutazione delle
               disdicevoli circostanze verificatesi con
               il mio predecessore Roverini che come e
               noto non e riuscito a impedire il
               verificarsi della scomparsa del signor
               Greenleaf, il quale era l'unica persona
               al momento passibile di incriminazione
               del reato di omicidio del signor Miles.

                         PETER
                   (translating)
               He's taken over the case because...
               they're annoyed the previous chap let
               Dickie...disappear when he was the only,
               he was the only suspect in Freddie's
               murder.

                         VERRECCHIA
               Quando e stata l'ultima volta che il
               signor Ripley ha visto il signor
               Greenleaf?
               (When was the last time Ripley saw
               Greenleaf?)

     Ripley forgets he's not supposed to have much Italian and
     answers.

                         RIPLEY
               In Rome, about three weeks ago.
                   (shrugs)
               I knew that one.

                         PETER
                   (giving Ripley a look)
               A Roma, circa tre settimane fa.

                         VERRECCHIA
               Dove e stato il signor Ripley da allora?

                         PETER
                   (translating)
               Where have you been since then?

                         RIPLEY
               I've been backpacking.

                         PETER
               I don't know how to translate that.
                   (he tries)
               E difficile....il signor Ripley
               ....dormiva all'aperto, con un...

                         VERRECCHIA
               All'aperto? Col freddo che ha fatto?

                         PETER
               He thinks it's very cold to be sleeping
               outside.

                         VERRECCHIA
               Il signor Ripley ha sviluppate tendenze
               omosessuali?

                         PETER
               Are you a homosexual?
                   (then as himself)
               Interesting non-sequitur.

                         RIPLEY
               No.

                         PETER
                   (translates for him)
               No.
                   (as Peter, drily)
               By the way, officially there are no
               Italian homosexuals. Makes Leonardo,
               Michelangelo very inconvenient.

                         RIPLEY
               Tell him I have a fiancÈe, Dickie has a
               fiancÈe and Freddie Miles probably had a
               string of them.

                         PETER
                   (translating)
               Il signor Ripley ha una fidanzata, il
               signor Dickie ha una fidanzata e
               probabilmente il signor Freddie Miles ha
               molte fidanzate.

                         VERRECCHIA
                   (laughs)
               Mamma mia, quante fidanzate!

     They all laugh.

                         RIPLEY
               What did he say?

                         PETER
               He says so many fiancÈes.

                         VERRECCHIA
                   (suddenly very tough)
               Lei ha ucciso prima Freddie Miles e dopo
               Dickie Greenleaf! Vero?

     As Peter translates Verrecchia watches intently.

                         PETER
               He wants to know if you killed Freddie
               Miles and then killed Dickie Greenleaf?

                         RIPLEY
                   (outraged)
               No I did not. I did not kill Freddie
               Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf.  Is
               he accusing me?
                   (Peter clearly doesn't ask)
               Ask him if he's accusing me!

                         PETER
               He's already angry, I don't think -

                         RIPLEY
                   (interrupting, heated)
               Just because he doesn't like Americans!

                         VERRECCHIA
               Non e questo il luogo per le vostre
               conversazioni private!  (This is not the
               place for your private conversations)

                         PETER
                   (appeasing him)
               A ragione.  A ragione.  (You're right.
               You're right.)

                         VERRECCHIA
               Hmm. C'e questa...  (There's this...)

     Verrecchia hands over a letter. It's opened. Ripley's name on
     the outside. Ripley stares at it.

                         VERRECCHIA
                         (cont'd)
               Questa lettera e stata trovata
               nell'abitazione del signor Richard
               Greenleaf a Roma.

                         PETER
               They found this in Dickie's place in
               Rome.

                         RIPLEY
               You opened this?

                         VERRECCHIA
               Of course!

     He stands and takes the letter out.  Begins to read. He has
     the look of a man whose privacy has been violated.

                         RIPLEY
                   (to Peter)
               It's a suicide note.
                   (to Verrecchia)
               You ask me all these questions and you've
               already read this suicide note?

     INT. PETER SMITH-KINGSLEY'S APARTMENT. DAY.

     There's music everywhere - and stands - and posters of
     performances and PHOTOGRAPHS OF PETER CONDUCTING. Peter is an
     opera repetiteur. Ripley is sitting at Peter's piano, playing
     from the score of Vivaldi's Stabat Mater. Peter's made supper.
     He's setting the table.

                         PETER
               Can you imagine, if Dickie did kill
               Freddie, what must that be like? To wake
               up every morning, how can you? Just wake
               up and be a person, drink a coffee...?

                         RIPLEY
               Whatever you do, however terrible,
               however hurtful - it all makes sense,
               doesn't it? inside your head. You never
               meet anybody who thinks they're a bad
               person or that they're cruel.

                         PETER
               But you're still tormented, you must be,
               you've killed somebody...

                         RIPLEY
               Don't you put the past in a room, in the
               cellar, and lock the door and just never
               go in there? Because that's what I do.

                         PETER
               Probably. In my case it's probably a
               whole building.

                         RIPLEY
               Then you meet someone special and all you
               want to do is toss them the key, say open
               up, step inside, but you can't because
               it's dark and there are demons and if
               anybody saw how ugly it was...

     Peter's come over, stands behind him over the piano.

                         PETER
               That's the music talking. Harder to be
               bleak if you're playing Knees up Mother
               Brown.

     He vamps this vaudeville song over Ripley's shoulder.

                         RIPLEY
               I keep wanting to do that - fling open
               the door - let the light in, clean
               everything out. If I could get a huge
               eraser and rub everything out...starting
               with myself...the thing is, Peter, if...

                         PETER
                   (as Ripley falls silent)
               No key, huh?

     INT. SANTA MARIA DELLA PIETA, BRIDGE OF SIGHS. DAY.

     A YOUNG BOY SINGS the soprano part of Vivaldi's STABAT MATER.
     A piercingly pure sound in Vivaldi's own church.  The
     orchestra - rehearsing - is conducted by Peter from the
     organ.

     Ripley slips in at the back of the church. He stands and
     listens. Peter sees him, smiles.  Ripley smiles back.

     EXT. VENICE, S.LUCIA RAILWAY STATION. DAY.

     MARGE appears on the steps, carrying an overnight bag. Ripley
     and Peter have come to meet her.

                         MARGE
                   (kissing him warmly)
               Hello Peter, so good to see you.

                         RIPLEY
               Hello Marge!

                         MARGE
                   (coolly)
               Tom.

     They walk towards the Vaporetto.

                         MARGE (cont'd)
               So you found Peter...

                         PETER
               I think we sort of found each other.

     Marge smiles enigmatically. Ripley registers.

                         PETER (cont'd)
               Where's Dickie's father?

                         MARGE
               He's not coming till the morning.
               Evidently his stomach - I don't think the
               food here is agreeing with him.

                         RIPLEY
               I was looking forward to seeing him.

                         MARGE
               Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of
               that. There's a private detective on the
               case now - a Mr MacCarron - Dickie's
               father's employing him.

                         RIPLEY
               That's a terrific idea.

                         MARGE
               He's American. He's already discovered
               Dickie cashed checks for $1000 the day
               before he disappeared.

     They step onto the Vaporetto.

                         MARGE (cont'd)
               Is that what you do before you jump in
               the Tiber?  I don't think so.

     EXT. RIPLEY'S HOUSE, VENICE. DAY.

     The boat arrives at the entrance to the house. Peter opens
     the door as Ripley collects Marge's bags.

                         MARGE
                   (to Peter)
               Is this you?

                         PETER
               No, it's Tom's. Splendid, eh?

                         MARGE
               Golly. Who's paying for this?

                         RIPLEY
               Peter found it for me. I can afford it
               because it's damp and, and falling down.

     INT. RIPLEY'S HOUSE, VENICE. DAY.

     Marge, entering the living room, is astonished at its
     grandeur. She walks around as Ripley heads for the bar.

                         MARGE
               This is spectacular.

                         PETER
               That's why Tom wanted you to stay.  It's
               better than squeezing into my room, and I
               know how you hate hotels.

                         MARGE
               A hotel would've been fine.
                   (to Ripley)
               We'll have to tell Mr Greenleaf how far
               his dollar has stretched.

     Ripley is shaking a martini. Marge laughs, helpless, somehow
     raging. Peter turns

                         PETER
               What's funny?

                         MARGE
               No, nothing. I'm just thinking about when
               Tom arrived in Mongi.
                   (to Ripley)
               And now look at you.

                         RIPLEY
               Look at me what?

                         MARGE
               To the manner born.

     EXT. PIAZZA SAN MARCO, VENICE. DAY.

     St Mark's Square is buzzing with life - tourists, balloon
     sellers - a man playing saxophone. HERBERT GREENLEAF sits out
     in the colonade on one of the many tables at Florian's Cafe,
     cradling a glass of hot water. He gets up as Marge and Ripley
     arrive.

                         RIPLEY
               Mr Greenleaf.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Tom. How are you?  You look well.

                         RIPLEY
               I'm well, thank you.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Far cry from New York.

                         RIPLEY
               Yes it is.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Marge, good morning.  Unusual weather.

                         MARGE
               Very.

                         RIPLEY
               And you, sir?  Any better?

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Pretty good.  Sticking with hot water.

                         MARGE
               Where's Mr MacCarron?

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               San Remo. The police are amateurs. Well,
               my boy, it's come to a pretty pass,
               hasn't it?

                         RIPLEY
               Yes.  What's the detective hoping to
               find in San Remo?

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               He's being thorough, that's all. I'm
               learning about my son, Tom, now he's
               missing. I'm learning a great deal about
               him. I hope you can fill in some more
               blanks for me. Marge has been good enough
               to do that, about Mongibello.

                         RIPLEY
               I'll try my best, sir. Obviously I'll do
               anything to help Dickie.

     Marge looks at him in contempt.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               This theory, the letter he left for you,
               the Police think that's a clear
               indication he was planning on doing
               something...to himself.

                         MARGE
               I just don't believe that!

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               You don't want to, dear. I'd like to talk
               to Tom alone - perhaps this afternoon?
               Would you mind? Marge, what a man may say
               to his sweetheart and what he'll admit to
               another fellow -

                         MARGE
               Such as?

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               What a waste of lives and opportunities
               and -

     A saxophonist is blaring away in the piazza. Greenleaf
     suddenly explodes.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
                         (cont'd)
               - I'd pay that fellow a hundred dollars
               right now to shut up!

     INT. RIPLEY'S HOUSE. AFTERNOON.

     Herbert Greenleaf sits on a chair, Ripley pours him some tea.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
                   (reading, plunging into gloom)
               No, Marge doesn't know the half of it.

                         RIPLEY
               I think it might hurt her to know.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               And his passport photo? Did you hear? To
               scratch out your own face like that - can
               you imagine - the frame of mind you'd
               have to be in?
                   (reading)
               I've thought about going to the police
               but I can't face it. I can't face
               anything anymore.

                         RIPLEY
               I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him
               away. I spoke and he heard you.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
                   (such a disappointed father)
               Well, if we all pushed him away what
               about him pushing us away? You've been a
               great friend to my son. Everything is
               someone else's fault. We all want to sow
               wild oars. Somebody's got to - what's the
               word?
                   (Ripley shakes his head)
               The moment someone confronts him he
               lashes out.  He lashes out. You know,
               people always say you can't choose your
               parents, but you can't choose your
               children.

     INT. RIPLEY'S HOUSE, VENICE. DUSK.

     Ripley wakes up from an awful, chilling nightmare, his head
     full of ghosts. He's cramped up in an armchair, his arms in
     sine foetal protection. HIS DOOR KNOCKER IS BEING REPEATEDLY
     SHAKEN. He surfaces thickly, stumbles to the door. It's Peter
     and Marge.

                         RIPLEY
               I'm sorry. I was asleep. I must have
               fallen asleep.

                         PETER
               You look ghastly, Tom. Are you okay?

                         MARGE
               Did Dickie's Dad go?

                         RIPLEY
               He's having an early night.

                         MARGE
               Poor man.
                   (she heads to her room)
               We were knocking on that door for ever.
                   (she fiddles inside the sleeve
                    of her dress)
               I think I've broken my strap.

                         PETER
               Not guilty.

                         RIPLEY
               I'll fix some drinks.

                         MARGE
               You walk in Venice!

     She takes off her shoe, examining her feet for wear and tear,
     then disappears into the bedroom. Peter walks over to Ripley,
     a little concerned.

                         PETER
               Are you okay?

                         RIPLEY
               I'm fine.

                         PETER
                   (a hand on his shoulder)
               Do you want me to stick around?

                         RIPLEY
               It's okay.

                         PETER
               Or I could come back.

     Ripley looks at him. That's never happened. He digs in his
     pocket, finds his key, gives it to Peter. Peter smiles.

                         PETER (cont'd)
               Your key.

     INT. RIPLEY'S BATHROOM, VENICE. NIGHT.

     Ripley's in the bath. Marge knocks on his door.

                         MARGE (O/S)
               Tom?

                         RIPLEY
               Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.

                         MARGE (O/S)
               Tom, I need to talk to you. It's urgent.

     Ripley, irritated, opens the door, his towel wrapped around
     his waist. Marge is white. She's wearing a robe. She's
     slightly breathless.

                         MARGE
               I found Dickie's rings.

                         RIPLEY
               What?

                         MARGE
               You've got Dickie's rings.

                         RIPLEY
               I can explain.

     He can't. His eyes dart. Marge holds up the evidence.

                         MARGE
               Dickie promised me he would never take
               off this ring.

                         RIPLEY
               Let me put on some clothes and then we
               can talk about this.

                         MARGE
               I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to
               tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr
               Greenleaf.

                         RIPLEY
               Marge, calm down, you're being
               hysterical.

                         MARGE
               He promised me. I swear I'll never take
               off this ring until the day -

                         RIPLEY
               Shut up! Shut up!

     His towel slips off from his waist.

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
               I'm wet, Marge, I've lost my towel, I'd
               really like to put my clothes on. So go
               and pour us both a drink, will you?

     She goes off obediently, a zombie. He shuts the door.
     Immediately he starts looking for something, anything, to
     kill Marge with. He's got a shoe but it feels too light. He
     opens cabinets, drawers - nail scissors, nothing - then
     picks up his straight razor and considers it in the mirror.

     INT. RIPLEY'S SITTING ROOM, VENICE. NIGHT.

     Marge is leaving, coat on, as Ripley comes out of the
     bathroom.

                         RIPLEY
               Marge?  Where are you going?

                         MARGE
                   (like a creature caught in
                    headlights)
               I was looking for a needle and thread. I
               wasn't snooping. I was looking for a
               needle and thread to mend my bra.

                         RIPLEY
               The scent you're wearing. I bought it for
               you, not Dickie. The thing about Dickie.
               So many things. The day he was late back
               from Rome - I tried to tell you this - he
               was with another girl. I'm not talking
               about Meredith, another girl we met in a
               bar. He couldn't be faithful for five
               minutes. So when he makes a promise it
               doesn't mean what it means when you make
               a promise. Or I do. He has so many
               realities, Dickie, and he believes them
               all. He lies. He lies, that's his... half
               the time he doesn't even realize.

     A SMALL RED STAIN is appearing on the pocket of his robe. As
     he speaks the stain spreads. He looks at it absently.

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
               Today, for the first time, I've even
               wondered whether he might have killed
               Freddie. He would get so crazy if anybody
               contradicted him - well, you know that.
               Marge. I loved you - you might as well
               know - I loved you, and because he knew I
               loved you, he let you think I loved him.
               Didn't you see, couldn't you see? I don't
               know, maybe it's grotesque to say this
               now, so just write it on a piece of paper
               or something, and keep it in your purse
               for a rainy day. Tom loves me.

                         MARGE
                   (as if she'd heard nothing)
               Why do you have Dickie's rings?

     His hand goes to his pocket. HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO DO IT.

                         RIPLEY
               I told you. He gave them to me.

                         MARGE
               Why? When?

                         RIPLEY
               I feel as if you haven't heard anything
               I've been saying to you.

                         MARGE
               I don't believe you.

                         RIPLEY
               It's all true.

                         MARGE
               I don't believe a single word you've
               said.

     Marge is shivering. Ripley, ominous, advances, she retreats.

                         RIPLEY
               You're shivering, Marge. Can I hold you?
               Would you let me hold you?

     Marge panics, backed up against the door. She screams and
     turns straight into the arms of a startled PETER who's come
     back to visit Ripley, and is unlocking the door.

                         MARGE
                   (sobbing uncontrollably)
               Oh Peter! Get me out of here.

     Ripley storms off. His hand comes out of his pocket COVERED
     IN BLOOD from the razor. Peter notices, appalled.

                         PETER
               Tom, are you okay?

                         RIPLEY
               You try. You try talking to her.

                         PETER
                   (calls after him)
               Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on?

                         RIPLEY
                   (not turning around)
               I give up.

     INT. RIPLEY HOUSE, LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.

     Peter has just put a band-aid over Ripley's cut hand.

                         PETER
               You can't be angry with her.  She's upset
               and needs someone to blame. So she blames
               you.  I'll go home and talk to her.  As
               for you - either get a safety razor or
               grow a beard.

     INT. LOBBY, EUROPA REGINA HOTEL, VENICE. MORNING.

     Ripley hurries through the gleaming marble entrance.

     INT. HERBERT GREENLEAF'S SUITE, EUROPA REGINA. DAY.

     Ripley knocks on the door. It's opened by a face he doesn't
     recognize. A middle-aged heavy set man. It's MacCARRON, the
     private investigator.

                         RIPLEY
               Is Mr Greenleaf here?

                         MACCARRON
               Mr Ripley? I'm Alvin MacCarron.

                         MARGE (O/S)
               I don't know, I don't know, I just know
               it.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
                         (O/S)
               Marge, there's female intuition, and
               then there are facts -

     Greenleaf sits with a scrubbed Marge, her hair pulled back,
     as if newly-widowed. THE RINGS SIT GLINTING ON THE COFFEE
     TABLE.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Tom.

                         RIPLEY
               Hello, sir.
                   (smiles thinly at Marge)
               Marge, you should have waited, didn't
               Peter tell you I'd come by and pick you
               up?

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Marge has been telling us about the
               rings.

                         RIPLEY
               You know I feel ridiculous I didn't
               mention them yesterday - I clean forgot -
               ridiculous.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               Perhaps you didn't mention them because
               there's only one conclusion to be drawn.

     Ripley worries about what that conclusion is as Mr Greenleaf
     heads into his bedroom.

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
                         (cont'd)
               I'm going to take Marge for a little
               walk, Tom.  Mr MacCarron wants to talk
               with you.

                         RIPLEY
                   (feeling caged in)
               We could go down to the bar - no need for
               you to -

                         HERBERT GREENLEAF
               No, he should talk to you alone.

     He helps Marge to her feet and leads her out. RIPLEY IS
     PARALYSED. He waits for the door to shut. Aimlessly he walks
     out onto the terrace, with its staggering, beautiful and
     indifferent view.

     EXT. EUROPA REGINA, THE GREENLEAF TERRACE. DAY.

     Ripley stands, steels himself for MacCarron's charges.

                         RIPLEY
               I could probably see my bedroom from
               here. I can see my house. When you see
               where you live from a distance it's like
               a dream, isn't it?

                         MACCARRON
                   (coming out)
               I don't care for B.S. I don't care to
               hear it. I don't care to speak it.

                         RIPLEY
               Okay.

                         MACCARRON
               Why do you think Dickie's father sent him
               to Europe in the first place? Did you
               know at Princeton Dickie Greenleaf half-
               killed a boy?

     Ripley turns, shocked.

                         MACCARRON
                         (cont'd)
               At a party. Over some girl. He kicked the
               kid several times in the head. Put him in
               the hospital. The boy had a wire fixed in
               his jaw. The Rome Police didn't think to
               ask Mr Greenleaf.

     MacCarron gets up.

                         MACCARRON
                         (cont'd)
               Nor did they think to check whether a
               Thomas Ripley had ever been a student at
               Princeton University. I turned up a Tom
               Ripley who'd been a piano tuner in the
               music department.

     Ripley's head drops.

                         MACCARRON
                         (cont'd)
               See - in America we're taught to check a
               fact before it becomes a fact. We're
               taught to nose around when a girl drowns
               herself, find out if that girl was
               pregnant, find out if Dickie had an
               embarrassment there.

     Ripley doesn't know where this barrage is going.

                         MACCARRON
                         (cont'd)
               Mr Greenleaf appreciates your loyalty.
               He really does. Marge, she's got a
               hundred theories, but there are a few
               things she doesn't know. We hope she
               never knows.

                         RIPLEY
               I hope she never knows.

                         MACCARRON
               Three different people saw Dickie get
               into Freddie Miles' car. A man who won't
               identify himself because he was jumping
               someone else's wife at the time saw
               Dickie removing license plates from a red
               sports car. The Police know about this
               man because he happens to be a Policeman.

     He walks out of the room, returns carrying THE LICENSE PLATES
     from Freddie's car.

                         MACCARRON
                         (cont'd)
               I found these in the basement of Dickie's
               apartment. They belonged to Freddie's
               car. Mr Greenleaf has asked me to lose
               them in the canal this evening.

     Ripley can't believe what he's hearing. It's like a dream.

                         MACCARRON
                         (cont'd)
               Mr Greenleaf also feels there was a
               silent promise in Dickie's letter to you
               which he intends to honor. He intends to
               transfer a good part of Dickie's income
               from his trust into your name. He doesn't
               intend to give the Italian police any
               information about Dickie's past. He's
               rather hoping you'll feel the same.

     There is a silence in which this strange compact is agreed.

     EXT. EUROPA REGINA MOORING. DAY.

     Ripley stands with Marge, Mr Greenleaf and MacCarron at the
     water's edge - MOTOR LAUNCH growling. They shake hands, and
     then MacCarron and Mr Greenleaf get into the launch. Herbert
     Greenleaf carries the saxophone case.

                         RIPLEY
                   (to Marge)
               I feel I never should have said those
               things to you the other evening. I was
               pretty flustered, the rings and - and you
               looked so, I don't know.

     Marge shakes her head to silence him.

                         RIPLEY (cont'd)
               But I hope that note goes to New York in
               your purse, for a rainy day.

                         MARGE
               What are you going to do now, Tom?

                         RIPLEY
               I don't know. Peter has a concert in
               Athens next month - and he's asked if I
               want to go along, help out. He says
               goodbye by the way - he's in rehearsal,
               otherwise -

                         MARGE
               Why do I think there's never been a
               Ripley rainy day?

                         RIPLEY
               What?

                         MARGE
                   (lunging at him)
               I know it was you - I know it was you,
               Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed
               Dickie. I know it was you.

                         RIPLEY
               Oh Marge.

     He puts his hand out to control her. She pushes it away.
     STARTS TO LASH OUT AT HIM, the frustration too much, so that
     Ripley has to cover his face. MacCarron comes off the boat to
     restrain her.  Ripley looks at him as if to say: what can you
     do, she's hysterical. MacCarron nods, pulls her on to the
     boat. Greenleaf catches Ripley's eye, guiltily. Turns away.
     They stand silhouetted as the launch revs up and surges off
     towards open waters, passing the little fleets of gondolas.

     EXT. FERRY FOR ATHENS, NAPLES. DAY.

     A week later and Peter and Ripley are on the deck of the
     ferry, the HELLENES, as it sails towards Greece.  They're
     laughing.

                         RIPLEY
               Ask me what I want to change about this
               moment.

                         PETER
               What do you want to change about this
               moment?

                         RIPLEY
               Nothing.

     INT. PETER'S CABIN. DUSK.

     Peter's in a bathrobe organising his currency, his
     traveller's cheques. Ripley knocks on the door, comes in.

                         PETER
               Hello.  What are you up to?

                         RIPLEY
               All kinds of things. Making plans.

                         PETER
               Plans - good, plans for tonight or plans
               for the future?

                         RIPLEY
               I don't know. Both. My plan right now is
               to go up on deck, look at the sunset.
               Come with me.

                         PETER
               You go. I don't want to get dressed yet.
               Come back though.  Come back.
                   (smiles at him)
               You know, you look so relaxed, like a
               completely different person.

                         RIPLEY
               Well, that's entirely your fault.  And,
               if I fall overboard, that'll be your
               fault too.

     EXT. DECK OF THE HELLENES. SUNSET.

     Ripley stands on deck, staring at the magnificent sunset.
     Then a voice shakes him from his reverie.

                         MEREDITH
               Dickie?  Dickie?

     He turns. He's caught. Suddenly he's Dickie.

                         MEREDITH (cont'd)
               Dickie, my God!

                         RIPLEY
               Hello Meredith.

                         MEREDITH
               I was looking at you, your clothes, I
               wouldn't have known you...

                         RIPLEY
               Well, you've spotted me and so you get
               the reward.

                         MEREDITH
               What?

                         RIPLEY
               Just kidding. Are you alone?

                         MEREDITH
               Hardly. I couldn't be less alone.

     Meredith points to the UPPER DECK BALCONY where TWO OLDER
     COUPLES are walking around the deck.

                         RIPLEY
               Of course.  Aunt Joan.

                         MEREDITH
               And co. A lot of co. Oh, God, I've
               thought about you so much.

                         RIPLEY
               I've thought about you.

     And now he's thinking I can't kill them all...

                         MEREDITH
               When I thought about you I was mostly
               hating you. Where've you been hiding?

                         RIPLEY
               I haven't been hiding. I've been in
               Police custody. They've been trying to
               flush out Freddie's killer.

                         MEREDITH
               You're kidding.

                         RIPLEY
               They're letting me have this vacation.
               Which is why the get-up. Which is why you
               haven't heard from me.

                         MEREDITH
               You know, the whole world thinks you
               killed Freddie? It's terrible.

                         RIPLEY
               I know. Look, I can't talk now. Later.
               Later?

     He kisses her.  Full of future.

                         MEREDITH
               So - are you travelling under R?

                         RIPLEY
               You know what - I am.

                         MEREDITH
               Dickie, are you with Peter Smith-
               Kingsley?  I bet you are. My aunt thought
               she saw him.

                         RIPLEY
                   (horrified)
               Peter Smith-Kingsley? I haven't seen him
               in months.  No, I'm alone.
                   (and he understands this is not
                    any kind of lie)

     INT. PETER'S CABIN. NIGHT.

     Peter's working on his score, lying on his front, apparently
     engrossed. Ripley knocks and enters. Looks long at Peter.

                         PETER
               How was it?

                         RIPLEY
               Good. But I think we should stay in here
               for the rest of the trip.

                         PETER
               Was that Meredith?

                         RIPLEY
                   (sighs)
               Was who Meredith?

                         PETER
               Meredith Logue. You were kissing
               somebody. Looked like Meredith.

                         RIPLEY
               Hardly kissing. Kissing off.

                         PETER
               Didn't look that way - you know - from a
               distance.

                         RIPLEY
               I lied. To her. She thought she'd seen
               you.

                         PETER
               Why lie?

                         RIPLEY
               Dickie and Peter, that's just too good
               gossip, isn't it?

                         PETER
               Or Tom and Peter even.

                         RIPLEY
               Well that would be even better gossip.

                         PETER
               Really, why?
                   (completely lost)
               Sorry, I'm completely lost.

                         RIPLEY
               I know. I'm lost, too. I'm going to be
               stuck in the basement, aren't I, that's
               my, that's my - terrible and alone and
               dark - and I've lied about who I am, and
               where I am, and so nobody can ever find
               me.

                         PETER
               What do you mean lied about who you are?

                         RIPLEY
               I suppose I always thought - better to be
               a fake somebody than a real nobody.

                         PETER
               What are you talking about - you're not a
               nobody! That's the last thing you are.

                         RIPLEY
               Peter, I... I...

                         PETER
                   (conciliatory)
               And don't forget. I have the key.

                         RIPLEY
               You have the key. Tell me some good
               things about Tom Ripley. Don't get up.
               Just tell me some nice things.

     He sits on the bed, leans against Peter. His eyes are
     brimming with tears.  He takes the cord from Peter's robe and
     begins twisting it in his hands.

                         PETER
               Good things about Tom Ripley?  Could take
               some time!... Tom is talented. Tom is
               tender... Tom is beautiful...

                         RIPLEY
                   (during this, and tender)
               You're such a liar...

                         PETER
               ...Tom is a mystery...

     Ripley is pressing against him, moving up his body, kisses
     his shoulder, the cord wrapped tight in his hands...

     INT. RIPLEY'S CABIN. NIGHT.

     Ripley returns to his cabin. Sits on the bed, desolate.

                         PETER (O/S)
                   (cont'd)
               ...Tom is not a nobody. Tom has secrets
               he doesn't want to tell me, and I wish he
               would. Tom has nightmares. That's not a
               good thing. Tom has someone to love him.
               That is a good thing!
                   (feeling Ripley's weight on
                    him)
               Tom is crushing me. Tom is crushing me.
                   (suddenly alarmed)
               Tom, you're crushing me!

     The door of his closet flips open with the swell and he
     catches his reflection. It swings shut. Open then shut.
     Through the porthole the weather's changing as the light
     dies. There's a swell as the horizon rises and falls in the
     round glass. Ripley, alone, in a nightmare of his own making.

     THE END.






     Lullaby for Cain

     From the silence
     from the night
     comes a distant lullabye

     Cry, remembering that first cry
     Your brother standing by
     and loved
     both loved
     beloved sons of mine
     sing a lullabye
     mother is close by
     innocent eyes
     such innocent eyes

     Envy stole your brother's life
     came home murdered peace of mind
     left you nightmares on the pillow
     sleep now

     Soul, surrendering your soul
     the heart of you not whole
     for love
     but love
     what toll

     Cast into the dark
     branded with the mark
     of shame
     of Cain

     From the garden of God's light
     to a wilderness of light
     sleep now

     sleep now.
