     FADE INTO:

     SEPIA-TONE FOOTAGE

     of a pig chasing a lion chasing a dinosaur chasing an
     elephant.  Noah's Ark going round... and round... and
     round...


     EXT. GRIFFITH PARK CAROUSEL - DAY

     Disjointed CALLIOPE MUSIC as the wheel of fate and
     fortune goes around until we PULL BACK to reveal:

     JON ARCHER (30) rising winged Pegasus.  On the adjacent
     unicorn is his son MATTHEW (5).  Clutching a balloon,
     Matty waves at his dad.  A happy moment, like so many
     certain to follow -- until we realize we are watching
     them THROUGH...


     SNIPER'S RIFLE SCOPE - SNIPER'S EYES

     wait until the child clears his aim -- Archer is the
     target.  They round the bend and disappear...


     MATTHEW

     Loses his grip on the unicorn.  Archer reaches over and
     pulls him into his lap.  They happily ride together...

     As the horses sweep back INTO VIEW... exposing Archer...

     Now we see the sniper.  CASTOR TROY is cool, efficient,
     aggressive, sexual.  His finger closes around the
     trigger.

     BOOM!  A BULLET RIPS into Archer's back.  Bleeding... he
     drops off his horse... and sinks to the deck of the
     carousel.  His eyes desperately searching... searching...
     searching... until he sees --

     Matthew lies on his back -- still.  Slowly, Archer
     reaches out and takes Matthew's hand... and now we see
     COLOR for the first time...

     Blood red... as bleeding father touches bleeding son...

     TILT UP TO the winged Pegasus flying by -- now in full
     color and UP UP UP TO Matthew's red balloon... floating
     away.

     HANDEL'S MESSIAH OVER a SERIES OF SHOTS:


     FBI BRIEFING ROOM

     Gazing out the window as dawn breaks over the city below
     is Jon Archer... older... unshaven... fatigued... his
     eyes reveal a man in the grip of obsession.


     CAROUSEL HORSE

     sweeps by, as if marking time itself...


     HOLY PLACE

     Smoky, spiritual... dominated by a gleaming, golden
     cross.  A priest kneels before it -- deep in prayer.  The
     glimmering cross comes INTO FOCUS... but it's just a
     light-reflection... off the casing of a large bomb.  This
     is no chapel... but an atrium.  Somewhere.

     And as the "priest" rubs out his cigarette we see it's
     Castor Troy -- carefully installing this complex device.


     ANOTHER CAROUSEL HORSE

     sweeps by...


     ARCHER

     pockets his FBI badge, then holsters his gun...


     CASTOR

     sets the bomb timer -- then replaces a wall panel in
     front of it.  Totally hidden.


     BRIEFING ROOM - CASTOR'S MUGSHOT

     is on a computer screen.  His criminal dossier scrolls by
     endlessly:  bombings, assassinations, mercenary
     kidnappings, terrorism-for-hire...

     Rookie agent LOOMIS studies the details carefully.  Other
     agents -- including BUZZ and WANDA scan computer grid-
     maps, man phones, etc. amid the take-out cartons and
     coffee cups.  These people are on high alert.

                             ARCHER
               Any follow-up from L.A.P.D.
               Intelligence?

                             BUZZ
               No, sir, nothing yet.

                             ARCHER
               Get them on the phone -- now.
               What about S.I.S. and our airport
               teams?

                             WANDA
               We've had everything from psychics
               to satellites on this.  Even if
               Castor was here... he must have
               slipped the net by now...

                             ARCHER
               He's here!  And we're going to
               keep looking until we find him!

     A silence descends on the chastised team.  As they go
     back to work, veteran agent TITO BIONDI takes Archer
     aside.

                             TITO
               Jon, these people have been
               working round the clock -- you
               gotta cut them some slack...

     Archer considers his best friend's advice -- then...

                             ARCHER
               I'll cut them some slack when I
               cut myself some slack.

     Archer marches out -- slamming the door behind him.


     INT. CORRIDOR - DAY (MORNING)

     Castor quietly shuts the security door behind him.  An
     Hispanic voice startles him.

                             JANITOR
               What are you doing?

                             CASTOR
                      (in perfect Spanish)
               Thank goodness, I feel like Icarus
               in the labyrinth -- where's the
               men's room?

                             JANITOR
                      (in Spanish)
               This area is off limits, Padre.
                      (re:  security door)
               How did you get in that room?

     Realizing the JANITOR is already too suspicious, Castor
     puts a priestly arm around him -- and leads him down the
     hall.

                             CASTOR
               Okay... I have a confession to
               make, but you aren't gonna like
               it.  I was planting a bomb.

                             JANITOR
               Bomb?

                             CASTOR
               You know -- boom --
                      (patting his
                       neck)
               Oh, never mind...

     The Janitor suddenly twitches, his eyes rolls up in his
     head.  As he gasps his last -- Castor heaves him down a
     stairwell.  Now we see the needle-thin custom stiletto in
     Castor's hand.

     Castor kicks the Janitor's mop and bucket down the stairs
     -- making everything look like an accident.


     INT. SAME BUILDING - MAIN FLOOR - DAY (MORNING)

     The children's church choir -- 200 strong -- sing "Behold
     the Lamb of God."  Clergy and lay persons listen
     reverently.

     "Father" Castor strolls by the singers -- casually
     heading for the exit.  As he passes the risers, a teenage
     girl drops her sheet music at his feet.

     Returning it -- he whispers in her ear -- so close he's
     practically licking it.

                             CASTOR
               I've never enjoyed 'The Messiah.'
               But your voice makes even a hack
               like Handel seem like a genius.

     He pats her behind and leaves.  Although a little shaken,
     she's also drawn by Castor's sexual magnetism.


     EXT. LA CONVENTION CENTER - DAY (MORNING)

     The marquee proclaims:  INTERNATIONAL CHURCH CHOIRS 18th-
     21st:  AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION.

     Castor exits -- politely holding the door for a beat cop.


     INT. ARCHER'S OFFICE - DAY (MORNING)

     The office is a monument to obsession:  photographs,
     clues, newsclips, totems of Castor Troy surround a pacing
     Archer.

                             ARCHER
                      (on phone)
               ... I don't have time to get a
               warrant from some hung-over judge.
               Just give me the go-ahead, Victor,
               and I promise -- as soon as this
               is over -- you can brand my butt
               with the Fourth Amendment.

     The instant Archer hangs up -- the INTERCOM BUZZES.

                             KIM (V.O.)
               Sir, your wife's on line one...
               S.I.S. on two...

                             ARCHER
               Tell her to hang on --

     As Archer punches up line two -- Tito bursts in.

                             TITO
               A jet was chartered at Anderson
               Airfield.  Guess who just showed
               up to pay for it?  Pollux Troy.

                             ARCHER
               Scramble the Reaction Team --
               we're moving out.  And get one of
               our people on that plane.

                             TITO
               But there's still no sign of
               Castor...

                             ARCHER
               Where one brother goes, the
               other's sure to follow...

     They rush our... the hold button on line 1 still
     blinking.


     EXT. PRIVATE AIRPORT - ESTABLISHING - DAY

     A sleek Cadillac pulls in... stopping next to a Land
     Rover.

     LARS MUELLER -- a muscular, crystal-eyed jar-head -- gets
     out of the Caddy.  An instant later -- LUNT MUELLER --
     emerges from the Rover.  They are identical twins.

     The men scan the airport carefully, then open the rear
     doors of their respective vehicles.  Castor emerges from
     the Caddy -- Armani clad.

     Exiting the Rover is Castor's younger brother POLLUX TROY
     -- skittish, brilliant, paranoid -- a human hummingbird.

                             POLLUX
               You're 26 minutes late.  The
               casing didn't fit -- right?  I
               knew that cheap-shit Dietrich
               would rip us off...

                             CASTOR
               Oh, God -- !

                             POLLUX
               What!?

                             CASTOR
               I forgot to turn the damn thing
               on!

                              POLLUX
               You're kidding, right?
                      (to the twins)
               He's kidding...
                      (grabs Castor
                       by throat)
               ... are you fucking kidding!?

     Castor hugs Pollux lovingly.  Pollux squirms like a kid.

                             CASTOR
               Bro -- everything went fine.

                             POLLUX
               I hate when you call me bro.

     Pollux heads for the jet.  Castor hands Lunt a wad of
     cash.

                             CASTOR
               Thanks for babysitting.

                             LUNT
               Anything else?

                             CASTOR
               I'll contact you when we get the
               rest of the money.
                      (turns to leave)
               Oh, and stat away from downtown.
               The inversion layer's going to be
               pretty thick around the 18th.

     The twins nod... then take off.  Castor heads for the
     jet.


     INT. JET - DAY

     Castor hustles in -- exhorting the PILOT.

                             CASTOR
               Let's go, let's go!

     As the JET TURBINES start to WHINE, Castor sinks into his
     seat.  A very sexy FLIGHT ATTENDANT appears and hands him
     a Scotch.  He downs it, looking her over salaciously.

                             FLIGHT ATTENDANT
               Would you like anything else?

                             CASTOR
               Hell, yes...
                      (pulls her into lap)
               It's the only way to fly.

     She smiles, not minding, until the jet suddenly slows its
     taxi down the runway.


     COCKPIT

     Castor yanks open the door.

                             CASTOR
               What's wrong?


     AT END OF RUNWAY

     A squat car creeps INTO VIEW -- blocking the runway.


     EXT./INT. HUMVEE - MOVING - DAY

     Behind the wheel is Jon Archer.  Beside him is Tito.


     BACK TO ARCHER

                             CASTOR
               It's Archer.
                      (gun to Pilot's
                       head)
               Go, dammit!

     Suddenly the gun is BLASTED from Castor's hand.  he turns
     around to see... the Flight Attendant behind them --
     holding a smoking pistol.  This is Agent WINTERS.

                             WINTERS
               F.B.I.!  Throttle down, captain!

     But Castor elbows the throttle up.  The jet lurches
     forward, throwing Winters off balance.  Pollux tackles
     her as the jet picks up speed.


     INT. HUMVEE - DAY

     Archer slams the vehicle into gear.

                             ARCHER
               Get out.

                             TITO
               You're not playing chicken with
               two tons of aluminum...

                             ARCHER
               Get out!

     Tito obeys as Archer peels out.  The HUMMER ROARS at the
     jet.

     The jet picks up speed, trying to get aloft.

     The humvee is aimed right at it... Archer's eyes narrow.


     COLLISION COURSE

     as two hunks of metal bear down.  The machines are
     seconds apart when --

     Archer looks up to see...

     Winters' face pressed up against the cockpit window,
     Castor holding a gun to her head.

     Archer cuts the wheel -- just avoiding the jet.  The
     Hummer skids to a stop as Federal back-up arrives -- but 
     too late.  Archer watches an FBI chopper -- landing in a 
     swirl of dust.

     As the jet picks up speed... the hatch opens.  Castor
     blasts Winters in the side and tosses her onto the
     tarmac.


     INSIDE

     Castor smiles at Pollux, sensing freedom, until...

     KA-CHUNK:  Something POUNDS the jet -- from above.
     Castor leans out the hatch and sees...

     The chopper on top of them -- Archer at the controls.

     Eye-contact -- years of hatred pass between these men.

     Castor BLASTS at him from the open hatch.

     The chopper's left windscreen spiderwebs.  Archer jerks
     and weaves -- dodging the BULLETS.  The chopper pulls
     away.

     The jet finally lifts off... when...

     The chopper settles on the jet -- slamming at its tail.


     TARMAC

     Tito reacts to this madness -- as the chopper plays a 
     deadly game of leap-frog with the jet.

     The end of the runway is coming up fast.

     Archer crushes the jet's horizontal elevator flap.


     JET PILOT

     can't budge the jet's jammed yoke.  Thwarted, he powers
     back the throttle.  Thrust reverse.

                             CASTOR
               What are you doing?

                             PILOT
               The horizontal elevator's smashed!
               We can't lift off!


     CASTOR

     SHOOTS the Pilot -- then takes the controls.  He
     struggles to maneuver the jet.  Suddenly...

     A biplane descends right at them -- about to land.


     ARCHER

     pulls up just as the JET swerves radically to avoid the
     biplane and SLAMS into the hangar.


     JET

     plows through the GLASS DOOR, the NOSE-WHEEL SNAPS off.
     The PLANE SKIDS right into the hangar -- finally stopping
     at the wings.


     FBI CHOPPER

     lands.  Archer steps out calmly -- like a cop about to 
     write a traffic ticket.  He hurries to join more FBI 
     agents rushing into the hangar ahead of him.


     INT. HANGAR - DAY

     The jet hatch pops open -- Castor leaps from it, FIRING.

     Two FBI agents drop -- riddled.

     Pollux appears at the hatch -- an FBI sharpshooter FIRES,
     grazing Pollux's shoulder.  Staggered, Pollux falls --

     Castor catches him before he hits the floor --
     simultaneously BLASTING the sharpshooter.

     Castor drags Pollux back into the smoke-filled hangar.

     Archer arrives and quickly checks the dead agents, his
     anger building.  He signals Tito and the others to spread
     out.


     DEEP IN HANGAR

     A maze of airplane debris and heavy machinery.  Led by
     Archer, the FBI agents pick their way through it.

     ROOKIE LOOMIS snaps alert -- did he see something?
     Advancing carefully, he comes up on...

     Castor -- staunching Pollux's shoulder wound.  Pollux
     sees the agent -- and FIRES.

     Loomis hits the floor -- his bleeding ear is shredded.

     Suddenly a forklift charges down on Castor and Pollux.

     Tito is at the wheel.  Castor FIRES -- forcing Tito to
     dive off.  The forklift careens on -- driving apart the
     brothers.

     The forklift upends a stack of heavy crates -- pinning
     Pollux.  Castor tries to free his trapped brother.

                             POLLUX
               Forget it -- Go!  Go!

     He slaps his Glock into Pollux's hand.

                             CASTOR
               Wherever they put you, I'll find a
               way to get you out...

     Pollux starts FIRING -- covering Castor as he runs
     through a tunnel which leads to an adjoining hangar.

     Suddenly Wanda presses her machine-pistol into Pollux's
     head.  As Pollux raises his gun -- Tito grabs his hand.

                             TITO
               -- not unless you want that 200
               I.Q. splattered all over the
               floor.
                      (as Archer
                       approaches)
               We got him now, Jon.

                             ARCHER
               That's what you always say.  Seal
               it off.  I'm going in.

     Archer moves away from the group and enters the tunnel.

     MUSIC as Archer and Castor begin their cat-and-mouse
     dance.

     Sensing Archer, Castor pauses by an old landing gear.  He
     draws a fresh pistol from his ankle holster and moves on.

     Archer pauses at the landing gear... his own stealthy
     movements mirroring Castor's.

     Castor waits behind a stack of steel drums... his gaze
     trying to penetrate the darkness... He SNAPS his fingers.
     The sound ECHOES as he tries to draw Archer in.

     Archer reacts to the sound and SNAPS back -- answering
     the challenge.  As the deadly beat between them
     continues --

     BLAM BLAM BLAM!  Archer spins away just as Castor OPENS
     FIRE from the gloom... one step ahead.

     INTERCUT as necessary:

                             CASTOR
               Jon, I'm getting a little annoyed
               by your obsessive need to spoil my
               fun.

                             ARCHER
               And how much will your 'fun' net
               you this time?

     BOOM BOOM BOOM!  Half-blind SHOTS send Castor spinning.
     A moment later, Archer pursues... SNAP!  He fits a new
     CLIP into his pistol.

                             CASTOR
               What's it to you?  I declare it.
               Here I am, back in the States for
               less than a week --

                             ARCHER
               You're under arrest.  Incredibly,
               you still have the right to remain
               silent --

                             CASTOR
               I've got something going down on
               the eighteenth... it's gonna be
               worse than anything God ever
               dumped on the Pharaoh.  I'll give
               it up -- but my brother and I have
               to walk.

                             ARCHER
               No discussion -- no deals.

                             CASTOR
               What're you gonna do with me
               locked up?  You'll drive your wife
               and kid nuts!  I bet your daughter
               is just about ripe by now.  What's
               her name, Janie?

     Enraged, Archer steps boldly forward -- trying to draw
     his enemy out.  Silence -- then Archer senses...

     Castor is behind him.  He FIRES -- Archer dives away.
     The BARRAGE CONTINUES -- driving Archer back between two
     huge turbine engines.  As Archer reloads, he stares at
     the control panel switches.

     Castor moves in for the kill when he hears a final SNAP-
     SNAP.  Except it isn't a finger snap... it's two
     switches.

     VRRRROOOM!  The TWIN ENGINES ROAR on!  Unable to fight
     the churning tornado-force wind... Castor's blasted
     across the hangar... slamming hard into the far wall.

     The ENGINES STOP and Archer emerges -- joined by Tito.

                             TITO
               Tell me he didn't get away
               again...

     Then Tito follows Archer's gaze to Castor's lifeless
     body.  Still as death -- somehow his mocking smile
     survives.


     EXT. AIRPORT TARMAC - SUNSET

     Heavily-manacled, an extremely agitated Pollux is herded
     into a SWAT van by Buzz and Wanda.

                             POLLUX
               Where's my brother?!  I want to
               see my brother!

     The van takes off -- passing an imposing older man, 
     flanked by two bodyguards.  Bullying through the media,
     Assistant FBI Director VICTOR LAZARRO scans the
     devastation.

     Approaching Archer, he watches as Castor's body is loaded
     on the ambulance.  A sheet covers Castor's lifeless face.

                             LAZARRO
               The oversight committee would've
               roasted us for this one -- thank
               God it paid off.  Damn fine work.

                             ARCHER
               Real fine, Victor.  Especially the
               casualties.

     Archer contemplates the slain agents -- their three
     bodies laid out in a row -- waiting to be zip-locked.
     Lazarro reacts grimly as a reporter snaps a photo of the
     bodies.

     Instinctively, the two men close ranks.  Archer grabs the
     Nikon, ejects the film, then shoves the camera back.

                             LAZARRO
               Classified information.  No
               photographs.

     Lazarro puts a caring arm around Archer's shoulder and
     leads him away from the media... and the carnage.

                             LAZARRO
               You okay, Jon?
                      (off Archer's nod)
               Then go home.  Tell Eve.


     EXT.  ARCHER'S HOME (SANTA MONICA) - SUNSET

     A renovated Craftsman.  Sipping a carton of milk, Archer
     pulls into the driveway.  He sits, gathering his
     thoughts.


     INT. ARCHER'S HOME - NIGHT

     Archer enters and sees his wife EVE.  Handsome,
     intelligent.

                             ARCHER
               Hi...
                      (no response)
               ... What's wrong?

     She nods toward the KITCHEN.  JAMIE is there -- a sullen 
     and hard fifteen-year-old.  There are cigarette cartons
     on the table.

                             EVE
               She complimented for her 'F' in
               history with an 'A' in
               shoplifting...

     Archer marches into the kitchen -- noting the crate of
     Marlboros.  Jamie matter-of-factly pours herself coffee.

                             ARCHER
               Nice stunt, Jamie.  You break the
               law and I'm expected to ignore it?

                             JAMIE
               That's right -- it's all about
               you.  Don't even ask me what
               happened.

     Archer looks to Eve for help.  Eve shakes her head --
     nope.

                             ARCHER
               Okay.  What happened?

                             JAMIE
               Like you'd ever fucking believe
               me!

     She bolts.  In anticipation, Eve calmly opens the door as
     Jamie rushes out, then closes it behind her.

                             EVE
               Well, you tried.  You failed
               miserably, but you tried.

                             ARCHER
               Why won't she even talk to me?

                             EVE
               Maybe because you taught her never
               to speak to strangers.
                      (immediately
                       regrets it)
               I'm sorry... that wasn't fair.

     Eve kisses his cheek -- then gathers up her doctor gear.

                             EVE
               I've got patients waiting.  Try
               again, Jon.  She hates you -- but
               she needs you.

                             ARCHER
               Eve...

     Something in Archer's expression makes her stop.

                             EVE
               Jon -- what is it?

     But he's too overcome.  He starts to speak -- but can't.

                             EVE
               Is it -- him?  It's... it's over?

     Emotions avalanche across his face until he finally looks 
     up.  Eve pulls him close -- a sheltering embrace for them 
     both.

                             ARCHER
               I'm going to make everything up to
               you and Jamie.  I'll put in for a
               desk job.  We'll go away, get
               counseling -- anything you want.
               This time, I mean it.


     INT. ARCHER HOME - NIGHT

     Freshly dressed, Archer heads down the hall.  He pauses 
     at the door to Jamie's room when he sees -- Jamie.

     Fully clothed, she's fast asleep on her bed cluttered
     with clothes and assorted girl-stuff.  Her face peaceful.

     Archer looks around her room... sees the stuffed animals 
     collecting dust... replaced by makeup, jewelry, beefcake
     Calvin Klein ads and band posters, etc.

     Archer's startled to see a lacey bustier... his little 
     girl is growing up fast.  And he's missing it.

     He pulls the blanket up over her and quietly slips out.
     The instant he leaves, Jamie kicks the blankets off.


     INT. FBI BUILDING - DAY

     Dominated by the FBI seal.  Archer steps to the check
     point.

                             SECURITY GUARD
               Print, please.

     Archer presses his thumb to a scan-pad -- and is cleared.


     INT.  BULL PEN - DAY

     Efficient as a beehive -- agents, cryptologists, support 
     staff buzz at their routines.  Archer strides through -- 
     drawing congratulatory nods and "thumbs up" signs...


     OUTSIDE HIS OFFICE

     Archer's team is there.  Applauding.  Proud.  Uneasy with 
     plaudits, he disperses the disappointed agents.

                             ARCHER
               Much appreciated.  Now let's get
               back to work, okay?

                             WANDA
                      (to Buzz)
               Is that stick ever gonna fall out
               of his ass?

     Archer's well-built secretary -- KIM BREWSTER -- hands
     him his messages.  She's holding a bottle of Dom
     Perignon.

                             KIMBERLY
               The C.I.A. sent this over.  What
               should I do with it?

                             ARCHER
               Send it back and tell them to stop
               wasting the taxpayers' money.
               Anything else, Miss Brewster?

                             KIMBERLY
               No, sir.

     He enters his office.  Kimberly sighs and turns to Wanda.

                             KIMBERLY
               Four years -- and he still calls
               me 'Miss Brewster.'


     INT. ARCHER'S OFFICE - DAY

     Sitting at his computer -- Archer scrolls through
     Castor's file.  He grimly contemplates face-after-face of
     Troy's victims -- finally pausing on a photo of his son
     Matthew.

     Burying his feeling, he types "CASE CLOSED" over
     Castor's image.  Archer starts to press "enter" when Tito
     comes in.

                             ARCHER
               How's Loomis?

                             TITO
               He needs some surgery, but he's
               going to be okay.  That's the good
               news...

                             ARCHER
               Go on.

                             TITO
               ... Brodie and Miller from Special
               Ops need to see you.

                             ARCHER
               I don't have time for those cloak
               and dagger guys.

     Big NED BRODIE and athletic female HOLLIS MILLER stroll
     in.

                             BRODIE
               You better make time, Jon.
                      (hefts a disc)
               We found this in the jet wreckage
               -- among Pollux Troy's effects...

     Archer accedes as Miller pops in the disk.  The computer
     screen displays a CAD schematic of the bomb.  Archer
     studies it carefully -- unease growing.

                             ARCHER
               Porcelain casing... Thermal
               cloak... Undetectable payload.

                             MILLER
               Powerful enough to flatten ten
               city blocks.

                             ARCHER
               'Worse than anything God ever
               dumped on the Pharaohs.'
                      (to Tito)
               Get Pollux Troy.  Now.

                                                DISSOLVE TO:


     INTERROGATION FOOTAGE

     Wired to a complex machine -- Pollux seems to have his
     frustrated interrogators on the run.


     INT. ARCHER'S OFFICE - DAY

     Archer, Lazarro, Tito, Brodie, Miller and other FBI
     officials watch the monitor.  Pollux remains implacable

                             POLLUX (V.O.)
                      (on screen)
               That bomb was just a crossword
               puzzle to me... a mental exercise.
               I never built it...

     Lazarro shuts down the monitor... turns to Archer.

                             ARCHER
               He's lying.

                             LAZARRO
               He's hooked up to a full-spectrum
               polygraph.

                             ARCHER
               Pollux is a manipulative
               psychopath.  He can control his
               heartbeat, his sweat glands, his
               blood pressure...

                             LAZARRO
               Jon, I trust your instincts, I
               always have.  But D.C. wants more
               evidence.  And frankly, so do I.

                             ARCHER
               You'll get all the evidence you
               need when ten thousand people die.

                             LAZARRO
               We'll get a team right on it.  But
               we can't evacuate the city on what
               amounts to a hunch.

     Archer looks at the gathered brass.  He knows it's 
     hopeless.

                             ARCHER
               That bomb has been built, it's out
               there somewhere and it's going to
               detonate...


     EXT. FBI BUILDING - INTELLIGENCE MEMORIAL - DAY

     Words etched in the granite wall read:

                     IN HONOR OF THOSE MEMBERS
               OF THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION
                     WHO SACRIFICED THEIR LIVES
                        IN THE LINE OF DUTY

     Archer watches as a workman engraves the last of the
     three new stars among so many others -- each one honoring
     the dead.

                             BRODIE
               Didn't Castor give any clue where
               the bomb might be?

                             ARCHER
               Only one person knows -- his
               brother Pollux.  And he'll keep
               his mouth shut until it blows.

                             BRODIE
               We could plant an agent in his
               cell -- get him to spill the
               location.

                             ARCHER
               Pollux is way too paranoid.  The
               only person he'd talk to about
               that bomb is Castor himself.  And
               dead men can't talk.

     Brodie and Miller exchange a knowing look.

                             BRODIE
               There might be a way around
               that...


     FULL SCREEN - CASTOR'S BODY

     Tubes and hoses are plugged into every orifice.


     INT. ICU ROOM - DAY

     Archer stares at the body... he can't believe it.

                             ARCHER
               Why are you keeping him alive?
                      (gets no answer)
               As long as he's breathing, he's
               dangerous.

                             MILLER
               Relax, he's a turnip.

     Miller grinds out her cigarette on Castor's leg.  Of
     course, Castor just lies there like a vegetable.

                             BRODIE
               We can arrange for you to enter
               Erewhon Prison -- as Castor Troy.

                             ARCHER
               What are you talking about?

     Archer turns as DR. MALCOLM HOAG (50s) enters the room.

                             HOAG
               I think I'd better answer that
               question.
                      (offers hand)
               Malcolm Hoag.  I run the
               Physiological Camouflage Unit for
               Special Ops.

                             ARCHER
               I know who you are.

                             MILLER
               But you don't know what he can do.
               Physical augmentation; enhancement
               surgery...

                             BRODIE
               ... He can disguise a compromised
               agent or alter the likeness --
               even the voice -- of a government
               witness.

                             HOAG
               Let me show you how it's done.
                      (leading him out)
               I think you'll recognize our
               patient...


     INT. HOAG'S SURGICAL BAY - DAY

     Loomis lies still as a surgeon carefully scrapes away
     charred flesh around his burned ear.  The doctor turns to
     a --


     STEREO-LITHOGRAPHIC MACHINE

     Laser-beams attack an organic soup with incredible
     precision.  The light forces a chemical reaction -- and 
     out of the soup -- an ear begins to form.  It rises from 
     the liquid, now fully-formed.  The surgeon takes the ear 
     and fits it in place on Loomis's head.  He starts 
     suturing.


     OBSERVATION BOOTH - ABOVE

     Archer, Hoag, Brodie and Miller watch the operation --
     video-enhanced by the two huge screens on the far walls.

                             HOAG
               With our new generation of anti-
               inflammatories, healing is
               accelerated from weeks to days.
               By his next paycheck, he won't
               even remember which ear he lost.
                      (a beat)
               Your situation, however, would be
               a little less permanent...

                             BRODIE
               -- and a lot more classified.

     Hoag holds up a face-sized organic shell made up of
     yellow cartilage pieces and tendons, etc.  Archer pulls
     it over his face -- like a gauze mask.  A "tendon" falls
     off.

                             ARCHER
               This'll fool Pollux.

                             HOAG
               That is a state-of-the-art morpho-
               genetic template.  The inside can
               be built to match the exact shape
               of your skull; the outside --
               exactly like Castor's.  Then we
               fit his face right on top --

                             MILLER
               -- and you become him.

                             ARCHER
               You're talking about removing the
               guy's face?

                             BRODIE
               Borrowing, Jon.  The procedure's
               completely reversible.

                             MILLER
               One way or the other -- the
               mission ends on the eighteenth.

     Archer turns the shell over and over and over in his
     hands.

                             BRODIE
               You know Castor better than
               anyone.  You've lived and breathed
               him for years -- hell, you even
               look a little like him.

     Archer shoves the template back at Hoag.

                             ARCHER
               Find yourself another lab-rat.

                             MILLER
               If you don't do this -- Castor
               will beat us again.  He'll beat
               you again...

     Archer pushes his way past them -- and marches out.

                             HOAG
               I don't think that went very well.

                             BRODIE
               Trust us, Doc...

                             MILLER
               ... he'll jerk around.  Then he'll
               be back.


     INT. INTERROGATION BOOTHS - DAY

     Archer enters... sizes up DIETRICH HASSLER.  His stylish
     garb doesn't completely hide his criminal roots.  Archer
     sits down calmly.  He looks at his watch.

                             ARCHER
               I'm in a hurry, Dietrich.  So
               you've only got ten seconds to go
               through your usual litany of lies,
               empty threats, and moronic
               denials.  Then I'm coming over
               there --

                             DIETRICH
               If you're in such a fucking hurry
               -- why are you wasting your time
               with me?  I'm just an art dealer.

                             ARCHER
               You're a dealer, all right:
               technical secrets, munitions...
               explosives.

                             DIETRICH
               You've never proven any of that.
               And when my bitchy, never-been-
               laid femi-nazi lawyer gets here,
               she's going to...

                             ARCHER
               Time's up.

     Archer topples the wooden table and tears a leg from the
     top.  Brandishing it -- he stalks the startled thug.


     HALLWAY JUST OUTSIDE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

     Lazarro blanches as an obsessed Archer repeatedly slams
     the table leg against the wall -- above Dietrich's head.

                             LAZARRO
               The only ticking bomb I see is
               inside his head.  He's getting
               worse, Tito.

                             TITO
               Don't worry, sir.  It's all an
               act...

     But as Lazarro leaves -- we see Tito's worried, too.


     BACK INSIDE BOOTH

     Archer has a terrified Dietrich backed into the corner.

                             DIETRICH
               ... Okay!  Castor called me but I
               blew him off... I swear I never
               saw him.  And I don't know
               anything about any bomb!


     INT. CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE INTERROGATION BOOTHS - SAME TIME

     Archer emerges... eyes blazing.

                             ARCHER
               Let him go, but I want him
               watched... Who's next?

                             TITO
               Just Dietrich's sister...

     In another booth, a careworn but striking woman sits with
     a little boy on her lap.  She gently helps him Crayola a
     book.  This is SASHA HASSLER (30) and her son ADAM (5).


     INT. INTERROGATION BOOTH - DAY

     Archer hovers over Sasha -- her maternal warmth replaced
     by an icy hatred.  Tito and the child are gone.

                             ARCHER
               When was the last time you saw
               Castor Troy?

                             SASHA
               Who cares?  He's dead.

                             ARCHER
               Answer the question.

                             SASHA
               Look, I'm clean.  I teach kids
               now --

                             ARCHER
               Sasha -- you are a felon, on
               probation for harboring Castor
               Troy.  So it's in your best
               interest to cooperate.
                      (as she's silent)
               Would you like your son put in a
               foster home?

     Sasha's eyes flash, her body coils -- but she keeps
     control.

                             SASHA
               No, but I'm sure you'd love it --
               you sick bastard.

                             ARCHER
                      (unmoved)
               When was the last time you saw
               Castor Troy?

     She stares at him with equal amounts of pity and hatred.

                             SASHA
               I haven't seen him for years.


     INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

     Archer watches as Adam leaves Dietrich and jumps into 
     Sasha's arms.  She hugs him protectively.  Adam sees
     Archer watching them -- and smiles.  Archer doesn't smile
     back.


     FULL SCREEN - CASTOR'S REAL FACE

     PULL BACK TO:


     INT. I.C.U. - NIGHT

     Archer slowly circles Castor's muscular, hairy, tattooed
     body.  Although on life support -- his signature smirk
     remains.

                             ARCHER
               What about Lazarro?

                             BRODIE
               No way -- the red tape alone would
               take a month.  This is a black-bag
               operation -- completely off the
               books.

                             MILLER
               If you need him, Tito can help you
               prepare.  But you know the drill:
               You can't tell anyone -- not the
               Director, not your wife... nobody.

     Archer's face shows he doesn't like it -- then he nods.

                             ARCHER
               I'm in.


     EXT. ARCHER HOME - NIGHT

     Archer slowly gets out of his car.  Trudging toward the
     front door, he picks up a basketball and takes a shot.
     His form is terrible -- he misses by a mile.


     INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

     Archer passes Jamie's room.  Loud MUSIC POUNDS from 
     within.  He pauses to knock, thinks again, then heads
     down the hall.


     INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Eve is in bed.  Archer comes in quietly and sits beside 
     her -- studying her peaceful, sleeping face.  She stirs.

                             EVE
               I was dreaming...

                             ARCHER
               Something good?

                             EVE
               I'm not sure... you were flying
               this weird old stunt plane...
               doing flips... walking on the
               wings... I was watching from the
               ground -- when you fell.  You had
               a parachute, but you wouldn't open
               it.

                             ARCHER
               Did you catch me?

                             EVE
               No.

                             ARCHER
               How come?

                             EVE
               I don't know...
                      (nuzzles him)
               Maybe because you've never needed
               my help.

                             ARCHER
               Come on, you made that up, didn't
               you?

                             EVE
               ... Maybe I did...
                      (teasing)
               ... maybe I didn't...

     They kiss affectionately.  Passion building, Eve runs her 
     hands over his body -- until her fingers touch a round
     scar on his chest.  Archer freezes -- mid-caress.

                             EVE
               It's all right, Jon.

                             ARCHER
               After all these years, I still
               can't get it out of my head -- an
               inch to the left, Matty would
               still be alive.

                             EVE
               And you wouldn't be.

     No response.  The pain hidden in his silence chills Eve.

                             EVE
               Things will get better now that
               you're home.  Everything will be
               better -- now that... that man is
               finally out of our lives.

                             ARCHER
               Eve...

     He starts to say the words.  He wants, needs to share the
     truth with her.  But he can't.  Instead --

                             ARCHER
               ... If I had to do something to
               find some closure... I should do
               it, shouldn't I?... No matter how
               crazy?

                             EVE
               Oh, God -- you're going on
               assignment again...

                             ARCHER
               One last time.  And while I'm
               gone, I want you and Jamie to go
               to your mother's.  It's
               important...

                             EVE
               You said you'd be here!  You
               promised!  What could be more
               important than that?

                             ARCHER
               I can't tell you... except only I
               can do it.

                             EVE
               You want me to tell you it's okay
               to leave?  Okay, go on!  Go!

     Fury erupting, Eve pushes Archer out of the bed.


     INT. ANOTHER BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Archer enters a child's room -- neat and tidy, like a 
     museum exhibit.  A starfield of glow-letters twinkles
     faintly.

     He lies down on the bed and toys with his wedding band --
     staring up at the words the stars form... "MATTHEW."

                                                DISSOLVE TO:


     INT. CONVENTION CENTER - MACHINE ROOM - BLINKING
     LIGHTS - NIGHT

     The blinking LED of the bomb timer continues to count
     down.


     INT./EXT. '56 BUICK/MOUNTAIN ROAD - MOVING - DAY

     Tito drives into the Hoag compound.

     Archer's beside him, juggling Castor's dossier:
     documents, photos, etc.

                             TITO
               Jon, this is goddam insane.  You
               can't do it.

     Archer says nothing... it's too late for debate.  Tito
     parks.  The men get out and head for the lab.

                             TITO
               You haven't got a chance in hell
               of fooling Pollux.  Castor drinks,
               smokes and walks around with a 24-
               hour hard-on.  He's nothing like
               you --

                             ARCHER
               Don't worry... If Hoag can do half
               what he claims, I'll get Pollux to
               talk.

     Archer reaches for the door -- Tito stops him.

                             TITO
               It's not that simple, Jon...
               Becoming another person --
               especially him -- nobody can come
               all the way back from that... not
               even you.

     Archer considers his friend's words... He toys with, then
     removes, his wedding bang.

                             ARCHER
               Keep this for me.

     As Tito takes the ring -- a caring, but concerned look
     passes between the two friends.



     INT. SURGICAL BAY - DAY

     Two huge video screens are dominated by the CG-images of
     Archer and Castor.  As Hoag briefs the team, the CG-
     images glow to reflect the physical characteristic Hoag
     refers to.

                             HOAG
               Let's walk through it, Jon.  Your
               blood types are different, but we
               can't do anything about that.
               Otherwise, nature is cooperating
               nicely.  The height difference is
               negligible -- within 1/2 an inch.
               Eye color -- almost a perfect
               match.  Penis size, flaccid,
               essentially the same --
               Substantial.

     From the observation booth above -- Miller (flanked by
     Tito and Brodie) raises his eyebrow.

     On the video screens, the images morph to signify the
     physical augmentations.

                             HOAG
               Hairline will be adjusted with
               laser-shears... micro-plugs for
               the body hair... the teeth will be
               bonded to match Castor's...

     Hoag eyes Castor's inert, tight body -- then turns to
     Archer -- prodding his love handles like a livestock
     inspector.

                             HOAG
               How about an abdominoplasty?

                             ARCHER
               Abdomino -- what?

                             HOAG
               A tummy tuck.  On the house.

                             ARCHER
               Do it.


     TRANSFORMATION MONTAGE

     (INTERCUT huge video screen enlargements of Archer and
     Castor's body parts as necessary):

     Globules of adipose tissue are siphoned off Archer's 
     obliques.  At the same time...

     Hoag recreates the "Great Sphinx" tattoo on Archer's
     thigh.  We PUSH IN ON his leg, then PULL BACK to
     reveal...

     Archer and Tito.  The CLOSE UP on his leg becomes a FULL
     SHOT as he walks across the rooftop -- like himself.
     Tito demonstrated the proper "Castor gait": dangerously
     casual, like a panther.

     Hoag reproduces Castor's fingerprints... then layers them
     over Archer's fingers.

     Archer practices Castor's icy, killer glare.  Tito hands
     him a lit cigarette.  Archer brings the cigarette to his
     lips -- then coughs harshly.  But he keeps trying.

     Castor smiles... then smirks and laughs.  PULL BACK to
     reveal Archer studying surveillance footage of Castor on
     a monitor-screen -- mimicking him.

     Archer fusses with his new hair, trying to cover the thin
     spots.  Giving  up, he zips up his sweatshirt -- getting
     the zipper caught in his new chest hair.


     EXT. HOAG INSTITUTE - GROUNDS - DAY

     Tito tosses a pistol.  Archer catches it with his right
     hand.  But to Archer's surprise, Tito frowns.

                             TITO
               Nice catch.  But you used the
               wrong hand.

     He takes the pistol away -- and slaps it in Archer's left
     hand.  Then Tito shoves him -- challengingly.

                             TITO
               Shoot me.
                      (as Archer
                       doesn't move)
               Shoot me!

     Tito pulls the gun against his own forehead.

                             TITO
               You want to be Castor Troy?  If
               you hesitate for a breath, you're
               finished!  Now -- shoot me!  Kill
               me!

     Archer holds the gun unsteadily.  Tito is disgusted.

                             TITO
               You can't do it... because Castor
               is tougher than you...

     BOOM!  The GUN goes off -- the slug tears past Tito's
     head.  Shocked, he touches his left ear, making sure it's
     still there.

     Then Tito looks at Archer -- and sees the determination.


     EXT. HOAG'S FACILITY - NIGHT

     Clear and calm.  God's night.  Someone's God anyway.


     INT. I.C.U. ROOM - NIGHT

     Hoag leads Archer to a full-length mirror.

                             HOAG
               Let's see if I missed anything
               before I get my hands really dirty.

     Archer removes the robe.  He's amazed to see:

     His own head on Castor's body:  a flat stomach, hairy
     chest, tattoos, thinning hair, etc.  Hoag touches
     Archer's scar.

                             HOAG
               You realize this has to be
               removed.
                      (as Archer
                       slowly nods)
               Then here we go, Commander.
               Through the Looking Glass...


     INT. SURGICAL BAY - NIGHT

     Unconscious, Archer is wheeled into the surgical bay, 
     Castor beside him.  Hoag turns to the video technician.

                             HOAG
               Make sure you get everything --
               I'll need to study the tape before
               the reverse surgery.

     Hoag lowers an aerated Plexiglas mask over Archer's face.
     Interwoven with integrated laser circuitry -- this Derma-
     Induction-Device (D.I.D.) attaches via suction.

     Hoag sights through the optical memory, squeezes the
     trigger.  A cobalt beam cuts around the face -- cleanly
     slicing it.  Then Hoag lifts Archer's face -- off of his
     skull.

     Brodie and Miller watch from above.  Tito stumbles into
     the nearby bathroom to throw up.

     Hoag inspects Archer's face, then turns to his nurse.

                             HOAG
               Vault it.

     Hoag turns to perform the same procedure on Castor.

     Castor's consistent EEG reading suddenly spikes
     radically -- for a moment, it almost seems to stabilize.
     Hoag glances over -- too late -- the spikes have 
     disappeared.

     But the CAMERA CLOSES IN ON Castor's ear -- and we sense
     that, somehow, his auditory nerves might be functioning.

                                                DISSOLVE TO:


     INT. RECOVERY ROOM - DAY

     A head swathed in gauze.  The bandages start to fall 
     away.

     Tito, Miller and Brodie wait as Hoag removes the gauze.
     The patient looks into a mirror.

     Jon Archer has become Castor Troy.

     he touches his new face.  Archer stares... the cold
     reality chilling his blood.

     Archer buckles -- unprepared emotionally for what he's
     done to himself.  For a moment, he seems to teeter on
     madness.

                             TITO
               Jon -- are you all right?

     Archer can't respond... he's somewhere the others can't
     comprehend.  Finally he emerges... shaken, but in
     control.

     TITO enters.  Instinctively, he grabs for his holster.

                             ARCHER
               Okay... I'm okay.
                      (realizes)
               But my voice... I still sound like
               me.

                             HOAG
               I implanted a micro-chip onto your
               larynx.

     Hoag SWITCHES ON an AUDIO TAPE.  Archer repeats Castor's
     words as Hoag adjusts the chip with a wavelength box.

               CASTOR (V.O.)                  ARCHER
       Okay, I've got a               Okay, I've got a
       confession to make, but        confession to make, but
       you aren't gonna like          you aren't gonna like
       it... (etc.)                   it... (etc.)

     After a few repetitions, Archer's voice matches
     perfectly.

     Archer yawns, squints and furrows his brow -- testing 
     every muscle.  He stares into the mirror -- into the eyes
     of his most hated enemy -- now his eyes.  Archer slowly 
     turns to...

     Castor.  Motionless, swathed, dead to the world -- but
     something about Castor's smile -- that mocking smile...

                             ARCHER
               Now what?

                             TITO
               We're down to 72 hours.  Let's
               call Lazarro.  Castor Troy just
               came out of his coma.


     EXT. FBI HELIPORT - DAY

     Armed agents take their positions around a helipad.  A 
     jet-black helicopter drops from the sky like an angry 
     wasp.


     EXT. HELIPAD - DAY

     As Lazarro watches -- Tito escorts out a heavily-manacled 
     "Castor."  Two armed agents leap from the chopper and 
     take charge of "Castor."  He follows them pliantly,
     until --

                             TITO
               Watch this hard-case -- he'll bite
               your nuts off if he gets the
               chance!

     Archer gets the message.  He starts to resist the agents 
     and must be muscled into the chopper.  He's manacled 
     down.

     Eye contact between Archer and Tito -- both aware of this 
     very real point of departure.  The CHOPPER DOOR SLAMS
     SHUT.  It lifts off like a twister and SCREAMS away.


     EXT. HELIPORT - STAGING AREA - DAY

     The watching team breaks up, wanders back to work.

                             LOOMIS
               What a week for Archer to go on a
               training op.  Maybe we should try
               to contact him.

                             WANDA
               Forget it.  He's knee-deep in
               Georgia swamp by now.

     They pass Brodie and Miller, who watch the chopper 
     disappear over the horizon.  So far so good.     


     INT. CHOPPER - FLYING - DAY

     The agent re-checks Archer's chains.

                             ARCHER
               Don't forget -- I ordered a kosher
               meal...

     The agent smashes his elbow into Archer's gut.  The 
     second agent presses an INJECTOR against Archer's leg.
     PSSSST.  Archer spasms against the drug -- then sags
     unconscious.


     INT. EREWHON PRISON - DELOUSING CUBICLE

     Archer wakes up as a torrent of delousing spray hits him.

     A guard holds a water cannon on the newest inmate.

     Archer lies gasping on the steel floor, protecting his
     face.  The spray stops -- when head guard "RED" WALTON
     enters.

                             WALTON
               You are now an Erewhon inmate -- a
               citizen of nowhere.  Human rights
               zealots, the Geneva convention and
               the P.C. police have no authority
               here.  You have no right...
                      (slaps on latex gloves)
               When I say your ass belongs to me
               -- I mean it.  Bend over.

     Archer's face reflects the degradation as he bends over
     and exposes all to the cavity-searching Guard.

     Satisfied, Walton lets Archer dress.  Another guard
     places a pair of odd-looking steel boots before Archer.

                             WALTON
               Step into them.

     Archer inspects the lock-down boots.  Hinged steel
     collars hook over the shoe and encase the ankle.  The
     soles are gridded steel with magnetic inserts.

                             WALTON
               Don't sniff 'em, you perv.  Just
               step into them.

     Archer obeys.  A guard squats down and locks the steel
     collars over Archer's shoes.  He tries to move -- but
     can't.

                             ARCHER
               They're too tight.

                             WALTON
               So's a noose.  Now keep your mouth
               shut.

     Walton JOLTS Archer with his HIGH-VOLTAGE SHOCK-STICK.

                             WALTON
               The prison's one big magnetic
               field.  The boots'll tell us where
               you are -- every second of the
               day.
                      (into comm-link)
               201 to Population.

     Walton presses his thumb into a standard FBI scan-pad.
     It forms a print -- positively identifying the guard.
     The heavy blast-door automatically opens.

                             WALTON
               I've got fifty bucks says you're
               dead by dinner.  Don't disappoint
               me.

     Walton prods Archer toward the door.  To Archer's
     surprise -- he can now move.


     INT. GENERAL POPULATION - DAY

     The inmates eat.  Silence descends as Archer enters --
     intensifying the constant HUMMING of the MAGNETIC FIELD.
     Huge Dubov does a slow burn on seeing "Castor."

     Scanning the room for Pollux -- Archer takes a seat next
     to a LITTLE, GOATEED MAN with a French accent.

                             LITTLE MAN
               Hey, Castor -- remember me?

                             ARCHER
               Fabrice Voisine... sure, I --
                      (catches himself)
               -- I believe Jon Archer busted you
               for poisoning five members of the
               the Canadian parliament?

                             VOISINE (LITTLE MAN)
               Those scumbags should never have
               voted against the Quebecois.
                      (a beat)
               We heard you got wasted.

     Archer sees the other inmates sizing him up.

                             ARCHER
               Do I look wasted -- asshole?

     Voisine shakes his head "no" -- then his eyes widen as...

     WHAM.  Dubov leaps onto Archer and starts pummeling him.
     They slide across the table -- spilling everyone's lunch.

                             GUARD
                      (into comm-unit)
               Central.  I have a disturbance in
               population.  Go to lock down --

                             WALTON
                      (into comm-unit)
               Hold that lock down.

     Walton watches as Dubov throws Archer across the room.
     Archer staggers to his feet -- and sees the encircling
     inmates and guards looking at him -- unimpressed.

     Especially his "brother" Pollux -- who watches
     uncertainly.

     Dubov attacks again -- but Archer is ready.  He grabs
     Dubov's fist -- just before it hits his face.

                             ARCHER
               Never -- in -- the -- face.

     Holding Dubov's fist firmly, Archer kicks Dubov
     repeatedly in the groin.  Metal boot meeting soft flesh.

     Dubov staggers back -- hurt.  Archer moves in for the
     kill, savoring it.

     Walton looks skyward.

                             WALTON
               Lock 'em down.

     INTERCUT WITH:


     UP ABOVE - CENTRAL SECURITY

     The prison's nerve center -- with video-feeds and
     monitors designed to keep problems and privacy to a
     minimum.

     The two deputies react to Walton's call.  Identifying
     Archer and Dubov's signature-blips -- they throw the
     appropriate switches and...

     ZAP!  The magnetic boots lock both inmates to the floor.  
     Dubov flails hopelessly -- but Archer's just out of 
     reach.

     Crack!  Walton punches Archer in the diaphragm.

                             ARCHER
               What?  He started it!

     Walton smashes Archer harder -- he hits the floor.

                             ARCHER
               When I get out of here --

                             WALTON
               You'll what?

                             ARCHER
               I'm going to have you fired.

     His statement is so ludicrous, Walton laughs.  Everyone 
     does.  From the inmates' reactions, Archer knows he's 
     been accepted.

                             WALTON
                      (to Dubov)
               That's two strikes, Dubov.  One
               more and you know where you're
               going.
                      (to the others)
               Back to your 'suites' -- or no
               dinner.

     As Archer drops into the line of cons -- he spots Pollux
     waiting for him.  Girding himself for this first 
     encounter -- he's got a plan.

                             POLLUX
               Hey, bro...

                             ARCHER
               -- Pollux?

                             POLLUX
               Of course it's Pollux, what the
               fuck's wrong with you?

     Archer stares -- feigning confusion until Walton prods 
     him forward.  Pollux watches his "brother" go -- very 
     concerned.


     INT. ARCHER'S CELL - NIGHT

     Archer lies on his cot -- staring at the ceiling.  
     Isolated, lonely, he realizes how easy it would be to go 
     insane here.


     EXT. HOAG INSTITUTE - NIGHT

     An insanely starry night.  Van Gogh's night.  The night 
     he cut off his ear, anyway.


     INT. SURGICAL BAY - NIGHT

     Castor's body lies inert.  His life-support MACHINES
     BLIPPING away.  Until the EEG spikes.  Once -- twice -- 
     three times.  Brain wave activity increases -- and 
     stabilizes.

     Castor's fingers twitch.  Then his fist clenches -- hard.  
     Castor's head is swathed in gauze.  But his eyes pop 
     open.

     Reflexively, Castor wrenches from the bed -- tearing out 
     the tubes and wires that tether him to life support.  He 
     goes down -- in agony -- groaning.

     He struggles to his feet -- staggering through the lab --
     until he catches the reflection of his bandaged face in
     the window.  He quickly unwraps the gauze.

     The discarded bandages fall at his feet... we don't see
     what CASTOR sees -- but we hear him MOAN... then CHOKE...
     then SCREAM -- the only moment Castor ever loses his
     cool.

     Finally composing himself -- Castor's hand grips the
     phone and he dials.

                             CASTOR
               Lars... okay, Lunt, then.
                      (rifling desk
                       documents)
               Something really fucked-up
               happened... I'm in trouble... so
               listen very carefully...


     EXT. HOAG INSTITUTE - NIGHT (LATER)

     A RANGE ROVER SCREECHES up.  At gunpoint, Lars and Lunt 
     manhandle Hoag into the lab.


     INT. SURGICAL BAY - NIGHT

     Lars and Lunt hustle Hoag in.  The lab is on.  The 
     screens run -- scrolling through the video log of 
     Archer's surgery.

     Hoag sees his terrified assistants -- bound with duct
     tape.

                             HOAG
               What's this about?  What do you
               want?

     Lars shoves Hoag into a towering figure... we ZOOM IN ON
     Hoag's glasses.  And THROUGH the REFLECTION we see...


     MAN WITHOUT FACE

     Hoag reacts in horror at the raw muscle, cartilage and
     bone.  The man lifts a cigarette to his lips... then 
     exhales.

                             CASTOR
               What do you think I want?


     INT. PRISON - POPULATION - DAY

     A huge wall-screen plays gentle nature scenes.  Below --
     the inmates engage in their exercise hour.

     Voisine stares at the screen -- while Pollux carefully 
     watches his "brother" play basketball.  Archer tosses up 
     an air-ball to the jeers of other inmates.

                             POLLUX
               You realize, of course, that
               magnetic humming is designed to
               drive us insane.  If we all don't
               get brain tumors first.

                              VOISINE
               And that same cloying Bambi tape
               -- over and over...

                              POLLUX
               It's like they're begging us to
               riot.  Where the fuck are we,
               anyway?
                      (the game ends)
               Gotta go...

     Pollux trots over to Archer -- passes him his cigarette.
     He studies Archer as he takes a drag -- and nearly gags.

                             POLLUX
               ... I'm worried about you.

                             ARCHER
               Why?

                             POLLUX
               Your jumpshot has no arc.  You
               used to swagger... now you swish.
               You're gumming that butt like a
               Catholic school girl.
                      (notices)
               And why do you keep picking at
               your finger?

     Pollux has caught Archer reflexively tugging at his
     phantom wedding ring.  Archer immediately stops.  He
     takes a drag and holds it -- then exhales right in
     Pollux's face.

                             ARCHER
               I was in a coma...

     Pollux sticks his finger under Archer's eye and pulls 
     down like a vet examining a sick dog.  Archer pushes him 
     off.

                             ARCHER
               My reflexes, my senses, my
               memory... everything's jumbled.  I
               can't even tell you why Dubov
               jumped me yesterday.

                             POLLUX
               You Pollinated his wife the day he
               was arrested.  How could forget
               that?

                             ARCHER
               I've forgotten plenty.  Look
               around -- we've screwed over half
               the freaks in here.  What's gonna
               happen to us if they think I've
               lost it?

     Pollux contemplates the other inmates -- circling, sizing
     up the brothers like hungry sharks.  Instinctively,
     Pollux moves closer to Archer for protection.

                             ARCHER
               I need you to play big brother for
               once -- till I can fill in a few
               blanks.  Think you can handle
               that?

     Pollux nods grimly -- then Archer pulls up his sleeve,
     exposing the pyramid tattoo.

                             ARCHER
               I know I got this on my tenth
               birthday.  I just can't remember
               why.

                             POLLUX
               Man -- that was the worst day of
               our lives!

     Archer feigns a "struggle" with his memory.  He lights a
     new butt with the old -- chain-style... then "remembers."

                             ARCHER
               Oh, God -- Mom O-D'd at County
               General.

                             POLLUX
               Retching and convulsing while
               those bastards didn't even try to
               save her sorry ass.  You gave her
               mouth to mouth -- man -- even then
               you had some constitution.
                      (a beat)
               Remember what you swore to me at
               the funeral?

                             ARCHER
               Uh -- to kill the doctors?

                             POLLUX
               After that.  You promised you'd
               always take care of me.

                             ARCHER
               And I bet I kept that promise...

                             POLLUX
               Only one you've never broken.

     Pollux curls into Archer -- in need of comfort.  Archer
     puts an affectionate arm around Pollux -- springing the
     trap.

                             ARCHER
               Screw the past.  We've got the
               future to look forward to.
                      (a beat)
               We still have tomorrow.

                             POLLUX
               No shit... five million bucks...
               now those Red Militia crackpots
               get to keep it.

                             ARCHER
               That's not the worst part.

                             POLLUX
               What's worse than losing five
               million bucks?

                             ARCHER
               Being stuck in this rat-hole when
               it blows.  What you built was a
               work of art.  It belongs in the
               Smithsonian.

     Pollux beams with pride -- Archer hangs on every word.

                             POLLUX
               Yeah -- well... the L.A.
               Convention Center will have to
               do...

                             ARCHER
               Thanks, Pollux.

                             POLLUX
               'Thanks'?  I guess they really did
               fuck you up.

     Then Archer smiles -- like Jon Archer.  Without knowing
     exactly why -- a wave of ill-ease overtakes Pollux.


     INT. ARCHER'S CELL - DAY

     Archer paces impatiently... as the door rolls open.
     Walton is looking at him with cool respect.

                             WALTON
               You have a visitor.

     Archer smiles to himself -- pleased at Brodie's
     timeliness.


     INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

     Archer's boots lock down -- as the guillotine door rises.
     But his confidence evaporates into unspeakable horror.  
     Because he finds himself staring into the blue eyes of --

     Jon Archer.  This man has Archer's face -- his real face.

                             IMPOSTOR
               What's the matter?  Don't you like
               the new me?

     Archer studies the image of his former self -- trying to
     understand.  Then he recognizes the smirk on the face, 
     the mocking twinkle in the eyes and he says what he 
     cannot say...

                             ARCHER
               -- Castor...?

                             CASTOR
               Not anymore.

                             ARCHER
               It can't be.  It's impossible.

                             CASTOR
               I believe the phrase Dr. Hoag used
               was 'titanically remote'.  Who
               knows?  Maybe the trauma of having
               my face cut off pulled me out.  Or
               maybe God really is on my side
               after all.
                      (starts pacing)
               By the way, I know you don't get
               the papers in here.

     Continuing to circle, he displays the current LA Times:

         "INFERNO AT HOAG INSTITUTE -- Malcolm Hoag Dead"

                             CASTOR
               Terrible tragedy.
               Hoag was such a genius -- but
               selfish with his artistry.  I
               actually had to torture his
               assistants to convince him to
               perform the same surgery on me.

                             ARCHER
               You killed them?

                             CASTOR
               Of course I killed them, you dumb
               fuck.  Hoag, his staff...

     FLASH ON Hoag's body -- on the floor of the burning lab.
     Two more burned bodies adjoin Hoag's.

                             CASTOR
               Miller and Brodie --

     FLASH ON Brodie and Miller -- dead in a mangled car
     wreck.

                             CASTOR
               I even paid a visit to your buddy
               Tito.

                             ARCHER
               He doesn't know anything about
               this!

                             CASTOR
               Come on, Jon.  I think I know you
               better than that.  I only wish you
               could have been there to see the
               look on his face --

     FLASH ON Tito... he smiles, then recoils in shock as
     Castor lifts a pistol and shoots him... then he picks up
     Archer's wedding band off the counter...


     INT. EREWHON PRISON (PRESENT)

     Archer stares -- thunderstruck -- at the wedding band now
     on Castor's finger.

                             CASTOR
               -- then again, I guess you were
               there.
                      (a beat)
               I torched every shred of evidence
               that proves who you are.  So
               swallow this -- you are going to
               be in here for the rest of your
               life.

                             ARCHER
               Castor, don't do this --

                             CASTOR
               No discussion, Jon -- no deals.
               Now if you'll excuse me, I've got
               an important government job to
               abuse, and a beautiful wife to
               fuck.  Excuse me -- I mean 'make
               love to.'

     Archer freaks out.  He screams, flails -- unable to reach
     Castor.  Castor opens the door and guards rush in --
     clubbing Archer and shocking him senseless.

                             WALTON
               Sorry, sir.

                             CASTOR
               It's quite all right.  You never
               know what to expect from a
               psychopathic criminal...


     INT. CELL BLOCK - DAY

     The guards dump Archer into his cell.

                             WALTON
               Better be nice, Castor.  You could
               get mighty lonely now that Pollux
               is gone.

                             ARCHER
               Pollux is -- what?

                             WALTON
               Archer cut him a deal for turning
               state's evidence.  He's been
               released...

                             ARCHER
               Walton, you have to listen to me
               -- right now!

                             WALTON
               Or what?  You'll have me fired?
                      (pushes a button)
               You're confined until I say
               otherwise...

     The steel panels shut - silencing Archer's pleading
     voice.


     INT. ARCHER'S CAR - MOVING - DAY

     Sipping a beer, Castor cruises past the suburban bliss:
     men on hammocks; women chatting; kids playing tag.

                             CASTOR
                      (sickened)
               Jesus, what a life.

     Castor tries to catch a street address and rolls past...


     ARCHER'S HOUSE

     Dressed for work, Eve watches blandly as the car goes by.
     A moment later, it backs up and parks.

     Hiding the beer can, Castor forces a sheepish smile --
     and gets out.  She doesn't smile back.

                             EVE
               I suppose it was only a matter of
               time before you forgot where we
               lived.

                             CASTOR
               Sorry -- the job's been murder
               lately.

     Castor looks her over -- she's much sexier than he 
     expected.

                             EVE
               So what happened to your
               'important' assignment?

                             CASTOR
               What do you know about it?

                             EVE
               I know exactly what you always
               tell me:  Absolutely nothing.

                             CASTOR
               It didn't work out the way
               everyone thought it would.  Where
               are you off to?

                             EVE
               I've got surgery.

                             CASTOR
               Surgery -- are you okay?

     Then he spots her medical bag.  Oops.

                             EVE
               Don't try to charm me -- I'm still
               angry.  There're leftovers in the
               fridge.

                             CASTOR
               Have fun at work.

     Castor kisses her good-bye -- on the mouth.

                             EVE
               What is with you?

                             CASTOR
               Don't I usually kiss my wife?

                             EVE
               No.

     Castor reacts as she gets in the car and pulls out.


     INT. ARCHER'S HOUSE - DAY

     Castor steps inside, looks around.

                             CASTOR
               What a dump.


     INT. STUDY - DAY

     Castor sifts through Christmas cards from holidays past,
     studying the ones with photos.  He's memorizing -- 
     matching names to faces -- Wanda's, Buzz's, Lazarro's, 
     etc.

     Something else catches his eye.  He finds a floral
     notebook -- Eve's diary -- and pages through it.  Then,
     he reads:

                             CASTOR
               '... "Date-night" has been a
               typical failure... we haven't made
               love in almost two months...'
               What a loser ...

     Castor hears a voice.  Glancing across the hall, he
     sees...


     GLIMPSES OF JAMIE

     As she walks back and forth in her room, talking on the
     phone -- and wearing only panties and a cropped T-shirt.
     Castor steps closer -- enjoying the view.

                             CASTOR
               The plot thickens.


     INT. JAMIE'S ROOM - DAY

     Jamie stamps out her cigarette.

                             JAMIE
               -- I got your E-mail, Karl.  That
               poem was really sweet --
                      (spots Castor
                       at door)
               Hang on a sec...

     She slams it -- but he gets his foot inside.

                             JAMIE
               I'll call you back.
                      (to Castor)
               You're not respecting my
               boundaries.

                             CASTOR
               I'm coming in, Janie.

     Castor pushes menacingly into the room.

                             JAMIE
               'Janie'?

     Castor spots her correct name embroidered on a pillow.  
     He gazes seductively -- unnerving Jamie as he steps 
     toward her.

                             CASTOR
               I don't think you heard me...
               Jamie... You have something I
               want ...

     He reaches for her -- and right past her.  He picks up a
     pack of cigarettes from the desk.

                             JAMIE
               Clarissa left those here.

                             CASTOR
                      (shrugs and
                       lights up)
               I won't tell mom if you don't.

                             JAMIE
               When did you start smoking?

                             CASTOR
               You'll be seeing a lot of changes
               around here --
                      (blows a perfect
                       smoke ring)
               Daddy's a new man.

     Jamie stares, astonished, as Castor goes out.


     INT. EREWHON PRISON - ARCHER'S CELL

     Fists bloody, voice hoarse, Archer pounds at the cell
     door.  Exhausted, he finally stops -- staring at the face
     of his enemy in the mirrored door -- the enemy who now
     has total command of his life.


     INT. FBI - LOBBY CHECKPOINT - DAY

     Castor dons his stern "Archer" face as the gate guard
     checks his thumbprint ID.  He's cleared and waved in.


     INT. FBI INTERROGATION BOOTH - DAY

     Buzz and Wanda watch Pollux through the two-way mirror.
     He's gorging himself on a big lunch.  Castor arrives.

                             BUZZ
               Listen, sir... we just want you to
               know...

                             WANDA
               We're all really sorry about
               Tito...

                             CASTOR
               Yeah, well, shit happens.

     Buzz and Wanda exchange a glance.  To them, "Archer" is
     just avoiding his feelings again.

                             CASTOR
               How's our star witness?

                             BUZZ
               He hasn't told us a damn thing
               except what kind of mustard he
               likes on his tongue sandwiches.

                             WANDA
               If that bomb is out there -- we're
               almost out of time.

                             LAZARRO (O.S.)
               Archer!

     Lazarro stomps toward them... furious.  Buzz and Wanda
     quickly excuse themselves.

                             LAZARRO
               You made a deal with Pollux Troy?
               He's 'a manipulative psychopath.'
               Your own words, Jon!

                             CASTOR
               Just let me do my job, Victor.

                             LAZARRO
               The job I've been protecting for
               the last eight years.  From now
               on, you go strictly by the book.
               Everything gets cleared by me.
               Understand?

     Lazarro stomps off.  Castor watches him go, wheels
     turning.


     INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

     Castor enters -- shutting down the mikes... and the
     blinds.

                             CASTOR
               You're supposed to be snitching --
               making me look good.

                             POLLUX
               'Look good'?
                      (drops food in
                       disgust)
               Seeing that face -- I want to
               vomit.

                             CASTOR
               I'm the one who has to look at
               this butt-ugly mug every time I
               pass a mirror.  Look at my eyes,
               my chin, my perfect nose -- gone!
                      (considers his
                       reflection)
               Archer took my life, so I'm taking
               his.  Bro, I'm going straight.

                             POLLUX
               Sounds like they took your brain,
               too?

                             CASTOR
               Imagine Dillinger as J. Edgar
               Hoover.  Carlos the Jackal running
               Interpol.  Kaddafi heading the
               Mossad.  Think of the secrets we
               could sell...

     Pollux listens carefully -- mind clicking like an abacus.

                             POLLUX
               The drug agents we could expose.
               The movie stars we could
               blackmail!

                             CASTOR
               That's just the bottom of the food
               chain.  Pollux -- what would
               happen if somebody planted a bomb
               on Air Force One?

                             POLLUX
               ... that somebody would get rich.
               And, I suppose, the nation would
               be pretty pissed-off.

                             CASTOR
               Pissed-off, vulnerable... looking
               for someone to step in, take
               charge, give them hope again.
               What if that someone was an F.B.I.
               hero?  A true Boy Scout and family
               man -- with a spotless past.
               Imagine where that guy could land
               -- if the timing's right.

                             POLLUX
               It's an audacious dream, Caz.  But
               Jon Archer is hardly a household
               name.

                             CASTOR
               Not yet he isn't.  But after you
               'confess' -- you'll be a free man.
               And I'll be on my way...


     EXT. CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

     Police VEHICLES ROAR into position.  Squads of police
     evacuate throngs of people.


     INT. CONVENTION CENTER - SUB-BASEMENT - EXTREME
     CLOSEUP - BOMB TIMER - DAY

     TICKS down to less than two minutes.

     Working as a unit, the BOMB SQUAD carefully remove the
     bomb's casing.  Inside, the complex guts glow evilly.
     The men are tense, cautious -- and way out of their 
     league.

                             BOMB LEADER
               Jesus... Any suggestions?

                             TECHNICIAN
               Yeah... run

     Castor pushes up his blast visor.  He looks grim.

                             BOMB LEADER
               It's protected by a vibration
               detector... One touch and...

                             CASTOR
               Evacuate your team, Captain.

                             BOMB LEADER
               Sir, you can't disarm it --

                             CASTOR
               Just go!

     The bomb squad hustles out.  Waiting until he's alone,
     Castor pulls a radio device from his pocket and hits its
     switch.  The bomb's glow dies instantly.


     EXTREME CLOSEUP - TIMER

     stops at 26 seconds.


     BACK TO SCENE

     Not satisfied, Castor starts it up again -- running the
     timer down to four seconds.  That's better.

     
     INT. EREWHON PRISON - "POPULATION" - DAY

     The inmates eat lunch.  Walton enters -- prodding a
     beaten Jon Archer ahead of him.

                             WALTON
               A special privilege today:  TV --
               by order of Agent Jon Archer of
               the F.B.I...

     Jeers from the inmates as the big screen changes from the
     nature loop to... CNN.


     ON SCREEN - CONVENTION CENTER

     "Sweating," Castor lumbers out, carrying the disarmed
     bomb.

                            ANCHORMAN (V.O.)
               That was the scene at the L.A.
               Convention Center, where an F.B.I.
               agent is being hailed as a hero.
               Agent Jon Archer disarmed a
               powerful bomb just seconds before
               it was set to explode.  Let's get
               the latest from Valerie Rice...


     EXT. CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

     Castor basks in the attention of the gathered media.

                             REPORTER RICE
               The apparent target was a group of
               Supreme Court justices -- due to
               speak here today.
                      (thrusting microphone)
               Mr. Archer, do you have any idea
               who planted it?

                             CASTOR
               That's classified.  But if he's
               listening I have a message for
               him:
                      (directly into
                       camera)
               Nice try.  Now you know who's
               really in charge.


     INT. EREWHON PRISON - POPULATION

     Watching the TV, Archer's enraged, frustrated.  Then his 
     eyes focus... he watches closely as --

     A guard uses his "thumbprint ID" to get through the 
     security door.  Archer's eyes fall on the thumbprint scan
     pad.


     INT. FBI - BULLPEN - DAY

     Castor gets a "thumbs up" from some co-workers, others
     smile -- but they know better than to applaud.

                             CASTOR
               Don't you guys watch TV?  Where's
               the parade?

     They look at each other -- afraid.  But proud rookie 
     Loomis starts clapping, so everyone else joins in rousing 
     applause.

                             CASTOR
               -- Loomis, Buzz, uh -- Wanda...
               all of you, thanks from the bottom
               of my heart.  Thanks for enduring
               all those years I was an
               insufferable boor.  From now on --
               consider me reborn.

                             WANDA
               Stop the presses -- Jon Archer
               found a personality...

     Wild applause... interrupted by an excited Kim.

                             KIM
               Sir... the White House is calling.

     Castor acts startled... as if at a loss.  Then he struts
     toward his office -- pausing only to give Kim a playful
     swat on the rump.  She's stunned.


     INT. ARCHER'S OFFICE - DAY

     Castor surveys his new domain.  He settles into Archer's
     big leather chair... sees a framed photo of Archer and
     family.  He apes Archer's dumb posed smile...

                             CASTOR
               Jon, your career is finally taking
               of.
                      (picks up phone)
               Archer.  Sure I'll hold...

     Waiting, he picks up a handbook:  You and the FBI:  A
     Primer for New Employees.  Then...

                             CASTOR
               Mr. President, what an honor...

     Castor pumps a "whacking off" gesture with his hand.


     EXT. ARCHER'S HOME - DAY

     Castor, carrying grocery bags, comes into the back yard 
     where Jamie practices free throws.  He watches her miss.

                             CASTOR
               How about a game of horse?

                             JAMIE
               Don't make me beat your butt
               again, Dad.  It's harmful to my
               developing psyche.

                             CASTOR
               Afraid you'll lose?

     Castor crisply sinks a free-throw.  Jamie glares, takes
     the ball -- and tosses an air-ball.

                             CASTOR
               'H.'

     Jamie sneers at him.  He buries another one.

                             CASTOR
               Try putting a higher arc on the
               ball... and square your shoulders
               to the basket.

     Begrudgingly, she listens -- and sinks a clean shot.
     Pleased, she nods.  HONK!  A BMW pulls into the driveway.

                             JAMIE
               Gotta go.  Karl's here.

     Jamie trots over to greet KARL (17) -- a clean-cut
     preppie.  Opening the car door dor her, Karl waves,
     smiling at Castor.  Castor studies Karl carefully, not
     liking what he sees.


     INT. ARCHER'S HOME - NIGHT

     A tired Eve opens the door.  It's pitch black inside.  As
     she fumbles for the light switch...


     MATCH

     flares as Castor lights a candle.  The dining room table
     is set for a candlelight dinner.  He smiles warmly at her
     confusion.

                             CASTOR
               Don't tell me you forgot.  Eve --
               it's date night!


     DINING ROOM - LATER

     Eve looks up from her pasta.  After an awkward silence.

                             EVE
               Why do I feel like I'm on a blind
               date?

                             CASTOR
               It's important to keep some
               mystery... so things stay...
               unpredictable.

     Eve studies him as he pours her more wine.  Her smile
     slowly fades as she realizes what's going on.

                             EVE
               'Unpredictable'?  You're about as
               unpredictable as the tide.
                      (detached)
               How long are you going to be gone
               this time?

                             CASTOR
               Gone?

                             EVE
               Isn't that what all this is about?
               The wine, cooking me dinner --
               your next assignment?

                             CASTOR
               I'm not going anywhere.

                             EVE
               You always say that -- then you
               leave.

                             CASTOR
               I bet I deserved that.  I bet Jon
               Archer is the most inattentive,
               sexless spouse on Earth.

                             EVE
               Jon, that's not true --

                             CASTOR
               Of course it's true, but I'm
               trying to change?  I'm here
               because I want to be alone with
               you.  I want to see the candle-
               light dance in your beautiful --

     Uh-oh.  Castor can't tell the color of Eve's eyes.  He 
     leans in "romantically" -- but we know the real reason.

                             CASTOR
               -- brown eyes.

     He smells her hair, then her shoulders, her skin.  She's
     aroused, but wary.  So Castor goes in for the kill.

                             CASTOR
               I wanted it all to be just
               right... when I told you about my
               promotion.

                             EVE
               Your what?

                             CASTOR
               Well, I don't have it yet.  But
               Lazarro's getting old -- he won't
               be around forever.  And I'm
               getting the itch to move up.

                             EVE
               Jon... that's wonderful.

                             CASTOR
               So you see, I'm not going
               anywhere.  Unless it's upstairs
               with you...


     INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

     Castor carries Eve into the shower and spins on the 
     water.

     He rips her blouse open -- on her like a vulture to 
     carrion.  As they drop to the floor of the stall -- water 
     filling up around them -- Castor licks her ear and
     whispers...

                             CASTOR
               baby, it's like I'm having you for
               the first time.

     Dirty water runs down a floor drain... PULL BACK to:


     INT. EREWHON PRISON - POPULATION - NIGHT

     Desolate, Archer mops down the rec area.

                             ARCHER
               Don't they ever let us take off
               these boots?

                             VOISINE
               Not unless you're sent to the
               'Clinic.'

                             ARCHER
               You mean if I get sick?

                             VOISINE
               They don't give two fucks about
               your health.  The Clinic's where
               they send the real hard-cases for
               attitude adjustment.  Dubov just
               got sent down -- and look at
               Wainwright --

     Voisine gestures to a dazed inmate nearby -- WAINWRIGHT
     -- who sits in a corner -- gnawing at his knuckles.

                             VOISINE
               Toughest bastard I ever saw --
               after you, of course.  Now he's a
               fucking drool case.

                             ARCHER
               What did he do?

                             VOISINE
               He hit a guard.

     Archer sees Walton hovering nearby.  Archer heads for
     him.

                             WALTON
               Looking for trouble, Castor?

                             ARCHER
               As a matter of fact -- yes.

     Crack!  Archer decks Walton.


     INT. PRISON - POPULATION - NIGHT

     Walton and a guard herd Archer toward a steel door.


     INT. "CLINIC" - NIGHT

     Archer is dumped on the floor.  He sees he's lying in a
     puddle of something.  He looks up -- and recoils.

     ARCHER'S POV - DUBOV

     is strapped to a vertical gurney -- post-procedure.  His 
     limbs are stiff, his eyes blank as a mako shark's.  But 
     his feet are bare -- bootless.

                             MED-TECH
               Where's the mop, he puked all over
               the place.

     An assistant unstraps Dubov and drops him on a gurney.

                             MED-TECH
                      (mopping up)
               -- next time, bring them in before
               dinner...

     Archer cases the place:  Above is a catwalk... leading
     out.


     BACK TO SCENE

     Walton muscles Archer into the gurney.  The Med-Tech 
     smirks.

                             MED-TECH
               Oh happy day -- Castor Troy.

     The Med-Tech wheels the ECT head-gear cart into place: 
     twin needle-like BOLTS ready to fit into ARCHER'S ears.  
     A single blue static spark jumps from the bolts.

     Walton roughly wedges Archer's head into the head gear,
     shoving the chewed-up bite strap into Archer's mouth.

                             WALTON
               Bite hard, scumbag, 'cause you'll
               be gumming baby food from here on
               out.

                             MED-TECH
               Get his boots, Sergeant.

     Walton unlocks Archer's first boot and pulls it off.  As
     the Med-Tech starts to fasten Archer's arm -- Walton 
     unlocks and pulls off the second boot.

     Archer's feet are free.  Crack!  He yanks his foot up 
     hard -- Walton reels back, stunned.

     One arm still restrained, Archer backrolls in the gurney 
     and kicks the head-gear cart away -- knocking it into the 
     Med-Tech who collapses onto it, hitting "Test" --

     ZAP!  The HEAD-BOLTS FIRE, catching the Med-Tech through 
     the shoulder -- he drops to the floor, his synapses shot.

     Seeing that Archer is still restrained by the arm -- the
     assistant darts out of the room.

     As Archer pulls free -- Walton looms over him -- gun
     poised.

     Then -- wham!  Dubov wallops Walton -- using his boots as
     brass knuckles.  The head guard collapses.

     Dubov smiles dumbly at Archer -- all trace of vendetta
     now obliterated.  Archer nods gratefully -- they're on
     the same team... at least for now.

     Suddenly the ALARM BLARES.

     Archer sees guards charging the room.  He tries closing
     the door -- but the guards arrive.  Dubov lumbers over
     and puts his massive weight into it -- and slams the door
     shut.

     O.S., guards POUND at the now-locked door.

     Archer quickly frisks Walton -- coming up with a
     cigarette lighter.  he pockets it.

     Scanning around -- Archer leaps onto a mounted, hinged
     lamp.  it swings against the wall.  Archer uses it to
     reach the catwalk above.

                             ARCHER
               Dubov -- come on!

     Dubov obeys and follows Archer up onto the catwalk.

     A groggy Walton muscles open the door from inside.  
     Guards pour in.  Walton grabs an AUTO-RIFLE and opens 
     FIRE.

     SLUGS chase Archer and Dubov as they flee through the
     catwalk door.


     INT. CENTRAL SECURITY CONTROL

     Two guards watch Archer and Dubov disappear off the
     clinic's monitor.  They grab their shock-sticks and rush
     for the door.

     The door opens -- revealing Dubov and Archer.  Perfectly
     in synch -- they double cold-cock the startled guards.
     Archer grabs a shock-stick -- and fuses the door shut.

     He yanks out wires and shatters the computers.  Dubov
     mimics the behavior -- ripping out an entire console --
     and revealing a narrow cable duct.

     Flames explode -- shorting the circuitry -- the DRONING
     HUM RISES -- the magnetic power monitor shows a dangerous
     surge.


     AROUND PRISON

     Chaos.  Guards scatter as the huge diamond-vision SCREEN
     EXPLODES and inmates are flung like rag-dolls by their
     short-circuiting boots.  Anything metallic flies into the
     magnetic domes.


     SECURITY CENTRAL

     As the men back through the cable duct -- Archer
     struggles to replace the heavy console.

     The DOOR is BLOWN open.  Walton enters to find... no one.
     Then his eyes light on the console -- slightly askew.


     INT. CABLE CORRIDOR

     Archer and Dubov rush down the tight corridor -- and
     around the bend.  The corridor ends in a...


     STORAGE/MAINTENANCE AREA

     Lined with tools, toilets, sinks, a rack of old lock-down
     boots.  They race through the far door...


     INT. CENTRAL TOWER ROOM

     Archer and Dubov find themselves in a multi-level
     labyrinth.  A hundred feet high -- criss-crossed with
     catwalks, staircases and high walls.

     ECHOES resound -- SHOUTING, FOOTSTEPS GETTING CLOSER --
     they seem to be coming from all around them.

     Over the magnetic HUM -- Archer notices loose screws and
     other metal debris stuck to the sheer wall.  He pulls one
     screw away -- and lets it fly back into the polarized
     wall.

     Archer gets an idea -- and looks back the way they came.  

                                                SMASH CUT:


     SHEER WALL

     Archer and Dubov scale the face -- using the old metal
     boots.  They climb higher and higher as...

     Guards criss-cross the catwalks and staircases below and
     around them -- oblivious.

     Archer and Dubov almost reach the next level when...

                             WALTON
               There!

     BULLETS SMACK the wall around them -- just as Archer and
     Dubov reach the next catwalk.

     Archer spots the emergency exit security door at the far
     end.  But four guards descend on them -- and block their
     way.

     Fist fight as Archer and Dubov take on the attacking
     guards.  Archer heaves one down the stairs -- into more
     guards.  Dubov drops another over the catwalk.

     They continue their desperate race for the door --
     reaching the landing.  As BULLETS PING around them --
     hulking Dubov rips away a floor panel.  He uses it as a
     shield as Archer sparks up Walton's lighter.

     As SLUGS EXPLODE into the shield -- Archer places the
     flame to his thumb... and peels off the skin mold.

     He presses his thumb to the door's keypad.  To his 
     horror, its LED reads "print unreadable."

     Walton and guards movie in, FIRING at closer and closer
     range.

     Dubov staggers under the FUSILLADE OF BULLETS.  The
     shield is repeatedly punctured -- and is quickly
     disintegrating.

     Archer licks his thumb, tries again.  Finally it reads
     "Clearance Confirmed"... the door slides open.

                             ARCHER
               Let's go!

     Dubov heaves the shield at the encroaching guards -- but
     as he turns to follow... Walton BLOWS him away.

     Archer reaches to pull Dubov through, but the riddled
     inmate ignores the helping hand.  Pulling the door shut,
     he collapses in front of it -- blocking it momentarily.


     INT. HIGH CATWALK TOWER

     Archer hesitates for a moment... but that's all he has.
     he keeps going... up the winding staircase-catwalk --
     higher and higher -- a step ahead of the onrushing
     guards.

     As BULLETS CLANG around him -- Archer reaches the top.
     He ignores a sign which reads...

                        EMERGENCY EXIT ONLY
                       SAFETY LINES REQUIRED

     He charges straight up a ladder and plows right
     through --

                                                SMASH CUT:

     EXT. PRISON - DAWN

     Archer's blinded -- it's daytime in the real world.

     A sea gull flies across his face -- as we FOLLOW the
     bird...

     PULL WAY, WAY BACK to reveal:

     The prison's in the middle of the goddamn ocean, in what
     appears to be just an abandoned, rusty oil rig platform.  

     Archer rushes over to a transport chopper.


     INSIDE COCKPIT

     Archer searches for the keys.  No go.  He throws
     switches.  Nothing works.

     Guards pour out of the hatch -- FIRING.  Archer leaps
     from the chopper and jumps over the side to the
     platform's --


     LOWER LEVEL

     He lands hard on the slanted, corrugated shed roof and
     rolls to the ground.  He grabs a high-pressure hose --
     and cranks the pressure valve -- as the pursuing guards
     close in.

     Archer BLASTS the guards with the WATER CANNON --
     knocking Walton and others into the sea.  Archer upends a
     stack of oil barrels -- which roll into more guards.
     Archer spots:


     TUGBOAT

     pulling a Zodiac dinghy -- heading out to sea.

     Archer jumps up a stack of pipes to the south rail --
     where the end of a crane's hook is tagged back.  Under
     FIRE -- Archer frees the hook, which swings away from the
     platform.

     Hanging on to the hook, it swings him out over the ocean.
     At the apex -- le lets go and plummets down into...


     CHOPPY SEA

     He pulls himself into the ZODIAC and frees it from the
     tug.  It ROARS off.


     EXT. ZODIAC - MOVING - DAY

     The nylon craft zips through the waves -- approaching San
     Pedro Harbor.  The ENGINE SPUTTERS... low on gas.

                             ARCHER
               Come on... come on...

     Archer senses something... He looks up and...

     Whoosh!  Something swoops down -- but it's just a
     pelican.

     He FIDDLES with the ENGINE -- which finally DIES.  Archer
     grabs the oars -- about to start rowing when --

     Another swoop!  This time it's the prison chopper.

     Archer spots a string of buoys dotting the harbor.  An
     idea.


     WIDE SHOT

     The chopper settles over the Zodiac.

     Wind and water swirl around Archer...


     CHOPPER

     Walton, drenched but obviously rescued, has archer in his
     sights... He starts to FIRE his MACHINE GUNS...


     ZODIAC

     BULLETS RAIN down on the boat -- destroying it -- as
     Archer dives into the rolling swells...


     INSIDE CHOPPER

     Walton RAKES the debris -- shredding it.

     The chopper does a final circle of the wreckage... then
     moves off... its ROTOR WASH THRASHING the buoy.


     UNDER BUOY

     Archer has crawled up into the hollow buoy -- sucking
     air.


     INT. ARCHER HOME - BEDROOM - DAY

     Eve's asleep.  Castor, dressed, looks down at her like 
     Cortez at Montezuma -- triumphant, with overwhelming 
     power.


     EXT. DRIVEWAY - DAY

     Heading for the car, Castor is about to light up when --

                             EVE
               Last night, I thought -- this
               isn't my husband.

     He pockets the smoke.  Eve is there, dressed somberly.

                             EVE
               Then I woke up in the middle of
               the night -- and found you passed
               out in the study.

                             CASTOR
               I couldn't sleep -- you roll
               around a lot.
                      (jingles car keys)
               Anyway, I'm late.

                             EVE
               Jon, you know what day it is.  I
               know it's difficult for you, but
               we still have to go.

                             CASTOR
               Can't we skip it just this once?
               I gotta 'protect and serve', you
               know.

                             EVE
               'Protect and serve' later.  You're
               going.

                             CASTOR
               Okay, if you insist.  But -- you
               drive.

     He climbs into the front seat beside her.


     INT./EXT. CAR - MOVING - DAY

     A pastoral, hilly area near the coast.

                             CASTOR
               So who's this Karl creep Jamie's
               been seeing?  He's a little old
               for her, isn't he?

                             EVE
               I don't know... they're about the
               same ages we were when we met.
                      (smiles)
               Remember the all-night dentist?

                             CASTOR
               Sure, how could I forget.
                      (changes subject)
               By the way, you never said
               anything about last night...

     He moves closer, stroking her hair as his BEEPER sounds.

                             EVE
               Aren't you going to get that?

     He turns his beeper off, then touches her lips with his
     finger.  Without knowing exactly why, Eve tenses up.

                             EVE
               Jon -- this is hardly the time or
               place.

     Castor looks around in surprise because he sees she's 
     driving into --


     SPRAWLING MEMORIAL PARK

     They drive through the gates -- passing a church marked
     "ST. MARY'S-BY-THE-SEA."  Nearby, the OCEAN ROARS.


     EXT. ST. MARY'S CEMETERY - DAY

     It's beautiful here, striking and sad.  Now on foot,
     Castor follows Eve up a bluff, through a phalanx of 
     graves -- with no idea where she's leading him.

     Finally she stops at a crucifix-topped headstone.  Castor
     joins her and reads the etched marble stone:

                       Matthew Archer, Age 5
                       Beloved Son & Brother
                       We Cherish You Always

     Stunned, Castor watches as Eve kneels beside the marker.

                             EVE
               Happy birthday, Matty.

     She places a few child's toys on the marker... a shark...
     a little bulldozer... a spaceship.  Overwhelmed with 
     grief, she collapses into Castor.

                             EVE
               He took our baby, Jon.  He took
               our little boy.


     FULL SCREEN - CASTOR'S FACE

     He stares at the grave of the boy he killed -- the boy 
     whose mother is weeping into his chest.

     The ever-present smirk is long gone as Castor stiffly 
     returns Eve's embrace -- maybe, just maybe, feeling the 
     victim's pain.

                             CASTOR
               Stop crying... stop crying...
               stop ...


     INT. FBI BULLPEN - DAY

     Shaking off his funk, Castor arrives at the office.

                             WANDA
               You picked a helluva day to leave
               your beeper off!

                             CASTOR
               What happened?

                             WANDA
               Castor's dead!

                             CASTOR
               He's -- what?

                             BUZZ
               Somehow he escaped from Erewhon.
               But a prison chopper mowed him
               down just off Long Beach Harbor...

                             CASTOR
               Where's the body?

                             WANDA
               It hasn't been recovered yet.

                             CASTOR
               'It hasn't been recovered yet!'
               You people have no idea who you're
               dealing with!
                      (beat)
               I want everyone on this, reports
               on the half hour, and all leads
               get routed through my office.
               Buzz, alert the L.A.P.D.

                             BUZZ
               L.A.P.D.?  Even if he is alive,
               Castor isn't stupid enough to come
               back to the city.

                             CASTOR
               He's alive -- and he's already
               here.  Move!


     EXT. PIER - NIGHT

     Something bobs up in the surf.  Archer is thrashed ashore
     by the breakers... he crawls gasping onto the sand.  He
     takes a few breaths -- then staggers up onto the beach.


     EXT. TITO'S STREET - NIGHT

     Archer's heart sinks as he sees the yellow police cordon
     taped across Tito's front door.  Some teenage cholos
     notice him -- so Archer keeps right on going.


     INT. TITO'S DUPLEX - NIGHT

     A rear window is forced open -- Archer pulls himself in.
     In the dim light, he sees the bullet hole on the wall...
     then the blood stains within the forensics chalk marks.

     He buckles and has to sit down.  Taking a deep breath, he
     picks up the phone and dials.

                             ARCHER
               Dr. Archer please.   It's an
               emergency.
                      (listens)
               -- Her husband.

     Archer waits.  He pinches his throat -- trying to 
     dislodge the vocal implant.  His voice scrambles into 
     garbled static.

                             ARCHER
               Hello, Eve -- I know this sounds
               crazy, but --
                      (reverting back)
               Dammit.


     INT. HOSPITAL - ER - NIGHT

     EVE deftly stitches up a gash above little IRIS's (8)
     eye.

                             EVE
               How did this happen, sweetie?

                             IRIS'S DAD
               She fell off her Big-Wheel.

     Something about his too-quick response rankles Eve.  She
     eyes the yuppy Dad with suspicion -- then notes some
     bruises on the child's arm.  A NURSE enters.

                             NURSE
               Dr. Archer -- your husband's on
               three.

                             EVE
               Get Child Services down here --
               and don't let her father leave.
                      (goes to wall-phone)
               Jon?  Hello?

     INTERCUT Archer and Eve as necessary.

                             ARCHER
               Eve, listen carefully.  The man
               you think is your husband --
               isn't.

                             EVE
               Who is this?

                             ARCHER
               Please, just listen!  Take Jamie
               and go to your mother's in Santa
               Fe.  Don't tell him where you're
               going -- just go.

                             EVE
               Whoever you are -- don't call
               again...

     CLICK.  Archer sags in futility.  A SIREN snaps him back
     to reality.

     Archer goes to the window and carefully peers out.

     A squad CAR ROARS INTO VIEW -- then continues on its way.

                             ARCHER
               I need to speak to Director
               Lazarro immediately... I have
               information about Castor Troy.

     Waiting... Archer rifles the room... finding car keys...
     a baggy jacket... Then...

     INTERCUT WITH:


     INT. FBI OFFICE

                             CASTOR
               This is Jon Archer.  Who's
               calling?

     Archer pauses... hearing his own voice speaking to him.

                             ARCHER
               Well, if you're Jon Archer... I
               guess this must be Castor Troy...

                             CASTOR
               I've gotta hand it to you, Jon.
               You're doing a damn respectable
               job of being me.  But let's face
               it, we both liked it better the
               way it was.  So before the cops
               blow your brains out -- why not
               tell me where you are...

                             ARCHER
               If you were really me, you'd
               know -- no discussion, no deals.

     Archer hangs up == leaving Castor stewing.


     EXT. GARAGE - NIGHT

     The automatic door lifts -- revealing Tito's old Buick.
     The big V-8 RUMBLES as Archer pulls out.  He doesn't get
     far as... menacing CHOLOS block his way.

                             CHOLO # 1
               Where are you going?

                             CHOLO #2
               Ten bucks he's the guy who popped
               Tito!

     The Cholos surround the Buick.  Archer's cornered like an
     animal as the angry teens pound on the windows.

     Archer HITS the GAS -- scattering all except Cholo #1 who
     jumps on the hood.  Archer SLAMS the BRAKES -- sending
     the guy flying.  He lands hard, but is only shaken up.

     As Archer roars off, Cholo #1 pulls out his cell phone.

                             CHOLO #1
               9-1-1?  I want to report a stolen
               car and don't put me on hold!


     INT./EXT. BUICK - MOVING - NIGHT

     Archer drives on -- listening to KFWB.

                             RADIO REPORTER (V.O.)
               ... the escapee is considered
               extremely dangerous.  If you have
               any information concerning the
               whereabouts of Castor Troy...

     He SHUTS it OFF as he sees in the distance:


     HIS OWN HOME

     FBI and LAPD vehicles are parked in front.  No way he's
     getting near there.

     In his rearview mirror Archer spots a cop car
     approaching.  He quickly turns a corner as the cop slowly
     cruises by.

                             ARCHER
               No, Jon... you have to think like
               Castor.  Where would he go...?

     Archer gets an idea.  But as he drives on -- the cop car
     backs up -- and reappears INTO FRAME.

     
     EXT. MELROSE DISTRICT - NIGHT

     Dietrich locks up his chic art gallery.  He gets in his 
     Lexus and drives out of the parking lot.


     INT./EXT. STREET - LEXUS - MOVING - NIGHT

     Dietrich slows down to check out the forensics team
     swarming all over Tito's parked Buick.  Dietrich quickly
     averts his face as he spots... "Jon Archer" inspecting
     Tito's Buick.

                             DIETRICH
               Jon Archer... some poor schmuck's
               in big trouble.

                             ARCHER
               Yeah -- me.

     With surprising speed, Dietrich yanks a pistol from
     someplace and jerks around --

     Archer -- hunkered down in the back seat -- stares into 
     the barrel of Dietrich's pistol.

                             DIETRICH
               Jesus Christ, Castor.

                             ARCHER
               Drive.  And punch up your
               cellular -- I need you to make
               some calls.

                             DIETRICH
               You're gonna get me busted!

                             ARCHER
               You're already busted, Dietrich.
               It's just a matter of time before
               they pick you up.

     Dietrich snakes the car past the crime scene and speeds
     off.

                             DIETRICH
               Man, when you came to me about
               that bomb -- I knew I should have
               blown you off... but that's my
               fucking curse -- I just can't say
               no to a friend.

                             ARCHER
               You can't say no to money.

                             DIETRICH
               That's my other curse.


     EXT. DOWNTOWN - LOFT - NIGHT (LATER)

     Cars pull up in front of a gentrified loft amid the low-
     rent streets.

     Emerging from them are several thugs -- including Aldo,
     Fitch and their sexy girl friends, LIVIA and Cindee.


     INT. DIETRICH'S LOFT - BATHROOM - NIGHT

     Archer splashes water on his face -- then stops and
     listens as the DOORBELL RINGS.  He screws up his courage.

                             ARCHER
               You're Castor Troy... This is your
               old crew -- you don't take shit
               and you don't take no for an
               answer...


     INT. DIETRICH'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

     The thugs admire the loft -- dominated by an enormous,
     in-progress mural and stunning glass-bricked floor.

                             ALDO
               Helluva place, Dietrich.  So
               what's the big surprise?

     Archer emerges.  The men are stunned -- the women beam.

                             FITCH
               Are you crazy?  You're going to
               bring the Feds down on all of us!

                             ARCHER
               Archer doesn't want you, he wants
               me!  But I'm going to get him
               first -- with your help.

                             ALDO
               Archer's a damn celebrity now --
               he's untouchable -- and you're
               radioactive.

     He turns to leave.  Archer wheels him around and smashes
     him into the wall.  Aldo goes for his gun, but Archer's
     too quick -- he strips him of it.

     The four bodyguards draw their weapons -- and surround
     Archer.

                             ARCHER
               You wanna face-off with Castor
               Troy?  Come on, then!  Come on!
               'Cause I've had a real bad day...

     Four against one -- and everyone's sweating but Archer.
     One-by-one, the bodyguards back off.  Archer points the
     gun at Aldo -- then smiles and hands it back.

                             ARCHER
               You're all forgetting who the real
               enemy is.
                      (to Aldo)
               Six months ago, Jon Archer hauled
               you in for questioning.  He
               rattled you so bad -- you shit
               your Armani suit right there in
               the interrogation room.

     Aldo blanches -- how did Castor know that?  Fitch laughs.

                             ARCHER
               You laugh, Fitch -- the way Archer
               laughed at your last arraignment,
               when you got down on your knees
               and tried to blow your way to
               freedom.

     Stunned, Fitch cringes as everybody cracks up.

                             DIETRICH
               We all have a reason to hate Jon
               Archer.  We all want to see him
               dead --

                             ARCHER
               And nobody's untouchable if we say
               he's not.

     The thugs exchange a glance... reading each other...
     considering.

                             DIETRICH
               It's all worked out.  Caz has
               Archer's routine down cold.

                             ARCHER
               We start with your basic
               kidnapping.  Then -- a little
               surgery.

                             FITCH
               Surgery?

                             ARCHER
               I'm going to rearrange his face in
               a way you won't believe.

                             ALDO
               You're an evil bitch, Caz.  But
               you've got balls of titanium.
               Count us in.

     Archer sighs with relief -- pleased with his performance.

                             DIETRICH
               Come on -- let's drink to it!


     FULL SCREEN - BLUE CAPSULE

     Dietrich cracks it open -- powder sifts into a big high-
     ball glass filled with mescal.  he hands it to Archer.

                             DIETRICH
               How about one of your famous
               toasts, Caz?

     They all look expectantly at Archer... he's at a loss.

                             ARCHER
               To old jobs, new jobs and -- uh --
               blow jobs?

     Silence -- then they crack up.  Reluctantly, Archer
     swallows the tumbler of mescal... he fights back the urge
     to puke.

                             LIVIA
               Enough business, Caz.  Let's
               dance.

                             ARCHER
               Sorry... I don't...

     She drags him onto the glass floor.  Cindee puts on some
     MUSIC as Archer's head begins to spin.  The girls start
     "dancing," grinding Archer between their taut bodies.  He
     tries to avoid it, but Livia kisses him -- hot, moist.

                             LIVIA
               Remember the Charger's game, Caz?
               The owners box?  We did it four
               times.

                             ARCHER
               Sure I remember... Once a quarter,
               right?

     Archer's eyes fall on the series of abstract paintings.

     The twisted renderings make his head spin worse... as he
     starts to hallucinate... surrounded by enemies -- he
     struggles to regain control of his battered psyche.

                             LIVIA
               Caz?  Are you okay?

     He pulls away and stumbles down the stairs -- toward the
     kitchen.

                             DIETRICH
               When even Castor Troy can't handle
               a tab of Quantrex...
                      (raises his glass)
               That, dear friends, is the first
               sorry whiff of old age.


     INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

     Archer has his mouth under the tap -- drinking greedily.
     Woozy, he takes a breath... and notices a reflection in
     the window above the sink.  Archer turns to see -- Sasha.

                             ARCHER
               -- Sasha Hassler.  Age 35.  Met
               Castor Troy in Austin, Texas, at
               Pearl Jam reunion...
                      (catches himself)
               Uh, how you doing, baby?

     She responds by slapping him -- hard.

                             SASHA
               What the hell are you doing here?
               You're supposed to be dead...

     He wobbles, then falls flat on his face.  Out cold.


     INT. ARCHER'S HOME - BALCONY - NIGHT

     Castor's chain-smoking, looking out over the city --
     wondering where Archer might be hiding.  But something
     breaks his rumination.  He sees --


     DOWN STREET

     A BMW pulls up to the curb.  The THUMPING MUSIC from
     within GOES QUIET, but no one emerges.


     EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)

     Curious, Castor approaches the car, keeping a safe 
     distance.  He can see Jamie inside, struggling with Karl.

                             JAMIE
               No... Karl, please.

     He "shushes" Jamie -- but doesn't stop pawing her.

                             JAMIE
               My father -- he's got a gun --
               he'll -- he'll --

                             KARL
                      (pulls open belt)
               That wimp won't do shit.

     SMASH!  The passenger WINDOW EXPLODES inward.  Castor
     drags Karl out by his hair.  Jamie scrambles out and
     flees toward the house as...

                             CASTOR
               Who are you to call Jon Archer a
               wimp?

     Castor heaves Karl into the WINDSHIELD -- SPIDER-WEBBING 
     it.  Somehow the kid finds his feet and stumbles behind 
     the wheel.  The Beemer lurches away.


     INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

     Castor enters to find Jamie, still shaken up.

                             CASTOR
               What are you -- stupid?

                             JAMIE
               That's just like you.  Some guy
               tries to rape me -- and you side
               with him.

                             CASTOR
               Did it look like I was siding with
               him?  Did it?
                      (she falls silent)
               You want to play with scummy organ
               grinders, you better be prepared.
               Do you have protection?

                             JAMIE
               You mean like... condoms?

                             CASTOR
               I mean like... protection.

     With a fluid motion, Castor expertly SNAPS open a well-
     oiled SWITCHBLADE and hands it to an astonished Jamie.

                             JAMIE
               For me?

                             CASTOR
               Next time -- slip it in low, then
               twist it -- so the wound doesn't
               close.

     She hugs him tight -- taking Castor by surprise.  But he
     responds momentarily.  About to pat her rump -- something
     makes him stop.

                             CASTOR
               Go on, get out of here.

     Jamie kisses him and heads up stairs.  After she's
     gone...

                             CASTOR
               No wonder he spent all his time
               chasing me.  Who can deal with
               this family shit?

     The PHONE RINGS.  He rushes to the den and picks it up.

                             CASTOR
               Jon Archer.
                      (immediately alert)
               Where is he?


     EXT. LOFT - ACROSS STREET - NIGHT

     Using night-vision goggles, Pollux watches Sasha close
     her drapes.  Visible in the b.g. on the sofa -- is
     Archer.

                             POLLUX
                      (into cell phone)
               -- I thought he might visit some
               old friends of yours.  And bro, if
               I didn't know better -- I'd swear
               this guy likes being you...


     INT. SASHA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Archer wakens.  Sasha is tugging off his pants.

                             ARCHER
               Uh -- can't we just talk?

                             SASHA
               Talk?  The only talk I ever heard
               from you was 'take it off,' 'sit
               on it,' 'I'll pay you tomorrow.'

     She pulls out some fresh clothes -- and dumps them on
     him.

                             SASHA
               Take off the rest of those rags
               and get dressed.  Then get out.

                             ARCHER
               Not until I finish my business
               with your brother.

                             SASHA
               I told him to keep those creeps
               away -- but you're just too big an
               attraction.
                      (calming herself)
               Look, if the F.B.I. finds out
               you've been here -- I'll lose my
               son.  So please, just go.

     For the first time, Archer sees not a hardened felon --
     but a frightened, protective mother.  And he realizes the
     effect his own relentless obsession has had on her.

                             ARCHER
               I know I've done some things that
               made your life harder...

                             SASHA
               How would you?  You walked out and
               never looked back.

     ADAM enters, heading for his toys -- his presence cooling
     Sasha's deep-seated anger.  Archer finishes dressing.

                             ARCHER
               I'm not the same person you
               remember.  And for what it's
               worth, I'm sorry...

     Her harsh look softens imperceptively -- like that of a
     woman trying to hate someone she still loves.

                             ARCHER
               Not a bad fit.

                             SASHA
               They should.  They're yours.

                             ARCHER
               Nice-looking kid, too

                             SASHA
               Of course he is...

     Sasha fidgets, struggling with a deep inner turmoil.
     Then...

                             SASHA
               Adam, come here... I want you to
               meet your father.

     Archer's face pales over in shock.


     EXT. SASHA'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Their silhouettes are visible against the shades.

     PULL BACK...


     EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

     Castor, Buzz, Wanda and Loomis peer at the silhouettes.

                             CASTOR
                      (into cellular)
               We've got him sighted.  Okay,
               Pollux, pull out.

                             BUZZ
               What makes you so sure this guy's
               gonna set up his own brother?

                             CASTOR
               I've never been more certain of
               anything.  Get everyone in
               position.  Remember -- shoot to
               kill.

     Before Buzz can object, Castor's eyes say "don't argue."

                             BUZZ
               You heard the man -- let's saddle
               up!


     INT. SASHA'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Playing with his toys, Adam does not see Archer's icy
     gaze.

                             ARCHER
               How old is he?

                             SASHA
               Five.  No one knows you're his
               father.  I thought someone might
               want to hurt him -- just to hurt
               you...

                             ADAM
               Bang!  Bang!  Bang!

     Startled, they turn to see Adam pointing a toy gun at
     them.  Upset, she takes it from his hands.

                             SASHA
               You know Mommy doesn't like you
               playing with these things...

     She kicks the toy aside and lifts Adam -- offering him to
     Archer.  Awkwardly, Archer takes the boy.

     Archer's emotions avalanche as his grip tightens -- his
     big hands dwarfing the little boy's body.

                             SASHA
               You're not holding him right...
               Caz...

     Archer isn't hearing Sasha.  He's lost in his own
     memory... the sound of a CAROUSEL... a KID'S LAUGHTER...
     a GUNSHOT...

     Then Adam smiles -- perhaps the way Matthew once smiled.
     It pulls something up from inside Archer -- something 
     strong.  He regains control, dumping the child into 
     Sasha's arms.

                             ARCHER
               He's not my son.

                             SASHA
               Yes, he is -- !

     Then something alerts Archer -- maybe the fleeting 
     shadows that blot out the window-light for the barest 
     second.

                             ARCHER
               Get down!

     K-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM-BOOM!  The WINDOW PANES SHATTER -- as 
     TEARGAS GRENADES and GUNFIRE riddles the loft.


     OUTSIDE

     across the way, Castor directs the FIREPOWER.


     INT. UPPER LEVEL

     Chaos.  A bodyguard is mowed down.  Dietrich and the
     others scatter and hit the floor.


     KITCHEN

     Cindee and Fitch are caught in flagrante delicto on the
     floor as the kitchen is decimated by GUNFIRE...


     SASHA'S BEDROOM

     Coughing, Archer crawls through the roiling smoke toward 
     the door.  He's almost out when...

                             SASHA
               Adam!

     Her wail of fear freezes Archer.  He looks back -- and
     sees Adam in the eye of the firestorm.

     Archer's face betrays his conflict.  A child -- but his
     worst enemy's child.

     BULLETS SHRED the WALL around Adam.  Getting closer.

     Archer moves -- he crawls toward Adam.

     Just then -- a SWAT agent rappels in through one of the
     shattered windows, his weapon poised.  Archer kicks him
     hard, pitching him back through the window.

     Archer grabs Adam -- curling him into his body.  Thinking
     fast, he soaks his discarded T-shirt into a toppled
     flower vase -- then places it over Adam's face.
     Protecting him.

     He rushes to Sasha.  Together, they barrel through the
     soft, paper wall and tear out an escape route.


     INT. KITCHEN

     FIRING out the window, Fitch is riddled from outside by
     an agent as he CRASHES through the WINDOW.

     Cindee slashes the agent with a cleaver.  He FIRES --
     BLASTING Cindee into the refrigerator.


     LOWER LEVEL

     Archer hustles Sasha and Adam toward the staircase
     when --


     FRONT DOOR

     explodes open.  SWAT agents swarm to get in -- FIRING and
     throwing FLASH-GRENADES.


     ARCHER, SASHA AND ADAM

     are caught out in the open, when --


     UPPER LEVEL

     Dietrich, et al, open FIRE down on the attacking agents.
     Agents drop or are driven back out.


     SKYLIGHT

     BURSTS open and agents rappel down -- FIRING.  Aldo's
     bodyguard falls, riddled, off the upper level.


     LOWER LEVEL

     as one agent lands, Archer knocks his gun to the floor.
     They grapple.  As the agent reaches for it -- Adam
     appears and kicks the gun away.  Just like Mommy.


     SASHA

     scoops up the kicked weapon -- and cold-cocks another
     rappelling agent.  Then she FIRES, cutting a third
     rappelling agent's rope.  he drops hard to the floor --
     unconscious.

     Still grappling, Archer rips off the agent's gas-mask...

                             ARCHER
               Buzz...

     Buzz's eyes reveal only hatred.  He reaches for his
     knife.  Archer hesitates, then heaves Buzz through the 
     glass door.  He pushes Adam upstairs as more agents pour
     in the front door.

                             ARCHER
               Dietrich!  The painting!


     UPPER LEVEL

     Dietrich sees the canvas mural above the breached front
     door -- and understands.  He opens FIRE, cutting loose
     the mural.  It collapses, billowing -- and enshrouds the
     attacking agents -- and buying time.

                             DIETRICH
               Let's go!

     Archer and Sasha flee up the stairs.


     UPPER LEVEL

     Sasha sees Adam huddled in the middle of the glass floor
     -- the shadows of agents moving below.

                             SASHA
               Adam!


     LOWER LEVEL

     An agent aims his shotgun at the glass floor -- at the
     "target" kneeling on top of it.


     UPPER LEVEL

     Archer dives and grabs the boy as the GLASS FLOOR
     EXPLODES up.  He rolls through a shower of glass -- but
     comes up with Adam safely.

     Agents and thugs FIRE blindly upward and downward through
     the floor -- desperate to hit their targets.

     Agents open FIRE from the girders supporting the roof --
     cutting down Fitch's last bodyguard.

                             DIETRICH
               They're like cockroaches!

     Dietrich and Livia toss SMOKE GRENADES into the loft --
     covering their escape.


     TOP LEVEL

     Dietrich leads them to the very back of the loft.  He
     pulls open a hidden door.

                             DIETRICH
               If we make it, we'll meet up at my
               Malibu place.  You remember it,
               Caz?

                             ARCHER
               Off Kanan Road -- I know it.

     Archer hands Adam over to Sasha.  She hugs her little boy
     -- then embraces Archer tightly.  Hanging on -- near
     tears -- because she knows this may be the last time.

                             SASHA
               Thank you, Caz... thank you...

                             ARCHER
               Get the boy out of here...

     Livia and the remaining bodyguard hustle Archer out --


     INT. ROTUNDA - NIGHT

     MAC-10 poised, Livia and the bodyguard rush Archer
     through the deserted rotunda -- BOOM!  BOOM!  His escorts
     drop.

     Castor rushes down the staircase -- BLASTING at Archer.
     Unarmed, Archer instantly disappears behind one of the
     eight columns.  The columns are separated by mirrored-
     panels.

     Cat-and-mouse as Castor slips in and out between column
     and mirror.  He spots Archer dead-ahead and BLASTS away!

     CRASH!  The MIRROR SHATTERS into a thousand pieces.

                             ARCHER (O.S.)
               That's about a thousand years bad
               luck...

     Castor whirls, spots Archer again and FIRES!  Another
     MIRROR.  Sensing Archer behind him -- Castor turns and
     FIRES again -- this time BLASTING away his OWN
     REFLECTION.

     Then Archer leaps through a shattered mirror frame -- and
     onto Castor.  They battle for control of the pistol.

                             CASTOR
               It's too late, Jon.  Your kid
               loves me.  And your wife's an
               animal.  Even I can't keep up with
               her.

     They're so close Castor's whispering right in Archer's
     ear.

                             CASTOR
               Tonight I'm going to make her come
               like Niagara Falls -- to celebrate
               your death.

     Castor licks Archer's ear salaciously.  Enraged, Archer
     tears the pistol from his grip and turns it on Castor.

     He's got Castor dead to rights -- suddenly BULLETS SHRED
     the world around him.  Archer staggers away as --

     Loomis enters -- FIRING his M-16 as Archer dives for a
     doorway.  Loomis FIRES the M-16's grenade launcher.

     BOOM!  The GRENADE EXPLODES -- the doorway bursts into
     flames -- but Archer has made it through.

     Loomis tries to help up Castor -- who pushes him off
     angrily.  Castor can't follow through the flames.


     EXT. ROOF - NIGHT

     Archer slams out of the interior stairwell -- but BULLETS
     force him to take cover behind the cupola.

     Pollux FIRES at him from the other side.

     Archer RETURNS FIRE -- driving Pollux back.  Stand-off.

                             POLLUX
               Remember me?  Your 'baby brother'?

     Trying to get the drop, Pollux carefully crawls onto the
     top of the cupola.

                             POLLUX
               You tricked me into telling you
               things I never told anyone...

     Archer hears movement above him as Pollux reaches the
     crown.

                             POLLUX
               Now take it to your grave.

     Archer FIRES his PISTOL -- into the glass cupola -- and
     SHATTERS the GLASS beneath Pollux's feet.  The cupola
     disintegrates beneath his weight.  He plunges down
     into --


     ROTUNDA

     Castor watches in horror as Pollux pancakes onto the
     floor at his feet.

                             CASTOR
               Pollux...

     Pollux is almost gone.  Castor looks up and sees --


     ARCHER

     Peering down into the rotunda.


     CASTOR

     OPENS FIRE --


     ARCHER

     Ducks the bullets as he disappears.

     Castor desperately holds Pollux -- to no avail.  Pollux
     slips away... and dies.  He turns to Loomis...

                             CASTOR
               Get a medic -- now!

                             LOOMIS
               Forget him, sir.  It's only Pollux
               Troy...

     Castor snaps.  Without hesitation, he jerks up his GUN
     and PUTS a BULLET right in the middle of Loomis's
     forehead.

     Castor looks at the dead kid -- his rage barely abated
     as -- Buzz and Wanda arrive on the scene and see Loomis's 
     body.

                             WANDA
               What happened?

                             CASTOR
               What the fuck do you think
               happened?  Castor Troy just
               shot him!
                      (beat)
               What are you waiting for?  Go!

     After Buzz and Wanda take off -- Castor gathers Pollux up 
     in his arms -- totally devastated.


     INT. F.B.I - DAY

     Dazed, Castor approaches his office.  Kim proudly holds a
     copy of Time magazine.  His photo is on the cover.

                             KIM
               Sir -- you're on the cover of
               Time.  They're calling you 'An
               Authentic American Hero.'

     He just pushes by her and goes into his office.


     INT. FBI - ARCHER'S OFFICE - DAY

     Alone -- Castor picks up the framed photo of Eve and
     Jamie -- staring at it with unbridled hatred.

     Fury rising, he crumples the frame -- and the photo -- in
     his clenching grip.  He hurls it into other Archer family
     memorabilia -- shattering more photos and souvenirs.

     Only then does Castor notice Lazarro standing in the
     doorway.  For how long -- he can't be sure.

                             CASTOR
               What is it?

     Lazarro shuts the door behind him.

                             LAZARRO
               We were friends once, Jon, so I
               feel I owe it to you -- to tell
               you face-to-face...
                      (a beat)
               I don't care how much hype you're
               getting -- you're through.  After
               that massacre last night, I'm
               ordering a full inquiry into your
               recent erratic -- and deeply
               suspect -- behavior.

                             CASTOR
               Me -- 'erratic'?  Victor, what are
               you talking about?

     Castor casually closes the blinds between the offices.

                             LAZARRO
               You start meeting with Brodie and
               Miller.  Then they die
               mysteriously.  Your best friend is
               murdered -- and you don't seem to
               give a shit.
               Suddenly you're smoking, drinking,
               acting like a man with something
               to hide...
                      (beat)
               Maybe you've been bought -- maybe
               you've lost your mind.  But I
               promise... I'm going to find out.

     Eye to eye... Castor knows he can't finesse this one.

                             CASTOR
               Okay, Vic, I have a confession to
               make.  But you aren't gonna like
               it...
                      (wraps arm
                       around neck)
               I'm Castor Troy.

                             LAZARRO
               -- I don't understand...

     Castor suddenly jabs his fist into Lazarro's chest.  He
     pleads for mercy as Castor pounds and pounds away at his
     heart -- until it finally seizes up.

     Lazarro twitches in a death throe, then slumps to the
     ground.

                             CASTOR
               Now you understand.

     He punches up the intercom button.

                             CASTOR
               Cancel my four o'clock.
                      (beat)
               And send for the paramedics.
               Victor Lazarro's having a heart
               attack.

     Castor fixes himself a shot of mescal.  He checks his
     watch -- as if counting -- then kneels beside Lazarro's
     body.

     The door flies open -- and two medics rush in.  They see
     Castor vigorously pumping Lazarro's chest -- "applying"
     CPR.

     The medics gently nudge Castor aside.  One medic takes
     Lazarro's pulse, then shakes his head.


     EXT. GRIFFITH PARK OBSERVATORY - DAY

     Castor peers down over the city... trying to collect
     himself.  He lights up a smoke... planning his next move.
     His meditation is broken as a police chopper circles
     above.

                                                MATCH CUT TO:


     EXT. CITY - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY

     LAPD choppers circle... squad cars prowl... cops and FBI
     agents set up roadblocks.  The city is being sealed off.


     EXT. DOWNTOWN - BROADWAY - DAY

     Skirting a roadblock, Archer appears to be coming
     undone... wobbly, wild-eyed... he suddenly picks up a
     trash can and carries it down the street in front of his
     face.

     Pedestrians gawk at this madman.  What's he doing?

     Archer finally stops in front of a sporting goods store.
     He swings the trash can.  SMASH!  The store's WINDOW
     SHATTERS.  An ALARM BLARES.

     Passersby stare at Archer for a moment -- stunned.  Then
     several youths leap into the window and start pulling
     merchandise out of the store.

     Mayhem as others join in... clerks rush out to do battle.

     An LAPD squad car hauls up onto the curb.  A cop leaps
     out and chases as the looters scatter.

     The driver stands at his door, radio in hand.  Sensing
     something, he turns... just as Archer grabs the canister
     of Comply-Gas from the cop's belt.

     Archer sprays him in the face.  The cop gags and sags.
     Archer quickly slips behind the wheel.

     Inside:  Archer hits a switch -- the car's tinted windows 
     darken automatically, obscuring him from the outside.  He
     HITS the GAS -- SCREAMING away.


     EXT. STREET - DAY

     Archer slows the squad car.

     Up ahead:  Parked cop cars block both lanes of the main 
     road -- a roadblock checkpoint for all traffic.

     Archer pulls off the road, out of sight.  He flips open 
     the portacomp and starts to type rapidly.


     INT. FBI - DAY

     A DISPATCHER'S SCANNER CLICKS to life.

                             DISPATCHER
               All units.  I have a confirmed
               code zero-zero priority alert.
               Proceed at once to Parthenia
               Street Terminal.  That's Parthenia
               at Nordhoff.


     QUICK SHOTS

     A)  MOTOR POOL

         Tac squads pile into armored Jeeps.

     B)  HELIPORT

         Choppers lift off and veer east.

     C)  ARCHER'S HOUSE

         The surveillance CARS ROAR away.


     EXT. ROADBLOCK - DAY

     Archer watches as the checkpoint of cop cars pulls apart 
     and screams east on the main road -- passing Archer.  
     Once the armada is gone, he pulls out and heads west.


     EXT. ARCHER HOME - BACK YARD - DAY

     A plank in the fence swings aside as Archer slips into
     the yard.  He peers out from behind the garage.

     A cop sits in a lawn chair, tuning a POLICE-BAND RADIO.

     Archer approaches the bird feeder.  Quietly, he sticks
     his hand inside -- and searches for the key.

     Just when he grabs it -- CAW-CAW -- an annoying BLUEBIRD
     hovers over Archer.  The cop looks over -- but Archer is
     gone.  All Lars sees is the bird.


     INT. FBI - BULLPEN - DAY

     Castor arrives.  Wanda is shocked to see him.

                             WANDA
               Commander, what are you doing
               here?

                             CASTOR
               Where should I be?
                      (looks around)
               Where's everyone else?

                             WANDA
               Backing you up!  Didn't you track
               Castor to the Parthenia Street
               Terminal?

                             CASTOR
               What?

                             WANDA
               You radioed in your personal
               security code.  Nobody knows that
               code but you.

                             CASTOR
               Obviously someone else knows it!
               Get everybody back to their
               posts -- now!


     INT. ARCHER HOME - SUNSET

     Archer tiptoes through the house -- listening.  He sees
     Cop #2 sitting at the dining room table, cleaning his
     pistol.  He slips upstairs -- toward the sound of
     RUNNING WATER.


     MASTER BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS ACTION

     Archer walks in and steps toward the bathroom -- passing 
     the bed.  He stops.  On top of the rumpled covers:  Eve's
     nightgown and a pair of Castor's black briefs.

     Overwhelmed, he sits down -- not noticing the water has
     stopped.  Eve steps in from the bathroom.

                             ARCHER
               Eve...

     The look of horror on her face snaps him back to reality.
     She runs, but Archer grabs her.  She struggles -- 
     fighting and kicking him -- but somehow he keeps her 
     mouth covered.

                             ARCHER
               I'm not going to hurt you.  Just
               don't scream, okay?
                      (no response)
               Okay?

     Terrified -- she finally nods and he eases off her.

                             EVE
               I know you -- you're the one who
               called.  You're Castor Troy.  You
               killed my son --

                             ARCHER
               -- I called, but I'm not Castor.
               I'm your husband.

     Archer holds onto her as she struggles again.

                             ARCHER
               Now, you're going to listen.  The
               last time we saw each other -- was
               in this room.  We had a fight
               after I told you I had to go away.
                      (a beat)
               My assignment -- Jon Archer's
               assignment -- was to enter a
               federal prison as Castor Troy.

     Eve is startled by this intimate information but she 
     reveals nothing.  SIRENS approach the house, the cops are 
     returning.  She keeps an eye on the door.  Playing for 
     time.

                             EVE
               How did he expect to do that?

                             ARCHER
               An F.B.I. surgeon gave me Castor's
               face.  He handled the transplant,
               the vocal implant, everything.
               But somehow Castor came out of his
               coma -- and killed everyone who
               knew about the mission.  But not
               before he was transformed into me.

     The back DOOR CLICKS open.  A voice booms out.

                             COP (O.S.)
               Dr. Archer, are you okay?

                             ARCHER
               If you need hard evidence, get it.
               Your husband's blood type is O
               negative.  Castor's is A.B.

     Archer glances at the balcony -- as FOOTSTEPS CLOMP up 
     the stairs.  Eve is about to answer -- or scream.  But 
     then...

                             ARCHER
               Remember the parachute dream?  I'm
               falling, Eve... I'm falling...

     The blood drains from her face as... Archer slips over 
     the balcony and disappears.


     INT. STUDY - LATER

     Eve is at the computer -- dazed and disoriented.  She
     snaps alert on hearing the front DOOR OPEN -- Castor is
     giving orders to the cops guarding the house.

                             CASTOR (O.S.)
               I want you guys here around-the-
               clock.  And stay off the lawn.

     Eve feigns interest in her laptop as Castor enters.  She
     tenses as he starts massaging her back.

                             CASTOR
               You're all in knots.  Maybe
               another date night will help you
               relax...

                             EVE
               Not tonight... I'm way behind in
               my Continuing Ed.

     He studies Eve, then grasps her firmly by the shoulders.

                             CASTOR
               You think I've been acting
               strange.  Like a completely
               different person.

                             EVE
               -- Yes.

                             CASTOR
               Okay, I have a confession to make.
               But you aren't going to like it...

     Castor wraps his hands around her slender neck...

                             CASTOR (cont'd)
               ... I read your diary.  I've been
               trying to change -- trying to be
               more like the man you want me to
               be.

     Eve reacts to the explanation.  There is a logic to it.

                             CASTOR
               And to prove it, I'm taking you
               and Jamie away on a trip -- right
               after the memorial service.

                             EVE
               What memorial service?

                             CASTOR
               Victor Lazarro had a heart
               seizure... right in my office.  It
               was horrible...

                             EVE
               Oh, my God...

     Castor pours it on -- feigning immense grief.

                             CASTOR
               First Tito... now Victor...
                      (holds her tight)
               ... please don't tell me I'm going
               to lose you, too...

                             EVE
                      (returns the embrace)
               Of course not.


     INT. ARCHER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Castor slumbers fitfully.  Suddenly, his shoulder
     twitches, rousing him.  He looks up to find Eve reading
     beside him.

                             CASTOR
               What was that?

                             EVE
               What was what?

                             CASTOR
               Something bit me.

                             EVE
               Probably a mosquito -- I'll close
               the window.

     Eve rubs Castor's shoulder blade until he falls asleep.  
     She gets up, closes the window, then goes into the
     bathroom.


     INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

     Eve takes a breath, then produces a lancet from her
     pocket.  She squeezes the lancet -- and a drop of blood
     splashes into a glass vial -- Castor's blood.


     EXT. ARCHER HOME - NIGHT

     As Eve gets the key in her car door -- a hand grabs her.
     She stifles a scream -- then sees... the two COPS.

                             COP
               Sorry, Dr. Archer.  Where are you
               going at this hour?

                             EVE
               There's been an emergency at the
               hospital.

                             COP
               One of us will have to escort you.

                             EVE
               Fine...
                      (a beat)
               But please don't wake my
               husband... he's exhausted.


     EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

     Nothing happening here at 4 A.M.  Nothing indeed.  The
     bored Cop keeps watch outside -- as Eve hustles in.


     INT. HOSPITAL - EVE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     Eve paces anxiously as the BLOOD ANALYZER CLICKS away.

                             EVE
               Please be O-neg.  Please...

     The MACHINE STOPS CLICKING.  It reads "Male -- Type AB."  
     She buries her face in her hands -- completely stunned.

                             ARCHER (O.S.)
               Thanks for believing me.

     Archer emerges from the darkness of her office -- but Eve
     pulls a pistol -- aiming it with calm authority.

                             ARCHER
               What are you doing?  Where did you
               get that gun?

                             EVE
               I took it from my fake husband.

                             ARCHER
               Why point it at me?  I'm the real
               thing.

                             EVE
               I don't know that.  Maybe Jon's
               already dead.

                             ARCHER
               What more proof do you need?

                             EVE
               Tell me... tell me about the all-
               night dentist.

     As Archer speaks -- Eve searches his eyes for the truth.

                             ARCHER
               ... I took a date out for chicken
               and ribs -- not knowing she was a
               vegetarian.  When the night
               couldn't get worse, she broke
               her tooth on a pebble that got
               into her three-bean salad
               Somehow she and I had fun driving
               around looking for an all-night
               dentist...
                      (a beat)
               And even though it must have hurt
               -- you still kissed me.

     Eve slowly puts the gun down, fighting off tears.

                             EVE
               Christ, Jon!  How could you put us
               in this position?  Do you know --
               do you know what he did to me...?

                             ARCHER
               Whatever happened, whatever he did
               -- I know it's my fault and I know
               I can never make it up to you --

     She pulls herself together -- regaining her composure.

                             EVE
               But you're damn well going to try.
                      (a beat)
               First -- how are we going to get
               you out of this?


     INT. ARCHER HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Castor wakes up and finds Eve gone.  His eyes narrow as
     he touches the mosquito bite -- the one that isn't there.


     INT. HOSPITAL - EVE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     Eve sifts through the supply cabinet and finds a yellow
     vial.

                             EVE
               This will knock him out for hours.

                             ARCHER
               Good.  What's his schedule
               tomorrow?

                             EVE
               He doesn't tell me anymore than
               you ever did... All I know is --
               tomorrow we're going to Victor's
               memorial service.

                             ARCHER
               Victor... Tito... they both died
               thinking I killed them... And in a
               way... I did.

                             EVE
               Jon -- you can't think about that
               now.

     Archer takes a breath -- and pulls himself together.

                             ARCHER
               -- What happens after the memorial?

                             EVE
               He's taking Jamie and me away.

                             ARCHER
               And neither of you will be coming
               back.  Where's the service?

                             EVE
               Saint Mary's-By-The-Sea.

     Archer reacts... the irony's not lost on him.

                             EVE
               What are you going to do?

                             ARCHER
               Hit him with a trank dart.  Once
               he's unconscious -- I'll try to
               get to Buzz and Wanda before the
               security team gets to me.

                             EVE
               What else can I do?

                             ARCHER
               Think up a good excuse.  I don't
               want you or Jamie anywhere near
               that service.

                             EVE
               I can cover for Jamie.  But if I'm
               not there, he'll suspect
               something...
                      (as Archer
                       considers)
               The second you make your move, all
               hell's going to break loose.  If
               I'm there beside him -- I can take
               charge.  I'm his wife, remember?
                      (a beat)
               There's no way around it -- for
               once, you need me.

     Archer looks into her eyes -- the regrets flooding over.

                             ARCHER
               I've always needed you...

     They embrace... soaking up each other's warmth.

                             EVE
               Jon -- what are the odds?

                             ARCHER
               Terrible.  But it's the best we
               can do with what we have.
                      (a beat)
               If it doesn't happen, take Jamie
               and don't look back...

                             EVE
               It'll happen.

     FOOTSTEPS APPROACH -- they break their embrace.

                             ARCHER
               Do doctors travel in packs?

                             EVE
               Only when we're golfing.


     INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

     Castor and the twins round the bend -- just in time to
     see the door to the burn ward close.


     INT. BURN WARD - NIGHT

     Eve quickly wraps gauze around a patient's head -- when
     Castor and his boys rush in, guns leveled.

                             EVE
               Jon!  What are you doing here?

                             CASTOR
               That's what you're going to
               explain to me.

                             EVE
               Didn't the police tell you?  There
               was an emergency.

     Lars starts pulling at the patient's bandages.

                             EVE
               Jon -- stop it!  Mr. Alandro is
               very ill!

                             CASTOR
               Not as ill as he's going to be...

     He blanches as Lars reveals a scarred burn victim -- Mr.
     Alandro.  Eve is livid as she attends to the patient.

                             CASTOR
               Sorry.  But what's a guy to think
               when his wife runs off in the
               middle of the night?

                             EVE
               It's my fault.  I should've woken
               you up before I left.
                      (kisses him)
               Now please let me get back to
               work.

     They leave.  Eve wipes his ugly taste from her mouth.


     EXT. HOSPITAL PARKING LOT - DAWN

     Castor gets into his car as he confabs with the twins.

                             CASTOR
               Stay here.  Watch her like a hawk.

                             LARS
               Think she knows?

                             CASTOR
               Who cares?  She's going to be dead
               by tonight anyway.  They're all
               going to be dead.  The wife, the
               kid... and the father.


     EXT. OLD RANCH - HIGH GRASS - DAY

     Archer waits as Sasha appears with a long case.  In the
     b.g., Adam plays on the Ranch House porch with Dietrich.

                             ARCHER
               How's the boy?

                             SASHA
               His ears are still ringing -- but
               he'll be okay.

     Archer opens the case.  Inside is a sniper rifle.

                             SASHA
               The truck's all gassed up.
               Look, Caz, there'll be F.B.I.
               agents all over that place.  Maybe
               I can talk my brother into helping
               us.

                             ARCHER
               'Us'?  No, Sasha -- believe me,
               this isn't your fight.

     He turns to leave -- but her look draws him back.  He
     kisses her -- not passionately, but nobly.

                             ARCHER
               Thanks...

     She watches him as he walks off toward the truck.


     EXT. ARCHER'S HOME - DAY

     Dressed in staid black, Eve joins Castor at the limo.

                             CASTOR
               Where's Jamie?

                             EVE
               That's what I'd like to know.  She
               stole fifty dollars from my purse
               and took off.

     Castor's eyes narrow -- trying to read Eve.

                             EVE
               Don't act so stunned, Jon.  You
               know how hard it is to get that
               girl into a dress.

                             CASTOR
               I'll deal with her later.

                             EVE
               Good.  Because I am fed up.


     EXT. ST. MARY'S-BY-THE-SEA - DAY

     A crucifix gleams in the sun... and anchoring the
     crucifix is... a headstone.

     Like so many others -- except this headstone is Matthew
     Archer's.  And hidden behind it is -- Jon Archer.  He
     finishes assembling the sniper rifle.

     For a moment he acknowledges Matthew's grave... the
     regrets giving way to determination.  He looks down from
     his vantage point onto --


     EXT. SEA-SIDE - DAY

     At the foot of the cemetery knoll.  Rows of chairs...
     white flowers... mourners.  A yacht is docked at the
     breakwater.

     INTERCUT WITH:


     ARCHER'S POV THROUGH SCOPE

     peers down through scope -- seeing...

     Castor and Eve as they emerge from their limo.

     Eve glances around, searching for Archer.  She comes eye-
     to-eye with Lars -- who is watching her every move.

     Archer TRACKS Castor and Eve as they sit in the front
     row.  The ceremony begins.

                             PRIEST
               We are here to celebrate the life
               of Victor Lazarro.  We all know
               him as a man who dedicated himself
               to defending this great nation --
               first, as a highly decorated
               admiral -- then, as west coast
               director of the F.B.I.  But not
               all of you know what a deeply
               spiritual man he was.  It was his
               wish that his Requiem Mass be
               performed in Latin.
                      (a beat)
               In Nomine Patris, et Filii et
               Spiritus Sancti.  Amen...

     The PRIEST begins to recite a beautiful and somber mass.


     ARCHER

     fills the trank-dart with sedative.


     PRIEST

     continues the solemn ritual.

                             PRIEST
               Domine, de morte aeterna, in
               die illa tremenda quando caeli
               movendi sunt et terra...


     EVE

     checks her watch... barely lifting her eyes away...

     Castor absently pats her knee.  She's forced to return
     focus to the service.


     ARCHER

     chambers the dart, twists a knob on the range-finder, and
     carefully peers over the crucifix.


     THROUGH SCOPE

     Archer TRACKS THROUGH the mourners -- and FINDS Castor.
     As the cross-hairs neatly cube his head...


     BACK TO SCENE

     We've come full circle from Matthew's death:  with Archer
     the sniper and Castor the target.

     The Priest's emotional reciting of the rites climaxes.

                             PRIEST
               Requiem aeternam dona eis,
               Domine... Amen.


     FULL SCREEN - TRIGGER

     Archer's finger wraps around -- he starts to squeeze...


     POV THROUGH SCOPE - FIGURE

     crosses behind Castor, blocking Archer's shot.  Archer's
     finger freezes -- as the figure turns -- hair tumbling
     away from her face.  It's Jamie.


     AT SERVICE

     Eve stiffens as Jamie sits down.

                             JAMIE
               Thanks anyway, Mom --
                      (slides her $50)
               But I wanted to be here for you...
               and Dad.

     Castor reads the panic on Eve's face, but says nothing.

     He simply takes Jamie's hand, intertwining his fingers in
     hers.

     The honor guard steps forward, shouldering their rifles,
     commencing their 21-GUN SALUTE as --


     ARCHER

     steadies himself, re-aims the sniper rifle.

     He hears MOTION behind him.  Someone's coming and fast...
     but this is his only chance.  Off-balance, Archer
     squeezes --

     THFFFT!  The SILENCED TRANK-DART explodes from the
     barrel.


     FOLLOW DART

     Screaming toward Castor's neck -- but it goes just wide.
     It sinks harmlessly into the grass -- unnoticed during
     the 21-GUN SALUTE.


     ON KNOLL

     THUMP!  Archer is cracked across the head.  He slumps
     down, unconscious, as a silenced gun barrel gently enters
     his ear.  As the saluting GUNS FIRE in the b.g. -- we
     don't know when, or if, this pistol fires...


     AT SEA-SIDE SERVICE

     The honor guard presents the urn to Mrs. Lazarro.
     Fearful, Eve chances a glance around -- wondering what's
     gone wrong.

                             PRIEST
               The admiral's family will now take
               his ashes to the sea...

     As Mrs. Lazarro and her grown children proceed to the
     docked yacht, Castor touches his ear-phone...
     getting a message.

     His eyes alight on a boathouse... adjacent to the
     service.

                             CASTOR
                      (into headset)
               Lars -- take Jamie, bring the car
               around, then meet us at that
               boathouse...

     Guests head for their cars.  Eve seizes the moment and
     steps over to Wanda and Buzz.

                             EVE
               Wanda -- I need to talk to you.

                             WANDA
                      (reads her face)
               Sure... what's wrong?

     But then Eve looks past Wanda -- and sees Lars looking at
     her -- tightening his "friendly" grip on Jamie's
     shoulder.

                             EVE
               Never mind --

                             CASTOR
               Come on, baby.  I've got a
               surprise for you.

     Wanda and Buzz watch as they head up toward the
     boathouse.


     INT. BOATHOUSE - DAY

     Dim, deserted.  Filled with boat parts, tools, etc.
     Castor hustles Eve inside and locks the door behind him.

     Lunt is there -- standing over a beaten Archer.  Eve
     gasps.

                             CASTOR
               Look who we caught creeping around
               -- Castor Troy.

                             EVE
               Why is he here?

                             CASTOR
               Before I turn him in, I thought
               we'd pay him back for everything
               he's put us through...

     Castor starts kicking Archer.  Over and over in the gut.

                             CASTOR
               Come on, baby.  Join the fun --

     Eve can't stand it.  She charges Castor -- but he
     immediately subdues her.

                             CASTOR
               Too bad.  Part of me was hoping
               you didn't know.

     He throws her down beside Archer.  She clings to him.

                             CASTOR
               Did you really think it would be
               that easy, you dumb fucks?
                      (to Eve)
               Sorry, baby.  Castor Troy is about
               to murder you and our daughter...
               but I promise you won't die
               unavenged.

                             ARCHER
               This is between you and me.  Leave
               them out of this.

                             CASTOR
               It was between you and me.  Even
               your little boy -- that wasn't
               supposed to happen.  But you
               couldn't let it go.

                             ARCHER
               No father could.

                             CASTOR
               Appealing to my sense of 'family'
               won't work, Jon.  I thought you
               knew me better than that

     Archer plays for time -- looking for some edge.  He sees
     a crate filled with block-and-tackle amid the shop's
     tools.

                             ARCHER
               I know some things that even you
               don't know, Caz.  You have a son.
               I've met him.  His name is Adam...

                             CASTOR
               I imagine I've got a dozen kids --
               so what?
                      (cocks pistol)
               No more head games... First your
               wife dies.  Then your daughter.
               Then you.

     Castor smiles as the DOOR CREAKS open.

                             CASTOR
               Just one big happy family...

     But it's not Jamie and Lars.  Three people emerge from
     the shadows, machine pistols poised.

                             CASTOR
               Dietrich -- Aldo -- Sasha?

                             DIETRICH
               That's right, Archer.  Now drop
               'em.

     No options.  Castor and Lunt drop their weapons.


     EXT. BOATHOUSE - SIDE ENTRANCE - DAY

     Lars and Jamie pull up in the car.  Lars listens to his
     headset -- knows something is wrong.

                             LARS
               Don't fucking move...


     INT. BOATHOUSE - DAY

     Sasha's at Archer's side.

                             SASHA
               Caz -- are you okay?

                             CASTOR
               You're making a mistake.  I'm
               Castor -- he's Archer.  Sasha,
               baby -- just give me a minute to
               explain!

                             SASHA
               That's pathetic, Archer.  But
               then, your terrible sense of humor
               is legendary.

                             ALDO
                      (cocks GUN)
               It's pay-back time.

     Aldo aims at Castor when BOOM!  He's blown apart.

     Lars charges in -- BLASTING.

     Archer grabs a block-and-tackle as --

     Lunt dives for Aldo's fallen machine-pistol.  Archer
     swings the block-and-tackle -- whacking Lunt across the
     head.

     Castor scoops up his pistol but Eve kicks him hard in the
     balls.  He doubles over.

     Archer snatches away the MACHINE PISTOL.  Staggered --
     Lunt is quickly riddled by Dietrich.

     Castor and Lars BLAZE at the now-scattering intruders --
     driving them back amid the shot's tools and drums.

                             ARCHER
               Find Jamie!

     Eve crawls through the FUSILLADE toward the exit.


     EXT. MEMORIAL SERVICE - DAY

     Among the last to leave -- Buzz and Wanda snap alert.
     Over the CRASHING of the WAVES -- did Wanda hear
     something?


     EXT. BOATHOUSE - DAY

     Eve rushes to the car -- it's empty.  Jamie is gone.

                             EVE
               Jamie?  Jamie!

     BULLETS SHRED the WINDOWS behind her.


     INT. BOATHOUSE - DAY

     During the GUN BATTLE -- we INTERCUT the deaths of
     Dietrich, Lars and Sasha WITH:


     EXT. SEA - LAZARRO'S ASHES

     being scattered at sea.

     Castor and Lars RIDDLE Sasha.  She drops.  Archer FIRES
     back -- killing Lars and driving Castor back.

     Archer leans beside the mortally-wounded Sasha.

                             SASHA
               ... Help Adam... don't let him end
               up like us...

     She dies in his arms.  Wounded, Dietrich crawls over.
     Seeing his sister, Dietrich rises in horror...

                             DIETRICH
               Sasha -- !

     BOOM BOOM BOOM!  Castor wastes Dietrich.  Archer BLASTS
     back -- driving Castor outside.  Archer pursues.


     EXT. MEMORIAL SERVICE - DAY

     Eve runs smack into Wanda and Buzz -- they're on the run.

                             WANDA
               We heard gunshots --

                             EVE
               Wanda, I've got to tell you
               something.  Something crazy...


     EXT. BOATHOUSE YARD - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY

     Archer emerges into the maze of dry-docked boats.
     Silently checking his clip, he discards the empty gun.

     Castor moves stealthily through the narrow paths.
     Hearing a NOISE behind him --

     BOOM!  Castor FIRES -- blowing apart an under-repair
     hull.  He advances toward the boat, gun ready, when
     Archer appears behind him and follows -- one step, two
     steps -- until --

     Castor stops -- then whirls as Archer leaps.

     The men collapse hard.  Castor's pistol clatters across
     the yard toward the docked boat.

     Archer and Castor brutally strangle each other -- digging
     their fingers deep into their throats.  They throttle
     each other so hard, Archer's larynx vocal chip is
     dislodged.

     His VOICE CHANGES, ECHOING with garbled.  STATIC.

                             ARCHER
               Give up, Castor.  People are going
               to find out.

                             CASTOR
               Not if I kill you first.

     They scramble for the gun -- but a hand reaches out from
     the docked boat and picks it up.  Archer and Castor stop
     dead in their tracks because --

     Jamie appears, holding the pistol.

                             CASTOR
               Give it here, Jamie.

                             ARCHER
               No, Jamie.  Don't do it!

     Everybody gawks -- because Archer and Castor are now...

     Both speaking in Archer's true voice.

     And nobody is more confused than Jamie.

                             ARCHER
               Listen to my voice, Jamie.  I'm
               your father.

                             CASTOR
               It's a trick, Jamie.  I'm your
               father.

     Jamie swings the gun back and forth -- baffled.

                             CASTOR
               Shoot him, Jamie.

                             ARCHER
               Jamie...

                             CASTOR
               Shoot him!

     Jamie FIRES.  Archer reels -- as a slug grazes his
     shoulder.  Castor snatches the PISTOL from Jamie's hand.

                             CASTOR
               You dunce.  No kid of mine would
               miss so badly.

     He aims the gun at Archer's head.

                             WANDA (O.S.)
               Hold it.

     Wanda and Buzz have burst onto the terrace -- their guns
     leveled.  Eve and more agents are right behind.

                             CASTOR
               Just saving the taxpayers the cost
               of a trial.  So take a hike.

                             WANDA
               You're both under arrest until a
               D.N.A. test proves who's who.

                             CASTOR
               I'm ordering you to back off!

     Several agents waver -- unsure.  But not Wanda and Buzz.

                             WANDA
               Put the gun down --

                             BUZZ
               -- Now!

                             CASTOR
                      (beat)
               Can't blame me for trying.

     He grabs a shocked Jamie -- shoving the gun under her
     chin.

     Archer struggles to his feet as --

     Castor -- using Jamie as a shield -- backs out the gate
     to the garden.  Archer follows -- cautiously.

                             CASTOR
               Say goodbye to Daddy --

     Jamie whips out the switchblade -- sinks it into Castor's
     thigh and twists.  She dives away.  FIRING wildly, Castor
     staggers back through the gate.

                             CASTOR (O.S.)
               You ungrateful delinquent!


     OUTSIDE GATE


     As Castor turns and staggers away -- he runs smack into a
     confused security agent.

                             CASTOR
               Give me your weapon -- now!

     The agent hands over his UZI -- and Castor PLUGS him.


     BOATYARD

     Archer and Eve make sure Jamie's okay.

                             JAMIE
                      (to Archer)
               Who are you?  Will someone please
               tell me what's going on?

     Archer rushes to the gate and hauls it open.


     CASTOR

     limps away from the boatyard, towards the slips -- alive
     with sunbathers and yachters.


     EXT. MARINA DOCKS - DAY

     Castor hustles along until he finds what he's looking
     for --

     Twin Cigarette BOATS -- racing boats -- being TUNED UP by
     their suntanned crews.  He jumps into one of the boats.

                             BOAT CAPTAIN
               Hey -- !

     Without even looking, Castor SHOOTS the guy dead.  In a
     flash -- Castor THROTTLES up the BOAT.  He sees --


     CASTOR'S POV

     Archer running down the dock toward the adjoining boat.


     CASTOR

     FIRES -- peppering the dock.

     Archer knocks the boat owner to safety -- as the BAIT
     HOUSE BLOWS UP behind him.  Archer rolls into the boat --
     FIRING.

     Castor's hit!  A slug grazes his shoulder.  He grabs the
     THROTTLE -- taking off.


     ARCHER

     FIRES UP the second BOAT -- in pursuit.  Castor BLASTS
     back -- SHATTERING Archer's BOAT COMPASS.


     CIVILIAN BOAT

     speeds toward him -- causing a near-miss.


     ANOTHER ANGLE

     Running parallel, Archer and Castor BLAST at EACH OTHER
     at point-blank range.  Their boats smash and pound each
     other.

     A police boat closes in on them.

     Castor FIRES at the police -- obliterating both crew and
     boat.  The POLICE BOAT'S rear SMASHES into Archer's
     craft.

     Archer's BOAT plows up and through the other.  EXPLOSION!
     Momentum carries Archer across -- and back into the
     water.

     The boat lands right next to Castor's.

     Archer and Castor resume their battering... approaching
     a --


     TUG

     pulling a barge.

     Castor forces Archer into its path.  At the last
     moment...

     Archer leaps onto the bow of Castor's boat as --

     KA-BOOM!  Archer's boat crashes into the BARGE which
     EXPLODES.


     CASTOR

     swerves wildly -- trying to throw Archer off.

     Archer can only watch as Castor reaches for another clip.

     But the boat hits a wave...

     Castor loses the gun -- which skids away.  Archer slips,
     his head hanging over the side.  Castor tries to ram
     Archer, but he pulls himself up just in time.

     Castor grabs the anchor -- swings it.  WHUNK!  It sinks
     into the deck beside Archer -- but the chain is around
     his neck.

     As Castor tries to strangle him -- Archer headbutts
     Castor, who reels -- snagging his leg around the chain.
     Castor falls back -- plunging toward the water.

     Archer tries to hold Castor up... as the boat speeds
     toward --


     PIER

     Archer yanks Castor back onto the deck as the BOAT
     BOUNCES OFF the pier pilings.  But as they slug it out...


     ANOTHER ANGLE

     WHAM!  The BOAT careens off a piling -- and ROARS
     straight for the shipyard.  COLLIDING with a shoreline
     obstruction --

     The BOAT FLIPS, stern over bow...

     Archer and Castor go flying... onto the beach.


     EXT. BEACH - DAY

     Archer and Castor lie dazed... then stir.  Castor sees
     the pistol lying half-buried... he reaches for it.
     But --

     Archer gets it first.  He aims it at Castor as they rise.

                             CASTOR
               You won't shoot me, Jon.  I'm
               unarmed...

                             ARCHER
               Okay, I have a confession to
               make... but you aren't gonna like
               it... You're right, I won't shoot
               you.  Not in the face anyway.

     BOOM -- Archer SHOOTS Castor in the chest!  He jerks and
     reels -- dropping to his knees.  He looks at Archer in
     total disbelief.  Then he sinks to the ground and lies
     still.

     Exhausted, Archer lets the empty gun drop.  Then he turns
     and sees an FBI chopper heading his way.  Relieved, he
     turns back to Castor, but -- Castor's body is gone!

     Castor is crawling toward the flipped boat's spinning
     stabilizing screw.  Archer FIRES -- hitting Castor in the
     leg.  He buckles... but keeps going.

     Archer leaps on him -- they struggle as Castor tries to
     bury his face on the spinning blade.

                             CASTOR
               It'll never be over, Jon... every
               time you look in the mirror...
               you'll see my face...

     They struggle as the propeller blade. gets closer,
     closer -- slicing into "Archer's" cheek.  At the last
     instant...

     Archer reaches the anchor-chain.  He wraps it around the
     screw -- stopping the whirling blades.

     Castor finally sinks to the ground -- and no longer
     moves.

     Archer takes Castor's hand -- trying to tug off his
     wedding ring.  Just when he almost has it off -- Castor
     suddenly grabs Archer's wrist and holds it tight.

     Eye contact between the two men.  Castor smirks, his
     grasp slackening... as he finally fades away.  Archer
     lets Castor's hand drop, then slides the ring on his own
     finger.


     ANOTHER ANGLE

     The chopper lands.  Buzz and Wanda rush over.

                             BUZZ
               You okay, Archer?

                             ARCHER
               What did you call me?

                             WANDA
               He called you 'Archer' -- sir.

     Archer finally realizes -- they actually mean him.  He
     smiles -- Jon Archer's long lost smile.


     EXT. SHIPYARD - SUNSET

     FBI med-teams strap Archer onto a gurney.  Castor's inert
     body is beside him.

                             EVE
               Hang on, Jon... they're bringing
               in their top surgical team from
               D.C...

                             ARCHER
                      (re:  Castor)
               How is he?

                             EVE
               No life signs at all.  He's a
               turnip.

                             ARCHER
               That's what they always say...

     He passes out as the FBI medics load him onto the med-
     evac chopper.  Wanda prevents Eve from climbing aboard.

                             WANDA
               I'm sorry, Eve.  You can't come.
                      (to Buzz)
               Take her home.

                             EVE
               But he's my husband!

                             WANDA
               But he works for us.

     Wanda gets on the med-evac chopper; it lifts off, leaving
     a furious Eve and a confused Jamie behind.

                             JAMIE
               Will Dad be Dad again?

                             EVE
               I hope so, honey.

                             JAMIE
               And you guys say my life is
               screwed up...

     In the swirl of dust, they watch the chopper fly away.


     INT. ARCHER'S HOUSE - DAY

     Maybe days, maybe weeks later -- no way to tell.  Eve is
     at the dining room table, catching up on medical reports.

     Sensing something, she looks up and sees a silhouette at
     the front screen door -- a man's silhouette.

                             ARCHER (O.S.)
               Hello, Eve.

     Pulse pounding, Eve frantically pushes open the door to
     glimpse the face of the man with Archer's voice.

     It's Jon Archer.  Eve stares -- then touches his face
     carefully, tenderly -- around the tiny residual scar.
     Then, she pulls him tight -- holding on for dear life.

                             JAMIE (O.S.)
               Dad?

     Jamie is there.  Archer smiles -- gently, almost sadly --
     with a softness and genuineness that Castor Troy could
     never feel, could never fake.

     She rushes to him.  The whole family hangs on, hugging
     and kissing -- for the first time ever, really together.

                             JAMIE
               I'm sorry I shot you, Dad.  Am I
               grounded?

     Archer smiles and holds her tighter.  But as they draw
     Archer inside, he hesitates.

                             ARCHER
               I have something to ask you -- to
               ask both of you...

     He steps aside -- revealing Castor's son.

                             ARCHER
               This is Adam.  He needs a place to
               live... just for a little while.

     Eve looks at Archer -- she sees what this means to him
     and, what the hell, there's plenty of time now to talk.


     EXT. ARCHER'S HOME - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY

     As the family heads inside, the door closes, shutting us
     out.

                                                DISSOLVE TO:


     INT. MATTHEW'S OLD ROOM - NIGHT

     Archer gives Adam an old teddy bear -- rocking the child
     until he finally drifts off into dreamland.


     INT. JAMIE'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Archer watches Jamie sleep.  He draws the comforter over
     her -- she stirs, and pulls it in tighter.


     INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Eve gets undressed... waiting for Archer.

                             EVE
               How was your first day back?

     No reply... Eve hears WATER RUNNING.  She approaches
     Archer, who's bent over the sink, washing his face.

                             EVE
               Jon?

     Archer stands up -- revealing Castor's face in the
     bathroom mirror.  Eve chokes back a scream.

     Archer turns and faces her -- with his true face.  He
     sees her terrified expression, turns back to the mirror
     -- and sees his own face looking at him.  But he
     understands.

     He embraces Eve... holds her tight.  She responds, happy
     to have him home again.  We STAY ON his familiar smile
     and...

                                                FADE OUT.




                              THE END
FARGO

 

                                   FARGO
                              a screenplay by
                                Ethan Coen
                                    and
                                 Joel Coen

	The following text fades in over black:

	This is a true story. The events depicted in this film took place
	in Minnesota in 1987. At the request of the survivors, the names
	have been changed. Out of respect for the dead, the rest has been
	told exactly as it occured.

	FLARE TO WHITE

	FADE IN FROM WHITE

	Slowly the white becomes a barely perceptible image:  white
	particles wave over a white background.  A snowfall.

	A car bursts through the curtain of snow.

	The car is equipped with a hitch and is towing another car,
	a brand-new light brown Cutlass Ciera with the pink sales
	sticker showing in its rear window.

	As the car roars past, leaving snow swirling in their dirft,
	the title of the film fades in.

				FARGO

	Green highway signs point the way to MOOREHEAD,
	MINNESOTA/FARGO, NORTH DAKOTA.  The roads for the two cities
	diverge.  A sign says WELCOME TO NORTH DAKOTA and another
	just after says NOW ENTERING FARGO, ND, POP. 44,412.

	The car pulls into a Rodeway Inn.

	HOTEL LOBBY

	A man in his early forties, balding and starting to paunch,
	goes to the reception desk.  The clerk is an older woman.

				CLERK
		And how are you today, sir?

				MAN
		Real good now.  I'm checking in
		- Mr. Anderson.

	The man prints "Jerry Lundega" onto a registration card,
	then hastily crosses out the last name and starts to print
	"Anderson."

	As she types into a computer:

				CLERK
		Okay, Mr. Anderson, and you're
		still planning on staying with
		us just the night, then?

				ANDERSON
		You bet.

	HOTEL ROOM

	The man turns on the TV, which shows the local evening news.

				NEWS ANCHOR
		- whether they will go to summer
		camp at all.  Katie Jensen has
		more.

				KATIE
		It was supposed to be a project
		funded by the city council;  it
		was supposed to benefit those
		Fargo-Moorehead children who
		would otherwise not be able to
		afford to attend a lakeshore
		summer camp.  But nobody consulted
		city controller Stu Jacobson...

	CHAIN RESTAURANT

	Anderson sits alone at a table finishing dinner.  Muzak
	plays.  A middle-aged waitress approaches holding a pot of
	regular coffee in one hand and decaf in the other.

				WAITRESS
		Can I warm that up for ya there?

				ANDERSON
		You bet.

	The man looks at his watch.

	THROUGH A WINDSHIELD

	We are pulling into the snowswept parking lot of a one-story
	brick building.  Broken neon at the top of the building
	identifies it as the Jolly Troll Tavern.  A troll, also in
	neon, holds a champagne glass aloft.

	INSIDE

	The bar is downscale even for this town.  Country music
	plays on the jukebox.

	Two men are seated in a booth at the back.  One is short,
	slight, youngish.  The other man is somewhat older, and
	dour.  The table in front of them is littered with empty
	long-neck beer bottles.  The ashtray is full.

	Anderson approaches.

				ANDERSON
		I'm, uh, Jerry Lundegaard -

				YOUNGER MAN
		You're Jerry Lundegaard?

				JERRY
		Yah, Shep Proudfoot said -

				YOUNGER MAN
		Shep said you'd be here at 7:30.
		What gives, man?

				JERRY
		Shep said 8:30.

				YOUNGER MAN
		We been sitting here an hour.
		I've peed three times already.

				JERRY
		I'm sure sorry.  I - Shep told
		me 8:30.  It was a mix-up, I
		guess.

				YOUNGER MAN
		Ya got the car?

				JERRY
		Yah, you bet.  It's in the lot
		there.  Brand-new burnt umber
		Ciera.

				YOUNGER MAN
		Yeah, okay.  Well, siddown then.
		I'm Carl Showalter and this is
		my associate Gaear Grimsrud.

				JERRY
		Yah, how ya doin'.  So, uh, we
		all set on this thing, then?

				YOUNGER MAN
		Sure, Jerry, we're all set.  Why
		wouldn't we be?

				JERRY
		Yah, no, I'm sure you are.  Shep
		vouched for you and all.  I got
		every confidence in you fellas.

	They stare at him.  An awkward beat.

				JERRY
		...  So I guess that's it, then.
		Here's the keys -

				CARL
		No, that's not it, Jerry.

				JERRY
		Huh?

				CARL
		The new vehicle, plus forty
		thousand dollars.

				JERRY
		Yah, but the deal was, the car
		first, see, then the forty
		thousand, like as if it was the
		ransom.  I thought Shep told you -

				CARL
		Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry.

				JERRY
		Well, okay, it's -

				CARL
		Except that you were gonna be
		here at 7:30.

				JERRY
		Yah, well, that was a mix-up, then.

				CARL
		Yeah, you already said that.

				JERRY
		Yah.  But it's not a whole pay-
		in-advance deal.  I give you a
		brand-new vehicle in advance and -

				CARL
		I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.

				JERRY
		Okay.

				CARL
		I'm not gonna sit here and debate.
		I will say this though:  what Shep
		told us didn't make a whole lot
		of sense.

				JERRY
		Oh, no, it's real sound.  It's
		all worked out.

				CARL
		You want your own wife kidnapped?

				JERRY
		Yah.

	Carl Stares.  Jerry looks blankly back.

				CARL
		...  You - my point is, you pay
		the ransom - what eighty thousand
		bucks? -  I mean, you give us
		half the ransom, forty thousand,
		you keep half.  It's like robbing
		Peter to play Paul, it doesn't
		make any -

				JERRY
		Okay, it's - see, it's not me
		payin' the ransom.  The thing is,
		my wife, she's wealthy - her dad,
		he's real well off.  Now, I'm in
		a bit of trouble -

				CARL
		What kind of trouble are you in,
		Jerry?

				JERRY
		Well, that's, that's, I'm not go
		inta, inta - see, I just need
		money.  Now, her dad's real
		wealthy -

				CARL
		So why don't you just ask him
		for the money?

	Grimsrud, the dour man who has not yet spoken, now softly
	puts in with a Swedish-accented voice:

				GRIMSRUD
		Or your fucking wife, you know.

				CARL
		Or your fucking wife, Jerry.

				JERRY
		Well, it's all just part of this -
		they don't know I need it, see.
		Okay, so there's that.  And even
		if they did, I wouldn't get it.
		So there's that on top, then.  See,
		these're personal matters.

				CARL
		Personal matters.

				JERRY
		Yah.  Personal matters that
		needn't, uh -

				CARL
		Okay, Jerry.  You're tasking us
		to perform this mission, but you,
		you won't, uh, you won't - aw,
		fuck it, let's take a look at
		that Ciera.

	MINNEAPOLIS SUBURBAN HOUSE

	Jerry enters through the kitchen door, in a parka and a red
	plaid Elmer Fudd hat.  He stamps snow off his feet.  He is
	carrying a bag of groceries which he deposits on the kitchen
	counter.

				JERRY
		Hon?  Got the growshries.

				VOICE
		Thank you, hon.  How's Fargo?

				JERRY
		Yah, real good.

				VOICE
		Dad's here.

	DEN

	Jerry enters, pulling off his plaid cap.

				JERRY
		How ya doin', Wade?

	Wade Gustafson is mid-sixtyish, vigorous, with a full head
	of gray hair.  His eyes remain fixed on the TV.

				WADE
		Yah, pretty good.

				JERRY
		Whatcha watchin' there?

				WADE
		Norstars.

				JERRY
		...  Who they playin'?

				WADE
		OOOoooh!

	His reaction synchronizes with a reaction from the crowd.

	KITCHEN

	Jerry walks back in, taking off his coat.  His wife is
	putting on an apron.  Jerry nods toward the living room.

				JERRY
		Is he stayin' for supper, then?

				WIFE
		Yah, I think so...  Dad, are you
		stayin' for supper?

				WADE
			(off)
		Yah.

	DINING ROOM

	Jerry, his wife, Wade and Scotty, twelve years old, sit
	eating.

				SCOTTY
		May I be excused?

				JERRY
		Sure, ya done there?

				SCOTTY
		Uh-huh.  Goin' out.

				WIFE
		Where are you going?

				SCOTTY
		Just out.  Just McDonald's.

				JERRY
		Back at 9:30.

				SCOTTY
		Okay.

				WADE
		He just ate.  And he didn't finish.
		He's going to McDonald's instead
		of finishing here?

				WIFE
		He sees his friends there.  It's
		okay.

				WADE
		It's okay?  McDonald's?  What do
		you think they do there?  They
		don't drink milkshakes, I assure
		you!

				WIFE
		It's okay, Dad.

				JERRY
		Wade, have ya had a chance to
		think about, uh, that deal I was
		talkin' about, those forty acres
		there on Wayzata?

				WADE
		You told me about it.

				JERRY
		Yah, you said you'd have a think
		about it.  I understand it's a
		lot of money -

				WADE
		A heck of a lot.  What'd you
		say you were gonna put there?

				JERRY
		A lot.  It's a limited -

				WADE
		I know it's a lot.

				JERRY
		I mean a parking lot.

				WADE
		Yah, well, seven hundred and
		fifty thousand dollars is a lot
		- ha ha ha!

				JERRY
		Yah, well, it's a chunk, but -

				WADE
		I thought you were gonna show
		it to Stan Grossman.  He passes
		on this stuff before it gets
		kicked up to me.

				JERRY
		Well, you know Stan'll say no
		dice.  That's why you pay him.
		I'm asking you here, Wade.  This
		could work out real good for me
		and Jean and Scotty -

				WADE
		Jean and Scotty never have to
		worry.

	WHITE

	A black like curls through the white.  Twisting perspective
	shows that it is an aerial shot of a two-lane highway,
	bordered by snowfields.  The highway carries one moving car.

	INT. CAR

	Carl Showalter is driving.  Gaear Grimsrud stares blankly
	out.

	After a long beat:

				GRIMSRUD
		Where is Pancakes Hause?

				CARL
		What?

				GRIMSRUD
		We stop at Pancakes Hause.

				CARL
		What're you, nuts?  We had
		pancakes for breakfast.  I gotta
		go somewhere I can get a shot
		and a beer - and a steak maybe.
		Not more fuckin' pancakes.  Come
		on.

	Grimsrud gives him a sour look.

				CARL
		...  Come on, man.  Okay, here's
		an idea.  We'll stop outside of
		Brainerd.  I know a place there
		we can get laid.  Wuddya think?

				GRIMSRUD
		I'm fuckin' hungry now, you know.

				CARL
		Yeah, yeah, Jesus - I'm sayin',
		we'll stop for pancakes, then
		we'll get laid.  Wuddya think?

	GUSTAFSON OLDS GARAGE

	Jerry is sitting in his glassed-in salesman's cubicle just
	off the showroom floor.  On the other side of his desk sit
	an irate customer and his wife.

				CUSTOMER
		We sat here right in this room and
		went over this and over this!

				JERRY
		Yah, but that TruCoat -

				CUSTOMER
		I sat right here and said I didn't
		want no TruCoat!

				JERRY
		Yah, but I'm sayin', that TruCoat,
		you don't get it and you get
		oxidization problems.  It'll cost
		you a heck of lot more'n five
		hunnert -

				CUSTOMER
		You're sittin' here, you're talkin'
		in circles!  You're talkin' like
		we didn't go over this already!

				JERRY
		Yah, but this TruCoat -

				CUSTOMER
		We had us a deal here for nine-
		teen-five.  You sat there and
		darned if you didn't tell me
		you'd get this car, these options,
		WITHOUT THE SEALANT, for nine-
		teen-five!

				JERRY
		Okay, I'm not sayin' I didn't -

				CUSTOMER
		You called me twenty minutes ago
		and said you had it!  Ready to
		make delivery, ya says!  Come on
		down and get it!  And here ya are
		and you're wastin' my time and
		you're wastin' my wife's time and
		I'm payin' nineteen-five for this
		vehicle here!

				JERRY
		Well, okay, I'll talk to my boss...

	He rises, and, as he leaves:

				JERRY
		...  See, they install that TruCoat
		at the factory, there's nothin' we
		can do, but I'll talk to my boss.

	The couple watch him go to a nearby cubicle.

				CUSTOMER
		These guys here - these guys!
		It's always the same!  It's always
		more!  He's a liar!

				WIFE
		Please, dear.

				CUSTOMER
		We went over this and over this -

	NEARBY CUBICLE

	Jerry sits perched on the desk of another salesman who is
	eating lunch as he watches a hockey game on a small portable
	TV.

				JERRY
		So you're goin' to the Gophers
		on Sunday?

				SALESMAN
		You bet.

				JERRY
		You wouldn't have an extra ticket
		there?

				SALESMAN
		They're playin' the Buckeyes!

				JERRY
		Yah.

				SALESMAN
		Ya kiddin'!

	JERRY'S CUBICLE

	Jerry re-enters.

				JERRY
		Well, he never done this before,
		but seein' as it's special
		circumstances and all, he says I
		can knock one hunnert off that
		TruCoat.

				CUSTOMER
		One hundred!  You lied to me, Mr.
		Lundegaard.  You're a bald-faced
		liar!

	Jerry sits staring at his lap.

				CUSTOMER
		...  A fucking liar -

				WIFE
		Bucky, please!

	Jerry mumbles into his lap:

				JERRY
		One hunnert's the best we can
		do here.

				CUSTOMER
		Oh, for Christ's sake, where's my
		goddamn checkbook.  Let's get this
		over with.

	WIDE EXTERIOR:  TRUCK STOP

	There is a restaurant with many big rigs parked nearby, and
	a motel with an outsize Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox
	flanking its sign:  BLUE OX MOTEL.

	MOTEL ROOM

	Carl Showalter and Gaear Grimsrud are in the twin beds
	having sex with two truck-stop hookers.

				CARL
		Oh, Jesus, yeah.

				HIS HOOKER
		There ya go, sugar.

				GRIMSRUD
		Nnph.

				HIS HOOKER
		Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.

	LATER

	The couples like in their respective beds, gazing at the
	offscreen TV.

				ED MCMAHON
		-  Johnny's guests tonight will be
		Lee Majors, George Wendt, and Steve
		Boutsikaros from the San Diego Zoo,
		so keep that dial -

	LUNDEGAARD KITCHEN

	We hear a morning show on television.  Jean Lundegaard is
	making coffee in the kitchen as Scott eats cereal at the
	table.

				JEAN
		I'm talkin' about your potential.

				SCOTT
			(absently)
		Uh-huh.

				JEAN
		You're not a C student.

				SCOTT
		Uhn.

				JEAN
		And yet you're gettin' C grades.
		It's this disparity there that
		concerns your dad and me.

				SCOTT
		Uh-huh.

				JEAN
		You know what a disparity is?

				SCOTT
			(testily)
		Yeah!

				JEAN
		Okay.  Well, that's why we don't
		want ya goin' out fer hockey.

				SCOTT
		Oh, man!

	The phone rings.

				SCOTT
		...  What's the big deal?  It's
		an hour -

				JEAN
		Hold on.

	She picks up the phone.

				JEAN
		...  Hello?

				PHONE VOICE
		Yah, hiya, hon.

				JEAN
		Oh, hiya, Dad.

				WADE
		Jerry around?

				JEAN
		Yah, he's still here - I'll
		catch him for ya.

	She holds the phone away and calls:

				JEAN
		...  Hon?

				VOICE
		Yah.

				JEAN
		It's Dad.

				VOICE
		Yah...

	Jerry enters in shirtsleeves and tie.

				JERRY
		...  Yah, okay...

				SCOTT
		Look, Dad, there is no fucking
		way -

				JEAN
		Scott!

				JERRY
		Say, let's watch the language -

	He takes the phone.

				JERRY
		How ya doin', Wade?

				WADE
		What's goin' on there?

				JERRY
		Oh, nothing, Wade.  How ya doin'
		there?

				WADE
		Stan Grossman looked at your
		proposal.  Says it's pretty
		sweet.

				JERRY
		No kiddin'?

				WADE
		We might be innarested.

				JERRY
		No kiddin'!  I'd need the cash
		pretty quick there.  In order
		to close the deal.

				WADE
		Come by at 2:30 and we'll talk
		about it.  If your numbers are
		right, Stan says its pretty
		sweet.  Stan Grossman.

				JERRY
		Yah.

				WADE
		2:30.

	Click.  Dial tone.

				JERRY
		Yah, okay.

	GUSTAFSON OLD GARAGE

	Jerry wanders through the service area where cars are being
	worked on.  He stops by an Indian in blue jeans who is
	looking at the underside of a car that sits on a hydraulic
	lift with a cage light hanging off its innards.

				JERRY
		Say, Shep, how ya doin' there?

				SHEP
		Mm.

				JERRY
		Say, ya know those two fellas
		ya put me in touch with, up
		there in Fargo?

				SHEP
		Put you in touch with Grimsrud.

				JERRY
		Well, yah, but he had a buddy
		there.  He, uh -

				SHEP
		Well, I don't vouch for him.

				JERRY
		Well, that's okay, I just -

				SHEP
		I vouch for Grimsrud.  Who's his
		buddy?

				JERRY
		Carl somethin'?

				SHEP
		Never heard of him.  Don't vouch
		for him.

				JERRY
		Well, that's okay, he's a buddy
		of the guy ya vouched for, so I'm
		not worryin'.  I just, I was
		wonderin', see, I gotta get in
		touch with 'em for, I might not
		need it anymore, sumpn's happenin',
		see -

				SHEP
		Call 'em up.

				JERRY
		Yah, well, see, I did that, and
		I haven't been able to get 'em,
		so I thought you maybe'd know an
		alternate number or what have ya.

				SHEP
		Nope.

	Jerry slaps his fist into his open palm and snaps his
	fingers.

				JERRY
		Okay, well, real good, then.

	CAR

	Carl is driving.  Grimsrud stares out front.

	After a beat:

				CARL
		...  Look at that.  Twin Cities.
		IDS Building, the big glass one.
		Tallest skyscraper in the Midwest.
		After the Sears, uh, Chicago...
		You never been to Minneapolis?

				GRIMSRUD
		No.

				CARL
		...  Would it kill you to say
		something?

				GRIMSRUD
		I did.

				CARL
		"No." First thing you've said
		in the last four hours.  That's
		a, that's a fountain of conversation,
		man.  That's a geyser.  I mean, whoa,
		daddy, stand back, man.  Shit, I'm
		sittin' here driving, man, doin'
		all the driving, whole fuckin' way
		from Brainerd, drivin', tryin' to,
		you know, tryin' to chat, keep
		our spirits up, fight the boredom
		of the road, and you can't say one
		fucking thing just in the way of
		conversation.

	Grimsurd smokes, gazing out the window.

				CARL
		...  Well, fuck it, I don't have
		to talk either, man.  See how
		you like it...

	He drives.

				CARL
		...  Total silence...

	JERRY'S CUBICLE

	He is on the phone.

				JERRY
		Yah, real good.  How you doin'?

				VOICE
		Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard.
		You're damned hard to get on the
		phone.

				JERRY
		Yah, it's pretty darned busy here,
		but that's the way we like it.

				VOICE
		That's for sure.  Now, I just
		need, on these last, these financing
		documents you sent us, I can't
		read the serial numbers of the
		vehicles on here, so I -

				JERRY
		But I already got the, it's okay,
		the loans are in place, I already
		got the, the what, the -

				VOICE
		Yeah, the three hundred and twenty
		thousand dollars, you got the money
		last month.

				JERRY
		Yah, so we're all set.

				VOICE
		Yeah, but the vehicles you were
		borrowing on, I just can't read
		the serial numbers on your
		applicaton.  Maybe if you could
		just read them to me -

				JERRY
		But the deal's already done, I
		already got the money -

				VOICE
		Yeah, but we have an audit here,
		I just have to know that these
		vehicles you're financing with
		this money, that they really
		exist.

				JERRY
		Yah, well, they exist all right.

				VOICE
		I'm sure they do - ha ha!  But
		I can't read their serial numbers
		here.  So if you could read me -

				JERRY
		Well, but see, I don't have 'em
		in front a me - why don't I just
		fax you over a copy -

				VOICE
		No, fax is no good, that's what
		I have and I can't read the darn
		thing -

				JERRY
		Yah, okay, I'll have my girl
		send you over a copy, then.

				VOICE
		Okay, because if I can't correlate
		this note with the specific vehicles,
		then I gotta call back that money -

				JERRY
		Yah, how much money was that?

				VOICE
		Three hundred and twenty thousand
		dollars.  See, I gotta correlate
		that money with the cars it's being
		lent on.

				JERRY
		Yah, no problem, I'll just fax
		that over to ya, then.

				VOICE
		No, no, fax is -

				JERRY
		I mean send it over.  I'll shoot
		it right over to ya.

				VOICE
		Okay.

				JERRY
		Okay, real good, then.

	CLOSE ON TELEVISION

	A morning-show host in an apron stands behind a counter on a
	kitchen set.

				HOST
		So I seperate the - how the heck
		do I get the egg out of the shell
		without breaking it?

	Jean Lundegaard is curled up on the couch with a cup of
	coffee, watching the television.

				HOSTESS
		You just prick a little hole in
		the end and blow!

	Jean smiles as we hear laughter and applause from the studio
	audience.  She hears something else - a faint scraping sound
	- and looks up.

				HOST
		Okay, here goes nothing.

	The scraping sound persists.  Jean sets down her coffee cup
	and rises.

	From the studio audience:

				AUDIENCE
		Awoooo!

	KITCHEN

	We track toward the back door.  A curtain is stretched tight
	across its window.

	Jean pulls the curtain back.  Bright sunlight amplified by
	snow floods in.

	A man in an orange ski mask looks up from the lock.

	Jean gasps, drops the curtain, rutns and runs into -

	- a taller man, also in a ski mask, already in the house.

	We hear the crack of the back-door window being smashed.

	The tall man - Gaear Grimsrud - grabs Jean's wrist.

	She screams, staring at her own imprisoned wrist, then wraps
	her gaping mouth around Grimsrud's gloved thumb and bites
	down hard.

	He drops her wrist.  As Carl enters, she races up the
	stairs.

				GRIMSRUD
		Unguent.

				CARL
		Huh?

	Grimsurd looks at his thumb.

				GRIMSRUD
		I need ... unguent.

	UPSTAIRS BEDROOM

	As the two men enter, a door at the far side is slamming
	shut.  A cord snakes in under the door.

	MASTER BATHROOM

	Jean, sobbing, frantically pushes at buttons on the princess
	phone.

	The phone pops out of her hands, jangles across the tile
	floor, smashes against the door and then bounces away, its
	cord ripped free.

	With a groaning sound, the door shifts in its frame.

	BEDROOM

	Grimsrud has a crowbar jammed in between the bathroom door
	and frame, and is working it.

	BATHROOM

	Jean crosses to a high window above the toilet and throws it
	open.  Snow that had drifted against the window sifts
	lightly in.  Jean steps up onto the toilet.

	The door creaks, moving as one piece in its frame.

	Jean glances back as she steps up from the toilet seat to
	the tank.

	The groaning of the door ends with the wood around its knob
	splintering and the knob itself falling out onto the floor.

	The door swings open.

	Grimsrud and Carl enter.

	THEIR POV

	Room empty, window open.

	Carl strides to the window and hoists himself out.

	Grimsrud opens the medicine cabinet and delicately taps
	aside various bottles and tubes, seeking the proper unguent.

	He finds a salve but after a moment sets it down, noticing
	something in the mirror.

	The shower curtain is drawn around the tub.

	He steps toward it.

	As he reaches for the curtain, it explodes outward, animated
	by thrashing limbs.

	Jean, screaming, tangled in the curtain, rips it off its
	rings and stumbles out into the bedroom.  Grimsrud follows.

	BEDROOM

	Jean rushes toward the door, cloaked by the shower curtain
	but awkwardly trying to push it off.

	UPSTAIRS LANDING

	Still thrashing, Jean crashes against the upstairs railing,
	trips on the curtain and falls, thumping crazily down the
	stairs.

	Grimsrud trots down after her.

	A PLAQUE:  WADE GUSTAFSON INCORPORTATED

	INT. WADE'S OFFICE

	Wade sits behind his desk; another man rises as Jerry
	enters.

				JERRY
		How ya doin' there, Stan?  How
		are ya, Wade?

	Stan Grossman shakes his hand.

				STAN
		Good to see ya again, Jerry.  If
		these numbers are right, this
		looks pretty sweet.

				JERRY
		Oh, those numbers are all right,
		bleemee.

				WADE
		This is do-able.

				STAN
		Congratulations, Jerry.

				JERRY
		Yah, thanks, Stan, it's a pretty -

				WADE
		What kind of finder's fee were
		you looking for?

				JERRY
		...  Huh?

				STAN
		The financials are pretty thorough,
		so the only thing we don't know
		is your fee.

				JERRY
		...  My fee?  Wade, what the
		heck're you talkin' about?

				WADE
		Stan and I're okay.

				JERRY
		Yah.

				WADE
		We're good to loan in.

				JERRY
		Yah.

				WADE
		But we never talked about your
		fee for bringin' it to us.

				JERRY
		No, but, Wade, see, I was
		bringin' you this deal for you
		to loan me the money to put
		in.  It's my deal here, see?

	Wade scowls, looks at Stan.

				STAN
		Jerry - we thought you were
		bringin' us an investment.

				JERRY
		Yah, right -

				STAN
		You're sayin' - what're you
		sayin'?

				WADE
		You're sayin' that we put in
		all the money and you collect
		when it pays off?

				JERRY
		No, no.  I - I'd, I'd - pay you
		back the principal, and interest
		- heck, I'd go - one over prime -

				STAN
		We're not a bank, Jerry.

	Wade is angry.

				WADE
		What the heck, Jerry, if I wanted
		bank interest on seven hunnert'n
		fifty thousand I'd go to Midwest
		Federal.  Talk to Bill Diehl.

				STAN
		He's at Norstar.

				WADE
		He's at -

				JERRY
		No, see, I don't need a finder's
		fee, I need - finder's fee's, what,
		ten percent, heck that's not gonna
		do it for me.  I need the principal.

				STAN
		Jerry, we're not just going to
		give you seven hundred and fifty
		thousand dollars.

				WADE
		What the heck were you thinkin'?
		Heck, if I'm only gettin' bank
		interest, I'd look for complete
		security.  Heck, FDIC.  I don't
		see nothin' like that here.

				JERRY
		Yah, but I - okay, I would, I'd
		guarantee ya your money back.

				WADE
		I'm not talkin' about your damn
		word, Jerry.  Geez, what the
		heck're you?...  Well, look, I
		don't want to cut you out of the
		loop, but his here's a good deal.
		I assume, if you're not innarested,
		you won't mind if we move on it
		independently.

	PARKING LOT

	We are high and wide on the office building's parking lot.
	Jerry emerges wrapped in a parka, his arms sticking stiffly
	out at his sides, his breath vaporizing.  He goes to his
	car, opens its front door, pulls out a red plastic scraper
	and starts methodically scraping off the thin crust of ice
	that has developed on his windshield.

	The scrape-scrape-scrape sound carries in the frigid air.

	Jerry goes into a frenzy, banging the scraper against the
	windshield and the hood of his car.

	The tantrum passes.  Jerry stands pantin, staring at nothing
	in particular.

	Scrape-scrape-scrape - he goes back to work on the
	windshield.

	FRONT DOOR

	A beat, silent but for a key scraping at the lock.

	The door swings open and Jerry edges in, looking about,
	holding a sack of groceries.

				JERRY
		Hon?

	He shuts the door.

				JERRY
		...  Got the growshries...

	He has already seen the shower curtain on the floor.  He
	frowns, pokes at it with his foot.

				JERRY
		...  Hon?

	UPSTAIRS BATHROOM

	Jerry walks in.  He sets the groceries down on the toilet
	tank.

	He looks at the open window, through which snow still sifts
	in.  He shuts it.

	He picks up the small tube of uguent that sits on the sink,
	frowns at it, puts it back in the medicine chest.

	He looks at the shower curtain rod holding empty rings.

	FOYER

	Once again we are looking at the rumpled shower curtain.

	From another room:

				JERRY
		Yah, Wade, I - it's Jerry, I.

	Then, slightly more agitated.

				JERRY
		...  Yah, Wade, it's, I, it's
		Jerry...

	Beat.

				JERRY
		...  Wade, it's Jerry, I - we
		gotta talk, Wade, it's terrible...

	Beat.

	LIVING ROOM

	Jerry stands in wide shot, hands on hips, looking down at a
	telephone.

	After a motionless beat he picks up the phone and punches in
	a number.

				JERRY
		...  Yah, Wade Gustafson, please.

	BLACK

	Hold in black.

	A slow tilt down from night sky brings the head of a large
	paper-mache figure into frame.  It is a flannel-shirt
	woodsman carrying a double-edged ax over one shoulder.  As
	we hear the rumble of an approaching car, the continuing
	tilt and boom down brings us down the woodsman's body to a
	pedestal.

	A sweep of headlights illuminates a sign on the pedestal:
	WELCOME TO BRAINDERD - HOME OF PAUL BUNYAN.

	The headlights sweep off and a car hums past and on into the
	background.  The two-lane highway is otherwise empty.

	INT. CAR

	Carl drives.  Grimsrud smokes and gazes out the window.
	From the back seat we hear whimpering.

	Grimsrud turns to look.

	Jean lies bound and curled on the back seat underneath a
	tarpaulin.

				GRIMSRUD
		Shut the fuck up or I'll throw
		you back in the trunk, you know.

				CARL
		Geez.  That's more'n I've heard
		you say all week.

	Grimsrud stares at him, then turns back to the window.

	At a loud WHOOP Carl starts and looks back out the rear
	window.  Fifty yards behind a state trooper has turned on
	his gumballs.

	Carl eases the car onto the shoulder.

				CARL
		Ah, shit, the tags...

	Grimsrud looks at him.

				CARL
		...  It's just the tags.  I never
		put my tags on the car.  Don't
		worry, I'll take care of this.

	He looks into the back seat as the car bounces and slows on
	the gravel shoulder.

				CARL
		...  Let's keep still back there,
		lady, or we're gonna have to, ya
		know, to shoot ya.

	Grimsrud stares at Carl.

				CARL
		...  Hey!  I'll take care of this!

	Both cars have stopped.  Carl looks up at the rear-view
	mirror.

	The trooper is stopped on the shoulder just behind them,
	writing in his citation book.

	Carl watches.

	We hear the trooper's door open.

	The trooper walks up the shoulder, one hand resting lightly
	on top of his holster, his breath steaming in the cold night
	air.

	Carl opens his window as the trooper draws up.

				CARL
		How can I help you, officer?

	The trooper scans the inside of the car, taking his time.

	Grimsrud smokes and gazes calmly out his window.

	Finally:

				TROOPER
		This is a new car, then, sir?

				CARL
		It certainly is, officer.  Still
		got that smell!

				TROOPER
		You're required to display
		temporary tags, either in the
		plate area or taped inside the
		back window.

				CARL
		Certainly -

				TROOPER
		Can I see your license and
		registration please?

				CARL
		Certainly.

	He reaches for his wallet.

				CARL
		...  I was gonna tape up the
		temporary tag, ya know, to be
		in full compliance, but it, uh,
		it, uh ... must a slipped my
		mind...

	He extends his wallet toward the trooper, a folded fifty-
	dollar bill protruding from it.

				CARL
		...  So maybe the best thing
		would be to take care of that,
		right here in Brainerd.

				TROOPER
		What's this, sir?

				CARL
		That's my license and regis-
		tration.  I wanna be in
		compliance.

	He forces a laugh.

				CARL
		...  I was just thinking I could
		take care of it right here.  In
		Brainerd.

	The policeman thoughtfully pats the fifty into the billfold
	and hands the billfold back into the car.

				TROOPER
		Put that back in your pocket,
		please.

	Carl's nervous smile fades.

				TROOPER
		...  And step out of the car,
		please, sir.

	Grimsrud, smiling thinly, shakes his head.

	There is a whimpering sound.

	The policeman hesitates.

	Another sound.

	The policeman leans forward into the car, listening.

	Grimsrud reaches across Carl, grabs the trooper by the hair
	and slams his head down onto the car door.

	The policeman grunts, digs awkwardly for footing outside and
	throws an arm for balance against the outside of the car.

	With his free hand, Grimsrud pops the glove compartment.  He
	brings a gun out and reaches across Carl and shoots - BANG -
	into the back of the trooper's head.

	Jean screams.

				GRIMSRUD
		Shut up.

	He releases the policeman.

	The policeman's head slides out the window and his body
	flops back onto the street.

	Carl looks out at the cop in the road.

				CARL
			(softly)
		Whoa...  Whoa, Daddy.

	Grimsrud takes the trooper's hat off of Carl's lap and sails
	it out the open window.

				GRIMSRUD
		You'll take care of it.  Boy, you
		are smooth smooth, you know.

				CARL
		Whoa, Daddy.

	Jean, for some reason, screams again.  Then stops.

				GRIMSRUD
		Clear him off the road.

				CARL
		Yeah.

	He gets out.

	EXT. ROAD

	Carl leans down to hoist up the body.

	Headlights appear:  an oncoming car.

	INT. CIERA

	Grimsrud notices.

	EXT. ROAD

	The car approaches, slowing.

	Carl, with the trooper's body hoisted halfway up, is frozen
	in the headlights.

	The car accelerates and roars past and away.  We just make
	out the silhouettes of two occupants in front.

	INT. CIERA

	Grimsrud slides into the driver's seat.  He squeals into a U-
	turn, the driver's door slamming shut with his spin.

	Small red tail lights fishtail up ahead.  The pursued car
	churns up fine snow.

	Grimsrud takes the cigarette from his mouth and stubs it in
	his ashtray.  We hear the churning of the car wheels and the
	pinging of snow clods and salt on the car's underside.

	In the back seat, Jean starts screaming.

	Grimsrud is not gaining on the tail lights.

	He fights with the wheel as his car swims on the road face.

	The red tail lights ahead start to turn.  With a distant
	crunching sound, they disappear.

	The headlights now show only empty road, starting to turn.

	Grimsrud frowns and slows.

	His headlights show the car up ahead off the road, crumpled
	around a telephone pole, having failed to hold a turn.

	Grimsrud brakes.

	Jean slides off the back seat and thumps into the legwell.

	Grimsrud sweeps his gun off the front seat, throws open his
	door and gets out.

	EXT. ROAD

	The wrecked car's headlights shine off into a snowfield
	abutting the highway.  A young man in a down parka is
	limping across the snowfield, away from the wrecked car.

	Grimsrud strides calmly out after the injured boy.  He
	raises his gun and fires.

	With a poof of feathers, a hole opens up in the boy's back
	and he pitches into the snow.

	Grimsrud walks up to the wreck and peers in its half-open
	door.

	A young woman is trapped inside the twisted wreckage,
	injured.

	Snow swirls in the headlights of the wreck.

	Grimsrud raises his gun and fires.

	AN OIL PAINTING

	A blue-winged teal in flight over a swampy marshland.  The
	room in which it hangs is dark.  We hear off-screen snoring.

	We track off to reveal an easel upon which we see a half-
	completed oil of a grey mallard.

	The continuing track reveals a couple in bed, sleeping.  The
	man, fortyish, pajama-clad, is big, and big-bellied.  His
	mouth is agape.  He snores.  His arms are flung over a woman
	in her thirties, wearing a nightie, mouth also open, not
	snoring.

	We hold for a long beat on their regular breathing and
	snoring.

	The phone rings.

	The woman stirs.

				WOMAN
		Oh, geez...

	She reaches for the phone.

				WOMAN
		...  Hi, it's Marge...

	The man stirs and clears his throat with a long deep rumble.

				MARGE
		...  Oh, my.  Where?...  Yah...
		Oh, geez...

	The man sits up, gazes stupidly about.

				MARGE
		...  Okay.  There in a jif...
		Real good, then.

	She hangs up.

				MARGE
		...  You can sleep, hon.  It's
		early yet.

				MAN
		Gotta go?

				MARGE
		Yah.

	The man swings his legs out.

				MAN
		I'll fix ya some eggs.

				MARGE
		That's okay, hon.  I gotta run.

				MAN
		Gotta eat a breakfast, Marge.
		I'll fix ya some eggs.

				MARGE
		Aw, you can sleep, hon.

				MAN
		Ya gotta eat a breakfast...

	He clears his throat with another deep rumble.

				MAN
		...  I'll fix ya some eggs.

				MARGE
		Aw, Norm.

	PLATE

	Leavings of a huge plate of eggs, ham, toast.

	Wider, we see Marge now wearing a beige police uniform.  A
	patch on one arm says BRAINERD POLICE DEPARTMENT.  She wears
	a heavy belt holding a revolver, walkie-talkie and various
	other jangling police impedimenta.  Norm is in a dressing
	gown.

				MARGE
		Thanks, hon.  Time to shove off.

				NORM
		Love ya, Margie.

	As she struggles into a parka:

				MARGE
		Love ya, hon.

	He is exiting back to the bedroom; she exits out the front
	door.

	EXT. GUNDERSON HOUSE

	Dawn.  Marge is making her way down the icy front stoop to
	her prowler.

	INT. GUNDERSON HOUSE

	Norm sits back onto the bed, shrugging off his robe.  Off-
	screen we hear the front door open.

	FRONT DOOR

	Marge stamps the snow off her shoes.

				MARGE
		Hon?

				NORM
			(off)
		Yah?

				MARGE
		Prowler needs a jump.

	HIGHWAY

	Two police cars and an ambulance sit idling at the side of
	the road, a pair of men inside each car.

	The first car's driver door opens and a figure in a parka
	emerges, holding two styrofoam cups.  His partner leans
	across the seat to close the door after him.

	The reverse shows Marge approaching from her own squad car.

				MARGE
		Hiya, Lou.

				LOU
		Margie.  Thought you might need
		a little warm-up.

	He hands her one of the cups of coffee.

				MARGE
		Yah, thanks a bunch.  So what's
		the deal, now?  Gary says triple
		homicide?

				LOU
		Yah, looks pretty bad.  Two
		of'm're over here.

	Marge looks around as they start walking.

				MARGE
		Where is everybody?

				LOU
		Well - it's cold, Margie.

	BY THE WRECK

	Laid out in the early morning light is the wrecked car, a
	pair of footprints leading out to a man in a bright orange
	parka face down in the bloodstained snow, and one pair of
	footsteps leading back to the road.

	Marge is peering into the car.

				MARGE
		Ah, geez.  So...  Aw, geez.
		Here's the second one...  It's
		in the head and the ... hand
		there, I guess that's a defensive
		wound.  Okay.

	Marge looks up from the car.

				MARGE
		...  Where's the state trooper?

	Lou, up on the shoulder, jerks his thumb.

				LOU
		Back there a good piece.  In
		the ditch next to his prowler.

	Marge looks around at the road.

				MARGE
		Okay, so we got a state trooper
		pulls someone over, we got a
		shooting, and these folks drive
		by, and we got a high-speed
		pursuit, ends here, and this
		execution-type deal.

				LOU
		Yah.

				MARGE
		I'd be very surprised if our
		suspect was from Brainerd.

				LOU
		Yah.

	Marge is studying the ground.

				MARGE
		Yah.  And I'll tell you what, from
		his footprints he looks like a big
		fella -

	Marge suddenly doubles over, putting her head between her
	knees down near the snow.

				LOU
		Ya see something down there, Chief?

				MARGE
		Uh - I just, I think I'm gonna barf.

				LOU
		Geez, you okay, Margie?

				MARGE
		I'm fine - it's just morning
		sickness.

	She gets up, sweeping snow from her knees.

				MARGE
		...  Well, that passed.

				LOU
		Yah?

				MARGE
		Yah.  Now I'm hungry again.

				LOU
		You had breakfast yet, Margie?

				MARGE
		Oh, yah.  Norm made some eggs.

				LOU
		Yah?  Well, what now, d'ya think?

				MARGE
		Let's go take a look at that
		trooper.

	BY THE STATE TROOPER'S CAR

	Marge's prowler is parked nearby.

	Marge is on her hands and knees by a body down in the ditch,
	again looking at footprints in the snow.  She calls up to
	the road:

				MARGE
		There's two of 'em, Lou!

				LOU
		Yah?

				MARGE
		Yah, this guy's smaller than
		his buddy.

				LOU
		Oh, yah?

	DOWN IN THE DITCH

	In the foreground is the head of the state trooper, facing
	us.  Peering at it from behind, still on her hands and
	knees, is Marge.

				MARGE
		For Pete's sake.

	She gets up, clapping the snow off her hands, and climbs out
	of the ditch.

				LOU
		How's it look, Marge?

				MARGE
		Well, he's got his gun on his hip
		there, and he looks like a nice
		enough guy.  It's a real shame.

				LOU
		Yah.

				MARGE
		You haven't monkeyed with his car
		there, have ya?

				LOU
		No way.

	She is looking at the prowler, which still idles on the
	shoulder.

				MARGE
		Somebody shut his lights.  I guess
		the little guy sat in there, waitin'
		for his buddy t'come back.

				LOU
		Yah, woulda been cold out here.

				MARGE
		Heck, yah.  Ya think, is Dave open
		yet?

				LOU
		You don't think he's mixed up in -

				MARGE
		No, no, I just wanna get Norm some
		night crawlers.

	INT. PROWLER

	Marge is driving; Lou sits next to her.

				MARGE
		You look in his citation book?

				LOU
		Yah...

	He looks at his notebook.

				LOU
		...  Last vehicle he wrote in
		was a tan Ciera at 2:18 a.m.
		Under the plate number he put
		DLR - I figure they stopped him
		or shot him before he could finish
		fillin' out the tag number.

				MARGE
		Uh-huh.

				LOU
		So I got the state lookin' for a
		Ciera with a tag startin' DLR.
		They don't got no match yet.

				MARGE
		I'm not sure I agree with you a
		hunnert percent on your policework,
		there, Lou.

				LOU
		Yah?

				MARGE
		Yah, I think that vehicle there
		probly had dealer plates.  DLR?

				LOU
		Oh...

	Lou gazes out the window, thinking.

				LOU
		...  Geez.

				MARGE
		Yah.  Say, Lou, ya hear the one
		about the guy who couldn't afford
		personalized plates, so he went
		and changed his name to J2L 4685?

				LOU
		Yah, that's a good one.

				MARGE
		Yah.

	THE ROAD

	The police car enters with a whoosh and hums down a straight-
	ruled empty highway, cutting a landscape of flat and perfect
	white.

	EMBERS FAMILY RESTAURANT

	Jerry, Wade, and Stan Grossman sit in a booth, sipping
	coffee.  Outside the window, snow falls from a gunmetal sky.

				WADE
		-  All's I know is, ya got a
		problem, ya call a professional!

				JERRY
		No!  They said no cops!  They were
		darned clear on that, Wade!  They
		said you call the cops and we -

				WADE
		Well, a course they're gonna say
		that!  But where's my protection?
		They got Jean here!  I give these
		sons a bitches a million dollars,
		where's my guarantee they're gonna
		let her go.

				JERRY
		Well, they -

				WADE
		A million dollars is a lot a damn
		money!  And there they are, they
		got my daughter!

				JERRY
		Yah, but think this thing through
		here, Wade.  Ya give 'em what they
		want, why wont' they let her go?
		You gotta listen to me on this one,
		Wade.

				WADE
		Heck, you don't know!  You're just
		whistlin' Dixie here!  I'm sayin',
		the cops, they can advise us on
		this!  I'm sayin' call a professional!

				JERRY
		No!  No cops!  That's final!  This
		is my deal here, Wade!  Jean is
		my wife here!

				STAN
		I gotta tell ya, Wade, I'm leanin'
		to Jerry's viewpoint here.

				WADE
		Well -

				STAN
		We gotta protect Jean.  These -
		we're not holdin' any cards here,
		Wade, they got all of 'em.  So
		they call the shots.

				JERRY
		You're darned tootin'!

				WADE
		Ah, dammit!

				STAN
		I'm tellin' ya.

				WADE
		Well...  Why don't we...

	He saws a finger under his nose.

				WADE
		...  Stan, I'm thinkin' we should
		offer 'em half a million.

				JERRY
		Now come on here, no way, Wade!
		No way!

				STAN
		We're not horse-trading here, Wade,
		we just gotta bite the bullet on
		this thing.

				JERRY
		Yah!

				STAN
		What's the next step here, Jerry?

				JERRY
		They're gonna call, give me
		instructions for a drop.  I'm
		supposed to have the money ready
		tomorrow.

				WADE
		Dammit!

	THE CASHIER

	She rings up two dollars forty.

				CASHIER
		How was everything today?

				JERRY
		Yah, real good now.

	PARKING LOT

	Snow continues to fall.  Jerry and Stan stand bundled in
	their parkas and galoshes near a row of beached vehicles.
	Wade sits behind the wheel of an idling Lincoln, waiting for
	Stan.

				STAN
		Okay.  We'll get the money together.
		Don't worry about it, Jerry.  Now,
		d'you want anyone at home, with you,
		until they call?

				JERRY
		No, I - they don't want - they're
		just s'posed to be dealin' with
		me, they were real clear.

				STAN
		Yah.

	Jerry pounds his mittened hands together against the cold.

				JERRY
		Ya know, they said no one listenin'
		in, they'll be watchin', ya know.
		Maybe it's all bull, but like you
		said, Stan, they're callin' the
		shots.

				STAN
		Okay.  And Scotty, is he gonna
		be all right?

				JERRY
		Yah, geez, Scotty.  I'll go talk
		to him.

	There is a tap at the horn from Wade, and Stan gets into the
	Lincoln.

				STAN
		We'll call.

	The Lincoln spits snow as it grinds out of the lot and
	fishtails out onto the boulevard.

	SCOTTY'S BEDROOM

	Scotty lies on the bed, weeping.  Jerry enters and perches
	uncomfortably on the edge of his bed.

				JERRY
		...  How ya doin' there, Scotty?

				SCOTT
		Dad!  What're they doing?  Wuddya
		think they're doin' with Mom?

				JERRY
		It's okay, Scotty.  They're not
		gonna want to hurt her any.
		These men, they just want money,
		see.

				SCOTT
		What if - what if sumpn goes wrong?

				JERRY
		No, no, nothin's goin' wrong here.
		Grandad and I, we're - we're makin'
		sure this gets handled right.

	Scott snorfles and sits up.

				SCOTT
		Dad, I really think we should call
		the cops.

				JERRY
		No!  We can't let anyone know about
		this thing!  We gotta play ball with
		these guys - you ask Stan Grossman,
		he'll tell ya the same thing!

				SCOTT
		Yeah, but -

				JERRY
		We're gonna get Mom back for ya, but
		we gotta play ball.  Ya know, that's
		the deal.  Now if Lorraine calls, or
		Sylvia, you just say that Mom is in
		Florida with Pearl and Marty...

	Scotty starts to weep again.  Jerry stares down at his lap.

				JERRY
		...  That's the best we can do here.

	EXT. CABIN

	It is a lakeside cabin surrounded by white.  A brown Ciera
	with dealer plates is pulling into the drive.

	Grimsrud climbs out of the passenger seat as Carl climbs out
	of the driver's.  Grimsrud opens the back door and, with an
	arm on her elbow, helps Jean out.  She has her hands tied
	behind her and a black hood over her head.

	With a cry, she swings her elbow out of Grimsrud's grasp and
	lurches away across the front lawn.  Grimsrud moves to
	retrieve her but Carl, grinning, lays a hand on his
	shoulder.

				CARL
		Hold it.

	They both look out at the front lawn, Grimsrud
	expressionless, Carl smiling.

	With muffled cries, the hooded woman lurches across the
	unbroken snow, staggering this way and that, stumbling on
	the uneven terrain.

	She stops, stands still, her hooded head swaying.

	She lurches out in an arbitrary direction.  Going downhill,
	she reels, staggers, and falls face-first into the snow,
	weeping.

				CARL
		Ha ha ha ha ha ha!  Jesus!

	Grimsrud, still expressionless, breaks away from Carl's
	restraining hand to retrieve her.

	BRAINERD POLICE HEADQUARTERS

	We track behind Marge as she makes her way across the floor,
	greeting various officers.  She holds a small half-full
	paper sack.

	Beyond her we see a small glassed-in cublcle.  Norm sits at
	the desk inside with a box lunch spread out in front of him.
	There is lettering on the cubicle's glass door:  BRAINERD
	PD. CHIEF GUNDERSON.

	Marge enters and sits behind the desk, detaching her walkie-
	talkie from her utility belt to accomodate the seat.

				MARGE
		Hiya, hon.

	She slides the paper sack toward him.

				NORM
		Brought ya some lunch, Margie.
		What're those, night crawlers?

	He looks inside.

	The bottom of the sack is full of fat, crawling earthworms.

				MARGE
		Yah.

				NORM
		Thanks, hon.

				MARGE
		You bet.  Thanks for lunch.  What
		do we got here, Arbie's?

				NORM
		Uh-huh.

	She starts eating.

				MARGE
		...  How's the paintin' goin'?

				NORM
		Pretty good.  Found out the Hautmans
		are entering a painting this year.

				MARGE
		Aw, hon, you're better'n them.

				NORM
		They're real good.

				MARGE
		They're good, Norm, but you're
		better'n them.

				NORM
		Yah, ya think?

	He leans over and kisses her.

				MARGE
		Ah, ya got Arbie's all o'er me.

	Lou enters.

				LOU
		Hiya, Norm, how's the paintin'
		goin'?

				NORM
		Not too bad.  You know.

				MARGE
		How we doin' on that vehicle?

				LOU
		No motels registered any tan Ciera
		last night.  But the night before,
		two men checked into the Blue Ox
		registering a Ciera and leavin' the
		tag space blank.

				MARGE
		Geez, that's a good lead.  The
		Blue Ox, that's that trucker's
		joint out there on I-35?

				LOU
		Yah.  Owner was on the desk then,
		said these two guys had company.

				MARGE
		Oh, yah?

	EXT. STRIPPER CLUB

	Marge's prowler is parked in an otherwise empty lot.  Snow
	drifts down.

	INT. STRIPPER CLUB

	Marge sits talking with two young women at one end of an
	elevated dance platform.  The club, not yet open for
	business, is deserted.

				MARGE
		Where you girls from?

				HOOKER ONE
		Chaska.

				HOOKER TWO
		LeSeure.  But I went to high school
		in White Bear Lake.

				MARGE
		Okay, I want you to tell me what
		these fellas looked like.

				HOOKER ONE
		Well, the little guy, he was
		kinda funny-looking.

				MARGE
		In what way?

				HOOKER ONE
		I dunno.  Just funny-looking.

				MARGE
		Can you be any more specific?

				HOOKER ONE
		I couldn't really say.  He wasn't
		circumcised.

				MARGE
		Was he funny-looking apart from
		that?

				HOOKER ONE
		Yah.

				MARGE
		So you were having sex with the
		little fella, then?

				HOOKER ONE
		Uh-huh.

				MARGE
		Is there anything else you can
		tell me about him?

				HOOKER ONE
		No.  Like I say, he was funny-looking.
		More'n most people even.

				MARGE
		And what about the other fella?

				HOOKER TWO
		He was a little older.  Looked like
		the Marlboro man.

				MARGE
		Yah?

				HOOKER TWO
		Yah.  Maybe I'm sayin' that cause
		he smoked Marlboros.

				MARGE
		Uh-huh.

				HOOKER TWO
		A subconscious-type thing.

				MARGE
		Yah, that can happen.

				HOOKER TWO
		Yah.

				HOOKER ONE
		They said they were goin' to the
		Twin Cities?

				MARGE
		Oh, yah?

				HOOKER TWO
		Yah.

				HOOKER ONE
		Yah.  Is that useful to ya?

				MARGE
		Oh, you bet, yah.

	EXT. LAKESIDE CABIN

	It is now dusk.  The brown Ciera with dealer plates still
	sits in the drive.

	INT. CABIN

	We track in on Jean Lundegaard, who sits tied in a chair
	with the black hood still over her head.  As we track in, we
	hear inarticulate cursing, intermittent banging and loud
	static.

	We track in on Gaear Grimsrud, who sits smoking a cigarette
	and expressionlessly gazing offscreen.

	We track in on Carl Showalter, who stands over an old black-
	and-white television.  It plays nothing but snow.  Carl is
	banging on it as he mutters:

				CARL
		...days ... be here for days with
		a - DAMMIT! - a goddamn mute ...
		nothin' to do ... and the fucking -
		DAMMIT!...

	Each "dammit" brings a pound of his fist on the TV.

				CARL
		...  TV doesn't even ... plug me
		in, man...  Gimmee a - DAMMIT! -
		signal...  Plug me into the
		ozone, baby...  Plug me into the
		ozone - FUCK!...

	With one last bang we cut:

	BACK TO THE TELEVISION SET

	In extreme close-up an insect is lugging a worm.

				TV VOICE-OVER
		The bark beetle carries the worm
		to the nest ... where it will feed
		its young for up to six weeks...

	A pull back from the screen reveals that we are in Marge's
	house.

	Marge and Norm are watching television in bed.  From the TV
	we hear insects chirring.

	After a long beat, silence except for the TV, Marge murmurs,
	still looking at the set:

				MARGE
		...  Well, I'm turnin' in, Norm.

	Also looking at the TV:

				NORM
		...  Oh, yah?

	Marge rolls over and Norm continues to watch.

	We hold.

	BLACK

	Hold.

	A snowflake drops through the black.

	Another flake.

	It starts snowing.

	BRAINERD MAIN STREET

	The lone traffic light blinks slowly, steadily, red.  Snow
	sifts down.  There is no other movement.

	PAUL BUNYAN

	We are looking up at the bottom-lit statue.  Snow falls.

	HIGH SHOT OF MARGE'S HOUSE

	Snow drops away.

	HIGH SHOT IN MARGE'S BEDROOM

	The bedroom is dark.  Norm is snoring.

	The phone rings.

	Marge gropes in the dark.

				MARGE
		Hello?

				VOICE
		Yah, is this Marge?

				MARGE
		Yah?

				VOICE
		Margie Olmstead?

				MARGE
		...  Well, yah.  Who's this?

				VOICE
		This is Mike Yanagita.  Ya know
		- Mike Yanagita.  Remember me?

				MARGE
		...  Mike Yanagita!

				MIKE
		Yah!

	Marge props herself up next to the still-sleeping Norm.

				MARGE
		Yah, yah, course I remember.
		How are ya?  What time is it?

				MIKE
		Oh, geez.  It's quarter to eleven.
		I hope I dint wake you.

				MARGE
		No, that's okay.

				MIKE
		Yah, I'm down in the Twin Cities
		and I was just watching on TV
		about these shootings up in
		Brainderd, and I saw you on the
		news there.

				MARGE
		Yah.

				MIKE
		I thought, geez, is that Margie
		Olmstead?  I can't believe it!

				MARGE
		Yah, that's me.

				MIKE
		Well, how the heck are ya?

				MARGE
		Okay, ya know.  Okay.

				MIKE
		Yah?

				MARGE
		Yah - how are you doon?

				MIKE
		Oh, pretty good.

				JERRY
		Yah, okay.

	JERRY'S CUBICLE

	He sits in and picks up his phone.

				JERRY
		Jerry Lundegaard.

				VOICE
		All right, Jerry, you got this
		phone to yourself?

				JERRY
		Well ... yah.

				VOICE
		Know who this is?

				JERRY
		Well, yah, I got an idea.  How's

				VOICE
		Circumstances have changed, Jerry.

				JERRY
		Well, what do ya mean?

				VOICE
		Things have changed.  Circumstances,
		Jerry.  Beyond the, uh ... acts of
		God, force majeure...

				JERRY

	A beat.

				JERRY
		My wife!  What the - how's -

		aren't so okay, I'll tell ya that.

				JERRY
		What the heck're you talkin' about?
		Let's just finish up this deal
		here -

				CARL
		Blood has been shed, Jerry.

	Jerry sits dumbly.  The voice solemnly repeats:

				CARL
		...  Blood has been shed.

				JERRY
		What the heck d'ya mean?

				CARL
		Three people.  In Brainerd.

				JERRY
		Oh, geez.

				CARL
		That's right.  And we need more
		money.

				JERRY
		The heck d'ya mean?  What a you

				CARL
		We need more -

				JERRY
		This was s'posed to be a no-rough

				JERRY
		Well, I'm sorry, but I just - I -

				CARL
		Look.  I'm not gonna debate you,

		thousand.

				JERRY
		Oh, for Chrissakes here -

				CARL
		Blood has been shed.  We've incurred
		risks, Jerry.  I'm coming into town

				JERRY
		Now we had a deal here!  A deal's

				CARL
		IS IT, JERRY?  You ask those three

		deal's a deal!  Go ahead, ask 'em!

				JERRY
		...  The heck d'ya mean?

				CARL
		I'll see you tomorrow.

	Click.

	Jerry slams down the phone, which immediately rings.  He
	angrily snatches it up.

				JERRY
		Yah!

				VOICE
		Jerome Lundegaard?

				JERRY
		Yah!

				VOICE
		This is Reilly Deifenbach at GMAC.
		Sir, I have not yet recieved those
		vehicle IDs you promised me.

				JERRY
		Yah!  I ... those are in the mail.

				VOICE
		Mr. Lundegaard, that very well may

				JERRY
		Yah.

				VOICE
		My patience is at an end.

				JERRY
		Yah.

				VOICE
		Good day, sir.

				JERRY
		...  Yah.

	WIDE ON THE CUBICLE

	We are looking at Jerry's cubicle from across the showroom.
	Noise muted by distance, we watch Jerry slam down the
	reciever, rise to his feet, fling the phone to the floor,
	raise his desk blotter high over his head with pens and
	pencils rolling off it and slam it onto his desktop.

	He stands for a moment, hands on hips, glaring.

	He stoops and picks up the phone, places it back on the
	desktop, starts picking up the pens and pencils.

	TRACK

	On steam-table bins of food, each identified by a plaque:
	BEEF STROGANOFF, SWEDISH MEATBALLS, BROILED TORSK, CHICKEN
	FLORENTINE.

	A complementary track shows two rays being pushed along a
	buffet line, piled high with many foods.

	MARGE AND NORM AT A TABLE

	They sit next to each other at a long cafateria-style
	Formica table, silently eating.

	A hip with a hissing walkie-talkie enters frame.

				GARY
		Hiya, Norm.  How ya doin', Margie?
		How's the fricasse?

				MARGE
		Pretty darn good, ya want some?

				GARY
		No, I gotta - hey, Norm, I thought
		you were goin' fishin' up at Mile
		Lacs?

				NORM
		Yah, after lunch.

	He goes back to his food.

				MARGE
		Whatcha got there?

	Gary hands her a flimsy.  Marge takes it with one hand and
	looks, her other hand frozen with a forkful of food.

				GARY
		The numbers y'asked for, calls
		made from the lobby pay phone
		at the Blue Ox.  Two to Minneapolis
		that night.

				MARGE
		Mm.

				GARY
		First one's a trucking company,
		second one's a private residence.
		A Shep Proudfoot.

				MARGE
		Uh-huh...  A what?

				GARY
		Shep Proudfoot.  That's a name.

				MARGE
		Uh-huh.

				GARY
		Yah.

				MARGE
		...  Yah, okay, I think I'll
		drive down there, then.

				GARY
		Oh, yah?  Twin Cities?

	Norm, who has been eating steadily throughout, looks over at
	Marge with mild interest.  He stares for a beat as he
	finishes chewing, and them swallows and says:

				NORM
		...  Oh, yah?

	KITCHEN OF LUNDEGAARD HOUSE

	Jerry, Wade, and Stan Grossman sit around the kitchen table.
	It is night.  The scene is harshly toplit by a hanging
	fixture.  On the table are the remains of coffee and a
	cinammon filbert ring.

				WADE
		Dammit!  I wanna be a part a
		this thing!

				JERRY
		No, Wade!  They were real clear!
		They said they'd call tomorrow,
		with instructions, and it's gonna
		be delivered by me alone!

				WADE
		It's my money, I'll deliver it
		- what do they care?

				STAN
		Wade's got a point there.  I'll
		handle the call if you want, Jerry.

				JERRY
		No, no.  See - they, no, see, they
		only deal with me.  Ya feel this,
		this nervousness on the phone there,
		they're very - these guys're
		dangerous -

				WADE
		All the more reason!  I don't want
		you - with all due respect, Jerry
		- I don't want you mucking this up.

				JERRY
		The heck d'ya mean?

				WADE
		They want my money, they can deal
		with me.  Otherwise I'm goin' to
		a professional.

	He points at a briefcase.

				WADE
		...  There's a million dollars
		here!

				JERRY
		No, see -

				WADE
		Look, Jerry, you're not sellin'
		me a damn car.  It's my show here.
		That's that.

				STAN
		It's the way we prefer to handle
		it, Jerry.

	THE DOWNTOWN RADISSON HOTEL

	Marge is at the reception desk.

				MARGE
		How ya doin'?

				CLERK
		Real good.  How're you today, ma'am?

				MARGE
		Real good.  I'm Mrs. Gunderson, I
		have a reservation.

	The clerk types into a computer console.

				CLERK
		You sure do, Mrs. Gunderson.

				MARGE
		Is there a phone down here, ya think?

	LOBBY CORNER

	Marge is on a public phone.

				MARGE
		...  Detective Sibert?  Yah, this
		is Marge Gunderson from up Brainerd,
		we spoke -  Yah.  Well, actually
		I'm in town here.  I had to do a
		few things in the Twin Cities, so
		I thought I'd check in with ya about
		that USIF search on Shep Proudfoot...
		Oh, yah?...  Well, maybe I'll go
		visit with him if I have the...  No,
		I can find that...  Well, thanks a
		bunch.  Say, d'ya happen to know a
		good place for lunch in the downtown
		area?...  Yah, the Radisson...  Oh,
		yah?  Is it reasonable?

	A GREEN FREEWAY SIGN

	Through a windshield we see a sign for the MINNEAPOLIS
	INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT.

	ROOFTOP PARKING LOT

	The brown Ciera enters and drives lazy S-curves around the
	few snow-covered cars parked on the roof of the lot.

	It stops by one car and Carl emerges.  He quickly scans the
	lot, then kneels in the snow at the back of the parked car
	and starts unscrewing its license plate.

	EXIT BOOTH

	Carl pulls up and hands the attendant his ticket.

				CARL
		Yeah, I decided not to park here.

	The attendant frowns uncomprehendingly at the ticket.

				ATTENDANT
		...  What do you mean, you decided
		not to park here?

				CARL
		Yeah, I just came in.  I decided
		not to park here.

	The attendant is still puzzled.

				ATTENDANT
		You, uh...  I'm sorry, sir, but -

				CARL
		I decided not to - I'm, uh, not
		taking the trip as it turns out.

				ATTENDANT
		I'm sorry, sir, we do have to
		charge you the four dollars.

				CARL
		I just pulled in here.  I just
		fucking pulled in here!

				ATTENDANT
		Well, see, there's a minimum charge
		of four dollars.  Long-term parking
		charges by the day.

	A car behind beeps.  Carl glances back, starts digging for
	money.

				CARL
		I guess you think, ya know, you're
		an authority figure.  With that
		stupid fucking uniform.  Huh, buddy?

	The attendant doesn't say anything.

				CARL
		...  King Clip-on Tie here.  Big
		fucking man.

	He is peeling off one dollar bills.

				CARL
		...  You know, these are the limits
		of your life, man.  Ruler of your
		little fucking gate here.  There's
		your four dollars.  You pathetic
		piece of shit.

	GUSTAFSON OLDS GARAGE

	Jerry is staring up, mouth agape, at the underside of a car
	on a hydraulic lift.  Bewildered, he looks about, then asks
	a mechanic passing by, his voice raised over the din of the
	shop.

				JERRY
		Where's Shep?

	The mechanic points.

				MECHANIC
		Talkin' to a cop.

	Jerry looks.

				JERRY
		...  Cop?

	Marge and Shep face each other at the other end of the floor
	in a grimy and cluttered glassed-in cubicle.

				MECHANIC
		Said she was a policewoman.

	Marge and Shep silently talk.

	Jerry stares, swallows.

	INSIDE THE CUBICLE

				MARGE
		- Wednesday night?

	Shep is shaking his head.

				SHEP
		Nope.

				MARGE
		Well, you do reside their at
		1425 Fremont Terrace?

				SHEP
		Yep.

				MARGE
		Anyone else residing there?

				SHEP
		Nope.

				MARGE
		Well, Mr. Proudfoot, this call
		came in past three in the morning.
		It's just hard for me to believe
		you can't remember anyone calling.

	Shep says nothing.

				MARGE
		...  Now, I know you've had some
		problems, struggling with the
		narcotics, some other entanglements,
		currently on parole -

				SHEP
		So?

				MARGE
		Well, associating with criminals,
		if you're the one they talked to,
		that right there would be a
		violation of your parole and would
		end with you back in Stillwater.

				SHEP
		Uh-huh.

				MARGE
		Now, I saw some rough stuff on
		your priors, but nothing in the
		nature of a homicide...

	Shep stares at her.

				MARGE
		...  I know you don't want to be
		an accessory to something like
		that.

				SHEP
		Nope.

				MARGE
		So you think you might remember
		who those folks were who called
		ya?

	JERRY'S OFFICE

	Jerry is worriedly pacing behind his desk.  At a noise he
	looks up.

	Marge has stuck her head in the door.

				MARGE
		Mr. Lundegaard?

				JERRY
		Huh?  Yah?

				MARGE
		I wonder if I could take just a
		minute of your time here -

				JERRY
		What...  What is it all about?

				MARGE
		Huh?  Do you mind if I sit down
		- I'm carrying quite a load here.

	Marge plops into the chair opposite him.

				MARGE
		...  You're the owner here, Mr.
		Lundegaard?

				JERRY
		Naw, I...  Executive Sales Manager.

				MARGE
		Well, you can help me.  My name's
		Marge Gunderson -

				JERRY
		My father-in-law, he's the owner.

				MARGE
		Uh-huh.  Well, I'm a police officer
		from up Brainerd investigating some
		malfeasance and I was just wondering
		if you've had any new vehicles stolen
		off the lot in the past couple of
		weeks - specifically a tan Cutlass
		Ciera?

	Jerry stares at her, his mouth open.

				MARGE
		...  Mr. Lundegaard?

				JERRY
		...  Brainerd?

				MARGE
		Yah.  Yah.  Home a Paul Bunyan and
		Babe the Blue Ox.

				JERRY
		...  Babe the Blue Ox?

				MARGE
		Yah, ya know we've got the big
		statue there.  So you haven't had
		any vehicles go missing, then?

				JERRY
		No.  No, ma'am.

				MARGE
		Okey-dokey, thanks a bunch.  I'll
		let you get back to your paperwork,
		then.

	As Marge rises, Jerry looks blankly down at the papers on
	the desk in front of him.

				JERRY
		...  Yah, okay.

	He looks up at Marge's retreating back.  He looks back down
	at the papers.  He looks over at the phone.

	he picks up the phone and dials four digits.

				JERRY
		...  Yah, gimmee Shep...  The
		heck d'ya mean?...  Well, where'd
		he go?  It's only...  No, I don't
		need a mechanic - oh, geez - I
		gotta talk to a friend of his, so,
		uh ... have him, uh ... oh, geez...

	HOTEL BAR

	Marge enters.  She looks around the bar, a rather
	characterless, lowlit meeting place for business people.

				VOICE
		Marge?

	It is a bald, paunching man of about Marge's age, rising
	from a booth halfway back.  His features are broad,
	friendly, Asian-American.

				MARGE
		Mike!

	He approaches somewhat carefully, as if on his second drink.
	They hug and head back toward the booth.

				MIKE
		Geez!  You look great!

				MARGE
		Yah - easy there - you do too!
		I'm expecting, ya know.

				MIKE
		I see that!  That's great!

	A waitress meets them at the table.

				MIKE
		...  What can I get ya?

				MARGE
		Just a Diet Coke.

	Again she glances about.

				MARGE
		...  This is a nice place.

				MIKE
		Yah, ya know it's the Radisson,
		so it's pretty good.

				MARGE
		You're livin' in Edina, then?

				MIKE
		Oh, yah, couple years now.  It's
		actually Eden Prarie - that school
		district.  So Chief Gunderson, then!
		So ya went and married Norm Son-of-
		a-Gunderson!

				MARGE
		Oh, yah, a long time ago.

				MIKE
		Great.  What brings ya down - are
		ya down here on that homicide -
		if you're allowed, ya know, to
		discuss that?

				MARGE
		Oh, yah, but there's not a heckuva
		lot to discuss.  What about you,
		Mike?  Are you married - you have
		kids?

				MIKE
		Well, yah, I was married.  I was
		married to -  You mind if I sit
		over here?

	He is sliding out of his side of the booth and easing in
	next to Marge.

				MIKE
		...  I was married to Linda
		Cooksey -

				MARGE
		No, I -  Mike - wyncha sit over
		there, I'd prefer that.

				MIKE
		Huh?  Oh, okay, I'm sorry.

				MARGE
		No, just so I can see ya, ya know.
		Don't have to turn my neck.

				MIKE
		Oh, sure, I unnerstand, I didn't
		mean to -

				MARGE
		No, no, that's fine.

				MIKE
		Yah, sorry, so I was married to
		Linda Cooksey - ya remember Linda?
		She was a year behind us.

				MARGE
		I think I remember Linda, yah.
		She was - yah.  So things didn't
		work out, huh?

				MIKE
		And then I, and then I been workin'
		for Honeywell for a few years now.

				MARGE
		Well, they're a good outfit.

				MIKE
		Yah, if you're an engineer, yah,
		you could do a lot worse.  Of
		course, it's not, uh, it's
		nothin' like your achievement.

				MARGE
		It sounds like you're doin' really
		super.

				MIKE
		Yah, well, I, uh ... it's not that
		it didn't work out -  Linda passed
		away.  She, uh...

				MARGE
		I'm sorry.

				MIKE
		Yah, I, uh...  She had leukemia,
		you know...

				MARGE
		No, I didn't...

				MIKE
		It was a tough, uh ... it was a
		long -  She fought real hard,
		Marge...

				MARGE
		I'm sorry, Mike.

				MIKE
		Oh, ya know, that's, uh - what
		can I say?...

	He holds up his drink.

				MIKE
		...  Better times, huh?

	Marge clinks it.

				MARGE
		Better times.

				MIKE
		I was so...  I been so ... and
		then I saw you on TV, and I
		remembered, ya know...  I always
		liked you...

				MARGE
		Well, I always liked you, Mike.

				MIKE
		I always liked ya so much...

				MARGE
		It's okay, Mike -  Should we get
		together another time, ya think?

				MIKE
		No - I'm sorry!  It's just -  I
		been so lonely - then I saw you,
		and...

	He is weeping.

				MIKE
		...  I'm sorry...  I shouldn't a
		done this...  I thought we'd have
		a really terrific time, and now
		I've...

				MARGE
		It's okay...

				MIKE
		You were such a super lady ...
		and then I...  I been so lonely...

				MARGE
		It's okay, Mike...

	CARLTON CELEBRITY ROOM

	Carl Showalter is sitting at a small table with a tarty-
	looking blonde in a low-cut gown.  Each holds a drink.

				CARL
		Just in town on business.  Just
		in and out.  Ha ha!  A little of
		the old in-and-out!

				WOMAN
		Wuddya do?

	Carl looks around.

				CARL
		Have ya been to the Celebrity Room
		before?  With other, uh, clients?

				WOMAN
		I don't think so.  It's nice.

				CARL
		Yeah, well, it depends on the artist.
		You know, Jose Feliciano, ya got no
		complaints.  Waiter!

	The reverse shows a disappearing waiter and the backs of
	many, many people sitting at tables between us and the very
	distant stage.  Jose Feliciano, very small, performs on a
	spotlit stool.  The acoustics are poor.

	Carl grimaces.

				CARL
		...  What is he, deaf?...  So,
		uh, how long have you been with
		the escort service?

				WOMAN
		I don't know.  Few munce.

				CARL
		Ya find the work interesting, do ya?

				WOMAN
		...  What're you talking about?

	A DIRTY BEDROOM

	Carl is humping the escort.

	We hear the door burst open.

	The escort is grabbed and flung out of bed.

				CARL
		Shep!  What the hell are you doing?
		I'm banging that girl!  Shep!  Jesus
		Ch -

	Shep slaps him hard, forehand, backhand.

				SHEP
		Fuck out of my house!

	He hauls him up -

				CARL
		Shep!  Don't you dare fucking hit
		me, man!  Don't you -

	- punches him and flings him away.

	Carl hits a sofa and we see his bare legs disappear as he
	flips back over it.

	Shep enters frame to circle the sofa and kick at Carl behind
	it.

				SHEP
		Fuck outta here.  Put me back in
		Stillwater.  Little fucking shit.

	There is a knock at the door.

				VOICE
		Hey!  Come on in there!

	Shep strides to the door, flings it open.

	A man in boxer shorts stands in the doorway.

				MAN
		C'mon, brother, it's late -  Unghh!

	Shep hits him twice, then grabs both of his ears and starts
	banging his head against the wall.

	The hooker runs by, clutching her clothes, and Shep kicks
	her in the ass as she passes.

	He spins and goes back into the apartment.

	Carl is hopping desperately into his pants.

				CARL
		Stay away from me, man!  Hey!
		Smoke a fuckin' peace pipe, man!
		Don't you dare fuckin' -  Unghh!

	After hitting him several times, Shep yanks Carl's belt out
	of his dangling pants and strangles him with it.  Carl
	gurgles.  Shep knees Carl repeatedly, then dumps him onto
	the floor and starts whipping him with the buckle end of the
	belt.

	CHAIN RESTAURANT PHONE BOOTH

	Carl listens to the phone ring at the other end.  His face
	is deeply bruised and cut.

	Finally, through the phone...

				VOICE
		...  Yah?

				CARL
		All right, Jerry, I'm through
		fucking around.  You got the
		fucking money?

	JERRY'S KITCHEN

	Jerry is at the kitchen phone.  Through the door to the
	dining room we see Wade picking up an extension.

				JERRY
		Yah, I got the money, but, uh -

				CARL
		Don't you fucking but me, Jerry.
		I want you with this money on the
		Dayton-Radisson parking ramp, top
		level, thirty minutes, and we'll
		wrap this up.

				JERRY
		Yah, okay, but, uh -

				CARL
		You're there in thirty minutes or
		I find you, Jerry, and I shoot
		you, and I shoot your fucking wife,
		and I shoot all your little fucking
		children, and I shoot 'em all in the
		back of their little fucking heads.
		Got it?

				JERRY
		...  Yah, well, you stay away from
		Scotty now -

				CARL
		GOT IT?

				JERRY
		Okay, real good, then.

	The line goes dead.

	A door slams offscreen.

	EXT. HOUSE

	Wade, briefcase in hand, gets into his Cadillac, slams the
	door and peels out.

	INT. CAR

	Wade's jaw works as he glares out at traffic.  He mumbles to
	himself as he drives.

				WADE
		Okay ... here's your damn money,
		now where's my daughter?...
		Goddamn punk ... where's my damn
		daughter...

	He pulls out a gun, cracks the barrel, peers in.

				WADE
		...  You little punk.

	JERRY'S HOUSE

	Jerry sits in the foyer, trying to pull on pair of galoshes.
	Scotty's voice comes from upstairs:

				VOICE
		...  Dad?

				JERRY
		It's okay, Scotty.

				VOICE
		Where're you going?

				JERRY
		Be back in a minute.  If Stan
		calls you, just tell him I went
		to Embers.  Oh, geez -

	Thunk! - his first boot goes on.

	RADISSON

	Marge sits on the bed in her hotel room, shoes off,
	massaging her feet.  The phone is pressed to her ear, and
	through it, we hear ringing.

				VOICE
		...  Hello?

				MARGE
		Norm?

	MILLE LACS LAKE

	It is late evening, blowing storm.  A leisurely pan across
	the bleak gray expanse finds a little hut in the middle of
	the frozen lake with a pickup truck parked next to it.

				MARGE'S VOICE
		They bitin'?

	INT. HUT

	Norm has a cellular phone to his ear.  His feet are
	stretched out to an electric heater.  The interior is bathed
	in soft orange light.

				NORM
		Yah, okay.  How's the hotel?

				MARGE
		Oh, pretty good.  They bitin'?

				NORM
		Yeah, couple a muskies.  No pike
		yet.  How d'you feel?

				MARGE
		Oh, fine.

				NORM
		Not on your feet too much?

				MARGE
		No, no.

				NORM
		You shouldn't be on your feet too
		much, you got weight you're not
		used too.  How's the food down
		there?

				MARGE
		Had dinner at a place called the
		King's Table.  Buffet style.  It
		was pretty darn good.

				NORM
		Was it reasonable?

				MARGE
		Yah, not too bad.  So it's nice
		up there?

				NORM
		Yah, it's good.  No pike yet, but
		it's good.

	DAYTON-RADISSON RAMP

	The top, open, level.  Snow blows.  A car sits idling.

	Another car pulls onto the roof.  It creeps over to the
	parked car and stops.  It continues to idle as its door
	opens and Wade steps out, carrying the briefcase.

	The door of the other car bangs open and Carl bounces out.

				CARL
		Who the fuck are you?  Who the
		fuck are you?

				WADE
		I got your goddamn money, you
		little punk.  Now where's my
		daughter?

				CARL
		I am through fucking around!  Drop
		that fucking briefcase!

				WADE
		Where's my daughter?

				CARL
		Fuck you, man!  Where's Jerry?  I
		gave SIMPLE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS -

				WADE
		Where's my damn daughter?  No
		Jean, no money!

				CARL
		Drop that fucking money!

				WADE
		No Jean, no money!

				CARL
		Is this a fucking joke here?

	He pulls out a gun and fires into Wade's gut.

				CARL
		...  Is this a fucking joke?

				WADE
		Unghh ... oh, geez...

	He is on the pavement, clutching at his gut.  Snow swirls.

				CARL
		You fucking imbeciles!

	He bends down next to Wade to pick up the briefcase.

				WADE
		Oh, for Christ ... oh, geez...

	Wade brings out his gun and fires at Carl's head, close by.

				CARL
		Oh!

	Carl stumbles and falls back, and then stands up again.  His
	jaw is gouting blood.

				CARL
		...  Owwmm...

	One hand pressed to his jaw, he fires down at Wade several
	times.  Blood streams through the hand pressed to his jaw.

				CARL
		...  Mmmmmphnck!  He fnkem shop me...

	He pockets the gun, picks up the briefcase one-handed,
	flings it into his car, gets in, peels out.

	DOWN RAMP

	Carl screams down the ramp.  He takes a corner at high speed
	and swerves, just missing Jerry in his Olds on his way to
	the top.

	INT. JERRY'S CAR

	Jerry recovers from the near miss and continues up.

				JERRY
		Oh, geez!

	EXIT BOOTH

	Carl squeals to a halt at the gate, still pressing his hand
	to his bleeding jaw.

				CARL
		Ophhem ma fuchem gaphe!

				ATTENDANT
		May I have your ticket, please?

	RAMP ROOF

	Jerry pulls to a halt next to Wade's idling Cadillac.  He
	gets out and walks slowly to Wade's body, prostrate in the
	swirling snow.

				JERRY
		Oh!  Oh, geez!

	He bends down, picks Wade up by the armpits and drags him
	over to the back of the Cadillac.  He drops Wade's body,
	walks to the driver's side of the car, pulls the keys and
	walks back to pop the trunk.  He wrestles Wade's body into
	the trunk, slams it shut and walks back to the scene of the
	shooting.

	He kicks at the snow with his galoshed feet, trying to hide
	the fresh bloodstains.

	EXIT BOOTH

	Jerry approaches in the Cadillac.

	The wooden gate barring the exit has been broken away.  The
	booth is empty.

	Jerry eases toward the street, looking over at the booth as
	he passes.

	Inside the booth we see the awkwardly angled leg of a
	prostrate body.

	EXT. JERRY'S HOUSE

	The car pulls into the driveway.

	FOYER

	Jerry enters and sits on the foyer chair to take off his
	galoshes.

				SCOTT'S VOICE
		...  Dad?

				JERRY
		Yah.

				SCOTT'S VOICE
		Stan Grossman called.

				JERRY
		Yah, okay.

				SCOTT'S VOICE
		Twice.

				JERRY
		Okay.

				SCOTT'S VOICE
		...  Is everything okay?

				JERRY
		Yah.

	Thoonk - the first boot comes off.

				SCOTT'S VOICE
		Are you calling Stan?

				JERRY
		Well...  I'm goin' ta bed now.

	CARL'S CAR

	Carl mumbles as he drives, underlit by the dim dash lights,
	one hand now holding a piece of rag to his shredded jaw.

				CARL
		...  Fnnkn ashlzh...  Fnk...

	ROAD

	Carl's car roars into frame, violently swirling the snow.
	Its red tail lights fishtail away.

	FADE OUT

	HOLD IN BLACK

	HARD CUT TO:  BRIGHT - LOOKING THROUGH A WINDSHIELD

	It is a starky sunny day.  We are cruising down a street of
	humble lookalike houses.

	We pan right as we draw toward one house in particular.  In
	its driveway a man in a hooded parka shovels snow.  He
	notices the approaching car and gives its driver a wave.

	The driver is Gary, the Brainderd police officer.  He gives
	a finger-to-the-head salute and pulls over.

	OUTSIDE

	Gary slams his door shut and the other man plants his shovel
	in the snow.

				MAN
		How ya doin'?

				GARY
		Mr. Mohra?

				MAN
		Yah.

				GARY
		Officer Olson.

				MAN
		Yah, right-o.

	The two men caucus the driveway without shaking hands and
	without standing particularly close.  They stand stiffly,
	arms down at their sides and breath streaming out of their
	parka hoods.  Each has an awkward leaning-away posture, head
	drawn slightly back and chin tucked in, to keep his face
	from protruding into the cold.

				MAN
		...  So, I'm tendin' bar there at
		Ecklund && Swedlin's last Tuesday
		and this little guy's drinkin'
		and he says, 'So where can a guy
		find some action - I'm goin' crazy
		down there at the lake.'  And I
		says, 'What kinda action?' and he
		says, 'Woman action, what do I
		look like,'  And I says 'Well,
		what do I look like, I don't
		arrange that kinda thing,' and he
		says, 'I'm goin' crazy out there
		at the lake' and I says, 'Well,
		this ain't that kinda place.'

				GARY
		Uh-huh.

				MAN
		So he says, 'So I get it, so you
		think I'm some kinda jerk for
		askin',' only he doesn't use the
		word jerk.

				GARY
		I unnerstand.

				MAN
		And then he calls me a jerk and
		says the last guy who thought he
		was a jerk was dead now.  So I
		don't say nothin' and he says, 'What
		do ya think about that?'  So I
		says, 'Well, that don't sound like
		too good a deal for him then.'

				GARY
		Ya got that right.

				MAN
		And he says, 'Yah, that guy's dead
		and I don't mean a old age.'  And
		then he says, 'Geez, I'm goin'
		crazy out there at the lake.'

				GARY
		White Bear Lake?

				MAN
		Well, Ecklund && Swedlin's, that's
		closer ta Moose Lake, so I made
		that assumption.

				GARY
		Oh sure.

				MAN
		So, ya know, he's drinkin', so I
		don't think a whole great deal of
		it, but Mrs. Mohra heard about the
		homicides out here and she thought
		I should call it in, so I called
		it in.  End a story.

				GARY
		What'd this guy look like anyways?

				MAN
		Oh, he was a little guy, kinda
		funny-lookin'.

				GARY
		Uh-huh - in what way?

				MAN
		Just a general way.

				GARY
		Okay, well, thanks a bunch, Mr.
		Mohra.  You're right, it's probably
		nothin', but thanks for callin'
		her in.

				MAN
		Oh sure.  They say she's gonna
		turn cold tomorrow.

				GARY
		Yah, got a front movin' in.

				MAN
		Ya got that right.

	CLOSE ON CARL SHOWALTER

	In his car, now parked, one hand holding the rag pressed to
	his mangled jaw.  He is staring down at something in the
	front seat next to him.

	His other hand holds open the briefcase.  It has money
	inside - a lot of money.

	Carl unfreezes, takes out one of the bank-wrapped wads and
	looks at it.

				CARL
		...  Mmmnphh.

	He paws through the money in the briefcase to get a feeling
	for the amount.

				CARL
		...  Jeshush Shrist...  Jeshush
		fuchem Shrist!

	Excited, he counts out a bundle of bills and tosses it onto
	the back seat.

	He starts to take the rag away from his chin but the layer
	pressed against his face sticks, its loose weave bound to
	his skin by clotted blood.

	He pulls very gently and winces as blood starts to flow
	again.

	He carefully tears the rag in half so that only a bit of it
	remains adhering to his jaw.

	EXT. CAR

	It is pulled over to the side of an untraveled road.  THe
	door opens and Carl emerges with the briefcase.

	He slogs through the snow, down a gulley and up the
	embankment to a barbed-wire fence.  He kneels at one of the
	fence posts and frantically digs into the snow with his bare
	hands, throws in the briefcase and covers it back up.

	He stands and tries to beat the circulation back into his
	red, frozen hands.

	He looks to the right.

	A regular line of identical fence posts stretches away
	against unblemished white.

	He looks to the left.

	A regular line of identical fence posts stretches away
	against unblemished white.

	He looks at the fence post in front of him.

				CARL
		Mmmphh...

	He looks about the snowy vastness for a marker.  Finding
	none, he kicks the fence post a couple of times, failing to
	scar or tilt it, then hurriedly plants a couple of sicks up
	against the post.

	He bends down, scoops up a handful of snow, presses it
	against his wounded jaw, and lopes back to the idling car.

	HOTEL ROOM

	Marge has a packed overnight back sitting on the unmade bed.
	She is ready to leave, already wearing her parka, but is on
	the phone.

				MARGE
		No, I'm leavin' this mornin', back
		up to Brainerd.

				VOICE
		Well, I'm sorry I won't see ya.

				MARGE
		Mm.  But ya think he's all right?
		I saw him last night and he's -

				VOICE
		What'd he say?

				MARGE
		Well, it was nothin' specific
		he said, it just seemd like it
		all hit him really hard, his
		wife dyin' -

				VOICE
		His wife?

				MARGE
		Linda.

				VOICE
		No.

				MARGE
		Linda Cooksey?

				VOICE
		No.  No.  No.  They weren't -
		he, uh, he was bothering Linda
		for about, oh, for a good year.
		Really pestering her, wouldn't
		leave her alone.

				MARGE
		So ... they didn't...

				VOICE
		No.  No.  They never married.
		Mike's had psychiatric problems.

				MARGE
		Oh.  Oh, my.

				VOICE
		Yah, he - he's been struggling.
		He's living with his parents now.

				MARGE
		Oh.  Geez.

				VOICE
		Yah, Linda's fine.  You should
		call her.

				MARGE
		Geez.  Well - geez.  That's a
		suprise.

	MARGE'S CAR

	Marge drives, gazing out at the road.

	MARGE AT A DRIVE-THROUGH

	She leans out of her open window and yells at the order
	panel:

				MARGE
		Hello?

	MARGE AT THE GUSTAFSON OLDS GARAGE

	She sits in the lot, eating a breakfast sandwich.

	JERRY LUNDEGAARD'S OFFICE

	Jerry is at his desk using a blunt pencil to enter numbers
	onto a form.  Beneath the form is a piece of carbon paper
	and beneath that another form copy, which Jerry periodically
	checks.  The carbon-copy form shows thick smudgy, illegible
	entries.

	Jerry hums nervously.

	Glass rattles as someone taps at his door.

	Jerry looks up and freezes, mouth hanging open, brow knit
	with worry.

	Marge sticks her head in the door.

				MARGE
		Mr. Lundegaard?  Sorry to bother
		you again.  Can I come in?

	She starts to enter.

				JERRY
		Yah, no, I'm kinda - I'm kinda
		busy -

				MARGE
		I unnerstand.  I'll keep it real
		short, then.  I'm on my way out
		of town, but I was just -  Do you
		mind if I sit down?  I'm carrying
		a bit of a load here.

				JERRY
		No, I -

	But she is already sitting into the chair opposite with a
	sigh of relieved weight.

				MARGE
		Yah, it's this vehicle I asked you
		about yesterday.  I was just
		wondering -

				JERRY
		Yah, like I told ya, we haven't had
		any vehicles go missing.

				MARGE
		Okay, are you sure, cause, I mean,
		how do you know?  Because, see,
		the crime I'm investigating, the
		perpetrators were driving a car
		with dealer plates.  And they
		called someone who works here, so
		it'd be quite a coincidence if
		they weren't, ya know, connected.

				JERRY
		Yah, I see.

				MARGE
		So how do you - have you done any
		kind of inventory recently?

				JERRY
		The car's not from our lot, ma'am.

				MARGE
		but do you know that for sure
		without -

				JERRY
		Well, I would know.  I'm the
		Executive Sales Manager.

				MARGE
		Yah, but -

				JERRY
		We run a pretty tight ship here.

				MARGE
		I know, but - well, how do you
		establish that, sir?  Are the
		cars, uh, counted daily or what
		kind of -

				JERRY
		Ma'am, I answered your question.

	There is a silent beat.

				MARGE
		...  I'm sorry, sir?

				JERRY
		Ma'am, I answered your question.
		I answered the darn -  I'm
		cooperating here, and I...

				MARGE
		Sir, you have no call to get
		snippy with me.  I'm just doin'
		my job here.

				JERRY
		I'm not, uh, I'm not arguin' here.
		I'm cooperating...  There's no, uh
		- we're doin' all we can...

	He trails off into silence.

				MARGE
		Sir, could I talk to Mr. Gustafson?

	Jerry stares at her.

				MARGE
		...  Mr. Lundegaard?

	Jerry explodes:

				JERRY
		Well, heck, if you wanna, if you
		wanna play games here!  I'm
		workin' with ya on this thing, but
		I...

	He is getting angrily off his feet.

				JERRY
		Okay, I'll do a damned lot count!

				MARGE
		Sir?  Right now?

				JERRY
		Sure right now!  You're darned
		tootin'!

	He is yanking his parka from a hook behind the opened door
	and grabbing a pair of galoshes.

				JERRY
		...  If it's so damned imporant
		to ya!

				MARGE
		I'm sorry, sir, I -

	Jerry has the parka slung over one arm and the galoshes
	pinched in his hand.

				JERRY
		Aw, what the Christ!

	He stamps out the door.

	Marge stares.

	After a long moment her stare breaks.  She glances idly
	around the office.

	There is a framed picture facing away from her on the
	desktop.  She turns it to face her.  It is Scotty, holding
	an accordion.  There is another picture of Jean.

	Marge looks at it, looks around, for some reason, at the
	ceiling.

	She looks at a trophy shelf on the wall behind her.

	She fiddles idly with a pencil.  She pulls a clipboard
	toward her.  It holds a form from the General Motors Finance
	Corporation.

	She looks idly around.  Her look abruptly locks.

				MARGE
		...  Oh, for Pete's sake.

	Jerry is easing his car around the near corner of the
	building.

	Marge's voice is flat with dismay:

				MARGE
		...  Oh, for Pete's sake...

	She grabs the phone and punches in a number.

				MARGE
		...  For Pete's s- he's fleein' the
		interview.  He's feelin' the
		interview...

	Jerry makes a left turn into traffic.

				MARGE
		...  Detective Sibert, please...

	POLICE OFFICER

	We are looking across a steam table at a man in blue.  He
	moves slowly to the right, pushing his tray along a
	cafeteria line.  Behind him, in the depth of the room, is an
	eating area of long Formica tables at which sit a mix of
	uniformed and civilian-clothed police and staff.

	We are listening to an offscreen woman's voice.

				WOMAN
		Well, so far we're just saying he's
		wanted for questioning in connection
		with a triple homicide.  Nobody at
		the dealship there's been much help
		guessing where he might go...

	The woman is entering frame sliding a tray.  Marge enters
	behind her, sliding her own.  We move laterally with them as
	they slowly make their way along the line.

				MARGE
		Uh-huh.

				WOMAN
		We called his house; his little
		boy said he hadn't been there.

				MARGE
		And his wife?

				WOMAN
		She's visiting relatives in Florida.
		Now his boss, this guy Gustafson,
		he's also disappeared.  Nobody at
		his office knows where he is.

				MARGE
		Geez.  Looks like this thing goes
		higher than we thought.  You call
		his home?

				WOMAN
		His wife's in the hospital, has
		been for a couple months.  The big C.

				MARGE
		Oh, my.

				WOMAN
		And this Shep Proudfoot character,
		he's a little darling.  He's now
		wanted for assault and parole
		violation.  He clobbered a neighbor
		of his last night and another
		person who could be one of your perps,
		and he's at large.

				MARGE
		Boy, this thing is really ... geez.

				WOMAN
		Well, they're all out on the wire.
		Well, you know...

				MARGE
		Yah.  Well, I just can't thank you
		enough, Detective Sibert, this
		cooperation has been outstanding.

				DETECTIVE SIBERT
		Ah, well, we haven't had to run
		around like you.  When're you due?

				MARGE
		End a April.

				DETECTIVE SIBERT
		Any others?

				MARGE
		This'll be our first.  We've been
		waiting a long time.

				DETECTIVE SIBERT
		That's wonderful.  Mm-mm.  It'll
		change your life, a course.

				MARGE
		Oh, yah, I know that!

				DETECTIVE SIBERT
		They can really take over, that's
		for sure.

				MARGE
		You have children?

	Detective Sibert pulls an accordion of plastic picture
	sleeves from her purse to show Marge.

				DETECTIVE SIBERT
		I thought you'd never ask.  The
		older one is Janet, she's nine, and
		the younger one is Morgan.

				MARGE
		Oh, now he's adorable.

				DETECTIVE SIBERT
		He's three now.  Course, not in that
		picture.

				MARGE
		Oh, he's adorable.

				DETECTIVE SIBERT
		Yah, he -

				MARGE
		Where'd you get him that parka?

	They have reached the end of the cafeteria line.  With a nod
	to the cashier, Detective Sibert indicates hers and Marge's
	trays.

				DETECTIVE SIBERT
		Both of these.

				MARGE
		Oh, no, I can't let you do that.

				DETECTIVE SIBERT
		Oh, don't be silly.

				MARGE
		Well, okay - thank you, Detective.

				DETECTIVE SIBERT
		Oh, don't be silly.

	GAEAR GRIMSRUD

	He sits eating a Swanson's TV dinner from a TV tray he has
	set up in front of an easy chair.

	He watches the old black-and-white TV set whose image - it
	might be a game show - is still heavily ghosting and
	diffused by snow.  The audio crackles with interference.
	Despite the impenetrability of its image, it holds
	Grimsrud's complete attention.

	At the sound of the front door opening, Grimsrud looks up.

	Carl enters, his face suppurating and raw.

	He reacts to Grimsrud's wordless look with a grotesque
	laugh.

				CARL
		You should she zhe uzher guy!

	He glances around.

				CARL
		...  The fuck happen a her?

	Jean sits slumped in a straight-backed chair facing the
	wall.  Her hooded head, resting on her chin, is motionless.
	There is blood on the facing wall.

				GRIMSRUD
		She started shrieking, you know.

				CARL
		Jezhush.

	He shakes his head.

				CARL
		...  Well, I gotta muddy.

	He is plunking down eight bank-wrapped bundles on the table.

				CARL
		...  All of it.  All eighty gran.
		Forty for you...

	He makes one pile, pockets the rest.

				CARL
		...  Forty for me.  Sho thishuzh
		it.  Adiosh.

	He slaps keys down on the table.

				CARL
		...  You c'n'ave my truck.  I'm
		takin' a Shiera.

				GRIMSRUD
		We split that.

	Carl looks at him.

				CARL
		HOW THE FUCK DO WE SHPLITTA FUCKIN'
		CAR?  Ya dummy!  Widda fuckin'
		chainshaw?

	Grimsrud looks sourly up.  There is a beat.  Finally:

				GRIMSRUD
		One of us pays the other for half.

				CARL
		HOLD ON!  NO FUCKIN' WAY!  YOU
		FUCKIN' NOTISH ISH?  I GOT FUCKIN'
		SHOT INNA FAISH!  I WENT'N GOTTA
		FUCKIN' MONEY!  I GET SHOT FUCKIN'
		PICKIN' IT UP!  I BEEN UP FOR
		THIRTY-SHIKSH FUCKIN' HOURZH!  I'M
		TAKIN' THAT FUCKIN' CAR!  THAT
		FUCKERZH MINE!

	Carl waits for an argument, but only gets the steady sour
	look.

	Carl pulls out a gun.

				CARL
		...  YOU FUCKIN' ASH-HOLE!  I
		LISHEN A YOUR BULLSHIT FOR A WHOLE
		FUCKIN' WEEK!

	A beat.  Carl returns Grimsrud's stare.

				CARL
		...  Are we shquare?

	Grimsrud says nothing.

				CARL
		...  ARE WE SHQUARE?

	A beat.

	Disgusted, Carl pockets the gun and heads for the door.

				CARL
		...  Fuckin' ash-hole.  And if
		you shee your friend Shep Proudpfut,
		tell him I'm gonna NAIL hizh
		fuckin' ash.

	OUTSIDE

	We are pulling Carl as he walks toward the car.  Behind him
	we see the cabin door opening.  Carl turns, reacting to the
	sound.

	Grimsrud is bounding out wearing mittens and a red hunter's
	cap, but no overcoat.  He is holding an ax.

	Carl fumbles in his pocket for his gun.

	Grimsrud swings overhand, burying the ax in Carl's neck.

	MARGE

	In her cruiser, on her two-way.  Through it we hear Lou's
	voice, heavily filtered:

				VOICE
		His wife.  This guy says she was
		kidnapped last Wednesday.

				MARGE
		The day of our homicides.

				VOICE
		Yah.

	Marge is peering to one side as she drives, looking through
	the bare trees that border the road on a declivity that runs
	down to a large frozen lake.

				MARGE
		And this guy is...

				VOICE
		Lundegaard's father-in-law's
		accountant.

				MARGE
		Gustafson's accountant.

				VOICE
		Yah.

				MARGE
		But we still haven't found Gustafson.

				VOICE
			(crackle)
		-  looking.

				MARGE
		Sorry - didn't copy.

				VOICE
		Still missing.  We're looking.

				MARGE
		Copy.  And Lundegaard too.

				VOICE
		Yah.  Where are ya, Margie?

	We hear, distant but growing louder, harsh engine noise, as
	of a chainsaw or lawnmower.

				MARGE
		Oh, I'm almost back - I'm driving
		around Moose Lake.

				VOICE
		Oh.  Gary's loudmouth.

				MARGE
		Yah, the loudmouth.  So the whole
		state has it, Lundegaard and
		Gustafson?

				VOICE
		Yah, it's over the wire, it's
		everywhere, they'll find 'em.

				MARGE
		Copy.

				VOICE
		We've got a -

				MARGE
		There's the car!  There's the car!

	We are slowing as we approach a short driveway leading down
	to a cabin.  Parked in front is the brown Cutlass Ciera.

				VOICE
		Whose car?

				MARGE
		My car!  My car!  Tan Ciera!

				VOICE
		Don't go in!  Wait for back-up!

	Marge is straining to look.  The power-tool noise is louder
	here but still muffled, its source not yet visible.

				VOICE
		...  Chief Gunderson?

				MARGE
		Copy.  Yah, send me back-up!

				VOICE
		Yes, ma'am.  Are we the closest PD?

				MARGE
		Yah, Menominie only has Chief Perpich
		and he takes February off to go to
		Boundary Waters.

	ROAD EXTERIOR

	Marge pulls her prowler over some distance past the cabin.
	She gets out, zips up her khaki parka and pulls up its fur-
	lined hood.

	For a moment, she stands listening to the muffled roar of
	the power tool.  Then, with one curved arm half pressing
	against, half supporting her belly, she takes slow, gingerly
	steps down the slope, through the deep snow, through the
	trees angling toward the cabin and the source of the
	grinding noise.

	She slogs from tree to tree, letting each one support her
	downhill-leaning weight for a moment before slogging to the
	next.

	The roar grows louder.  Marge stands panting by one tree,
	her breath vaporizing out of her snorkel hood.  She squints
	down toward the cabin's back lot.

	A tall man with his back to us, wearing a red plaid quilted
	jacket and a hunting cap with earflaps, is laboring over a
	large power tool which his body blocks from view.

	Marge advances.

	The man is forcing downward something which engages the
	roaring power tool and makes harsh spluttering noises.

	The man is Grimsrud, his nose red and eyes watering from the
	cold, hatflaps pulled down over his ears.  His breath steams
	as he sourly goes about his work, both hands pressing down a
	shod foot, as it if were the shaft of a butter churn.

	The roar is very loud.

	Marge slogs down to the next tree, panting, looking.

	Grimsrud forces more of the leg into the machine, which we
	can now see sprays small wet chunks out the bottom.

	Marge's eyes shift.

	A large dark form lies in the snow next to Grimsrud.

	Grimsrud works on, eyes watering.  With a grunt he bends
	down out of frame and then re-enters holding a thick log.
	He uses it to force the leg deeper into the machine.

	Marge is advancing.  She holds a gun extended toward
	Grimsrud, who is still turned away.

	Grimsrud rubs his nose with the back of his hand.

	Marge closes in, grimacing.

	Grimsrud's back strains as he puts his weight into the log
	that pushes down into the machine.

	The dark shape in the snow next to his side is the rest of
	Carl Showalter's body.

	Marge has drawn to within twenty yards.  When she bellows it
	sounds hollow and distant, her voice all but eaten up by the
	roar of the power tool.

				MARGE
		Stop!  Police!  Turn around and
		hands up!

	Startled, Grimsrud scowls.  He turns to face her.

	He stares.

	Marge bellows again:

				MARGE
		...  Hands up!

	Conscious of the noise, she shows with a twist of her
	shoulder the armpatch insignia.

				MARGE
		...  Police!

	Grimsrud stares.

	With a quick twist, he reaches back for the log, hurls it at
	Marge and then starts running away.

	Marge twists her body sideways, shielding herself.

	No need - the heavy log travels perhaps ten yards and lands
	in the snow several feet short of her.

	Grimsrud pants up the hill - slow going through the deep
	snow.

	Behind him:

				MARGE
		...  Halt!

	She fires in the air.

	She lowers the gun and carefully sighs.

				MARGE
		...  Halt!

	She fires.

	Grimsrud still slogs up the hill - a miss.

	Marge sights again.

				MARGE
		...  Halt!

	She fires again.

	Grimsrud pitches forward.  He mutters in Swedish as he
	reaches down to clutch at his wounded leg.

	Marge walks toward him, gun trained on him as her other hand
	reaches under her parka and gropes around her waist.

	It comes out with a pair of handcuffs, which she opens with
	a snap of the wrist.

				MARGE
		...  All right, buddy.  On your
		belly and your hands clasped
		behind you.

	THE CRUISER

	Marge drives.  Grimsrud sits in the back seat, hands cuffed
	behind him.

	For a long moment there, he is quiet - only engine hum and
	the periodic clomp of wheels on pavement seams - as Marge
	grimly shakes her head.

				MARGE
		...  So that was Mrs. Lundegaard
		in there?

	She glances up in the rear-view mirror.

	Grimsrud, cheeks sunk, eyes hollow, looks sourly out at the
	road.

	Marge shakes her head.

	At length:

				MARGE
		...  I guess that was your
		accomplice in the wood chipper.

	Grimsrud's head bobs with bumps on the road; otherwise he is
	motionless, reactionless, scowling and gazing out.

				MARGE
		...  And those three people in
		Brainerd.

	No response.

	Marge, gazing forward, seems to be talking to herself.

				MARGE
		...  And for what?  For a little
		bit of money.

	We hear distant sirens.

				MARGE
		...  There's more to life than money,
		you know.

	She glances up in the rear-view mirror.

				MARGE
		...  Don't you know that?...  And
		here ya are, and it's a beautiful
		day...

	Grimsrud's hollow eyes stare out.

	The sirens are getting louder.  Marge pulls over.

				MARGE
		...  Well...

	She leans forward to the dash to give two short signalling
	WHOOPS on her siren.

	She turns on her flashers.

	She leans back with a creak and jangle of utilities.

	She stares forward, shakes her head.  We hear the dull click
	of her flashers.

				MARGE
		...  I just don't unnerstand it.

	Outside it is snowing.  The sky, the earth, the road - all
	white.

	A squad car, gumballs spinning, punches through the white.
	It approaches in slow motion.

	An ambulance punches through after it.

	Another squad car.

							 FADE OUT:


	FADE IN:

	HIGH AND WIDE ON A SHABBY MOTEL

	It stands next to a highway on a snowy, windslept plain.
	One or two cars dot the parking lot along with an idling
	police cruiser.

	MOTEL ROOM DOORWAY

	We are looking over the shoulders of two uniformed policemen
	who stand on either side of the door, their hands resting
	lightly on their holstered sidearms.  One of them raps at
	the door.

				COP ONE
		Mr. Anderson...

	A title fades in:  OUTSIDE OF BISMARK, NORTH DAKOTA

	After a pause, muffled through the door:

				VOICE
		...  Who?...

				COP ONE
		Mr. Anderson, is this your burgundy
		88 out here?

				VOICE
		...  Just a sec.

				COP ONE
		Could you open the door, please?

				VOICE
		...  Yah.  Yah, just a sec.

	We hear a clatter from inside.

				VOICE
		...  Just a sec...

	One of the policemen unholsters his gun and nods to someone
	whose back enters - a superintendent holding a ring of keys.
	This man turns a key in the door and then stands away.

	The two policemen, guns at the ready, bang into the motel
	room.

	The rough hand-held camera rushes in behind them as the two
	men give the room a two-handed sweep with their guns.

	The room is empty.

	Cop one indicates the open bathroom door.

				COP ONE
		Dale!

	The two men charge the bathroom, belts jingling, guns at the
	ready, jittery camera behind them rushing to keep pace.

	A man in boxer shorts is halfway out the bathroom window.

	The policemen holster their guns and charge the window, and
	drag Jerry Lundegaard back into the room.

	His flesh quivers as he thrashes and keens in short,
	piercing screams.

	The cops wrestle him to the floor but his palsied thrashing
	continues.  The policemen struggle to restrain him.

				COP ONE
		Call an ambulance!

				COP TWO
		You got him okay?

	Cop One pinions Jerry's arms to the floor and Jerry bursts
	into uncontrolled sobbing.

				COP ONE
		Yah, yah, call an ambulance.

	Jerry sobs and screams.

	A BEDROOM

	We are square on Norm, who sits in bed watching television.

	After a long beat, Marge enters frame in a nightie and
	climbs into bed, with some effort.

				MARGE
		Oooph!

	Norm reaches for her hand as both watch the television.

	At length Norm speaks, but keeps his eyes on the TV.

				NORM
		They announced it.

	Marge looks at him.

				MARGE
		They announced it?

				NORM
		Yah.

	Marge looks at him, waiting for more, but Norm's eyes stay
	fixed on the television.

				MARGE
		...  So?

				NORM
		Three-cent stamp.

				MARGE
		Your mallard?

				NORM
		Yah.

				MARGE
		Norm, that's terrific!

	Norm tries to suppress a smile of pleasure.

				NORM
		It's just the three cent.

				MARGE
		It's terrific!

				NORM
		Hautman's blue-winged teal got the
		twenty-nine cent.  People don't
		much use the three-cent.

				MARGE
		Oh, for Pete's - a course they do!
		Every time they raise the darned
		postage, people need the little
		stamps!

				NORM
		Yah.

				MARGE
		When they're stuck with a bunch a
		the old ones!

				NORM
		Yah, I guess.

				MARGE
		That's terrific.

	Her eyes go back to the TV.

				MARGE
		...  I'm so proud a you, Norm.

	Norm murmurs:

				NORM
		I love you, Margie.

				MARGE
		I love you, Norm.

	Both of them are watching the TV as Norm reaches out to rest
	a hand on top of her stomach.

				NORM
		...  Two more months.

	Marge absently rests her own hand on top of his.

				MARGE
		Two more months.

	Hold; fade out.
FARGO
                              a screenplay by
                                Ethan Coen
                                    and
                                 Joel Coen

	The following text fades in over black:

	This is a true story. The events depicted in this film took place
	in Minnesota in 1987. At the request of the survivors, the names
	have been changed. Out of respect for the dead, the rest has been
	told exactly as it occured.

	FLARE TO WHITE

	FADE IN FROM WHITE

	Slowly the white becomes a barely perceptible image:  white
	particles wave over a white background.  A snowfall.

	A car bursts through the curtain of snow.

	The car is equipped with a hitch and is towing another car,
	a brand-new light brown Cutlass Ciera with the pink sales
	sticker showing in its rear window.

	As the car roars past, leaving snow swirling in their dirft,
	the title of the film fades in.

				FARGO

	Green highway signs point the way to MOOREHEAD,
	MINNESOTA/FARGO, NORTH DAKOTA.  The roads for the two cities
	diverge.  A sign says WELCOME TO NORTH DAKOTA and another
	just after says NOW ENTERING FARGO, ND, POP. 44,412.

	The car pulls into a Rodeway Inn.

	HOTEL LOBBY

	A man in his early forties, balding and starting to paunch,
	goes to the reception desk.  The clerk is an older woman.

				CLERK
		And how are you today, sir?

				MAN
		Real good now.  I'm checking in
		- Mr. Anderson.

	The man prints "Jerry Lundega" onto a registration card,
	then hastily crosses out the last name and starts to print
	"Anderson."

	As she types into a computer:

				CLERK
		Okay, Mr. Anderson, and you're
		still planning on staying with
		us just the night, then?

				ANDERSON
		You bet.

	HOTEL ROOM

	The man turns on the TV, which shows the local evening news.

				NEWS ANCHOR
		- whether they will go to summer
		camp at all.  Katie Jensen has
		more.

				KATIE
		It was supposed to be a project
		funded by the city council;  it
		was supposed to benefit those
		Fargo-Moorehead children who
		would otherwise not be able to
		afford to attend a lakeshore
		summer camp.  But nobody consulted
		city controller Stu Jacobson...

	CHAIN RESTAURANT

	Anderson sits alone at a table finishing dinner.  Muzak
	plays.  A middle-aged waitress approaches holding a pot of
	regular coffee in one hand and decaf in the other.

				WAITRESS
		Can I warm that up for ya there?

				ANDERSON
		You bet.

	The man looks at his watch.

	THROUGH A WINDSHIELD

	We are pulling into the snowswept parking lot of a one-story
	brick building.  Broken neon at the top of the building
	identifies it as the Jolly Troll Tavern.  A troll, also in
	neon, holds a champagne glass aloft.

	INSIDE

	The bar is downscale even for this town.  Country music
	plays on the jukebox.

	Two men are seated in a booth at the back.  One is short,
	slight, youngish.  The other man is somewhat older, and
	dour.  The table in front of them is littered with empty
	long-neck beer bottles.  The ashtray is full.

	Anderson approaches.

				ANDERSON
		I'm, uh, Jerry Lundegaard -

				YOUNGER MAN
		You're Jerry Lundegaard?

				JERRY
		Yah, Shep Proudfoot said -

				YOUNGER MAN
		Shep said you'd be here at 7:30.
		What gives, man?

				JERRY
		Shep said 8:30.

				YOUNGER MAN
		We been sitting here an hour.
		I've peed three times already.

				JERRY
		I'm sure sorry.  I - Shep told
		me 8:30.  It was a mix-up, I
		guess.

				YOUNGER MAN
		Ya got the car?

				JERRY
		Yah, you bet.  It's in the lot
		there.  Brand-new burnt umber
		Ciera.

				YOUNGER MAN
		Yeah, okay.  Well, siddown then.
		I'm Carl Showalter and this is
		my associate Gaear Grimsrud.

				JERRY
		Yah, how ya doin'.  So, uh, we
		all set on this thing, then?

				YOUNGER MAN
		Sure, Jerry, we're all set.  Why
		wouldn't we be?

				JERRY
		Yah, no, I'm sure you are.  Shep
		vouched for you and all.  I got
		every confidence in you fellas.

	They stare at him.  An awkward beat.

				JERRY
		...  So I guess that's it, then.
		Here's the keys -

				CARL
		No, that's not it, Jerry.

				JERRY
		Huh?

				CARL
		The new vehicle, plus forty
		thousand dollars.

				JERRY
		Yah, but the deal was, the car
		first, see, then the forty
		thousand, like as if it was the
		ransom.  I thought Shep told you -

				CARL
		Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry.

				JERRY
		Well, okay, it's -

				CARL
		Except that you were gonna be
		here at 7:30.

				JERRY
		Yah, well, that was a mix-up, then.

				CARL
		Yeah, you already said that.

				JERRY
		Yah.  But it's not a whole pay-
		in-advance deal.  I give you a
		brand-new vehicle in advance and -

				CARL
		I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.

				JERRY
		Okay.

				CARL
		I'm not gonna sit here and debate.
		I will say this though:  what Shep
		told us didn't make a whole lot
		of sense.

				JERRY
		Oh, no, it's real sound.  It's
		all worked out.

				CARL
		You want your own wife kidnapped?

				JERRY
		Yah.

	Carl Stares.  Jerry looks blankly back.

				CARL
		...  You - my point is, you pay
		the ransom - what eighty thousand
		bucks? -  I mean, you give us
		half the ransom, forty thousand,
		you keep half.  It's like robbing
		Peter to play Paul, it doesn't
		make any -

				JERRY
		Okay, it's - see, it's not me
		payin' the ransom.  The thing is,
		my wife, she's wealthy - her dad,
		he's real well off.  Now, I'm in
		a bit of trouble -

				CARL
		What kind of trouble are you in,
		Jerry?

				JERRY
		Well, that's, that's, I'm not go
		inta, inta - see, I just need
		money.  Now, her dad's real
		wealthy -

				CARL
		So why don't you just ask him
		for the money?

	Grimsrud, the dour man who has not yet spoken, now softly
	puts in with a Swedish-accented voice:

				GRIMSRUD
		Or your fucking wife, you know.

				CARL
		Or your fucking wife, Jerry.

				JERRY
		Well, it's all just part of this -
		they don't know I need it, see.
		Okay, so there's that.  And even
		if they did, I wouldn't get it.
		So there's that on top, then.  See,
		these're personal matters.

				CARL
		Personal matters.

				JERRY
		Yah.  Personal matters that
		needn't, uh -

				CARL
		Okay, Jerry.  You're tasking us
		to perform this mission, but you,
		you won't, uh, you won't - aw,
		fuck it, let's take a look at
		that Ciera.

	MINNEAPOLIS SUBURBAN HOUSE

	Jerry enters through the kitchen door, in a parka and a red
	plaid Elmer Fudd hat.  He stamps snow off his feet.  He is
	carrying a bag of groceries which he deposits on the kitchen
	counter.

				JERRY
		Hon?  Got the growshries.

				VOICE
		Thank you, hon.  How's Fargo?

				JERRY
		Yah, real good.

				VOICE
		Dad's here.

	DEN

	Jerry enters, pulling off his plaid cap.

				JERRY
		How ya doin', Wade?

	Wade Gustafson is mid-sixtyish, vigorous, with a full head
	of gray hair.  His eyes remain fixed on the TV.

				WADE
		Yah, pretty good.

				JERRY
		Whatcha watchin' there?

				WADE
		Norstars.

				JERRY
		...  Who they playin'?

				WADE
		OOOoooh!

	His reaction synchronizes with a reaction from the crowd.

	KITCHEN

	Jerry walks back in, taking off his coat.  His wife is
	putting on an apron.  Jerry nods toward the living room.

				JERRY
		Is he stayin' for supper, then?

				WIFE
		Yah, I think so...  Dad, are you
		stayin' for supper?

				WADE
			(off)
		Yah.

	DINING ROOM

	Jerry, his wife, Wade and Scotty, twelve years old, sit
	eating.

				SCOTTY
		May I be excused?

				JERRY
		Sure, ya done there?

				SCOTTY
		Uh-huh.  Goin' out.

				WIFE
		Where are you going?

				SCOTTY
		Just out.  Just McDonald's.

				JERRY
		Back at 9:30.

				SCOTTY
		Okay.

				WADE
		He just ate.  And he didn't finish.
		He's going to McDonald's instead
		of finishing here?

				WIFE
		He sees his friends there.  It's
		okay.

				WADE
		It's okay?  McDonald's?  What do
		you think they do there?  They
		don't drink milkshakes, I assure
		you!

				WIFE
		It's okay, Dad.

				JERRY
		Wade, have ya had a chance to
		think about, uh, that deal I was
		talkin' about, those forty acres
		there on Wayzata?

				WADE
		You told me about it.

				JERRY
		Yah, you said you'd have a think
		about it.  I understand it's a
		lot of money -

				WADE
		A heck of a lot.  What'd you
		say you were gonna put there?

				JERRY
		A lot.  It's a limited -

				WADE
		I know it's a lot.

				JERRY
		I mean a parking lot.

				WADE
		Yah, well, seven hundred and
		fifty thousand dollars is a lot
		- ha ha ha!

				JERRY
		Yah, well, it's a chunk, but -

				WADE
		I thought you were gonna show
		it to Stan Grossman.  He passes
		on this stuff before it gets
		kicked up to me.

				JERRY
		Well, you know Stan'll say no
		dice.  That's why you pay him.
		I'm asking you here, Wade.  This
		could work out real good for me
		and Jean and Scotty -

				WADE
		Jean and Scotty never have to
		worry.

	WHITE

	A black like curls through the white.  Twisting perspective
	shows that it is an aerial shot of a two-lane highway,
	bordered by snowfields.  The highway carries one moving car.

	INT. CAR

	Carl Showalter is driving.  Gaear Grimsrud stares blankly
	out.

	After a long beat:

				GRIMSRUD
		Where is Pancakes Hause?

				CARL
		What?

				GRIMSRUD
		We stop at Pancakes Hause.

				CARL
		What're you, nuts?  We had
		pancakes for breakfast.  I gotta
		go somewhere I can get a shot
		and a beer - and a steak maybe.
		Not more fuckin' pancakes.  Come
		on.

	Grimsrud gives him a sour look.

				CARL
		...  Come on, man.  Okay, here's
		an idea.  We'll stop outside of
		Brainerd.  I know a place there
		we can get laid.  Wuddya think?

				GRIMSRUD
		I'm fuckin' hungry now, you know.

				CARL
		Yeah, yeah, Jesus - I'm sayin',
		we'll stop for pancakes, then
		we'll get laid.  Wuddya think?

	GUSTAFSON OLDS GARAGE

	Jerry is sitting in his glassed-in salesman's cubicle just
	off the showroom floor.  On the other side of his desk sit
	an irate customer and his wife.

				CUSTOMER
		We sat here right in this room and
		went over this and over this!

				JERRY
		Yah, but that TruCoat -

				CUSTOMER
		I sat right here and said I didn't
		want no TruCoat!

				JERRY
		Yah, but I'm sayin', that TruCoat,
		you don't get it and you get
		oxidization problems.  It'll cost
		you a heck of lot more'n five
		hunnert -

				CUSTOMER
		You're sittin' here, you're talkin'
		in circles!  You're talkin' like
		we didn't go over this already!

				JERRY
		Yah, but this TruCoat -

				CUSTOMER
		We had us a deal here for nine-
		teen-five.  You sat there and
		darned if you didn't tell me
		you'd get this car, these options,
		WITHOUT THE SEALANT, for nine-
		teen-five!

				JERRY
		Okay, I'm not sayin' I didn't -

				CUSTOMER
		You called me twenty minutes ago
		and said you had it!  Ready to
		make delivery, ya says!  Come on
		down and get it!  And here ya are
		and you're wastin' my time and
		you're wastin' my wife's time and
		I'm payin' nineteen-five for this
		vehicle here!

				JERRY
		Well, okay, I'll talk to my boss...

	He rises, and, as he leaves:

				JERRY
		...  See, they install that TruCoat
		at the factory, there's nothin' we
		can do, but I'll talk to my boss.

	The couple watch him go to a nearby cubicle.

				CUSTOMER
		These guys here - these guys!
		It's always the same!  It's always
		more!  He's a liar!

				WIFE
		Please, dear.

				CUSTOMER
		We went over this and over this -

	NEARBY CUBICLE

	Jerry sits perched on the desk of another salesman who is
	eating lunch as he watches a hockey game on a small portable
	TV.

				JERRY
		So you're goin' to the Gophers
		on Sunday?

				SALESMAN
		You bet.

				JERRY
		You wouldn't have an extra ticket
		there?

				SALESMAN
		They're playin' the Buckeyes!

				JERRY
		Yah.

				SALESMAN
		Ya kiddin'!

	JERRY'S CUBICLE

	Jerry re-enters.

				JERRY
		Well, he never done this before,
		but seein' as it's special
		circumstances and all, he says I
		can knock one hunnert off that
		TruCoat.

				CUSTOMER
		One hundred!  You lied to me, Mr.
		Lundegaard.  You're a bald-faced
		liar!

	Jerry sits staring at his lap.

				CUSTOMER
		...  A fucking liar -

				WIFE
		Bucky, please!

	Jerry mumbles into his lap:

				JERRY
		One hunnert's the best we can
		do here.

				CUSTOMER
		Oh, for Christ's sake, where's my
		goddamn checkbook.  Let's get this
		over with.

	WIDE EXTERIOR:  TRUCK STOP

	There is a restaurant with many big rigs parked nearby, and
	a motel with an outsize Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox
	flanking its sign:  BLUE OX MOTEL.

	MOTEL ROOM

	Carl Showalter and Gaear Grimsrud are in the twin beds
	having sex with two truck-stop hookers.

				CARL
		Oh, Jesus, yeah.

				HIS HOOKER
		There ya go, sugar.

				GRIMSRUD
		Nnph.

				HIS HOOKER
		Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.

	LATER

	The couples like in their respective beds, gazing at the
	offscreen TV.

				ED MCMAHON
		-  Johnny's guests tonight will be
		Lee Majors, George Wendt, and Steve
		Boutsikaros from the San Diego Zoo,
		so keep that dial -

	LUNDEGAARD KITCHEN

	We hear a morning show on television.  Jean Lundegaard is
	making coffee in the kitchen as Scott eats cereal at the
	table.

				JEAN
		I'm talkin' about your potential.

				SCOTT
			(absently)
		Uh-huh.

				JEAN
		You're not a C student.

				SCOTT
		Uhn.

				JEAN
		And yet you're gettin' C grades.
		It's this disparity there that
		concerns your dad and me.

				SCOTT
		Uh-huh.

				JEAN
		You know what a disparity is?

				SCOTT
			(testily)
		Yeah!

				JEAN
		Okay.  Well, that's why we don't
		want ya goin' out fer hockey.

				SCOTT
		Oh, man!

	The phone rings.

				SCOTT
		...  What's the big deal?  It's
		an hour -

				JEAN
		Hold on.

	She picks up the phone.

				JEAN
		...  Hello?

				PHONE VOICE
		Yah, hiya, hon.

				JEAN
		Oh, hiya, Dad.

				WADE
		Jerry around?

				JEAN
		Yah, he's still here - I'll

	She holds the phone away and calls:

				JEAN
		...  Hon?

				VOICE
		Yah.

				JEAN
		It's Dad.

				VOICE
		Yah...

	Jerry enters in shirtsleeves and tie.

				JERRY
		...  Yah, okay...

				SCOTT
		Look, Dad, there is no fucking
		way -

				JEAN
		Scott!

				JERRY
		Say, let's watch the language -

	He takes the phone.

				JERRY
		How ya doin', Wade?

				WADE
		What's goin' on there?

				JERRY
		Oh, nothing, Wade.  How ya doin'
		there?

				WADE
		Stan Grossman looked at your

				JERRY
		No kiddin'!  I'd need the cash

				JERRY
		Yah.

				WADE
		2:30.

	Click.  Dial tone.

				JERRY
		Yah, okay.

	GUSTAFSON OLD GARAGE

	Jerry wanders through the service area where cars are being
	worked on.  He stops by an Indian in blue jeans who is
	looking at the underside of a car that sits on a hydraulic
	lift with a cage light hanging off its innards.

				JERRY
		Say, Shep, how ya doin' there?

				SHEP
		Mm.

				JERRY
		Say, ya know those two fellas
		ya put me in touch with, up
		there in Fargo?

				SHEP
		Put you in touch with Grimsrud.

				JERRY
		Well, yah, but he had a buddy
		there.  He, uh -

				SHEP
		Well, I don't vouch for him.

				JERRY
		Well, that's okay, I just -

				SHEP
		I vouch for Grimsrud.  Who's his
		buddy?

				JERRY
		Carl somethin'?

				SHEP
		Never heard of him.  Don't vouch
		for him.

				JERRY
		Well, that's okay, he's a buddy
		of the guy ya vouched for, so I'm

				JERRY
		Yah, well, see, I did that, and
		I haven't been able to get 'em,
		so I thought you maybe'd know an
		alternate number or what have ya.

				SHEP
		Nope.

	Jerry slaps his fist into his open palm and snaps his
	fingers.

				JERRY
		Okay, well, real good, then.

	CAR

	Carl is driving.  Grimsrud stares out front.

	After a beat:

				CARL
		...  Look at that.  Twin Cities.
		IDS Building, the big glass one.
		Tallest skyscraper in the Midwest.
		After the Sears, uh, Chicago...
		You never been to Minneapolis?

				GRIMSRUD
		No.

				CARL
		...  Would it kill you to say
		something?

				GRIMSRUD
		I did.

				CARL
		"No." First thing you've said
		in the last four hours.  That's
		a, that's a fountain of conversation,
		man.  That's a geyser.  I mean, whoa,
		daddy, stand back, man.  Shit, I'm
		sittin' here driving, man, doin'
		all the driving, whole fuckin' way
		from Brainerd, drivin', tryin' to,
		you know, tryin' to chat, keep
		our spirits up, fight the boredom
		of the road, and you can't say one
		fucking thing just in the way of
		conversation.

	Grimsurd smokes, gazing out the window.

				CARL
		...  Well, fuck it, I don't have
		to talk either, man.  See how
		you like it...

	He drives.

				CARL
		...  Total silence...

	JERRY'S CUBICLE

	He is on the phone.

				JERRY
		Yah, real good.  How you doin'?

				VOICE
		Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard.
		You're damned hard to get on the
		phone.

				JERRY
		Yah, it's pretty darned busy here,
		but that's the way we like it.

				VOICE
		That's for sure.  Now, I just
		need, on these last, these financing
		documents you sent us, I can't
		read the serial numbers of the
		vehicles on here, so I -

				JERRY
		But I already got the, it's okay,
		the loans are in place, I already
		got the, the what, the -

				VOICE
		Yeah, the three hundred and twenty
		thousand dollars, you got the money
		last month.

				JERRY
		Yah, so we're all set.

				VOICE
		Yeah, but the vehicles you were
		borrowing on, I just can't read
		the serial numbers on your
		applicaton.  Maybe if you could
		just read them to me -

				JERRY
		But the deal's already done, I
		already got the money -

				VOICE
		Yeah, but we have an audit here,
		I just have to know that these
		vehicles you're financing with
		this money, that they really
		exist.

				JERRY
		Yah, well, they exist all right.

				VOICE
		I'm sure they do - ha ha!  But
		I can't read their serial numbers
		here.  So if you could read me -

				JERRY
		Well, but see, I don't have 'em
		in front a me - why don't I just
		fax you over a copy -

				VOICE
		No, fax is no good, that's what
		I have and I can't read the darn
		thing -

				JERRY
		Yah, okay, I'll have my girl
		send you over a copy, then.

				VOICE
		Okay, because if I can't correlate
		this note with the specific vehicles,
		then I gotta call back that money -

				JERRY
		Yah, how much money was that?

				VOICE
		Three hundred and twenty thousand
		dollars.  See, I gotta correlate
		that money with the cars it's being
		lent on.

				JERRY
		Yah, no problem, I'll just fax
		that over to ya, then.

				VOICE
		No, no, fax is -

				JERRY
		I mean send it over.  I'll shoot
		it right over to ya.

				VOICE
		Okay.

				JERRY
		Okay, real good, then.

	CLOSE ON TELEVISION

	A morning-show host in an apron stands behind a counter on a
	kitchen set.

				HOST
		So I seperate the - how the heck
		do I get the egg out of the shell
		without breaking it?

	Jean Lundegaard is curled up on the couch with a cup of
	coffee, watching the television.

				HOSTESS
		You just prick a little hole in
		the end and blow!

	Jean smiles as we hear laughter and applause from the studio
	audience.  She hears something else - a faint scraping sound
	- and looks up.

				HOST
		Okay, here goes nothing.

	The scraping sound persists.  Jean sets down her coffee cup
	and rises.

	From the studio audience:

				AUDIENCE
		Awoooo!

	KITCHEN

	We track toward the back door.  A curtain is stretched tight
	across its window.

	Jean pulls the curtain back.  Bright sunlight amplified by
	snow floods in.

	A man in an orange ski mask looks up from the lock.

	Jean gasps, drops the curtain, rutns and runs into -

	- a taller man, also in a ski mask, already in the house.

	We hear the crack of the back-door window being smashed.

	The tall man - Gaear Grimsrud - grabs Jean's wrist.

	She screams, staring at her own imprisoned wrist, then wraps
	her gaping mouth around Grimsrud's gloved thumb and bites
	down hard.

	He drops her wrist.  As Carl enters, she races up the
	stairs.

				GRIMSRUD
		Unguent.

				CARL
		Huh?

	Grimsurd looks at his thumb.

				GRIMSRUD
		I need ... unguent.

	UPSTAIRS BEDROOM

	As the two men enter, a door at the far side is slamming
	shut.  A cord snakes in under the door.

	MASTER BATHROOM

	Jean, sobbing, frantically pushes at buttons on the princess
	phone.

	The phone pops out of her hands, jangles across the tile
	floor, smashes against the door and then bounces away, its
	cord ripped free.

	With a groaning sound, the door shifts in its frame.

	BEDROOM

	Grimsrud has a crowbar jammed in between the bathroom door
	and frame, and is working it.

	BATHROOM

	Jean crosses to a high window above the toilet and throws it
	open.  Snow that had drifted against the window sifts
	lightly in.  Jean steps up onto the toilet.

	The door creaks, moving as one piece in its frame.

	Jean glances back as she steps up from the toilet seat to
	the tank.

	The groaning of the door ends with the wood around its knob
	splintering and the knob itself falling out onto the floor.

	The door swings open.

	Grimsrud and Carl enter.

	THEIR POV

	Room empty, window open.

	Carl strides to the window and hoists himself out.

	Grimsrud opens the medicine cabinet and delicately taps
	aside various bottles and tubes, seeking the proper unguent.

	He finds a salve but after a moment sets it down, noticing
	something in the mirror.

	The shower curtain is drawn around the tub.

	He steps toward it.

	As he reaches for the curtain, it explodes outward, animated
	by thrashing limbs.

	Jean, screaming, tangled in the curtain, rips it off its
	rings and stumbles out into the bedroom.  Grimsrud follows.

	BEDROOM

	Jean rushes toward the door, cloaked by the shower curtain
	but awkwardly trying to push it off.

	UPSTAIRS LANDING

	Still thrashing, Jean crashes against the upstairs railing,
	trips on the curtain and falls, thumping crazily down the
	stairs.

	Grimsrud trots down after her.

	A PLAQUE:  WADE GUSTAFSON INCORPORTATED

	INT. WADE'S OFFICE

	Wade sits behind his desk; another man rises as Jerry
	enters.

				JERRY
		How ya doin' there, Stan?  How
		are ya, Wade?

	Stan Grossman shakes his hand.

				STAN
		Good to see ya again, Jerry.  If
		these numbers are right, this
		looks pretty sweet.

				JERRY
		Oh, those numbers are all right,
		bleemee.

				WADE
		This is do-able.

				STAN
		Congratulations, Jerry.

				JERRY
		Yah, thanks, Stan, it's a pretty -

				WADE
		What kind of finder's fee were
		you looking for?

				JERRY
		...  Huh?

				STAN
		The financials are pretty thorough,
		so the only thing we don't know
		is your fee.

				JERRY
		...  My fee?  Wade, what the
		heck're you talkin' about?

				WADE
		Stan and I're okay.

				JERRY
		Yah.

				WADE
		We're good to loan in.

				JERRY
		Yah.

				WADE
		But we never talked about your
		fee for bringin' it to us.

				JERRY
		No, but, Wade, see, I was
		bringin' you this deal for you
		to loan me the money to put
		in.  It's my deal here, see?

	Wade scowls, looks at Stan.

				STAN
		Jerry - we thought you were
		bringin' us an investment.

				JERRY
		Yah, right -

				STAN
		You're sayin' - what're you
		sayin'?

				WADE
		You're sayin' that we put in
		all the money and you collect
		when it pays off?

				JERRY
		No, no.  I - I'd, I'd - pay you
		back the principal, and interest
		- heck, I'd go - one over prime -

				STAN
		We're not a bank, Jerry.

	Wade is angry.

				WADE
		What the heck, Jerry, if I wanted
		bank interest on seven hunnert'n
		fifty thousand I'd go to Midwest
		Federal.  Talk to Bill Diehl.

				STAN
		He's at Norstar.

				WADE
		He's at -

				JERRY
		No, see, I don't need a finder's
		fee, I need - finder's fee's, what,
		ten percent, heck that's not gonna
		do it for me.  I need the principal.

				STAN
		Jerry, we're not just going to
		give you seven hundred and fifty
		thousand dollars.

				WADE
		What the heck were you thinkin'?
		Heck, if I'm only gettin' bank
		interest, I'd look for complete
		security.  Heck, FDIC.  I don't
		see nothin' like that here.

				JERRY
		Yah, but I - okay, I would, I'd
		guarantee ya your money back.

				WADE
		I'm not talkin' about your damn
		word, Jerry.  Geez, what the
		heck're you?...  Well, look, I
		don't want to cut you out of the
		loop, but his here's a good deal.
		I assume, if you're not innarested,
		you won't mind if we move on it
		independently.

	PARKING LOT

	We are high and wide on the office building's parking lot.
	Jerry emerges wrapped in a parka, his arms sticking stiffly
	out at his sides, his breath vaporizing.  He goes to his
	car, opens its front door, pulls out a red plastic scraper
	and starts methodically scraping off the thin crust of ice
	that has developed on his windshield.

	The scrape-scrape-scrape sound carries in the frigid air.

	Jerry goes into a frenzy, banging the scraper against the
	windshield and the hood of his car.

	The tantrum passes.  Jerry stands pantin, staring at nothing
	in particular.

	Scrape-scrape-scrape - he goes back to work on the
	windshield.

	FRONT DOOR

	A beat, silent but for a key scraping at the lock.

	The door swings open and Jerry edges in, looking about,
	holding a sack of groceries.

				JERRY
		Hon?

	He shuts the door.

				JERRY
		...  Got the growshries...

	He has already seen the shower curtain on the floor.  He
	frowns, pokes at it with his foot.

				JERRY
		...  Hon?

	UPSTAIRS BATHROOM

	Jerry walks in.  He sets the groceries down on the toilet
	tank.

	He looks at the open window, through which snow still sifts
	in.  He shuts it.

	He picks up the small tube of uguent that sits on the sink,
	frowns at it, puts it back in the medicine chest.

	He looks at the shower curtain rod holding empty rings.

	FOYER

	Once again we are looking at the rumpled shower curtain.

	From another room:

				JERRY
		Yah, Wade, I - it's Jerry, I.

	Then, slightly more agitated.

				JERRY
		...  Yah, Wade, it's, I, it's
		Jerry...

	Beat.

				JERRY
		...  Wade, it's Jerry, I - we
		gotta talk, Wade, it's terrible...

	Beat.

	LIVING ROOM

	Jerry stands in wide shot, hands on hips, looking down at a
	telephone.

	After a motionless beat he picks up the phone and punches in
	a number.

				JERRY
		...  Yah, Wade Gustafson, please.

	BLACK

	Hold in black.

	A slow tilt down from night sky brings the head of a large
	paper-mache figure into frame.  It is a flannel-shirt
	woodsman carrying a double-edged ax over one shoulder.  As
	we hear the rumble of an approaching car, the continuing
	tilt and boom down brings us down the woodsman's body to a
	pedestal.

	A sweep of headlights illuminates a sign on the pedestal:
	WELCOME TO BRAINDERD - HOME OF PAUL BUNYAN.

	The headlights sweep off and a car hums past and on into the
	background.  The two-lane highway is otherwise empty.

	INT. CAR

	Carl drives.  Grimsrud smokes and gazes out the window.
	From the back seat we hear whimpering.

	Grimsrud turns to look.

	Jean lies bound and curled on the back seat underneath a
	tarpaulin.

				GRIMSRUD
		Shut the fuck up or I'll throw
		you back in the trunk, you know.

				CARL
		Geez.  That's more'n I've heard
		you say all week.

	Grimsrud stares at him, then turns back to the window.

	At a loud WHOOP Carl starts and looks back out the rear
	window.  Fifty yards behind a state trooper has turned on
	his gumballs.

	Carl eases the car onto the shoulder.

				CARL
		Ah, shit, the tags...

	Grimsrud looks at him.

				CARL
		...  It's just the tags.  I never
		put my tags on the car.  Don't
		worry, I'll take care of this.

	He looks into the back seat as the car bounces and slows on
	the gravel shoulder.

				CARL
		...  Let's keep still back there,
		lady, or we're gonna have to, ya
		know, to shoot ya.

	Grimsrud stares at Carl.

				CARL
		...  Hey!  I'll take care of this!

	Both cars have stopped.  Carl looks up at the rear-view
	mirror.

	The trooper is stopped on the shoulder just behind them,
	writing in his citation book.

	Carl watches.

	We hear the trooper's door open.

	The trooper walks up the shoulder, one hand resting lightly
	on top of his holster, his breath steaming in the cold night
	air.

	Carl opens his window as the trooper draws up.

				CARL
		How can I help you, officer?

	The trooper scans the inside of the car, taking his time.

	Grimsrud smokes and gazes calmly out his window.

	Finally:

				TROOPER
		This is a new car, then, sir?

				CARL
		It certainly is, officer.  Still
		got that smell!

				TROOPER
		You're required to display
		temporary tags, either in the
		plate area or taped inside the
		back window.

				CARL
		Certainly -

				TROOPER
		Can I see your license and
		registration please?

				CARL
		Certainly.

	He reaches for his wallet.

				CARL
		...  I was gonna tape up the
		temporary tag, ya know, to be
		in full compliance, but it, uh,
		it, uh ... must a slipped my
		mind...

	He extends his wallet toward the trooper, a folded fifty-
	dollar bill protruding from it.

				CARL
		...  So maybe the best thing
		would be to take care of that,
		right here in Brainerd.

				TROOPER
		What's this, sir?

				CARL
		That's my license and regis-
		tration.  I wanna be in
		compliance.

	He forces a laugh.

				CARL
		...  I was just thinking I could
		take care of it right here.  In
		Brainerd.

	The policeman thoughtfully pats the fifty into the billfold
	and hands the billfold back into the car.

				TROOPER
		Put that back in your pocket,
		please.

	Carl's nervous smile fades.

				TROOPER
		...  And step out of the car,
		please, sir.

	Grimsrud, smiling thinly, shakes his head.

	There is a whimpering sound.

	The policeman hesitates.

	Another sound.

	The policeman leans forward into the car, listening.

	Grimsrud reaches across Carl, grabs the trooper by the hair
	and slams his head down onto the car door.

	The policeman grunts, digs awkwardly for footing outside and
	throws an arm for balance against the outside of the car.

	With his free hand, Grimsrud pops the glove compartment.  He
	brings a gun out and reaches across Carl and shoots - BANG -
	into the back of the trooper's head.

	Jean screams.

				GRIMSRUD
		Shut up.

	He releases the policeman.

	The policeman's head slides out the window and his body
	flops back onto the street.

	Carl looks out at the cop in the road.

				CARL
			(softly)
		Whoa...  Whoa, Daddy.

	Grimsrud takes the trooper's hat off of Carl's lap and sails
	it out the open window.

				GRIMSRUD
		You'll take care of it.  Boy, you
		are smooth smooth, you know.

				CARL
		Whoa, Daddy.

	Jean, for some reason, screams again.  Then stops.

				GRIMSRUD
		Clear him off the road.

				CARL
		Yeah.

	He gets out.

	EXT. ROAD

	Carl leans down to hoist up the body.

	Headlights appear:  an oncoming car.

	INT. CIERA

	Grimsrud notices.

	EXT. ROAD

	The car approaches, slowing.

	Carl, with the trooper's body hoisted halfway up, is frozen
	in the headlights.

	The car accelerates and roars past and away.  We just make
	out the silhouettes of two occupants in front.

	INT. CIERA

	Grimsrud slides into the driver's seat.  He squeals into a U-
	turn, the driver's door slamming shut with his spin.

	Small red tail lights fishtail up ahead.  The pursued car
	churns up fine snow.

	Grimsrud takes the cigarette from his mouth and stubs it in
	his ashtray.  We hear the churning of the car wheels and the
	pinging of snow clods and salt on the car's underside.

	In the back seat, Jean starts screaming.

	Grimsrud is not gaining on the tail lights.

	He fights with the wheel as his car swims on the road face.

	The red tail lights ahead start to turn.  With a distant
	crunching sound, they disappear.

	The headlights now show only empty road, starting to turn.

	Grimsrud frowns and slows.

	His headlights show the car up ahead off the road, crumpled
	around a telephone pole, having failed to hold a turn.

	Grimsrud brakes.

	Jean slides off the back seat and thumps into the legwell.

	Grimsrud sweeps his gun off the front seat, throws open his
	door and gets out.

	EXT. ROAD

	The wrecked car's headlights shine off into a snowfield
	abutting the highway.  A young man in a down parka is
	limping across the snowfield, away from the wrecked car.

	Grimsrud strides calmly out after the injured boy.  He
	raises his gun and fires.

	With a poof of feathers, a hole opens up in the boy's back
	and he pitches into the snow.

	Grimsrud walks up to the wreck and peers in its half-open
	door.

	A young woman is trapped inside the twisted wreckage,
	injured.

	Snow swirls in the headlights of the wreck.

	Grimsrud raises his gun and fires.

	AN OIL PAINTING

	A blue-winged teal in flight over a swampy marshland.  The
	room in which it hangs is dark.  We hear off-screen snoring.

	We track off to reveal an easel upon which we see a half-
	completed oil of a grey mallard.

	The continuing track reveals a couple in bed, sleeping.  The
	man, fortyish, pajama-clad, is big, and big-bellied.  His
	mouth is agape.  He snores.  His arms are flung over a woman
	in her thirties, wearing a nightie, mouth also open, not
	snoring.

	We hold for a long beat on their regular breathing and
	snoring.

	The phone rings.

	The woman stirs.

				WOMAN
		Oh, geez...

	She reaches for the phone.

				WOMAN
		...  Hi, it's Marge...

	The man stirs and clears his throat with a long deep rumble.

				MARGE
		...  Oh, my.  Where?...  Yah...
		Oh, geez...

	The man sits up, gazes stupidly about.

				MARGE
		...  Okay.  There in a jif...
		Real good, then.

	She hangs up.

				MARGE
		...  You can sleep, hon.  It's
		early yet.

				MAN
		Gotta go?

				MARGE
		Yah.

	The man swings his legs out.

				MAN
		I'll fix ya some eggs.

				MARGE
		That's okay, hon.  I gotta run.

				MAN
		Gotta eat a breakfast, Marge.
		I'll fix ya some eggs.

				MARGE
		Aw, you can sleep, hon.

				MAN
		Ya gotta eat a breakfast...

	He clears his throat with another deep rumble.

				MAN
		...  I'll fix ya some eggs.

				MARGE
		Aw, Norm.

	PLATE

	Leavings of a huge plate of eggs, ham, toast.

	Wider, we see Marge now wearing a beige police uniform.  A
	patch on one arm says BRAINERD POLICE DEPARTMENT.  She wears
	a heavy belt holding a revolver, walkie-talkie and various
	other jangling police impedimenta.  Norm is in a dressing
	gown.

				MARGE
		Thanks, hon.  Time to shove off.

				NORM
		Love ya, Margie.

	As she struggles into a parka:

				MARGE
		Love ya, hon.

	He is exiting back to the bedroom; she exits out the front
	door.

	EXT. GUNDERSON HOUSE

	Dawn.  Marge is making her way down the icy front stoop to
	her prowler.

	INT. GUNDERSON HOUSE

	Norm sits back onto the bed, shrugging off his robe.  Off-
	screen we hear the front door open.

	FRONT DOOR

	Marge stamps the snow off her shoes.

				MARGE
		Hon?

				NORM
			(off)
		Yah?

				MARGE
		Prowler needs a jump.

	HIGHWAY

	Two police cars and an ambulance sit idling at the side of
	the road, a pair of men inside each car.

	The first car's driver door opens and a figure in a parka
	emerges, holding two styrofoam cups.  His partner leans
	across the seat to close the door after him.

	The reverse shows Marge approaching from her own squad car.

				MARGE
		Hiya, Lou.

				LOU
		Margie.  Thought you might need
		a little warm-up.

	He hands her one of the cups of coffee.

				MARGE
		Yah, thanks a bunch.  So what's
		the deal, now?  Gary says triple
		homicide?

				LOU
		Yah, looks pretty bad.  Two
		of'm're over here.

	Marge looks around as they start walking.

				MARGE
		Where is everybody?

				LOU
		Well - it's cold, Margie.

	BY THE WRECK

	Laid out in the early morning light is the wrecked car, a
	pair of footprints leading out to a man in a bright orange
	parka face down in the bloodstained snow, and one pair of
	footsteps leading back to the road.

	Marge is peering into the car.

				MARGE
		Ah, geez.  So...  Aw, geez.
		Here's the second one...  It's
		in the head and the ... hand
		there, I guess that's a defensive
		wound.  Okay.

	Marge looks up from the car.

				MARGE
		...  Where's the state trooper?

	Lou, up on the shoulder, jerks his thumb.

				LOU
		Back there a good piece.  In
		the ditch next to his prowler.

	Marge looks around at the road.

				MARGE
		Okay, so we got a state trooper
		pulls someone over, we got a
		shooting, and these folks drive
		by, and we got a high-speed
		pursuit, ends here, and this
		execution-type deal.

				LOU
		Yah.

				MARGE
		I'd be very surprised if our
		suspect was from Brainerd.

				LOU
		Yah.

	Marge is studying the ground.

				MARGE
		Yah.  And I'll tell you what, from
		his footprints he looks like a big
		fella -

	Marge suddenly doubles over, putting her head between her
	knees down near the snow.

				LOU
		Ya see something down there, Chief?

				MARGE
		Uh - I just, I think I'm gonna barf.

				LOU
		Geez, you okay, Margie?

				MARGE
		I'm fine - it's just morning
		sickness.

	She gets up, sweeping snow from her knees.

				MARGE
		...  Well, that passed.

				LOU
		Yah?

				MARGE
		Yah.  Now I'm hungry again.

				LOU
		You had breakfast yet, Margie?

				MARGE
		Oh, yah.  Norm made some eggs.

				LOU
		Yah?  Well, what now, d'ya think?

				MARGE
		Let's go take a look at that
		trooper.

	BY THE STATE TROOPER'S CAR

	Marge's prowler is parked nearby.

	Marge is on her hands and knees by a body down in the ditch,
	again looking at footprints in the snow.  She calls up to
	the road:

				MARGE
		There's two of 'em, Lou!

				LOU
		Yah?

				MARGE
		Yah, this guy's smaller than
		his buddy.

				LOU
		Oh, yah?

	DOWN IN THE DITCH

	In the foreground is the head of the state trooper, facing
	us.  Peering at it from behind, still on her hands and
	knees, is Marge.

				MARGE
		For Pete's sake.

	She gets up, clapping the snow off her hands, and climbs out
	of the ditch.

				LOU
		How's it look, Marge?

				MARGE
		Well, he's got his gun on his hip
		there, and he looks like a nice
		enough guy.  It's a real shame.

				LOU
		Yah.

				MARGE
		You haven't monkeyed with his car
		there, have ya?

				LOU
		No way.

	She is looking at the prowler, which still idles on the
	shoulder.

				MARGE
		Somebody shut his lights.  I guess
		the little guy sat in there, waitin'
		for his buddy t'come back.

				LOU
		Yah, woulda been cold out here.

				MARGE
		Heck, yah.  Ya think, is Dave open
		yet?

				LOU
		You don't think he's mixed up in -

				MARGE
		No, no, I just wanna get Norm some
		night crawlers.

	INT. PROWLER

	Marge is driving; Lou sits next to her.

				MARGE
		You look in his citation book?

				LOU
		Yah...

	He looks at his notebook.

				LOU
		...  Last vehicle he wrote in
		was a tan Ciera at 2:18 a.m.
		Under the plate number he put
		DLR - I figure they stopped him
		or shot him before he could finish
		fillin' out the tag number.

				MARGE
		Uh-huh.

				LOU
		So I got the state lookin' for a
		Ciera with a tag startin' DLR.
		They don't got no match yet.

				MARGE
		I'm not sure I agree with you a
		hunnert percent on your policework,
		there, Lou.

				LOU
		Yah?

				MARGE
		Yah, I think that vehicle there
		probly had dealer plates.  DLR?

				LOU
		Oh...

	Lou gazes out the window, thinking.

				LOU
		...  Geez.

				MARGE
		Yah.  Say, Lou, ya hear the one
		about the guy who couldn't afford
		personalized plates, so he went
		and changed his name to J2L 4685?

				LOU
		Yah, that's a good one.

				MARGE
		Yah.

	THE ROAD

	The police car enters with a whoosh and hums down a straight-
	ruled empty highway, cutting a landscape of flat and perfect
	white.

	EMBERS FAMILY RESTAURANT

	Jerry, Wade, and Stan Grossman sit in a booth, sipping
	coffee.  Outside the window, snow falls from a gunmetal sky.

				WADE
		-  All's I know is, ya got a
		problem, ya call a professional!

				JERRY
		No!  They said no cops!  They were
		darned clear on that, Wade!  They
		said you call the cops and we -

				WADE
		Well, a course they're gonna say
		that!  But where's my protection?
		They got Jean here!  I give these
		sons a bitches a million dollars,
		where's my guarantee they're gonna
		let her go.

				JERRY
		Well, they -

				WADE
		A million dollars is a lot a damn
		money!  And there they are, they
		got my daughter!

				JERRY
		Yah, but think this thing through
		here, Wade.  Ya give 'em what they
		want, why wont' they let her go?
		You gotta listen to me on this one,
		Wade.

				WADE
		Heck, you don't know!  You're just
		whistlin' Dixie here!  I'm sayin',
		the cops, they can advise us on
		this!  I'm sayin' call a professional!

				JERRY
		No!  No cops!  That's final!  This
		is my deal here, Wade!  Jean is
		my wife here!

				STAN
		I gotta tell ya, Wade, I'm leanin'
		to Jerry's viewpoint here.

				WADE
		Well -

				STAN
		We gotta protect Jean.  These -
		we're not holdin' any cards here,
		Wade, they got all of 'em.  So
		they call the shots.

				JERRY
		You're darned tootin'!

				WADE
		Ah, dammit!

				STAN
		I'm tellin' ya.

				WADE
		Well...  Why don't we...

	He saws a finger under his nose.

				WADE
		...  Stan, I'm thinkin' we should
		offer 'em half a million.

				JERRY
		Now come on here, no way, Wade!
		No way!

				STAN
		We're not horse-trading here, Wade,
		we just gotta bite the bullet on
		this thing.

				JERRY
		Yah!

				STAN
		What's the next step here, Jerry?

				JERRY
		They're gonna call, give me
		instructions for a drop.  I'm
		supposed to have the money ready
		tomorrow.

				WADE
		Dammit!

	THE CASHIER

	She rings up two dollars forty.

				CASHIER
		How was everything today?

				JERRY
		Yah, real good now.

	PARKING LOT

	Snow continues to fall.  Jerry and Stan stand bundled in
	their parkas and galoshes near a row of beached vehicles.
	Wade sits behind the wheel of an idling Lincoln, waiting for
	Stan.

				STAN
		Okay.  We'll get the money together.
		Don't worry about it, Jerry.  Now,
		d'you want anyone at home, with you,
		until they call?

				JERRY
		No, I - they don't want - they're
		just s'posed to be dealin' with
		me, they were real clear.

				STAN
		Yah.

	Jerry pounds his mittened hands together against the cold.

				JERRY
		Ya know, they said no one listenin'
		in, they'll be watchin', ya know.
		Maybe it's all bull, but like you
		said, Stan, they're callin' the
		shots.

				STAN
		Okay.  And Scotty, is he gonna
		be all right?

				JERRY
		Yah, geez, Scotty.  I'll go talk
		to him.

	There is a tap at the horn from Wade, and Stan gets into the
	Lincoln.

				STAN
		We'll call.

	The Lincoln spits snow as it grinds out of the lot and
	fishtails out onto the boulevard.

	SCOTTY'S BEDROOM

	Scotty lies on the bed, weeping.  Jerry enters and perches
	uncomfortably on the edge of his bed.

				JERRY
		...  How ya doin' there, Scotty?

				SCOTT
		Dad!  What're they doing?  Wuddya
		think they're doin' with Mom?

				JERRY
		It's okay, Scotty.  They're not
		gonna want to hurt her any.
		These men, they just want money,
		see.

				SCOTT
		What if - what if sumpn goes wrong?

				JERRY
		No, no, nothin's goin' wrong here.
		Grandad and I, we're - we're makin'
		sure this gets handled right.

	Scott snorfles and sits up.

				SCOTT
		Dad, I really think we should call
		the cops.

				JERRY
		No!  We can't let anyone know about
		this thing!  We gotta play ball with
		these guys - you ask Stan Grossman,
		he'll tell ya the same thing!

				SCOTT
		Yeah, but -

				JERRY
		We're gonna get Mom back for ya, but
		we gotta play ball.  Ya know, that's
		the deal.  Now if Lorraine calls, or
		Sylvia, you just say that Mom is in
		Florida with Pearl and Marty...

	Scotty starts to weep again.  Jerry stares down at his lap.

				JERRY
		...  That's the best we can do here.

	EXT. CABIN

	It is a lakeside cabin surrounded by white.  A brown Ciera
	with dealer plates is pulling into the drive.

	Grimsrud climbs out of the passenger seat as Carl climbs out
	of the driver's.  Grimsrud opens the back door and, with an
	arm on her elbow, helps Jean out.  She has her hands tied
	behind her and a black hood over her head.

	With a cry, she swings her elbow out of Grimsrud's grasp and
	lurches away across the front lawn.  Grimsrud moves to
	retrieve her but Carl, grinning, lays a hand on his
	shoulder.

				CARL
		Hold it.

	They both look out at the front lawn, Grimsrud
	expressionless, Carl smiling.

	With muffled cries, the hooded woman lurches across the
	unbroken snow, staggering this way and that, stumbling on
	the uneven terrain.

	She stops, stands still, her hooded head swaying.

	She lurches out in an arbitrary direction.  Going downhill,
	she reels, staggers, and falls face-first into the snow,
	weeping.

				CARL
		Ha ha ha ha ha ha!  Jesus!

	Grimsrud, still expressionless, breaks away from Carl's
	restraining hand to retrieve her.

	BRAINERD POLICE HEADQUARTERS

	We track behind Marge as she makes her way across the floor,
	greeting various officers.  She holds a small half-full
	paper sack.

	Beyond her we see a small glassed-in cublcle.  Norm sits at
	the desk inside with a box lunch spread out in front of him.
	There is lettering on the cubicle's glass door:  BRAINERD
	PD. CHIEF GUNDERSON.

	Marge enters and sits behind the desk, detaching her walkie-
	talkie from her utility belt to accomodate the seat.

				MARGE
		Hiya, hon.

	She slides the paper sack toward him.

				NORM
		Brought ya some lunch, Margie.
		What're those, night crawlers?

	He looks inside.

	The bottom of the sack is full of fat, crawling earthworms.

				MARGE
		Yah.

				NORM
		Thanks, hon.

				MARGE
		You bet.  Thanks for lunch.  What
		do we got here, Arbie's?

				NORM
		Uh-huh.

	She starts eating.

				MARGE
		...  How's the paintin' goin'?

				NORM
		Pretty good.  Found out the Hautmans
		are entering a painting this year.

				MARGE
		Aw, hon, you're better'n them.

				NORM
		They're real good.

				MARGE
		They're good, Norm, but you're
		better'n them.

				NORM
		Yah, ya think?

	He leans over and kisses her.

				MARGE
		Ah, ya got Arbie's all o'er me.

	Lou enters.

				LOU
		Hiya, Norm, how's the paintin'
		goin'?

				NORM
		Not too bad.  You know.

				MARGE
		How we doin' on that vehicle?

				LOU
		No motels registered any tan Ciera
		last night.  But the night before,
		two men checked into the Blue Ox
		registering a Ciera and leavin' the
		tag space blank.

				MARGE
		Geez, that's a good lead.  The
		Blue Ox, that's that trucker's
		joint out there on I-35?

				LOU
		Yah.  Owner was on the desk then,
		said these two guys had company.

				MARGE
		Oh, yah?

	EXT. STRIPPER CLUB

	Marge's prowler is parked in an otherwise empty lot.  Snow
	drifts down.

	INT. STRIPPER CLUB

	Marge sits talking with two young women at one end of an
	elevated dance platform.  The club, not yet open for
	business, is deserted.

				MARGE
		Where you girls from?

				HOOKER ONE
		Chaska.

				HOOKER TWO
		LeSeure.  But I went to high school
		in White Bear Lake.

				MARGE
		Okay, I want you to tell me what
		these fellas looked like.

				HOOKER ONE
		Well, the little guy, he was
		kinda funny-looking.

				MARGE
		In what way?

				HOOKER ONE
		I dunno.  Just funny-looking.

				MARGE
		Can you be any more specific?

				HOOKER ONE
		I couldn't really say.  He wasn't
		circumcised.

				MARGE
		Was he funny-looking apart from
		that?

				HOOKER ONE
		Yah.

				MARGE
		So you were having sex with the
		little fella, then?

				HOOKER ONE
		Uh-huh.

				MARGE
		Is there anything else you can
		tell me about him?

				HOOKER ONE
		No.  Like I say, he was funny-looking.
		More'n most people even.

				MARGE
		And what about the other fella?

				HOOKER TWO
		He was a little older.  Looked like
		the Marlboro man.

				MARGE
		Yah?

				HOOKER TWO
		Yah.  Maybe I'm sayin' that cause
		he smoked Marlboros.

				MARGE
		Uh-huh.

				HOOKER TWO
		A subconscious-type thing.

				MARGE
		Yah, that can happen.

				HOOKER TWO
		Yah.

				HOOKER ONE
		They said they were goin' to the
		Twin Cities?

				MARGE
		Oh, yah?

				HOOKER TWO
		Yah.

				HOOKER ONE
		Yah.  Is that useful to ya?

				MARGE
		Oh, you bet, yah.

	EXT. LAKESIDE CABIN

	It is now dusk.  The brown Ciera with dealer plates still
	sits in the drive.

	INT. CABIN

	We track in on Jean Lundegaard, who sits tied in a chair
	with the black hood still over her head.  As we track in, we
	hear inarticulate cursing, intermittent banging and loud
	static.

	We track in on Gaear Grimsrud, who sits smoking a cigarette
	and expressionlessly gazing offscreen.

	We track in on Carl Showalter, who stands over an old black-
	and-white television.  It plays nothing but snow.  Carl is
	banging on it as he mutters:

				CARL
		...days ... be here for days with
		a - DAMMIT! - a goddamn mute ...
		nothin' to do ... and the fucking -
		DAMMIT!...

	Each "dammit" brings a pound of his fist on the TV.

				CARL
		...  TV doesn't even ... plug me
		in, man...  Gimmee a - DAMMIT! -
		signal...  Plug me into the
		ozone, baby...  Plug me into the
		ozone - FUCK!...

	With one last bang we cut:

	BACK TO THE TELEVISION SET

	In extreme close-up an insect is lugging a worm.

				TV VOICE-OVER
		The bark beetle carries the worm
		to the nest ... where it will feed
		its young for up to six weeks...

	A pull back from the screen reveals that we are in Marge's
	house.

	Marge and Norm are watching television in bed.  From the TV
	we hear insects chirring.

	After a long beat, silence except for the TV, Marge murmurs,
	still looking at the set:

				MARGE
		...  Well, I'm turnin' in, Norm.

	Also looking at the TV:

				NORM
		...  Oh, yah?

	Marge rolls over and Norm continues to watch.

	We hold.

	BLACK

	Hold.

	A snowflake drops through the black.

	Another flake.

	It starts snowing.

	BRAINERD MAIN STREET

	The lone traffic light blinks slowly, steadily, red.  Snow
	sifts down.  There is no other movement.

	PAUL BUNYAN

	We are looking up at the bottom-lit statue.  Snow falls.

	HIGH SHOT OF MARGE'S HOUSE

	Snow drops away.

	HIGH SHOT IN MARGE'S BEDROOM

	The bedroom is dark.  Norm is snoring.

	The phone rings.

	Marge gropes in the dark.

				MARGE
		Hello?

				VOICE
		Yah, is this Marge?

				MARGE
		Yah?

				VOICE
		Margie Olmstead?

				MARGE
		...  Well, yah.  Who's this?

				VOICE
		This is Mike Yanagita.  Ya know
		- Mike Yanagita.  Remember me?

				MARGE
		...  Mike Yanagita!

				MIKE
		Yah!

	Marge props herself up next to the still-sleeping Norm.

				MARGE
		Yah, yah, course I remember.
		How are ya?  What time is it?

				MIKE
		Oh, geez.  It's quarter to eleven.
		I hope I dint wake you.

				MARGE
		No, that's okay.

				MIKE
		Yah, I'm down in the Twin Cities
		and I was just watching on TV
		about these shootings up in
		Brainderd, and I saw you on the
		news there.

				MARGE
		Yah.

				MIKE
		I thought, geez, is that Margie
		Olmstead?  I can't believe it!

				MARGE
		Yah, that's me.

				MIKE
		Well, how the heck are ya?

		Yah?

				MARGE
		Yah - how are you doon?

		Heck, it's been such a long time,
		Mike.  It's great to hear from ya.

	He sits in and picks up his phone.

				JERRY

		All right, Jerry, you got this

				JERRY
		Well ... yah.

				JERRY
		What the heck're you talkin' about?
		Let's just finish up this deal
		here -

				CARL
		Blood has been shed, Jerry.

	Jerry sits dumbly.  The voice solemnly repeats:

				CARL
		...  Blood has been shed.

				JERRY
		What the heck d'ya mean?

				CARL
		Three people.  In Brainerd.

				JERRY
		Oh, geez.

				CARL

				JERRY
		...  The heck d'ya mean?

				CARL
		I'll see you tomorrow.

	Click.

	Jerry slams down the phone, which immediately rings.  He
	angrily snatches it up.

				JERRY
		Yah!

				VOICE
		Jerome Lundegaard?

				JERRY
		Yah!

				VOICE
		This is Reilly Deifenbach at GMAC.
		Sir, I have not yet recieved those

		Good day, sir.

		...  Yah.

	WIDE ON THE CUBICLE

	We are looking at Jerry's cubicle from across the showroom.
	Noise muted by distance, we watch Jerry slam down the
	reciever, rise to his feet, fling the phone to the floor,
	raise his desk blotter high over his head with pens and
	pencils rolling off it and slam it onto his desktop.

	He stands for a moment, hands on hips, glaring.

	He stoops and picks up the phone, places it back on the
	desktop, starts picking up the pens and pencils.

	TRACK

	On steam-table bins of food, each identified by a plaque:
	BEEF STROGANOFF, SWEDISH MEATBALLS, BROILED TORSK, CHICKEN
	FLORENTINE.

	A complementary track shows two rays being pushed along a
	buffet line, piled high with many foods.

	MARGE AND NORM AT A TABLE

	They sit next to each other at a long cafateria-style
	Formica table, silently eating.

	A hip with a hissing walkie-talkie enters frame.

				GARY
		Hiya, Norm.  How ya doin', Margie?
		How's the fricasse?

				MARGE
		Pretty darn good, ya want some?

				GARY
		No, I gotta - hey, Norm, I thought
		you were goin' fishin' up at Mile
		Lacs?

				NORM
		Yah, after lunch.

	He goes back to his food.

				MARGE
		Whatcha got there?

	Gary hands her a flimsy.  Marge takes it with one hand and
	looks, her other hand frozen with a forkful of food.

				GARY
		The numbers y'asked for, calls
		made from the lobby pay phone
		at the Blue Ox.  Two to Minneapolis
		that night.

				MARGE
		Mm.

				GARY
		First one's a trucking company,
		second one's a private residence.
		A Shep Proudfoot.

				MARGE
		Uh-huh...  A what?

				GARY
		Shep Proudfoot.  That's a name.

				MARGE
		Uh-huh.

				GARY
		Yah.

				MARGE
		...  Yah, okay, I think I'll
		drive down there, then.

				GARY
		Oh, yah?  Twin Cities?

	Norm, who has been eating steadily throughout, looks over at
	Marge with mild interest.  He stares for a beat as he
	finishes chewing, and them swallows and says:

				NORM
		...  Oh, yah?

	KITCHEN OF LUNDEGAARD HOUSE

	Jerry, Wade, and Stan Grossman sit around the kitchen table.
	It is night.  The scene is harshly toplit by a hanging
	fixture.  On the table are the remains of coffee and a
	cinammon filbert ring.

				WADE
		Dammit!  I wanna be a part a
		this thing!

				JERRY
		No, Wade!  They were real clear!
		They said they'd call tomorrow,
		with instructions, and it's gonna
		be delivered by me alone!

				WADE
		It's my money, I'll deliver it
		- what do they care?

				STAN
		Wade's got a point there.  I'll
		handle the call if you want, Jerry.

				JERRY
		No, no.  See - they, no, see, they
		only deal with me.  Ya feel this,
		this nervousness on the phone there,
		they're very - these guys're
		dangerous -

				WADE
		All the more reason!  I don't want
		you - with all due respect, Jerry
		- I don't want you mucking this up.

				JERRY
		The heck d'ya mean?

				WADE
		They want my money, they can deal
		with me.  Otherwise I'm goin' to
		a professional.

	He points at a briefcase.

				WADE
		...  There's a million dollars
		here!

				JERRY
		No, see -

				WADE
		Look, Jerry, you're not sellin'
		me a damn car.  It's my show here.
		That's that.

				STAN
		It's the way we prefer to handle
		it, Jerry.

	THE DOWNTOWN RADISSON HOTEL

	Marge is at the reception desk.

				MARGE
		How ya doin'?

				CLERK
		Real good.  How're you today, ma'am?

				MARGE
		Real good.  I'm Mrs. Gunderson, I

	The clerk types into a computer console.

				CLERK
		You sure do, Mrs. Gunderson.

				MARGE
		Is there a phone down here, ya think?

	LOBBY CORNER

	Marge is on a public phone.

				MARGE
		...  Detective Sibert?  Yah, this
		is Marge Gunderson from up Brainerd,
		we spoke -  Yah.  Well, actually
		I'm in town here.  I had to do a
		few things in the Twin Cities, so
		I thought I'd check in with ya about
		that USIF search on Shep Proudfoot...
		Oh, yah?...  Well, maybe I'll go

		yah?  Is it reasonable?

	A GREEN FREEWAY SIGN

	Through a windshield we see a sign for the MINNEAPOLIS
	INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT.

	ROOFTOP PARKING LOT

	The brown Ciera enters and drives lazy S-curves around the
	few snow-covered cars parked on the roof of the lot.

	It stops by one car and Carl emerges.  He quickly scans the
	lot, then kneels in the snow at the back of the parked car
	and starts unscrewing its license plate.

	EXIT BOOTH

	Carl pulls up and hands the attendant his ticket.

				CARL
		Yeah, I decided not to park here.

	The attendant frowns uncomprehendingly at the ticket.

				ATTENDANT
		...  What do you mean, you decided
		not to park here?

				CARL
		Yeah, I just came in.  I decided
		not to park here.

	The attendant is still puzzled.

				ATTENDANT
		You, uh...  I'm sorry, sir, but -

				CARL
		I decided not to - I'm, uh, not
		taking the trip as it turns out.

				ATTENDANT
		I'm sorry, sir, we do have to
		charge you the four dollars.

				CARL
		I just pulled in here.  I just
		fucking pulled in here!

				ATTENDANT
		Well, see, there's a minimum charge
		of four dollars.  Long-term parking
		charges by the day.

	A car behind beeps.  Carl glances back, starts digging for
	money.

				CARL
		I guess you think, ya know, you're
		an authority figure.  With that
		stupid fucking uniform.  Huh, buddy?

	The attendant doesn't say anything.

				CARL
		...  King Clip-on Tie here.  Big
		fucking man.

	He is peeling off one dollar bills.

				CARL
		...  You know, these are the limits
		of your life, man.  Ruler of your
		little fucking gate here.  There's
		your four dollars.  You pathetic
		piece of shit.

	GUSTAFSON OLDS GARAGE

	Jerry is staring up, mouth agape, at the underside of a car
	on a hydraulic lift.  Bewildered, he looks about, then asks
	a mechanic passing by, his voice raised over the din of the
	shop.

				JERRY
		Where's Shep?

	The mechanic points.

				MECHANIC
		Talkin' to a cop.

	Jerry looks.

				JERRY
		...  Cop?

	Marge and Shep face each other at the other end of the floor
	in a grimy and cluttered glassed-in cubicle.

				MECHANIC
		Said she was a policewoman.

	Marge and Shep silently talk.

	Jerry stares, swallows.

	INSIDE THE CUBICLE

				MARGE
		- Wednesday night?

	Shep is shaking his head.

				SHEP
		Nope.

				MARGE
		Well, you do reside their at
		1425 Fremont Terrace?

				SHEP
		Yep.

				MARGE
		Anyone else residing there?

				SHEP
		Nope.

				MARGE
		Well, Mr. Proudfoot, this call
		came in past three in the morning.
		It's just hard for me to believe
		you can't remember anyone calling.

	Shep says nothing.

				MARGE
		...  Now, I know you've had some
		problems, struggling with the
		narcotics, some other entanglements,
		currently on parole -

				SHEP
		So?

				MARGE
		Well, associating with criminals,
		if you're the one they talked to,
		that right there would be a
		violation of your parole and would
		end with you back in Stillwater.

				SHEP
		Uh-huh.

				MARGE
		Now, I saw some rough stuff on
		your priors, but nothing in the
		nature of a homicide...

	Shep stares at her.

				MARGE
		...  I know you don't want to be
		an accessory to something like
		that.

				SHEP
		Nope.

				MARGE
		So you think you might remember
		who those folks were who called
		ya?

	JERRY'S OFFICE

	Jerry is worriedly pacing behind his desk.  At a noise he
	looks up.

	Marge has stuck her head in the door.

				MARGE
		Mr. Lundegaard?

				JERRY
		Huh?  Yah?

				MARGE
		I wonder if I could take just a
		minute of your time here -

				JERRY
		What...  What is it all about?

				MARGE
		Huh?  Do you mind if I sit down
		- I'm carrying quite a load here.

	Marge plops into the chair opposite him.

				MARGE
		...  You're the owner here, Mr.
		Lundegaard?

				JERRY
		Naw, I...  Executive Sales Manager.

				MARGE
		Well, you can help me.  My name's
		Marge Gunderson -

				JERRY
		My father-in-law, he's the owner.

				MARGE
		Uh-huh.  Well, I'm a police officer
		from up Brainerd investigating some
		malfeasance and I was just wondering
		if you've had any new vehicles stolen
		off the lot in the past couple of
		weeks - specifically a tan Cutlass
		Ciera?

	Jerry stares at her, his mouth open.

				MARGE
		...  Mr. Lundegaard?

				JERRY
		...  Brainerd?

				MARGE
		Yah.  Yah.  Home a Paul Bunyan and
		Babe the Blue Ox.

				JERRY
		...  Babe the Blue Ox?

				MARGE
		Yah, ya know we've got the big
		statue there.  So you haven't had
		any vehicles go missing, then?

				JERRY
		No.  No, ma'am.

				MARGE
		Okey-dokey, thanks a bunch.  I'll
		let you get back to your paperwork,
		then.

	As Marge rises, Jerry looks blankly down at the papers on
	the desk in front of him.

				JERRY
		...  Yah, okay.

	He looks up at Marge's retreating back.  He looks back down
	at the papers.  He looks over at the phone.

	he picks up the phone and dials four digits.

				JERRY
		...  Yah, gimmee Shep...  The
		heck d'ya mean?...  Well, where'd
		he go?  It's only...  No, I don't
		need a mechanic - oh, geez - I
		gotta talk to a friend of his, so,
		uh ... have him, uh ... oh, geez...

	HOTEL BAR

	Marge enters.  She looks around the bar, a rather
	characterless, lowlit meeting place for business people.

				VOICE
		Marge?

	It is a bald, paunching man of about Marge's age, rising
	from a booth halfway back.  His features are broad,
	friendly, Asian-American.

				MARGE
		Mike!

	He approaches somewhat carefully, as if on his second drink.
	They hug and head back toward the booth.

				MIKE
		Geez!  You look great!

				MARGE
		Yah - easy there - you do too!
		I'm expecting, ya know.

				MIKE
		I see that!  That's great!

	A waitress meets them at the table.

				MIKE
		...  What can I get ya?

				MARGE
		Just a Diet Coke.

	Again she glances about.

				MARGE
		...  This is a nice place.

				MIKE
		Yah, ya know it's the Radisson,
		so it's pretty good.

				MARGE
		You're livin' in Edina, then?

				MIKE
		Oh, yah, couple years now.  It's
		actually Eden Prarie - that school
		district.  So Chief Gunderson, then!
		So ya went and married Norm Son-of-
		a-Gunderson!

				MARGE
		Oh, yah, a long time ago.

				MIKE
		Great.  What brings ya down - are
		ya down here on that homicide -
		if you're allowed, ya know, to
		discuss that?

				MARGE
		Oh, yah, but there's not a heckuva
		lot to discuss.  What about you,
		Mike?  Are you married - you have
		kids?

				MIKE
		Well, yah, I was married.  I was
		married to -  You mind if I sit
		over here?

	He is sliding out of his side of the booth and easing in
	next to Marge.

				MIKE
		...  I was married to Linda
		Cooksey -

				MARGE
		No, I -  Mike - wyncha sit over
		there, I'd prefer that.

				MIKE
		Huh?  Oh, okay, I'm sorry.

				MARGE
		No, just so I can see ya, ya know.
		Don't have to turn my neck.

				MIKE
		Oh, sure, I unnerstand, I didn't
		mean to -

				MARGE
		No, no, that's fine.

				MIKE
		Yah, sorry, so I was married to
		Linda Cooksey - ya remember Linda?
		She was a year behind us.

				MARGE
		I think I remember Linda, yah.
		She was - yah.  So things didn't
		work out, huh?

				MIKE
		And then I, and then I been workin'
		for Honeywell for a few years now.

				MARGE
		Well, they're a good outfit.

				MIKE
		Yah, if you're an engineer, yah,
		you could do a lot worse.  Of
		course, it's not, uh, it's
		nothin' like your achievement.

				MARGE
		It sounds like you're doin' really
		super.

				MIKE
		Yah, well, I, uh ... it's not that
		it didn't work out -  Linda passed
		away.  She, uh...

				MARGE
		I'm sorry.

				MIKE
		Yah, I, uh...  She had leukemia,
		you know...

				MARGE
		No, I didn't...

				MIKE
		It was a tough, uh ... it was a
		long -  She fought real hard,
		Marge...

				MARGE
		I'm sorry, Mike.

				MIKE
		Oh, ya know, that's, uh - what
		can I say?...

	He holds up his drink.

				MIKE
		...  Better times, huh?

	Marge clinks it.

				MARGE
		Better times.

				MIKE
		I was so...  I been so ... and
		then I saw you on TV, and I
		remembered, ya know...  I always
		liked you...

				MARGE
		Well, I always liked you, Mike.

				MIKE
		I always liked ya so much...

				MARGE
		It's okay, Mike -  Should we get
		together another time, ya think?

				MIKE
		No - I'm sorry!  It's just -  I
		been so lonely - then I saw you,
		and...

	He is weeping.

				MIKE
		...  I'm sorry...  I shouldn't a
		done this...  I thought we'd have
		a really terrific time, and now
		I've...

				MARGE
		It's okay...

				MIKE
		You were such a super lady ...
		and then I...  I been so lonely...

				MARGE
		It's okay, Mike...

	CARLTON CELEBRITY ROOM

	Carl Showalter is sitting at a small table with a tarty-
	looking blonde in a low-cut gown.  Each holds a drink.

				CARL
		Just in town on business.  Just
		in and out.  Ha ha!  A little of
		the old in-and-out!

				WOMAN
		Wuddya do?

	Carl looks around.

				CARL
		Have ya been to the Celebrity Room
		before?  With other, uh, clients?

				WOMAN
		I don't think so.  It's nice.

				CARL
		Yeah, well, it depends on the artist.
		You know, Jose Feliciano, ya got no
		complaints.  Waiter!

	The reverse shows a disappearing waiter and the backs of
	many, many people sitting at tables between us and the very
	distant stage.  Jose Feliciano, very small, performs on a
	spotlit stool.  The acoustics are poor.

	Carl grimaces.

				CARL
		...  What is he, deaf?...  So,
		uh, how long have you been with
		the escort service?

				WOMAN
		I don't know.  Few munce.

				CARL
		Ya find the work interesting, do ya?

				WOMAN
		...  What're you talking about?

	A DIRTY BEDROOM

	Carl is humping the escort.

	We hear the door burst open.

	The escort is grabbed and flung out of bed.

				CARL
		Shep!  What the hell are you doing?
		I'm banging that girl!  Shep!  Jesus
		Ch -

	Shep slaps him hard, forehand, backhand.

				SHEP
		Fuck out of my house!

	He hauls him up -

				CARL
		Shep!  Don't you dare fucking hit
		me, man!  Don't you -

	- punches him and flings him away.

	Carl hits a sofa and we see his bare legs disappear as he
	flips back over it.

	Shep enters frame to circle the sofa and kick at Carl behind
	it.

				SHEP
		Fuck outta here.  Put me back in
		Stillwater.  Little fucking shit.

	There is a knock at the door.

				VOICE
		Hey!  Come on in there!

	Shep strides to the door, flings it open.

	A man in boxer shorts stands in the doorway.

				MAN
		C'mon, brother, it's late -  Unghh!

	Shep hits him twice, then grabs both of his ears and starts
	banging his head against the wall.

	The hooker runs by, clutching her clothes, and Shep kicks
	her in the ass as she passes.

	He spins and goes back into the apartment.

	Carl is hopping desperately into his pants.

				CARL
		Stay away from me, man!  Hey!
		Smoke a fuckin' peace pipe, man!
		Don't you dare fuckin' -  Unghh!

	After hitting him several times, Shep yanks Carl's belt out
	of his dangling pants and strangles him with it.  Carl
	gurgles.  Shep knees Carl repeatedly, then dumps him onto
	the floor and starts whipping him with the buckle end of the
	belt.

	CHAIN RESTAURANT PHONE BOOTH

	Carl listens to the phone ring at the other end.  His face
	is deeply bruised and cut.

	Finally, through the phone...

				VOICE
		...  Yah?

				CARL
		All right, Jerry, I'm through
		fucking around.  You got the
		fucking money?

	JERRY'S KITCHEN

	Jerry is at the kitchen phone.  Through the door to the
	dining room we see Wade picking up an extension.

				JERRY
		Yah, I got the money, but, uh -

				CARL
		Don't you fucking but me, Jerry.
		I want you with this money on the
		Dayton-Radisson parking ramp, top
		level, thirty minutes, and we'll
		wrap this up.

				JERRY
		Yah, okay, but, uh -

				CARL
		You're there in thirty minutes or
		I find you, Jerry, and I shoot
		you, and I shoot your fucking wife,
		and I shoot all your little fucking
		children, and I shoot 'em all in the
		back of their little fucking heads.
		Got it?

				JERRY
		...  Yah, well, you stay away from
		Scotty now -

				CARL
		GOT IT?

				JERRY
		Okay, real good, then.

	The line goes dead.

	A door slams offscreen.

	EXT. HOUSE

	Wade, briefcase in hand, gets into his Cadillac, slams the
	door and peels out.

	INT. CAR

	Wade's jaw works as he glares out at traffic.  He mumbles to
	himself as he drives.

				WADE
		Okay ... here's your damn money,
		now where's my daughter?...
		Goddamn punk ... where's my damn
		daughter...

	He pulls out a gun, cracks the barrel, peers in.

				WADE
		...  You little punk.

	JERRY'S HOUSE

	Jerry sits in the foyer, trying to pull on pair of galoshes.
	Scotty's voice comes from upstairs:

				VOICE
		...  Dad?

				JERRY
		It's okay, Scotty.

				VOICE
		Where're you going?

				JERRY
		Be back in a minute.  If Stan
		calls you, just tell him I went
		to Embers.  Oh, geez -

	Thunk! - his first boot goes on.

	RADISSON

	Marge sits on the bed in her hotel room, shoes off,
	massaging her feet.  The phone is pressed to her ear, and
	through it, we hear ringing.

				VOICE
		...  Hello?

				MARGE
		Norm?

	MILLE LACS LAKE

	It is late evening, blowing storm.  A leisurely pan across
	the bleak gray expanse finds a little hut in the middle of
	the frozen lake with a pickup truck parked next to it.

				MARGE'S VOICE
		They bitin'?

	INT. HUT

	Norm has a cellular phone to his ear.  His feet are
	stretched out to an electric heater.  The interior is bathed
	in soft orange light.

				NORM
		Yah, okay.  How's the hotel?

				MARGE
		Oh, pretty good.  They bitin'?

				NORM
		Yeah, couple a muskies.  No pike
		yet.  How d'you feel?

				MARGE
		Oh, fine.

				NORM
		Not on your feet too much?

				MARGE
		No, no.

				NORM
		You shouldn't be on your feet too
		much, you got weight you're not
		used too.  How's the food down
		there?

				MARGE
		Had dinner at a place called the
		King's Table.  Buffet style.  It
		was pretty darn good.

				NORM
		Was it reasonable?

				MARGE
		Yah, not too bad.  So it's nice
		up there?

				NORM
		Yah, it's good.  No pike yet, but
		it's good.

	DAYTON-RADISSON RAMP

	The top, open, level.  Snow blows.  A car sits idling.

	Another car pulls onto the roof.  It creeps over to the
	parked car and stops.  It continues to idle as its door
	opens and Wade steps out, carrying the briefcase.

	The door of the other car bangs open and Carl bounces out.

				CARL
		Who the fuck are you?  Who the
		fuck are you?

				WADE
		I got your goddamn money, you
		little punk.  Now where's my
		daughter?

				CARL
		I am through fucking around!  Drop
		that fucking briefcase!

				WADE
		Where's my daughter?

				CARL
		Fuck you, man!  Where's Jerry?  I
		gave SIMPLE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS -

				WADE
		Where's my damn daughter?  No
		Jean, no money!

				CARL
		Drop that fucking money!

				WADE
		No Jean, no money!

				CARL
		Is this a fucking joke here?

	He pulls out a gun and fires into Wade's gut.

				CARL
		...  Is this a fucking joke?

				WADE
		Unghh ... oh, geez...

	He is on the pavement, clutching at his gut.  Snow swirls.

				CARL
		You fucking imbeciles!

	He bends down next to Wade to pick up the briefcase.

				WADE
		Oh, for Christ ... oh, geez...

	Wade brings out his gun and fires at Carl's head, close by.

				CARL
		Oh!

	Carl stumbles and falls back, and then stands up again.  His
	jaw is gouting blood.

				CARL
		...  Owwmm...

	One hand pressed to his jaw, he fires down at Wade several
	times.  Blood streams through the hand pressed to his jaw.

				CARL
		...  Mmmmmphnck!  He fnkem shop me...

	He pockets the gun, picks up the briefcase one-handed,
	flings it into his car, gets in, peels out.

	DOWN RAMP

	Carl screams down the ramp.  He takes a corner at high speed
	and swerves, just missing Jerry in his Olds on his way to
	the top.

	INT. JERRY'S CAR

	Jerry recovers from the near miss and continues up.

				JERRY
		Oh, geez!

	EXIT BOOTH

	Carl squeals to a halt at the gate, still pressing his hand
	to his bleeding jaw.

				CARL
		Ophhem ma fuchem gaphe!

				ATTENDANT
		May I have your ticket, please?

	RAMP ROOF

	Jerry pulls to a halt next to Wade's idling Cadillac.  He
	gets out and walks slowly to Wade's body, prostrate in the
	swirling snow.

				JERRY
		Oh!  Oh, geez!

	He bends down, picks Wade up by the armpits and drags him
	over to the back of the Cadillac.  He drops Wade's body,
	walks to the driver's side of the car, pulls the keys and
	walks back to pop the trunk.  He wrestles Wade's body into
	the trunk, slams it shut and walks back to the scene of the
	shooting.

	He kicks at the snow with his galoshed feet, trying to hide
	the fresh bloodstains.

	EXIT BOOTH

	Jerry approaches in the Cadillac.

	The wooden gate barring the exit has been broken away.  The
	booth is empty.

	Jerry eases toward the street, looking over at the booth as
	he passes.

	Inside the booth we see the awkwardly angled leg of a
	prostrate body.

	EXT. JERRY'S HOUSE

	The car pulls into the driveway.

	FOYER

	Jerry enters and sits on the foyer chair to take off his
	galoshes.

				SCOTT'S VOICE
		...  Dad?

				JERRY
		Yah.

				SCOTT'S VOICE
		Stan Grossman called.

				JERRY
		Yah, okay.

				SCOTT'S VOICE
		Twice.

				JERRY
		Okay.

				SCOTT'S VOICE
		...  Is everything okay?

				JERRY
		Yah.

	Thoonk - the first boot comes off.

				SCOTT'S VOICE
		Are you calling Stan?

				JERRY
		Well...  I'm goin' ta bed now.

	CARL'S CAR

	Carl mumbles as he drives, underlit by the dim dash lights,
	one hand now holding a piece of rag to his shredded jaw.

				CARL
		...  Fnnkn ashlzh...  Fnk...

	ROAD

	Carl's car roars into frame, violently swirling the snow.
	Its red tail lights fishtail away.

	FADE OUT

	HOLD IN BLACK

	HARD CUT TO:  BRIGHT - LOOKING THROUGH A WINDSHIELD

	It is a starky sunny day.  We are cruising down a street of
	humble lookalike houses.

	We pan right as we draw toward one house in particular.  In
	its driveway a man in a hooded parka shovels snow.  He
	notices the approaching car and gives its driver a wave.

	The driver is Gary, the Brainderd police officer.  He gives
	a finger-to-the-head salute and pulls over.

	OUTSIDE

	Gary slams his door shut and the other man plants his shovel
	in the snow.

				MAN
		How ya doin'?

				GARY
		Mr. Mohra?

				MAN
		Yah.

				GARY
		Officer Olson.

				MAN
		Yah, right-o.

	The two men caucus the driveway without shaking hands and
	without standing particularly close.  They stand stiffly,
	arms down at their sides and breath streaming out of their
	parka hoods.  Each has an awkward leaning-away posture, head
	drawn slightly back and chin tucked in, to keep his face
	from protruding into the cold.

				MAN
		...  So, I'm tendin' bar there at
		Ecklund && Swedlin's last Tuesday
		and this little guy's drinkin'
		and he says, 'So where can a guy
		find some action - I'm goin' crazy
		down there at the lake.'  And I
		says, 'What kinda action?' and he
		says, 'Woman action, what do I
		look like,'  And I says 'Well,
		what do I look like, I don't
		arrange that kinda thing,' and he
		says, 'I'm goin' crazy out there
		at the lake' and I says, 'Well,
		this ain't that kinda place.'

				GARY
		Uh-huh.

				MAN
		So he says, 'So I get it, so you
		think I'm some kinda jerk for
		askin',' only he doesn't use the
		word jerk.

				GARY
		I unnerstand.

				MAN
		And then he calls me a jerk and
		says the last guy who thought he
		was a jerk was dead now.  So I
		don't say nothin' and he says, 'What
		do ya think about that?'  So I
		says, 'Well, that don't sound like
		too good a deal for him then.'

				GARY
		Ya got that right.

				MAN
		And he says, 'Yah, that guy's dead
		and I don't mean a old age.'  And
		then he says, 'Geez, I'm goin'
		crazy out there at the lake.'

				GARY
		White Bear Lake?

				MAN
		Well, Ecklund && Swedlin's, that's
		closer ta Moose Lake, so I made
		that assumption.

				GARY
		Oh sure.

				MAN
		So, ya know, he's drinkin', so I
		don't think a whole great deal of
		it, but Mrs. Mohra heard about the
		homicides out here and she thought
		I should call it in, so I called
		it in.  End a story.

				GARY
		What'd this guy look like anyways?

				MAN
		Oh, he was a little guy, kinda
		funny-lookin'.

				GARY
		Uh-huh - in what way?

				MAN
		Just a general way.

				GARY
		Okay, well, thanks a bunch, Mr.
		Mohra.  You're right, it's probably
		nothin', but thanks for callin'
		her in.

				MAN
		Oh sure.  They say she's gonna
		turn cold tomorrow.

				GARY
		Yah, got a front movin' in.

				MAN
		Ya got that right.

	CLOSE ON CARL SHOWALTER

	In his car, now parked, one hand holding the rag pressed to
	his mangled jaw.  He is staring down at something in the
	front seat next to him.

	His other hand holds open the briefcase.  It has money
	inside - a lot of money.

	Carl unfreezes, takes out one of the bank-wrapped wads and
	looks at it.

				CARL
		...  Mmmnphh.

	He paws through the money in the briefcase to get a feeling
	for the amount.

				CARL
		...  Jeshush Shrist...  Jeshush
		fuchem Shrist!

	Excited, he counts out a bundle of bills and tosses it onto
	the back seat.

	He starts to take the rag away from his chin but the layer
	pressed against his face sticks, its loose weave bound to
	his skin by clotted blood.

	He pulls very gently and winces as blood starts to flow
	again.

	He carefully tears the rag in half so that only a bit of it
	remains adhering to his jaw.

	EXT. CAR

	It is pulled over to the side of an untraveled road.  THe
	door opens and Carl emerges with the briefcase.

	He slogs through the snow, down a gulley and up the
	embankment to a barbed-wire fence.  He kneels at one of the
	fence posts and frantically digs into the snow with his bare
	hands, throws in the briefcase and covers it back up.

	He stands and tries to beat the circulation back into his
	red, frozen hands.

	He looks to the right.

	A regular line of identical fence posts stretches away
	against unblemished white.

	He looks to the left.

	A regular line of identical fence posts stretches away
	against unblemished white.

	He looks at the fence post in front of him.

				CARL
		Mmmphh...

	He looks about the snowy vastness for a marker.  Finding
	none, he kicks the fence post a couple of times, failing to
	scar or tilt it, then hurriedly plants a couple of sicks up
	against the post.

	He bends down, scoops up a handful of snow, presses it
	against his wounded jaw, and lopes back to the idling car.

	HOTEL ROOM

	Marge has a packed overnight back sitting on the unmade bed.
	She is ready to leave, already wearing her parka, but is on
	the phone.

				MARGE
		No, I'm leavin' this mornin', back
		up to Brainerd.

				VOICE
		Well, I'm sorry I won't see ya.

				MARGE
		Mm.  But ya think he's all right?
		I saw him last night and he's -

				VOICE
		What'd he say?

				MARGE
		Well, it was nothin' specific

		all hit him really hard, his
		wife dyin' -

				VOICE
		His wife?

				MARGE

				VOICE
		No.

				MARGE

				VOICE
		No.  No.  No.  They weren't -
		he, uh, he was bothering Linda
		for about, oh, for a good year.
		Really pestering her, wouldn't
		leave her alone.

				MARGE
		So ... they didn't...

				VOICE
		No.  No.  They never married.
		Mike's had psychiatric problems.

				MARGE
		Oh.  Oh, my.

				VOICE
		Yah, he - he's been struggling.
		He's living with his parents now.

				MARGE
		Oh.  Geez.

				VOICE
		Yah, Linda's fine.  You should
		call her.

				MARGE
		Geez.  Well - geez.  That's a
		suprise.

	MARGE'S CAR

	Marge drives, gazing out at the road.

	MARGE AT A DRIVE-THROUGH

	She leans out of her open window and yells at the order
	panel:

				MARGE
		Hello?

	MARGE AT THE GUSTAFSON OLDS GARAGE

	She sits in the lot, eating a breakfast sandwich.

	JERRY LUNDEGAARD'S OFFICE

	Jerry is at his desk using a blunt pencil to enter numbers
	onto a form.  Beneath the form is a piece of carbon paper
	and beneath that another form copy, which Jerry periodically
	checks.  The carbon-copy form shows thick smudgy, illegible
	entries.

	Jerry hums nervously.

	Glass rattles as someone taps at his door.

	Jerry looks up and freezes, mouth hanging open, brow knit
	with worry.

	Marge sticks her head in the door.

				MARGE
		Mr. Lundegaard?  Sorry to bother
		you again.  Can I come in?

	She starts to enter.

				JERRY
		Yah, no, I'm kinda - I'm kinda
		busy -

				MARGE
		I unnerstand.  I'll keep it real
		short, then.  I'm on my way out
		of town, but I was just -  Do you
		mind if I sit down?  I'm carrying
		a bit of a load here.

				JERRY
		No, I -

	But she is already sitting into the chair opposite with a
	sigh of relieved weight.

				MARGE
		Yah, it's this vehicle I asked you
		about yesterday.  I was just
		wondering -

				JERRY
		Yah, like I told ya, we haven't had
		any vehicles go missing.

				MARGE
		Okay, are you sure, cause, I mean,
		how do you know?  Because, see,
		the crime I'm investigating, the
		perpetrators were driving a car
		with dealer plates.  And they
		called someone who works here, so
		it'd be quite a coincidence if
		they weren't, ya know, connected.

				JERRY
		Yah, I see.

				MARGE
		So how do you - have you done any
		kind of inventory recently?

				JERRY
		The car's not from our lot, ma'am.

				MARGE
		but do you know that for sure
		without -

				JERRY
		Well, I would know.  I'm the
		Executive Sales Manager.

				MARGE
		Yah, but -

				JERRY
		We run a pretty tight ship here.

				MARGE
		I know, but - well, how do you
		establish that, sir?  Are the
		cars, uh, counted daily or what
		kind of -

				JERRY
		Ma'am, I answered your question.

	There is a silent beat.

				MARGE
		...  I'm sorry, sir?

				JERRY
		Ma'am, I answered your question.
		I answered the darn -  I'm
		cooperating here, and I...

				MARGE
		Sir, you have no call to get
		snippy with me.  I'm just doin'
		my job here.

				JERRY
		I'm not, uh, I'm not arguin' here.
		I'm cooperating...  There's no, uh
		- we're doin' all we can...

	He trails off into silence.

				MARGE
		Sir, could I talk to Mr. Gustafson?

	Jerry stares at her.

				MARGE
		...  Mr. Lundegaard?

	Jerry explodes:

				JERRY
		Well, heck, if you wanna, if you
		wanna play games here!  I'm
		workin' with ya on this thing, but
		I...

	He is getting angrily off his feet.

				JERRY
		Okay, I'll do a damned lot count!

				MARGE
		Sir?  Right now?

				JERRY
		Sure right now!  You're darned
		tootin'!

	He is yanking his parka from a hook behind the opened door
	and grabbing a pair of galoshes.

				JERRY
		...  If it's so damned imporant
		to ya!

				MARGE
		I'm sorry, sir, I -

	Jerry has the parka slung over one arm and the galoshes
	pinched in his hand.

				JERRY
		Aw, what the Christ!

	He stamps out the door.

	Marge stares.

	After a long moment her stare breaks.  She glances idly
	around the office.

	There is a framed picture facing away from her on the
	desktop.  She turns it to face her.  It is Scotty, holding
	an accordion.  There is another picture of Jean.

	Marge looks at it, looks around, for some reason, at the
	ceiling.

	She looks at a trophy shelf on the wall behind her.

	She fiddles idly with a pencil.  She pulls a clipboard
	toward her.  It holds a form from the General Motors Finance
	Corporation.

	She looks idly around.  Her look abruptly locks.

				MARGE
		...  Oh, for Pete's sake.

	Jerry is easing his car around the near corner of the
	building.

	Marge's voice is flat with dismay:

				MARGE
		...  Oh, for Pete's sake...

	She grabs the phone and punches in a number.

				MARGE
		...  For Pete's s- he's fleein' the
		interview.  He's feelin' the
		interview...

	Jerry makes a left turn into traffic.

				MARGE
		...  Detective Sibert, please...

	POLICE OFFICER

	We are looking across a steam table at a man in blue.  He
	moves slowly to the right, pushing his tray along a
	cafeteria line.  Behind him, in the depth of the room, is an
	eating area of long Formica tables at which sit a mix of
	uniformed and civilian-clothed police and staff.

	We are listening to an offscreen woman's voice.

				WOMAN
		Well, so far we're just saying he's
		wanted for questioning in connection
		with a triple homicide.  Nobody at
		the dealship there's been much help
		guessing where he might go...

	The woman is entering frame sliding a tray.  Marge enters
	behind her, sliding her own.  We move laterally with them as
	they slowly make their way along the line.

				MARGE
		Uh-huh.

				WOMAN
		We called his house; his little
		boy said he hadn't been there.

				MARGE
		And his wife?

				WOMAN
		She's visiting relatives in Florida.
		Now his boss, this guy Gustafson,
		he's also disappeared.  Nobody at
		his office knows where he is.

				MARGE
		Geez.  Looks like this thing goes
		higher than we thought.  You call
		his home?

				WOMAN
		His wife's in the hospital, has
		been for a couple months.  The big C.

				MARGE
		Oh, my.

				WOMAN
		And this Shep Proudfoot character,
		he's a little darling.  He's now
		wanted for assault and parole
		violation.  He clobbered a neighbor
		of his last night and another
		person who could be one of your perps,
		and he's at large.

				MARGE
		Boy, this thing is really ... geez.

				WOMAN
		Well, they're all out on the wire.
		Well, you know...

				MARGE
		Yah.  Well, I just can't thank you
		enough, Detective Sibert, this
		cooperation has been outstanding.

				DETECTIVE SIBERT
		Ah, well, we haven't had to run
		around like you.  When're you due?

				MARGE
		End a April.

				DETECTIVE SIBERT
		Any others?

				MARGE
		This'll be our first.  We've been
		waiting a long time.

				DETECTIVE SIBERT
		That's wonderful.  Mm-mm.  It'll
		change your life, a course.

				MARGE
		Oh, yah, I know that!

				DETECTIVE SIBERT
		They can really take over, that's
		for sure.

				MARGE
		You have children?

	Detective Sibert pulls an accordion of plastic picture
	sleeves from her purse to show Marge.

				DETECTIVE SIBERT
		I thought you'd never ask.  The
		older one is Janet, she's nine, and
		the younger one is Morgan.

				MARGE
		Oh, now he's adorable.

				DETECTIVE SIBERT
		He's three now.  Course, not in that
		picture.

				MARGE
		Oh, he's adorable.

				DETECTIVE SIBERT
		Yah, he -

				MARGE
		Where'd you get him that parka?

	They have reached the end of the cafeteria line.  With a nod
	to the cashier, Detective Sibert indicates hers and Marge's
	trays.

				DETECTIVE SIBERT
		Both of these.

				MARGE
		Oh, no, I can't let you do that.

				DETECTIVE SIBERT
		Oh, don't be silly.

				MARGE
		Well, okay - thank you, Detective.

				DETECTIVE SIBERT
		Oh, don't be silly.

	GAEAR GRIMSRUD

	He sits eating a Swanson's TV dinner from a TV tray he has
	set up in front of an easy chair.

	He watches the old black-and-white TV set whose image - it
	might be a game show - is still heavily ghosting and
	diffused by snow.  The audio crackles with interference.
	Despite the impenetrability of its image, it holds
	Grimsrud's complete attention.

	At the sound of the front door opening, Grimsrud looks up.

	Carl enters, his face suppurating and raw.

	He reacts to Grimsrud's wordless look with a grotesque
	laugh.

				CARL
		You should she zhe uzher guy!

	He glances around.

				CARL
		...  The fuck happen a her?

	Jean sits slumped in a straight-backed chair facing the
	wall.  Her hooded head, resting on her chin, is motionless.
	There is blood on the facing wall.

				GRIMSRUD
		She started shrieking, you know.

				CARL
		Jezhush.

	He shakes his head.

				CARL
		...  Well, I gotta muddy.

	He is plunking down eight bank-wrapped bundles on the table.

				CARL
		...  All of it.  All eighty gran.
		Forty for you...

	He makes one pile, pockets the rest.

				CARL
		...  Forty for me.  Sho thishuzh
		it.  Adiosh.

	He slaps keys down on the table.

				CARL
		...  You c'n'ave my truck.  I'm
		takin' a Shiera.

				GRIMSRUD
		We split that.

	Carl looks at him.

				CARL
		HOW THE FUCK DO WE SHPLITTA FUCKIN'
		CAR?  Ya dummy!  Widda fuckin'
		chainshaw?

	Grimsrud looks sourly up.  There is a beat.  Finally:

				GRIMSRUD
		One of us pays the other for half.

				CARL
		HOLD ON!  NO FUCKIN' WAY!  YOU
		FUCKIN' NOTISH ISH?  I GOT FUCKIN'
		SHOT INNA FAISH!  I WENT'N GOTTA
		FUCKIN' MONEY!  I GET SHOT FUCKIN'
		PICKIN' IT UP!  I BEEN UP FOR
		THIRTY-SHIKSH FUCKIN' HOURZH!  I'M
		TAKIN' THAT FUCKIN' CAR!  THAT
		FUCKERZH MINE!

	Carl waits for an argument, but only gets the steady sour
	look.

	Carl pulls out a gun.

				CARL
		...  YOU FUCKIN' ASH-HOLE!  I
		LISHEN A YOUR BULLSHIT FOR A WHOLE
		FUCKIN' WEEK!

	A beat.  Carl returns Grimsrud's stare.

				CARL
		...  Are we shquare?

	Grimsrud says nothing.

				CARL
		...  ARE WE SHQUARE?

	A beat.

	Disgusted, Carl pockets the gun and heads for the door.

				CARL
		...  Fuckin' ash-hole.  And if
		you shee your friend Shep Proudpfut,
		tell him I'm gonna NAIL hizh
		fuckin' ash.

	OUTSIDE

	We are pulling Carl as he walks toward the car.  Behind him
	we see the cabin door opening.  Carl turns, reacting to the
	sound.

	Grimsrud is bounding out wearing mittens and a red hunter's
	cap, but no overcoat.  He is holding an ax.

	Carl fumbles in his pocket for his gun.

	Grimsrud swings overhand, burying the ax in Carl's neck.

	MARGE

	In her cruiser, on her two-way.  Through it we hear Lou's
	voice, heavily filtered:

				VOICE
		His wife.  This guy says she was
		kidnapped last Wednesday.

				MARGE
		The day of our homicides.

				VOICE
		Yah.

	Marge is peering to one side as she drives, looking through
	the bare trees that border the road on a declivity that runs
	down to a large frozen lake.

				MARGE
		And this guy is...

				VOICE
		Lundegaard's father-in-law's
		accountant.

				MARGE
		Gustafson's accountant.

				VOICE
		Yah.

				MARGE
		But we still haven't found Gustafson.

				VOICE
			(crackle)
		-  looking.

				MARGE
		Sorry - didn't copy.

				VOICE
		Still missing.  We're looking.

				MARGE
		Copy.  And Lundegaard too.

				VOICE
		Yah.  Where are ya, Margie?

	We hear, distant but growing louder, harsh engine noise, as
	of a chainsaw or lawnmower.

				MARGE
		Oh, I'm almost back - I'm driving
		around Moose Lake.

				VOICE
		Oh.  Gary's loudmouth.

				MARGE
		Yah, the loudmouth.  So the whole
		state has it, Lundegaard and
		Gustafson?

				VOICE
		Yah, it's over the wire, it's
		everywhere, they'll find 'em.

				MARGE
		Copy.

				VOICE
		We've got a -

				MARGE
		There's the car!  There's the car!

	We are slowing as we approach a short driveway leading down
	to a cabin.  Parked in front is the brown Cutlass Ciera.

				VOICE
		Whose car?

				MARGE
		My car!  My car!  Tan Ciera!

				VOICE
		Don't go in!  Wait for back-up!

	Marge is straining to look.  The power-tool noise is louder
	here but still muffled, its source not yet visible.

				VOICE
		...  Chief Gunderson?

				MARGE
		Copy.  Yah, send me back-up!

				VOICE
		Yes, ma'am.  Are we the closest PD?

				MARGE
		Yah, Menominie only has Chief Perpich
		and he takes February off to go to
		Boundary Waters.

	ROAD EXTERIOR

	Marge pulls her prowler over some distance past the cabin.
	She gets out, zips up her khaki parka and pulls up its fur-
	lined hood.

	For a moment, she stands listening to the muffled roar of
	the power tool.  Then, with one curved arm half pressing
	against, half supporting her belly, she takes slow, gingerly
	steps down the slope, through the deep snow, through the
	trees angling toward the cabin and the source of the
	grinding noise.

	She slogs from tree to tree, letting each one support her
	downhill-leaning weight for a moment before slogging to the
	next.

	The roar grows louder.  Marge stands panting by one tree,
	her breath vaporizing out of her snorkel hood.  She squints
	down toward the cabin's back lot.

	A tall man with his back to us, wearing a red plaid quilted
	jacket and a hunting cap with earflaps, is laboring over a
	large power tool which his body blocks from view.

	Marge advances.

	The man is forcing downward something which engages the
	roaring power tool and makes harsh spluttering noises.

	The man is Grimsrud, his nose red and eyes watering from the
	cold, hatflaps pulled down over his ears.  His breath steams
	as he sourly goes about his work, both hands pressing down a
	shod foot, as it if were the shaft of a butter churn.

	The roar is very loud.

	Marge slogs down to the next tree, panting, looking.

	Grimsrud forces more of the leg into the machine, which we
	can now see sprays small wet chunks out the bottom.

	Marge's eyes shift.

	A large dark form lies in the snow next to Grimsrud.

	Grimsrud works on, eyes watering.  With a grunt he bends
	down out of frame and then re-enters holding a thick log.
	He uses it to force the leg deeper into the machine.

	Marge is advancing.  She holds a gun extended toward
	Grimsrud, who is still turned away.

	Grimsrud rubs his nose with the back of his hand.

	Marge closes in, grimacing.

	Grimsrud's back strains as he puts his weight into the log
	that pushes down into the machine.

	The dark shape in the snow next to his side is the rest of
	Carl Showalter's body.

	Marge has drawn to within twenty yards.  When she bellows it
	sounds hollow and distant, her voice all but eaten up by the
	roar of the power tool.

				MARGE
		Stop!  Police!  Turn around and
		hands up!

	Startled, Grimsrud scowls.  He turns to face her.

	He stares.

	Marge bellows again:

				MARGE
		...  Hands up!

	Conscious of the noise, she shows with a twist of her
	shoulder the armpatch insignia.

				MARGE
		...  Police!

	Grimsrud stares.

	With a quick twist, he reaches back for the log, hurls it at
	Marge and then starts running away.

	Marge twists her body sideways, shielding herself.

	No need - the heavy log travels perhaps ten yards and lands
	in the snow several feet short of her.

	Grimsrud pants up the hill - slow going through the deep
	snow.

	Behind him:

				MARGE
		...  Halt!

	She fires in the air.

	She lowers the gun and carefully sighs.

				MARGE
		...  Halt!

	She fires.

	Grimsrud still slogs up the hill - a miss.

	Marge sights again.

				MARGE
		...  Halt!

	She fires again.

	Grimsrud pitches forward.  He mutters in Swedish as he
	reaches down to clutch at his wounded leg.

	Marge walks toward him, gun trained on him as her other hand
	reaches under her parka and gropes around her waist.

	It comes out with a pair of handcuffs, which she opens with
	a snap of the wrist.

				MARGE
		...  All right, buddy.  On your
		belly and your hands clasped
		behind you.

	THE CRUISER

	Marge drives.  Grimsrud sits in the back seat, hands cuffed
	behind him.

	For a long moment there, he is quiet - only engine hum and
	the periodic clomp of wheels on pavement seams - as Marge
	grimly shakes her head.

				MARGE
		...  So that was Mrs. Lundegaard
		in there?

	She glances up in the rear-view mirror.

	Grimsrud, cheeks sunk, eyes hollow, looks sourly out at the
	road.

	Marge shakes her head.

	At length:

				MARGE
		...  I guess that was your
		accomplice in the wood chipper.

	Grimsrud's head bobs with bumps on the road; otherwise he is
	motionless, reactionless, scowling and gazing out.

				MARGE
		...  And those three people in
		Brainerd.

	No response.

	Marge, gazing forward, seems to be talking to herself.

				MARGE
		...  And for what?  For a little
		bit of money.

	We hear distant sirens.

				MARGE
		...  There's more to life than money,
		you know.

	She glances up in the rear-view mirror.

				MARGE
		...  Don't you know that?...  And
		here ya are, and it's a beautiful
		day...

	Grimsrud's hollow eyes stare out.

	The sirens are getting louder.  Marge pulls over.

				MARGE
		...  Well...

	She leans forward to the dash to give two short signalling
	WHOOPS on her siren.

	She turns on her flashers.

	She leans back with a creak and jangle of utilities.

	She stares forward, shakes her head.  We hear the dull click
	of her flashers.

				MARGE
		...  I just don't unnerstand it.

	Outside it is snowing.  The sky, the earth, the road - all
	white.

	A squad car, gumballs spinning, punches through the white.
	It approaches in slow motion.

	An ambulance punches through after it.

	Another squad car.

							 FADE OUT:


	FADE IN:

	HIGH AND WIDE ON A SHABBY MOTEL

	It stands next to a highway on a snowy, windslept plain.
	One or two cars dot the parking lot along with an idling
	police cruiser.

	MOTEL ROOM DOORWAY

	We are looking over the shoulders of two uniformed policemen
	who stand on either side of the door, their hands resting
	lightly on their holstered sidearms.  One of them raps at
	the door.

				COP ONE
		Mr. Anderson...

	A title fades in:  OUTSIDE OF BISMARK, NORTH DAKOTA

	After a pause, muffled through the door:

				VOICE
		...  Who?...

				COP ONE
		Mr. Anderson, is this your burgundy
		88 out here?

				VOICE
		...  Just a sec.

				COP ONE
		Could you open the door, please?

				VOICE
		...  Yah.  Yah, just a sec.

	We hear a clatter from inside.

				VOICE
		...  Just a sec...

	One of the policemen unholsters his gun and nods to someone
	whose back enters - a superintendent holding a ring of keys.
	This man turns a key in the door and then stands away.

	The two policemen, guns at the ready, bang into the motel
	room.

	The rough hand-held camera rushes in behind them as the two
	men give the room a two-handed sweep with their guns.

	The room is empty.

	Cop one indicates the open bathroom door.

				COP ONE
		Dale!

	The two men charge the bathroom, belts jingling, guns at the
	ready, jittery camera behind them rushing to keep pace.

	A man in boxer shorts is halfway out the bathroom window.

	The policemen holster their guns and charge the window, and
	drag Jerry Lundegaard back into the room.

	His flesh quivers as he thrashes and keens in short,
	piercing screams.

	The cops wrestle him to the floor but his palsied thrashing
	continues.  The policemen struggle to restrain him.

				COP ONE
		Call an ambulance!

				COP TWO
		You got him okay?

	Cop One pinions Jerry's arms to the floor and Jerry bursts
	into uncontrolled sobbing.

				COP ONE
		Yah, yah, call an ambulance.

	Jerry sobs and screams.

	A BEDROOM

	We are square on Norm, who sits in bed watching television.

	After a long beat, Marge enters frame in a nightie and
	climbs into bed, with some effort.

				MARGE
		Oooph!

	Norm reaches for her hand as both watch the television.

	At length Norm speaks, but keeps his eyes on the TV.

				NORM
		They announced it.

	Marge looks at him.

				MARGE
		They announced it?

				NORM
		Yah.

	Marge looks at him, waiting for more, but Norm's eyes stay
	fixed on the television.

				MARGE
		...  So?

				NORM
		Three-cent stamp.

				MARGE
		Your mallard?

				NORM
		Yah.

				MARGE
		Norm, that's terrific!

	Norm tries to suppress a smile of pleasure.

				NORM
		It's just the three cent.

				MARGE
		It's terrific!

				NORM
		Hautman's blue-winged teal got the
		twenty-nine cent.  People don't
		much use the three-cent.

				MARGE
		Oh, for Pete's - a course they do!
		Every time they raise the darned
		postage, people need the little
		stamps!

				NORM
		Yah.

				MARGE
		When they're stuck with a bunch a
		the old ones!

				NORM
		Yah, I guess.

				MARGE
		That's terrific.

	Her eyes go back to the TV.

				MARGE
		...  I'm so proud a you, Norm.

	Norm murmurs:

				NORM
		I love you, Margie.

				MARGE
		I love you, Norm.

	Both of them are watching the TV as Norm reaches out to rest
	a hand on top of her stomach.

				NORM
		...  Two more months.

	Marge absently rests her own hand on top of his.

				MARGE
		Two more months.

	Hold; fade out.

               FADE IN ON:

               EXT. SANTA MONICA PIER - NIGHT

               The sultry dampness of a blistering summer hangs in the night 
               air. People stroll the boardwalk looking for a cool breeze. 
               The soft rhythms of a jazz concert float from the band shell.

               CLOSE SHOT - A PAIR OF SEXY HIGH HEELS

               and a woman's shapely legs, walking along the wooden pier. 

               OPENING TITLES & CREDITS OVER.

               After several steps, a discarded piece of gum sticks to one 
               of her shoes, stretching out stickily. Two steps later, a 
               piece of paper sticks to the gum, flopping awkwardly with 
               each step.

               The MOVING CAMERA PANS UP her gorgeous legs and sensuous 
               body. She wears a loose summer dress that floats like gossamer 
               around her soft curves. Her hair is long and blond.

                                     NED (V.O.)
                         To some guys, women are like a cheap 
                         puzzle... with pieces that just don't 
                         fit. They think the soul of a woman 
                         is darker than a back alley... more 
                         tangled than a telephone cord... and 
                         colder than a Klondike Bar in Canada. 
                         But those guys don't even have a 
                         clue.

               She stops at the railing. We see an incredibly beautiful 
               face and cool, alluring eyes. This is LOLA CAIN. The term 
               "femme fatale" was coined for her. She's on display... and 
               knows it.

                                     NED (V.O.)
                         When you know women the way I do, 
                         you understand exactly what what 
                         makes them tick... what makes them 
                         hum... what makes them jiggle up and 
                         down when they walk. And it's not 
                         the kind of thing you can learn from 
                         a correspondence course.

               The CAMERA MOVES with her as she walks on, passing TWO MEN 
               whose eyes are glued to her. We HOLD ON THEM.

               One is NED RAVINE, in his thirties, stalwart, handsome, hair 
               trimmed neatly, but with a feel of loose ends about him... 
               coat slung over his shoulder, sleeves rolled up, the sweat 
               dampening his shirt. He's a cop. A plain clothes detective 
               who's been around the block a few times and still gets lost.

               Next to him is ARCH, his partner. Older, if not in years, at 
               least in mileage. Dependable, solid, with no great aspirations 
               except to reach the end of a shift intact. He's eating Nachos 
               from a cardboard container, licking the cheese off his 
               fingers.

               The CAMERA PUSHES IN to NED. His eyes are fixed on Lola.

               ANGLE - LOLA - NED'S POV

               She walks to the other side of the pier... as more paper 
               sticks to the gum on her shoe. She stands at the railing.

                                     NED (V.O.)
                         There are two kinds of women in this 
                         world... and I've known 'em both.

               ANGLE - ARCH

               Arch heaves an exasperated sigh and looks toward Ned. The 
               CAMERA PULLS BACK to INCLUDE NED. It isn't "voice-over" 
               narration at all. Ned is actually talking out loud.

                                     NED (V.O.)
                         One will take you for a fast ride on 
                         a bumpy road with no seat belt. But 
                         the other kind...

                                     ARCH
                              (interrupts)
                         Jeez... knock off the chatter, will 
                         ya.

                                     NED
                         Just trying to keep you awake, Arch.

                                     ARCH
                         I'm awake! Where do you come up with 
                         all that crap about women?

                                     NED
                         It's true. Women are very complex, 
                         but if you know how to read 'em... 
                         they're an open book. You can always 
                         tell the rotten apples from the 
                         peaches.

                                     NED
                         I'd stake my career on it. Anybody 
                         ever proves me wrong, I'll throw 
                         away my badge.

                         married Lana. Now, she... is a peach.

                         pal. Ya hold down two jobs. Got a 
                         beautiful wife waitin' for ya at

                         Logic. He knocked off all those banks. 
                         He's got cash. He's gonna want to 
                         spend it. This is one of the few 
                         places that still takes cash. Sooner 
                         or later... he's gotta turn up.

                         scumbag?

                                     NED
                         The "Support Hose Bandit"? When you 
                         see him... you'll know him.

               In the b.g., MILO CRUMLEY, the "Support Hose Bandit", ambles 
               by casually, unnoticed, sucking on a cherry Snow-Cone through 
               the panty-hose pulled down over his head.

                         These are the best damn Nachos in 
                         North America. Maybe the world!

               He pops the last chip in his mouth, licks his fingers and 
               turns the container over.

                                     ARCH
                         I'm empty. I'm gonna get a refill. 
                         You want some?

               Ned shakes his head. Arch heads off to the Nacho stand. Ned 
               steps over to the railing... gazes out at the ocean.

               A SAXOPHONE begins to wail a scorching, romantic melody... a 
               recurrent tune that will come to be known as LOLA'S THEME.

               A beat later... Lola moves to Ned's side at the railing. He 
               tries to ignore her presence, peering into the darkness. 
               Lola digs in her purse for a pack of cigarettes.

                                     LOLA
                         Got a light?

                                     NED
                         Sure.

               Ned pulls out a small flashlight, shines it in her purse. 
               She pulls a cigarette out of the pack, puts it to her lips... 
               her eyes on Ned, sizing him up.

                                     LOLA
                         How about a match?

                                     NED
                         No thanks. I have plenty.

               He pulls out a handful of matchbooks, shows her, then stuffs 
               them back in his pocket.

               He turns and walks along the pier. She falls into step beside 
               him, lighting her own cigarette. A saxophone player named 
               DIZZY follows behind them, continuing to play. He's the actual 
               source of the romantic THEME MUSIC we've been hearing.

                                     LOLA

                         serious.

                         You lose.

               Lola looks toward a nearby hot dog vendor.

                                     LOLA
                         If I can't buy you a drink...

                         ...let me buy you one of those.

                                     NED

                         Not me.

               Lola turns to the hot dog VENDOR, raising two fingers.

                                     LOLA
                         Two dogs. Hot.

               She takes them... hands one to Ned. He picks up the plastic 
               mustard container to put mustard on her hot dog first.

                                     NED
                         You come here often?

                                     LOLA
                         Only when I'm in heat.

               Ned REACTS to this, squeezing the container. A stream of 
               mustard squirts out, hitting the front of Lola's dress.

                                     NED
                         Oh! Sorry.

               Flustered, he stuffs his hot dog into his inside jacket 
               pocket, then tries to wipe the mustard off Lola's dress, 
               smearing it all over her, making it worse. She watches him 
               with a cool, detached gaze as he fumbles ingenuously.

               Suddenly, Ned stops, looking off. He sees... Milo Crumley 
               going into the PUBLIC RESTROOM. Ned starts to leave. Lola 
               grabs his hand, holding it tightly against her breast.

                                     LOLA

                         I'll get you a wet paper towel.

               He heads for the men's room... signaling to Arch, who's 
               waiting in line at the Nacho stand. Arch motions at the long 
               line... all UNIFORMED COPS... shrugging helplessly.

               INT. MEN'S ROOM ON PIER - NIGHT

               Several MEN are at the urinals. Milo, still wearing the panty 
               hose over his head, washes his face at the sink. He looks 
               up, sees Ned enter. Ned sees Milo... reacts, pulling the 
               frankfurter out of his pocket and pointing it.

                                     NED
                         Hold it right there, Milo!

               The Men turn, seeing Ned pointing the frankfurter.

                                     RESTROOM PATRON
                         Look out! He's got a weenie!

               Milo bolts, slamming into Ned, knocking him back through the 
               door of a stall, into the lap of the MAN inside.

               EXT. MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Milo bursts out, colliding with Arch. They both go down in a 
               flurry of Nacho chips and cheese. Arch helps Milo to his 
               feet, apologizing profusely... picking up the gun that Milo 
               dropped, handing it back to him. Milo sprints off down the 
               pier.

               A beat later, Ned bursts out the door... dashing after Milo.

               ANGLE - ALONG THE PIER

               Milo runs frantically, knocking people aside! He ducks into...

               INT. BUMPER CAR PAVILION - NIGHT

               ...and drags a FLUSTERED MAN out of a bumper car, jumps in, 
               and speeds away!

               A beat later, Ned runs up, followed by Arch. Ned flashes his 
               badge at a FRECKLE-FACED KID in one of the bumper cars.

                                     NED
                         Police emergency! I need your car!

               He pulls the kid out, jumps in, slaps a portable FLASHING 
               RED LIGHT on the dashboard... then speeds off after Milo, a 
               SIREN WAILING! He zig-zags through the crush of other bumper 
               cars in the pavilion.

               Ned's bumper car catches up with Milo, pulling alongside. 
               Milo turns the wheel, RAMMING Ned! Ned RAMS him back, both 
               bumper cars swerving violently... spraying SPARKS!

               Ned SLAMS Milo's car again! Milo loses control, spins out 
               and SMASHES into the pavillion railing!

               Ned swerves to avoid a collision, but RAMS into two other 
               bumper cars, wrenching to a grinding halt. A BEAT. The AIRBAG 
               inflates in his bumper car.

               Arch runs up as Ned pulls himself from the wreckage. They 
               turn to see Milo leap from his mangled bumper car, leap over 
               the pavillion railing and dash down the pier and into an 
               alley between two buildings. A sign on the building says: 
               DEAD END ALLEY.

               Ned and Arch eye each other, shake their heads, and follow 
               after Milo.

               OMIT

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               IN THE ALLEY

               Milo runs into a tall chain link fence at the end of the 
               alley and scrambles up the wire mesh. Suddenly, Ned's hand 
               shoots out, grabs Milo's ankle, yanking him down hard.

               Milo jumps to his feet, swinging at Ned, who catches Milo's 
               fist with his hand, stopping it cold... neatly snapping a 
               handcuff on his wrist. He shoves Milo's arm against the fence 
               and snaps the other cuff to the chainlink.

               A SWITCHBLADE flashes out of Milo's other hand with a sharp 
               CLICK! Milo slashes the blade at Ned, just missing his face. 
               On the backswing, Ned parries with his own switchblade and 
               flips Milo's knife away.

               Milo pulls a .45 Calibre REVOLVER with his free hand! Ned 
               shoves his finger into the end of the barrel. Milo looks 
               surprised... then sneers, clicking the hammer back.

                                     NED
                         You take science in high school,

                                     NED
                         Then you're probably not familiar 
                         with the theory of inverse 
                         proportionate explosive dynamics.

                                     MILO
                         What about it?

                                     NED
                         If you fire a weapon with the barrel 
                         obstructed, the explosive force 
                         multiplies by twenty-three point 
                         five nine eight and reverses on itself 
                         with diametric polarity?

                                     MILO
                         Yeah. So?

                                     NED
                         The gun will blow up in your hand... 
                         and it won't even scorch my pinkie.

                                     MILO
                         Ha! That's just theoretical 
                         hypothesis. Inverse proportionate 
                         explosive dynamics has never been 
                         demonstrated conclusively in a 
                         laboratory environment.

                                     NED
                         Oh yeah. Then pull the trigger, smart 
                         guy. Let's find out.

               Milo hesitates, unsure. Finally, he releases the gun. Ned 
               raises it up on the end of his finger. Arch pulls it off 
               with a loud POP!

               Ned cuffs Milo's hands behind him... spins him around.

                                     NED
                         You have the right to remain silent... 
                         next... if you waive that right, 
                         anything you say... next...

               REVEAL ARCH

               holding up a series of "cue cards"... as Ned reads from them.

                                     NED
                         ...may be used against you in a court 
                         of law... next... You have the right 
                         to an attorney... Do you have an 
                         attorney?

                                     MILO
                         Nahhhh!

                                     NED
                         Then today's your lucky day...

               He flips out a business card, handing it to Milo.

               ANGLE - THE BUSINESS CARD

               It reads... "Ned Ravine - Defense Attorney"

               EXT. NED'S HOUSE - DAWN

               Large. Expensive. Impressive. The name on the mailbox reads 
               "Ned and Lana Ravine."

               We begin to HEAR the O.S. SOUND of passionate lovemaking!

               INT. HOUSE - DAWN

               The CAMERA MOVES up the stairs, into the bedroom. Still O.S., 
               we hear more heavy breathing... urgent whispers... lust... 
               passion... squeaky bedsprings!

               A trail of clothes is scattered before us on the way to the 
               bed... shoes, a dress, slip, bra, nylons, panties... greasy 
               coveralls with a "Frank Kelbo - Mobile Mechanic" namepatch, 
               dirty work boots, a wrench and a gigantic grease gun...

               The bed shakes violently. A female VOICE calls the shots as 
               various tools drop to the floor.

                                     LANA (O.S.)
                         Oh yes, Frank! Adjust the stroke by 
                         ten percent! That's it.
                              (CLUNK! A wrench)
                         Now tweak my points. Oh yes, oh yes!
                              (THUNK! Pliers)
                         You got it! Stabilize your ball joints

                         Now accelerate! Floor it! Lay rubber, 
                         baby! VRRROOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMM!

               A beat. The LIGHT clicks ON. LANA; a sexy redhead with a 
               cool, manipulative edge, and FRANK; a slick, smarmy Lothario, 
               lay under the sheets, panting, glistening with sweat.

               Lana reaches for a pack of "Fatal 100's" on the bedside table.

                                     LANA
                         Not bad for an auto mechanic...

                                     FRANK
                              (grins, cocky)
                         Yeah, well you're not so bad 
                         yourself... for a lawyer's wife...

                                     LANA
                         Better watch your tongue, sweetie, 
                         or I'll have my husband arrest you.

                                     FRANK
                         Busy man. Cop and a lawyer. When 
                         does he ever find time for you?

               She lights a cigarette... exhales a soft, gloomy cloud.

                                     LANA
                         He doesn't. That's why I need you to 
                         keep my engine tuned, Frank. Why 
                         drive a jalopy when you can have a 
                         hot rod?

                                     FRANK
                         Maybe you should trade him in on a 
                         new model.

                                     LANA
                         I would... if I could make any money 
                         on the deal.

                                     FRANK
                              (reaches for her)
                         Want to go for another test drive?

               The SOUND of an automobile engine outside. Lana stops him.

                                     LANA
                         Pull over and park it, Frank. I'm 
                         still under warranty.

               EXT. NED'S HOUSE - MORNING

               Ned glances at the white van parked in the driveway, then 
               takes note of his wife's silver Mercedes... sitting on floor 
               jacks, the hood raised, tools spread out around it.

               INT. HOUSE - THE KITCHEN - MORNING

               Ned enters. Lana wears a diaphanous dressing gown, buttoned 
               unevenly, hair disheveled. She smokes a cigarette.

                                     NED
                         Morning sweetheart.

               Ned kisses her on the back of the neck as he passes through 
               the kitchen on his way to the dining room. She reacts with 
               bored, contemptuous disinterest, picking up the coffee pot.

                                     LANA
                         Uh huh. Want some coffee?

               Ned steps back into the kitchen with his briefcase.

                                     NED
                         No thanks.

               Ned sees Frank sitting at the kitchen table, hair messed up, 
               coveralls hastily pulled on inside-out. Frank is reading a 
               copy of INSURANCE DIGEST magazine. A headline on the cover 
               touts an article: "LIFE INSURANCE FOR YOUR CAT!... Cover All 
               Nine Lives For The Price of One!" Ned's smile fades.

                                     LANA
                         Frank here was just grabbing a little 
                         before going back to work on my car.

               He steps over to the table... gives Frank a cool stare.

                                     NED
                         How long you been working on Lana's 
                         Mercedes, Frank?

                                     FRANK
                              (shrugs)
                         Oh... I don't know... six, seven 
                         weeks.

                                     NED
                         And ya still haven't found the 
                         problem?

                                     FRANK
                              (a leering smile)
                         Think I got my finger on it though.

               Ned turns to Lana.

                                     NED
                         I know what he's doing, Lana. I wasn't 
                         born yesterday. He's not fixing your 
                         car. He's SCREWING you!

               Lana tenses up at this. Frank freezes. He figures they've 
               been busted. He sits there, holding the magazine, not moving 
               a muscle... as Ned turns on him.

                                     NED
                         YOU are screwing my wife! I can see 
                         what your game is, Frank. You open 
                         up her hood, poke around in there... 
                         squirt some lubrication in... play 
                         around with all her parts... then 
                         take an old used piston and stick it 
                         in... then pull it out... in, out, 
                         in, out! Every day! There's no end 
                         to it. You just keep coming and 
                         COMING!... and the bill just gets 
                         bigger and BIGGER!

               Lana braces herself against the sink, breathless... turned 
               on by Ned's description. Ned goes to her, sympathetic.

                                     NED
                         But you don't see it, do you, Lana? 
                         You're too good... too pure. You 
                         can't see the evil in people like 
                         him.
                              (turns to Frank)
                         Well, you're not getting away with 
                         it, pal. I'm pulling the plug! You're 
                         fired!

                                     LANA
                              (breathless)
                         Ned... don't you have to be somewhere?

                                     NED
                              (checks his watch)
                         Oh... yeah. Thanks, honey. I'm late 
                         for court.

               He goes to kiss her mouth and she turns her cheek to him. He 
               looks at her lovingly... touches her face tenderly.

                                     NED
                         You are so naive.

               He picks up his briefcase, gives Frank a nasty look, then 
               exits thru the back door.

               Lana and Frank stare at each other lustfully, really hot 
               now! Frank sweeps the dishes off the table with his arm. 
               Lana leaps into his arms, wrapping her legs around his waist. 
               He lays her down on the kitchen table, standing over her.

               Suddenly, Ned opens the back door, glaring right at Frank... 
               not even noticing Lana on the table.

                                     NED
                         Finish your coffee... then GET OUT!

               He slams the door. A beat. Lana and Frank begin to devour 
               each other with passionate kisses. Another beat. The front 
               doorbell RINGS once... then again.

                                     FRANK
                         Who's that?

                                     LANA
                         Just the postman. He always rings 
                         twice.

               INT. NED'S LAW OFFICE - DAY

               Richly appointed with stately oak, walls lined with law books. 
               As in all "Noir" thrillers, venetian blinds cast dramatic 
               slashes of light and ceiling fans turn lazily in every room. 
               Ned hurries in, rummaging through the files on his desk.

               LAURA, a strikingly lovely brunette, enters from the outer 
               office, files in hand. She is Ned's astute, dedicated, self-
               sacrificing "girl-friday" and legal secretary. She keeps his 
               life from spinning crazily apart. She absolutely adores him.

                                     NED
                         Laura... do you know where...?

                                     LAURA
                              (hands him file)
                         Right here. The judge decided to 
                         skip arraignment and take Milo direct 
                         to trial. You're six minutes late, 
                         but don't sweat it. You got Judge 
                         Allen. He's always eleven minutes 
                         late.

               She picks up a lawbook, flips it open to a dog-eared page.

                                     LAURA
                         I suggest you try Lemming versus 
                         Florida, 1956... where the guy jumped 
                         in the water and everybody followed.

                                     NED
                              (thinks about it)
                         Yeah. Good idea.

               He smiles gratefully... drops the file into his briefcase.

               Ned heads for the office washroom. Laura darts ahead of him 
               into the washroom and turns the water on.

               Ned steps in... splashes some water on his face. Laura grabs 
               a towel from the rack where three small towels hang neatly... 
               hands it to Ned. He dries his face, looking at her with 
               genuine fondness and gratitude.

                                     NED
                         I don't know what I'd do without 
                         you?

               She glances toward the toilet, notices it hasn't been flushed. 
               She FLUSHES it, lowers the seat.

                                     LAURA
                         Really?

               She sits down on the toilet seat, watching him adoringly as 
               he shaves with an electric razor.

                                     NED
                         Laura, how long have you worked for 
                         me?

                                     LAURA
                         Two years, seven months, twenty-three 
                         days, nineteen hours...
                              (checks her watch)
                         ...six minutes and fifty-two seconds.
                              (softly, to herself)
                         ...fifty-three... fifty-four... fifty-
                         five... fifty-six...

                                     NED
                         And when was the last time I gave 
                         you a raise?

               Laura neatly folds the end of the toilet paper into a point.

                                     LAURA
                         Never. But that's okay. I don't need 
                         a raise. In fact... I was thinking 
                         of giving you a rebate on my salary.

               He clicks off the razor, turns to look at her for a long 
               moment, considering this, then...

                                     NED
                         Naw. That's okay. You keep it.

               He gives her a manly pat on the shoulder then casually tosses 
               the towel onto the rack, where it hangs sloppily askew... 
               right next to her face. He exits.

               Laura stares at the towel with a tortured expression. The 
               CAMERA PUSHES IN to her face as we see...

               INT. ULTRA-MODERN BEACH HOUSE - DAY

               Scrawled on a steamed-up bathroom mirror - FLASHBACK - CAPE 
               COD - THREE YEARS EARLIER. A hand wipes the mirror off, 
               revealing Laura... younger, longer hair, with a nasty black 
               eye.

               LAURA'S HUSBAND appears behind her, glaring insanely. He 
               looks toward the towel rack.

               There are three towels... with HIS - HIS - HIS embossed along 
               the bottom edge. One towel hangs longer than the others.

                                     LAURA'S HUSBAND
                         Did we forget something?

               She meekly lines up all the towels.

                                     LAURA'S HUSBAND
                         Did we forget something?

               She meekly lines up all the towels.

               INT. BEACH HOUSE KITCHEN - DAY

               Laura's Husband pulls the cupboard open. All the cans and 
               boxes are neatly stacked in straight lines. All except one. 
               She straightens it... trembling with fear.

               EXT. DECK OF BEACH HOUSE - DAY

               He pulls her outside, nodding toward a line of tall PINE 
               trees behind the house. They are all straight and even... 
               except one, whose tall branches tower conspicuously above 
               the rest.

               He holds up a chainsaw, nodding toward the trees. Shaking 
               and tearful... she backs into the house.

               END FLASHBACK

               BACK TO LAURA

               SCREAMING out in terror! Ned rushes in, shaking her.

                                     NED
                         Laura. Laura! What is it?

                                     LAURA
                              (coming out of it)
                         I'm okay, I'm okay. I just get a 
                         bit... claustrophobic... in the 
                         bathroom.

                                     NED
                         Maybe we should try some prune juice.

               He gives her shoulder a consoling squeeze, then exits. She 
               shakily straightens the towels and regains her composure.

               Ned opens a wardrobe closet in his office. He walks along, 
               looking at thirty exactly identical blue suits, hanging 
               neatly. Laura follows behind him. He stops and stares, 
               indecisive.

                                     LAURA
                         Wear the blue one.

               INT. COURTROOM - DAY

               Ned turns dramatically to face the jury.

                                     NED
                         Ladies and gentlemen... I ask you... 
                         does this look like the face of a 
                         crook?

               ANGLE - MILO CRUMLEY

               sitting next to Laura at the defense table... STILL wearing 
               the panty hose over his head.

               BACK TO SCENE

                                     NED
                         Of course it does. But the question 
                         of my client's guilt or innocence is 
                         not the issue here today. I'm certain 
                         every member of the jury can clearly 
                         see that he's guilty!

                                     BLIND JUROR
                         I can't.

               ANGLE ON NED - JURY'S POV

               Ned ignores this, turning to look directly at the CAMERA as 
               he addresses the jury... holding up a pair of nylon pantyhose.

                                     NED
                         Put yourself in his shoes. Look 
                         through his eyes. See the world the 
                         way HE sees it!

               He puts the pantyhose over the LENS, obscuring our view.

                                     NED
                         Things just don't look the same. 
                         It's fuzzy... and frightening!

               NEW ANGLE - TO INCLUDE NED AND JURY

               The nylon pantyhose are draped over the frightened face of a 
               WOMAN JUROR. All the other Jurors are holding up their own 
               socks and nylon stockings, trying to peer through them.

               Ned steps over to Milo, motioning toward him.

                                     NED
                         Ladies and gentlemen... Milo Crumley 
                         is not the perpetrator here. He is 
                         the VICTIM!

               Milo unwraps a piece of bubble gum and pushes it into his 
               panty-hose covered mouth, chewing the nylon and gum together.

                                     NED
                         Like ALL of us... this man is the 
                         unfortunate victim of these tragically 
                         difficult economic times. And what 
                         does that mean? He can't support his 
                         family!

               Ned motions toward the gallery, where we SEE...

               ...MILO'S WIFE and TWO CHILDREN, all wearing panty hose over 
               their faces. Ned motions toward Milo.

                                     NED
                         For God's sake!... He can't even 
                         support his own FACE!

               JUDGE ALLEN notices that Milo is chewing gum.

                                     JUDGE ALLEN
                         Mr. Crumley... you cannot chew gum 
                         in my courtroom... unless you have 
                         enough for everyone.

               Milo holds up a big plastic bag filled with bubble gum. Judge 
               Allen grabs it, takes a piece of gum and hands it to the 
               Bailiff.

                                     JUDGE ALLEN
                         Bailiff. Pass these out.

               The Bailiff takes the bag, offers one to Ned... who takes a 
               piece, unwraps it and starts chewing. The Bailiff then 
               proceeds to pass out gum to EVERYONE in the courtroom.

               The JURY FOREMAN raises his hand and clears his throat.

                                     JUDGE ALLEN
                         And don't forget the jury.

                                     NED
                         And so, desperate and broke, with no 
                         other options before him, Mr. Crumley 
                         went to eleven Savings & Loans and 
                         did what any of you would have done. 
                         He stole back the money that the 
                         S&Ls had stolen from him!

               The courtroom erupts in CHEERS! Judge Allen raps the gavel.

                                     JUDGE ALLEN
                              (interrupting)
                         Mr. Ravine... please approach the 
                         bench.

               He does. The Judge leans toward him, reaching out to cover 
               the microphone, covering the end of the gavel instead. The 
               Judge's voice is AMPLIFIED over the courtroom speakers.

                                     JUDGE ALLEN
                         You're not running for congress here, 
                         so knock off the speeches and quit 
                         inciting these brainless morons! Now 
                         pick up the pace and wrap this son-
                         of-a-bitch up! Call your first 
                         witness.

               Ned turns... looking out over the courtroom.

                                     NED
                         I call... Detective Ned Ravine.

               There is a surprised GASP from the crowd... and a loud MURMUR.

               The BAILIFF holds out a video box. It's titled HOLY BIBLE - 
               THE VIDEO. Ned puts one hand on it, raises the other.

                                     BAILIFF
                         Do you swear to tell the truth, the 
                         whole truth and nothing but the truth, 
                         so help you God?

                                     NED
                         I do.

               Ned sits down... then gets up, his demeanor changing.

                                     NED
                         Detective Ravine, at the time of the 
                         arrest, did you read the defendant 
                         his Miranda rights?

               He slips back into the witness box.

                                     NED
                         Of course. That's standard procedure.

               Ned steps over to Arch, who is sitting in the first row of 
               the gallery. Arch hands him the Miranda "cue cards."

                                     NED
                         Are these the cards Officer Brooks 
                         used to prompt you while reading Mr. 
                         Crumley his rights?

               He lays them on the corner of the stand... then slips into 
               the chair. He picks the cards up and flips thru them. On the 
               back we can see scribbled... "NED'S IDIOT CARDS"

                                     NED
                         Yeah. These are them.

               Ned jumps to his feet, pacing dramatically, grabbing the 
               cards.

                                     NED
                         Reading from the cards now... quote 
                         "You have the right to remain silent, 
                         if you waive that right, anything 
                         you say... may be used against you 
                         in a court of law." Is that right?

                                     NED
                              (back in the chair)
                         That's right.

                                     NED
                              (stands up, announces)
                         WRONG! The official Miranda warning 
                         is... "anything you say CAN be used 
                         against you in a court of law." Not 
                         "may"... "CAN!"
                              (on the attack)
                         Don't you know the difference between 
                         "can" and "may", Detective? Every 
                         school kid knows "can" is a verb 
                         that indicates ability to perform, 
                         while "may" is a verbal auxiliary 
                         indicating the permission to act.

               Ned pivots into the witness stand, changing his attitude 
               from aggressive attorney to defensive, angry witness as he 
               hits the chair.

                                     NED
                         I didn't have time to worry about 
                         past participles or interrogative 
                         pronouns! I was trying to protect 
                         society from a deranged MADMAN!
                              (leaps up, pointing)
                         But this ivy league fop...!!!

               The courtroom ERUPTS! The Judge bangs the gavel. Ned strides 
               proudly toward the defense table.

                                     NED
                         I have no more use for this witness.

                                     JUDGE ALLEN
                         Mr. Ravine...

               Ned turns. The Judge motions with a finger for Ned to approach 
               the bench. Ned does, resting his hand on it.

                                     JUDGE ALLEN
                         I'm dismissing this case on the 
                         grounds of improper grammar.

               The Judge smacks Ned's hand with a ruler!

                                     NED
                         Ow!

                                     PROSECUTOR
                              (jumps up)
                         But your Honor...!

                                     JUDGE ALLEN
                         I know, I know. It's a technicality. 
                         But it's the kind of technicality 
                         that makes the American legal system 
                         what it is today! Court's adjourned!

               The Judge mistakenly picks up the microphone and whacks it 
               on the bench like a gavel. BAM! BAM! BAM! It is DEAFENING! 
               Everyone covers their ears in pain.

               The THX Sound System Logo appears at the bottom of the 
               screen... along with "The Courtroom Is Listening"

               INT. NED'S LAW OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON

               Ned turns the key... enters through the private door. He 
               HEARS the plaintive sound of a saxophone playing Lola's 
               Theme... his eyes drawn to the slightly opened door to the 
               outer office.

               ANGLE - NED'S POV THRU OPENING

               A gorgeous pair of legs, sleek nylons, high-heeled shoes.

               There are several CANDY WRAPPERS, CIGARETTE BUTTS and other 
               pieces of TRASH stuck to the bottom of one shoe.

               NED

               pushes the door open. It's Lola. She wears a tight white 
               dress, long white gloves and broad-brimmed hat. The hat tips 
               up slowly, revealing her eyes.

                                     LOLA
                         I waited. You never came back.

               Ned reaches in his pocket, pulls out a wet paper towel.

                                     NED
                         I got busy. Here's that paper towel 
                         I promised.

                                     LOLA
                         Thanks...

                                     NED
                         How'd you get in? The door was locked.

               Lola proudly holds up a tiny bobbie pin. She smiles.

                                     LOLA
                         It's miraculous what a real woman 
                         can do... with a bobbie pin.

               Ned looks at the door. The frame and lock have been brutally 
               chewed away, as if someone used a jackhammer on them! She 
               pulls out a pack of cigarettes... BLACK LUNG LITES.

                                     LOLA
                              (offering)
                         Cigarette?

                                     NED
                         No... thanks. They're bad for ya.

               He goes to the water cooler. She lights up, exhaling a soft 
               cloud of smoke through a sleepy smile, her voice purring.

                                     LOLA
                         Yes, I know. I like things that are 
                         bad for me.
                              (touching lawbooks)
                         So... I hear you go both ways.

               Ned hesitates... about to drink from the paper cup.

                                     NED
                         Only once. It was a fraternity prank. 
                         I never saw him again.

               He gulps the water down, crumbles the cup in his hand.

                                     LOLA
                         No, I mean... you're a cop and a 
                         lawyer.

                                     NED
                         Oh. Yeah. Well, there's a lot of 
                         scum out there on the streets... but 
                         they all deserve a fair and costly 
                         trial.

               Ned turns, tries to casually "dunk" the crumpled cup in the 
               waste basket. He misses.

               Laura enters with a huge pile of lawbooks in her arms. She 
               sees Ned miss the basket and darts over as he bends down to 
               pick it up.

                                     LAURA
                         I'll get that.

               She picks it up and tosses it into the waste basket.

                                     NED
                         Oh... Laura... this is, uh...

                                     LOLA
                         Lola Cain.

               Laura sets the heavy load of books on the desk and steps 
               toward Lola, extending her hand. Lola takes her time removing 
               the long white glove... finally reaching out and shaking 
               Laura's hand with a condescending air.

                                     LOLA
                              (sarcastic)
                         So lovely to meet you, Laura.

               Ned grabs the books and turns to the bookshelf, replacing 
               each lawbook in its proper slot.

               The "handshake" between Lola and Laura turns tense, then 
               aggressive, eventually becoming a "standing Indian wrestle" 
               as they try to force each other off balance with sheer force. 
               Ned is oblivious to the battle behind him, chattering away.

                                     NED
                         Gotta keep these darn books in their 
                         right place or we'll never find the 
                         ones we need. Let's see, Q thru M... 
                         R thru B... W thru F...

               Laura suddenly whirls Lola around, putting her in an arm 
               lock. But Lola elbows Laura in the stomach! Laura doubles 
               over. Lola feigns sympathy, taking her hand... then spins, 
               twisting Laura's arm, flipping her head over heels!

               Laura lands on the couch... upside down... gasping. Lola 
               strikes a haughty pose, still holding her lit cigarette. She 
               takes a drag. Laura checks her watch, then tumbles off the 
               couch, landing on her feet. She straightens her skirt.

                                     LAURA
                         It's getting late. I'll give you a 
                         ride home, Ned.

               Finished with the books, Ned turns... smiles.

                                     NED
                         I have my car.

                                     LAURA
                         I'll tow you.

                                     NED
                         Not today. You don't need to wait. 
                         I'll see you tomorrow.

               Lola looks at Laura... icy, haughty, triumphant. Laura moves 
               reluctantly toward the door, sees the lock and door frame 
               chewed to pieces... whirls around, heads back toward Ned.

                                     LAURA
                         I should call someone to fix this...

                                     NED
                         Tomorrow...

               She instantly spins around, heads back toward the door...

                                     LAURA
                         I'll call from home.

               ...and exits. Ned sits down on the corner of the desk. Lola 
               sits in the chair across from him.

                                     LOLA
                         I think I should warn you, Mr. 
                         Ravine... I'm not wearing any 
                         underwear.

               She crosses her legs suggestively... then slowly, enticingly, 
               re-crosses them in the other direction.

               Unimpressed, Ned opens Laura's desk drawer... pulls a pair 
               of sexy lace panties from a Kleenex-style dispenser box 
               labeled "PANDORA'S POP-UP PANTIES"... which pulls another 
               pair up into position. He tosses the panties to Lola.

                                     NED
                         Try these on.

               She does... very, very slowly and seductively... as they 
               talk.

                                     NED
                         So... what can I do for you?

                                     LOLA
                         I've run across some... papers... 
                         and I thought you might be able to 
                         tell me what they are. You see, I'm 
                         not very experienced when it comes 
                         to... papers.

                                     NED
                         I'll help you Miss Cain, if I'm able. 
                         Do you have the... papers... here?

                                     LOLA
                         No... they're at home. I thought you 
                         might stop by...

                                     NED
                         I'm on duty tonight.

                                     LOLA
                         Don't they ever give you a night 
                         off?

                                     NED
                         Yeah. Tomorrow.

                                     LOLA
                              (picks up cigarette)
                         Why don't we meet tomorrow evening 
                         then?

               She finishes pulling the panties on with a sultry smile... 
               "snapping" the elastic waistband. She goes to the door, 
               pauses... turns to him.

                                     LOLA
                         I'll let you know where.

                                     NED
                              (steps over to her)
                         What's wrong with my office?

               She looks around, exhaling another cloud of smoke.

                                     LOLA
                         Nothing a good interior decorator 
                         couldn't fix.

               She opens the door. Behind her, in the hall, we see Dizzy, 
               the saxophone player, wailing away on "Lola's Theme."

               CLOSE ON LOLA

               She takes a final, long drag on her cigarette, then reaches 
               O.S. with it... toward Ned.

                                     LOLA
                         Take care of this for me, will ya?

               With a sultry smile, she turns and leaves, closing the door.

               ANGLE ON NED

               The cigarette is stuck in his nose.

               INT. NED'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               The front door swings open. Frank is standing there, dressed 
               in a cheap, loose-fitting suit and a T-shirt.

                                     FRANK
                         I came back for my shower cap.

               Lana, now wearing the diaphanous gown, pulls him inside. She 
               kisses him hungrily, slipping a frilly plastic shower cap 
               with a gaudy floral design on his head.

                                     LANA
                         Yeah, well you came to the right 
                         place.

               She walks to the living room. Frank follows, still wearing 
               the shower cap. Lana snaps her fingers.

                                     LANA
                         Sit down.

               He sits in a chair, looking around.

                                     FRANK
                         Where is he?

                                     LANA
                         On duty all night. By the time he 
                         wraps up his reports, it'll be close 
                         to noon tomorrow.

               She sits on the couch, picks up a stack of papers.

                                     LANA
                         I was just reading over...

               She looks up at Frank. Sees the shower cap.

                                     LANA
                         Take off the hat, Frank.

               He slips the shower cap off as Lana continues.

                                     LANA
                         I was just reading over my husband's 
                         insurance policies. You wouldn't 
                         know anything about insurance, would 
                         you, Frankie?

                                     FRANK
                         Yeah, matter of fact, I sell policies 
                         part-time. I got half a brain... or 
                         didn't you notice?

                                     LANA
                         I musta had my eye on something else.
                              (hands him papers)
                         How about a translation.

               He flips through, scanning the pages, shrugging.

                                     FRANK
                         Standard accident policy... all the 
                         usual stuff... blah, blah, blah. The 
                         face value is... Wow. Not bad. Three 
                         million bucks!
                              (flips page)
                         And there's a triple indemnity rider.

                                     LANA
                         Meaning?

                                     FRANK
                         Aw, it's just something agents throw 
                         in so we can boost the premium. If 
                         the policy holder dies under very 
                         specific conditions, it pays off 
                         three times the face value of the 
                         policy.

                                     LANA
                         Nine million dollars...?

                                     FRANK
                         Yeah... but it's a sure bet for the 
                         company. Nobody ever collects.

                                     LANA
                         Why not?

                                     FRANK
                         Well, like here... it only pays off 
                         if he's shot with a pistol, falls 
                         from a moving northbound train and 
                         drowns in a fresh water stream.

                                     LANA
                         All three?

                                     FRANK
                         See what I mean, sweetheart? What 
                         are the odds of that?

                                     LANA
                         It could happen.
                              (dramatic beat)
                         Suppose it did happen?

                                     FRANK
                         Then you'd be rich.

                                     LANA
                         Then we'd be rich.

                                     FRANK
                         What're you sayin'...?

               She drops to her knees in front of him, her face close to 
               his, speaking with a persuasive urgency.

                                     LANA
                         We're gonna kill the son-of-a-bitch! 
                         And I know exactly how! He has a 
                         legal symposium in Santa Barbara 
                         this weekend... All we have to do is 
                         get him to take the train up instead 
                         of driving.

                                     FRANK
                         How we gonna do that? Didn't you 
                         tell me he hates trains?

                                     LANA
                         That's where you come in, baby. You're 
                         gonna rig his car so it doesn't work. 
                         That should be no problem for you.

               She gets up, walks to the adjoining room... snapping her 
               fingers at her side. He follows.

               She steps to a table, pulls the cover off an elaborate scale-
               model of Dealey Plaza and a train station, complete with HO-
               Scale model trains chugging around the tracks.

               She uses a pointer to trace the route to the depot.

                                     LANA
                         Then... we give him a lift to the 
                         train station... through Dealey Plaza, 
                         past the Book Suppository and around 
                         the grassy knoll...

                                     FRANK
                         Isn't that out of our way?

               Ignoring this, she turns the LIGHTS OFF, walks over to a 
               screen and picks up a remote control. She clicks the button. 
               A SLIDE PROJECTOR comes on, throwing an IMAGE on Frank's 
               back. We can read the words: THE PLAN.

                                     LANA
                         Move, Frank.

               He moves over. "THE PLAN" appears on the screen.

                                     LANA
                         And pay attention.

               As she talks, IMAGES appear on the screen, accompanying her 
               rapid spiel. We see: a shot of the depot, a map of the rail 
               route, a gun, a river, a Bingo game, baseball action and a 
               huge dollar sign!

                                     LANA
                         Ten minutes out of the station he'll 
                         be standing in the vestibule between 
                         cars... trying to avoid a panic 
                         attack. Fourteen minutes and ten 
                         seconds out, the train crosses the 
                         Santa Ynez River. So at thirteen 
                         minutes and fifty-four seconds, I 
                         shoot him, shove him out the door... 
                         he hits the river and drowns. Bingo! 
                         A triple play. We're rich!

               The lights click ON.

                                     FRANK
                         You been thinking about this a lot, 
                         haven't you?

                                     LANA
                         No. It just came to me.
                              (closer, seductive)
                         I had this image of a big, powerful, 
                         throbbing train... plunging into a 
                         long, dark, wet tunnel.

               They embrace, kissing passionately, dropping out of frame. 
               The model train CHUGS faster, the train whistle SHRIEKING a 
               long "Woooooooo-woooooooooo!"... racing into a model tunnel.

               INT. POLICE STATION - SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT

               Ned and Arch drag in a bunch of bad-ass, multi-ethnic GANG 
               MEMBERS they've just busted. Ned angrily shoves one of the 
               toughest gang members against the wall... losing his cool.

                                     NED
                         Stand over there and shut up!

                                     GANG MEMBER #1
                         Hey, man, we got rights! Don't you 
                         be layin' no deleterious malfeasance 
                         on us.

               Ned goes ballistic and slams him into the wall again!

                                     NED
                         Watch your mouth, punk! I don't want 
                         to hear language like that!

               Arch grabs Ned by the shoulder, pulling him back, calming 
               him.

                                     ARCH
                         Whoa, hold on, hoss! Take it easy. 
                         You seem a little tense tonight. 
                         What is it?

               Ned regains his composure. He's depressed.

                                     NED
                         Aw... I don't know. I guess it's 
                         Lana. It's just... I know she wants 
                         to have a baby so bad...

               Gang Member #1 steps closer, listening.

                                     NED
                         ...but I never get to spend any time 
                         with her. And when I am home... it's 
                         like she's, you know... avoiding 
                         sex.

               Gang Member #1 steps closer, listening.

                                     GANG MEMBER #1
                         You should try to be more sensitive, 
                         man. More romantic. Bring her flowers.

               He steps between them, putting his arm around Ned's shoulder.

                                     GANG MEMBER #1
                         Try to understand how she feels. 
                         After all...

               He steps back, begins to SING "Try A Little Tenderness"...

                                     GANG MEMBER #1
                         She may be weary... Women do get 
                         weary... Wearing that same old shabby 
                         dress... But when she's weary... Try 
                         a little ten-der-ness...

               The other Gang Members join in on the SECOND VERSE with a 
               sweet, mellow street-corner harmony as back-up... and some 
               smooth group choreography.

               The COPS on duty listen raptly, getting maudlin and dewey-
               eyed. Tears roll down the cheeks of the BOOKING SERGEANT.

               The lights dim. A big, gruff COP makes eyes at a HOOKER being 
               booked... and they start to slow dance.

               Arch watches all this with a sentimental smile, munching on 
               his Nachos. When the song ends, Arch puts a comforting hand, 
               covered with Nacho cheese, on Ned's shoulder.

                                     NED
                         That can't be it. I'm the tenderest 
                         guy on the force. Nah... I think 
                         she's just afraid she won't be able 
                         to get pregnant.

                                     ARCH
                         What's to be afraid! It's like making 
                         breakfast! You bring home the bacon... 
                         she's got the eggs. Ya scramble it 
                         up. Ba-da-boom ba-da-bing! She's got 
                         an omelette in the oven!
                              (a beat, then)
                         Why don't you knock off early... go 
                         home. It'd be nice for Lana to wake 
                         up in the morning and find you there 
                         for a change.

                                     NED
                         Naw... I can't. I got all this 
                         paperwork.

                                     ARCH
                         Don't worry about that.

                                     GANG MEMBER #1
                         We'll do our own paperwork, man!

                                     OTHER GANG MEMBERS
                         Yeah! We'll fill out all that shit.

               Ned nods, smiles and gratefully "high-fives" the Gang Members 
               as he heads for the door.

               INT. THE HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT

               The house is dark. A key turns in the lock and Ned enters.

               IN THE BEDROOM

               It's dark. Ned quietly undresses and slips into bed.

               INT. BEDROOM - CLOSE ON LANA - DAWN

               Sunlight creeps through the windows. Lana's eyes flutter 
               open. She sees Ned beside her... sleeping. Suddenly, it hits 
               her. She turns! Frank is on the other side, curled up, 
               snoring. She's laying between both men!

               Lana elbows Frank. He stirs, groggy. She covers his mouth... 
               indicating Ned. Frank's eyes bug out! He slips out of bed. 
               The bed frame SQUEAKS LOUDLY! Frank freezes. Ned sleeps on 
               steadily.

               Frank grabs his clothes. An unending torrent of coins fall 
               out of his pants pockets, CLANGING on the floor! He freezes. 
               Ned sleeps on. Frank retrieves the coins, clumsily stepping 
               on the TV REMOTE CONTROL.

               A high-tech, sleekly designed TELEVISION MONITOR rises up... 
               clicks ON. Frank tries frantically to push the set down, but 
               it keeps rising into position. An IMAGE appears. It's WILLARD 
               SCOTT, doing the weather on the TODAY SHOW.

               Frank grabs the remote control, frantically pounding on all 
               the buttons. The VOLUME goes up... SOUND BLASTING!

                                     WILLARD SCOTT
                              (on television)
                         ...and Mrs. Prudy Ann Camomile of 
                         Delphi, Georgia is one-hundred and 
                         thirteen! What a gorgeous hunk of 
                         female! Smokes three cigars a day, 
                         drinks a straight shot of vodka at 
                         bedtime... and still has sex!

               The alarm clock goes off, CLANGING LOUDLY! Lana dives for 
               it, slamming her hand down, killing the alarm.

               Going for a double-play, she flings the clock at the TV, 
               nailing the on/off switch! Silence. Ned is still out cold.

               Frank moves toward the door... but with each step the floor 
               CREAKS LOUDLY! He turns the knob. It CLUNKS! He pulls the 
               door open v-e-r-y s-l-o-w-l-y and it CRE-E-E-E-A-K-S like 
               the piercing metal brakes of a train!

               He blows Lana a kiss, then pulls the door closed very gently. 
               It sticks. He pulls harder. The knob pops off in his hand 
               and he falls backward, tumbling down the stairs with a HUGE 
               RACKET! Ned doesn't stir. Finally it's SILENT. Lana exhales.

               A SMALL BIRD lands on the sill of the open window, trilling 
               a sweet little "CHIRP." Ned sits bolt upright, irritated.

                                     NED
                         Damn birds!

               He grabs his shoe, heaving it toward the open window.

               EXT. NED'S HOUSE - MORNING

               Frank glances back up at the bedroom window with an arrogant 
               smirk. WHAP! Ned's shoe hits him right in the face!

               EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY

               Ned comes down the courthouse steps. He pauses in the street, 
               glimpsing the back of a WOMAN passing nearby... a STUNNING 
               BLOND decked out in a clinging dress and fashionable hat... 
               a long strip of toilet paper trailing from her high heel 
               shoe. It must be LOLA. He turns to watch her.

               A HORN BLARES! BRAKES SCREECH! The SOUND OVERLAPS to...

               INT. NED'S LAW OFFICE - DAY

               The door opens. Ned enters, looking terrible. Suit ripped, 
               hair messed up, bruised and battered, briefcase crushed.

                                     LAURA
                         My God, Ned... you look like you 
                         were hit by a bus.

                         Who's in my office?

                                     LAURA
                         Max Shady's mother.

                                     NED
                         Not again.

               INSIDE THE OFFICE

               MRS. SHADY, an older woman with a pleasant appearance, sits 
               in an overstuffed leather chair. Ned and Laura enter.

                                     NED
                         Hello, Mrs. Shady.

               Ned goes straight to his office closet, pulls out an identical 
               blue suit... and starts stripping off his tattered clothes.

                                     NED
                         Laura... check on my insurance. Make 
                         sure it's paid up.

               Laura reluctantly returns to the outer office.

                                     MRS. SHADY
                         Good idea, Mr. Ravine. My son, Max, 
                         is getting out of prison tomorrow.

                                     NED
                              (checks his watch)
                         Gee, has it been seven years already?

                                     MRS. SHADY
                         Seven long, miserable years in the 
                         slammer. And he's a bit pissed off.

                                     NED
                         Well, being locked in a tiny room 
                         with no TV can make a guy feel pretty 
                         tense.

                                     MRS. SHADY
                         I'm very concerned about him, Mr. 
                         Ravine. He said you were a two-bit 
                         shyster... and he's going to rip 
                         your head off and use it for a bowling 
                         ball!

               He goes to her, putting a comforting hand on her shoulder, 
               looking her right in the eye, attempting to provide solace.

                                     NED
                         I'm sure the experience wasn't all 
                         negative. He probably made a lot of 
                         friends...

                                     MRS. SHADY
                              (ever hopeful)
                         You think?

                         ...learned a useful trade...

                                     MRS. SHADY
                         Oh yes... live autopsies...

                                     NED
                         ...caught up on all those books he 
                         wanted to read...

               She struggles to her feet feebly...

                                     MRS. SHADY
                         Maybe so... but he said he's going 
                         to punch you in the testicles...

               She hauls off and PUNCHES him like a pile driver! WHAM! He 
               doubles over, gasping.

                                     MRS. SHADY
                         ...smash your face...

               She KNEES him in the face, raising him up... then nails him 
               with a devastating RIGHT CROSS, spinning him around. He 
               collapses over the desk.

                                     MRS. SHADY
                         ...and decimate your wardrobe.

               She grabs the tail of his suit jacket and rips it up the 
               back!

                                     MRS. SHADY
                         And I wouldn't want that to happen.
                              (spanks his butt)
                         He's a naughty naughty boy. I just 
                         thought I should warn you.

               She turns and shuffles out, passing through the outer office.

                                     MRS. SHADY
                              (to Laura)
                         Bye for now.
                              (pauses by desk)
                         Oh... may I have a cookie?

                                     LAURA
                              (at file cabinet)
                         Sure.

               She grabs a handful of cookies and casually flings them at 
               Laura... as she heads out the door.

                                     MRS. SHADY
                         Thank yooooooooou.

               Laura rushes into Ned's office with the file folder. He 
               staggers unsteadily by the desk.

                                     LAURA
                         Oh my God, Ned.

                         Don't you realize, Ned?... you could 
                         be in real danger.

                                     LAURA
                         Extreme peril. You know, the risk of 
                         personal bodily harm.

                                     LAURA
                         Your insurance file. But the policy's 
                         missing. Did you take it home?

                         I don't think so.

               Laura looks puzzled... wondering where it might be. Then...

                                     LAURA
                         Oh, wait a second...

               She goes to her desk in the outer office, digs through a 
               drawer. Suddenly, she GASPS!

               She is holding...

               A FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH

               of her abusive HUSBAND... sneering. A circle has been drawn 
               around his head with lipstick and a diagonal line slashed 
               across his face.

               MATCH DISSOLVE TO: FLASHBACK

               HER HUSBAND'S FACE

               peers out through a sailboat porthole at stormy seas. A piece 
               of masking tape stuck to the glass matches the diagonal line.

               INT. CABIN OF SAILBOAT - NIGHT

               Laura's Husband turns from the porthole. Laura cowers.

               The boat pitches and heaves, disturbing all the neatly hung 
               towels, emblazoned with MINE - MINE - MINE across the bottom 
               edge. Laura's Husband reacts with a crazed look in his eyes.

               Laura makes a break for it, running up on deck.

               EXT. SAILBOAT IN STORM - NIGHT

               Laura's Husband scrambles up onto the deck, looking fore and 
               aft. Laura's vanished! He looks out to sea, calling...

                                     LAURA'S HUSBAND
                         Lau-raaaaa!

               EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

               Laura paddles ashore, grasping a little kid's inflatable 
               float ring. She struggles onto the sand and looks out to 
               sea, triumphant... tossing the plastic float aside.

               MONTAGE - ULTRA CONTEMPO BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT

               -- Laura rushes in, tracking water all through the house.

               -- Laura cuts an inch of hair from her amazingly long, very 
               wet tresses, then puts on a WIG... that is also LONG and 
               WET!

               -- Laura retrieves a bra and a package of Twinkies from a 
               secret hiding place... and stuffs them into a small brown 
               paper bag.

               -- Laura hurriedly mops up her water tracks, then...

               -- She uses an industrial buffer to wax the hardwood floor.

               -- Laura removes her wedding ring... throws it in the toilet. 
               She reaches for the handle to flush it... hesitates, seeing 
               the "CONSERVE WATER - THIS MEANS YOU!" sticker on the toilet. 
               She reaches into the bowl and retrieves the ring.

               -- On the deck, Laura throws the wedding ring toward the 
               ocean. A SEAGULL swoops down, snatching it in mid-air and 
               flies off.

               OMIT

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               -- In the bathroom... the Seagull flies in through the open 
               window, lands on the back of the toilet and drops the ring... 
               into the toilet bowl!

               EXT. THE BEACH - NEXT MORNING

               Laura's Husband reaches into the surf and picks up the 
               deflated float ring. He looks at it with a cruel sneer.

               INT. BEACH HOUSE - BATHROOM

               Laura's Husband fishes Laura's wedding ring out of the toilet 
               bowl... looking off with demonic rage!

               END FLASHBACK MONTAGE

               THE CAMERA PULLS BACK

               from Laura's SCREAMING mouth! Her eyes are filled with pure 
               terror! A GIGANTIC wave of WATER splashes in her face!

               We see Ned... holding a tiny empty paper cup in his hand. 
               Laura is completely drenched!

                                     NED
                         Laura! Are you alright? That was a 
                         very long flashback you had.

               She snaps out of it, sputtering.

                                     LAURA
                         Yes... I know. It's okay. I'm just a 
                         little... pre-menstrual.

               She goes to her desk, still upset. She picks up the message 
               spike and turns to Ned.

                                     LAURA
                         That Lola Cain... "person"... stopped 
                         by. She left this!

               She thrusts it toward Ned's face! There's a business card 
               stuck on the end. He pulls it off.

               ANGLE - CLOSE ON BUSINESS CARD

               It reads: LE HOT CLUB! No Air Conditioning... And Proud Of 
               It! Scribbled next to it is the message... "Meet me at 7:30". 
               The edges of the card are scorched.

               INT. LE HOT CLUB - NIGHT

               It's dark, seductive, smoky, crowded... and HOT. Everybody 
               is dripping with sweat and holding unlit cigarettes.

               Ned enters, sees Lola sitting on a stool at the bar, one leg 
               crossed provocatively over the other. A beer can is stuck to 
               the gum on the bottom of her shoe. It falls off with a CLUNK.

               He sits on the stool next to her. She looks at him, smiles.

                                     NED
                         Oh yeah, before I forget... you asked 
                         me to take care of this.

               He reaches into his jacket pocket, pulls out a LIT CIGARETTE. 
               It has a very long ash.

                                     LOLA
                         Thanks...

               She takes it... inhales a drag, then lets the smoke flow out 
               through her smile. It flows out for a loooooooooong time! 
               More smoke than she could ever have inhaled. Then...

                                     NED
                         You smoke too much.
                              (looks around, then)
                         It's hot tonight.

                                     LOLA
                         Is it? I never know. My body heat 
                         runs about twenty degrees above 
                         normal.

               He notices the drink in her hand is BOILING. A saxophone 
               begins to softly wail Lola's Theme. Ned looks over to see a 
               QUARTET, featuring Dizzy on sax. The GUITARIST spontaneously 
               bursts into FLAME! A FIREMAN, in full gear, jumps up from 
               the bar and puts out the blaze with a fire extinguisher. 
               None of the band members miss a beat.

                                     NED
                         Maybe we should look for a cooler 
                         place.

                                     LOLA
                         I doubt we'll find one. Even the 
                         wind chimes on my porch aren't moving 
                         much these days. They keep thudding 
                         softly, like dairy cows bumping butts 
                         in the night. I go out there expecting 
                         to find a cool breeze... but it's 
                         just a lot of hot air.

               Ned glances at the MALE CUSTOMERS... sitting at the bar across 
               from them. They're staring coldly at Ned.

                                     NED
                         What're they lookin' at?

                                     LOLA
                         A lot of them have tried that seat. 
                         You're the first one's lasted this 
                         long.

                                     NED
                         I feel honored.

                                     LOLA
                         Don't. It's broken.

               A beat of realization, then the stool collapses with a CRASH! 
               Ned pulls himself back up and drags another stool over.

                                     NED
                         Did you bring the... papers?

                                     LOLA
                         No. I thought you might come over...

                         Sure. I'll drive you.

                                     LOLA
                         I brought my own car.

                                     NED
                         I'll follow you then.

                                     LOLA
                         I know it sounds silly, but would 
                         you leave first... wait in your car? 
                         I come here a lot and I wouldn't 
                         want those men to think I'm "easy"... 
                         a slut who'll jump into bed with 
                         anyone at the drop of a hat. But if 
                         you leave first...

                                     NED
                         ...they'll think I'm a putz for 
                         passing up a sure thing.

               Lola stares at Ned for a long moment... then SLAPS his face. 
               He doesn't move, remaining staunchly macho. Then, suddenly, 
               she SLUGS HIM so hard it knocks him over the top of the bar!

                                     LOLA
                              (for all to hear)
                         Now leave me alone!

               She pauses to give him a flicker of a COY SMILE... then picks 
               up her drink and moves to a nearby table. Ned struggles to 
               his feet and staggers to the door.

               INT. NED'S CAR - NIGHT

               Ned is a mess! Blood trickles from the side of his mouth. 
               Shirt soaked in sweat. He turns the radio ON. LOLA'S THEME 
               starts playing.

               A small ceiling fan hangs from the interior roof of his car, 
               turning slowly. The venetian blinds on his side windows are 
               partially open, letting in slashes of dramatic light.

               ANGLE - HIS POV OF ROAD

               He's following Lola's car. It signals and turns left.

               INT. NED'S CAR - NIGHT

               Still hot, Ned pulls the chain on the ceiling fan. It spins 
               faster. MUCH faster! The car becomes like a wind tunnel!

               EXT. LOLA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               The two cars enter a long drive, coming to a stop near a 
               large two story house surrounded by lush greenery.

               Ned climbs out... his wind-blown hair flattened on one side 
               and sticking out crazily.

               ANGLE - LOLA'S CAR DOOR - NED'S POV

               It opens. Lola's legs swing out. The CAMERA PANS DOWN her 
               long legs to her feet. The car floormat is stuck to one shoe. 
               She casually shakes it off... going to the front door.

               INT. LOLA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               They enter. It's DARK. Ned squints into the shadows.

                                     NED
                         Well, here we are... in the dark.

                                     LOLA
                         I have The Clapper.

                                     NED
                         You what?

               Lola CLAPS her hands twice and all the LIGHTS COME ON. She 
               smiles at him... drops her car keys on the hall table, then 
               goes up the stairs.

               Ned drops his car keys on the table too and follows her.

               EXT. PORCH OFF BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Lola clicks on a porch light. She and Ned step out. Dozens 
               of small boxes hang around the perimeter of the porch.

                                     LOLA
                         My wind chimes.

               Ned steps over, running his hands along the boxes. They "thud" 
               against each other.

                                     NED
                         You know, these would work a lot 
                         better if you took them out of the 
                         boxes.

               He slips several boxes off, releasing clusters of the metal 
               chimes. They "tinkle" and "clang" melodically in the breeze.

                                     LOLA
                         Well well... I guess you have been 
                         around. I'm impressed.

               She moves close, coming on to him. Ned feels uneasy.

                                     NED
                         Why don't we take a look at those... 
                         papers?

                                     LOLA
                              (remembering)
                         Papers. Right.

               INT. DRESSING AREA OFF BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Lola comes in, looks around, then down. She removes her shoe, 
               pulling off two scraps of paper stuck to the gum on her heel.

               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Ned is looking through a book... "KAMIKAZE KAMA SUTRA - The 
               Encyclopedia of Deadly Sexual Positions." Lola comes back 
               in, hands Ned the two scraps of paper.

                                     NED
                         That's it? These are the... papers?

                                     LOLA
                         Yes. They're so confusing to me. Can 
                         you tell me what they are?

               He checks them out... shrugs. It's obvious.

                                     NED
                         This one's a laundry receipt... and 
                         the other one's an expired lottery 
                         ticket.

               He hands them back to her, but she gently pushes them away.

                                     LOLA
                         No. You keep them... as a memento of 
                         our time together.

               She slips them into his jacket pocket... then sensuously 
               slides her hands around him, grabbing his buns, pulling him 
               closer.

                                     LOLA
                         I'm so grateful. How can I ever repay 
                         you for all you've done?

                                     NED
                         Cash would be nice.

                                     LOLA
                         Isn't there some other way?

                                     NED
                         I suppose you could wash my car.

                                     LOLA
                         No, I mean, isn't there something 
                         else you want? Something I could 
                         give you?

               She seductively starts to slide the jacket off his shoulders.

                                     NED
                         Hey... slow down... there's a speed

                         an hour.

                              (rapid run-on)
                         Suppose I do and then we lose the 
                         key and while I'm gone to get a 
                         duplicate made the house catches on 
                         fire and I can't get back to save 
                         you because the bridge is washed out 
                         and so you die a horrible death 
                         toasted like a Polish sausage on a 
                         flaming spit!
                              (shakes his head)
                         Nah... I better be going.

               He turns and leaves. She is stunned, confused, breathless.

               EXT. FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

               Ned opens the door, pauses, turns... as Lola joins him there. 
               She looks into his eyes with desire.

                                     LOLA
                         You're not so tough. Last chance.

               She moves her lips close to his, about to kiss him. Then...

                                     NED
                         No thanks. I got a cold shower and a 
                         wife who trusts me waiting at home.

                                     LOLA
                         What's the matter? Don't you want 
                         me? It's the way I look, isn't it?

               He steps out, pauses... turns to her.

                                     NED
                         Don't forget to lock up.

               Ned pulls the door shut. The lock CLICKS. He pauses by his 
               car, realizing something, heaves a sigh, goes back to the 
               door.

               He tries the knob, but the door is locked. He looks through 
               the small window. He sees Lola standing inside... breathing 
               heavily, bracing herself against the staircase bannister, 
               hand to her heaving chest as if to calm a pounding heart.

               He pushes against the door. It won't budge. He goes to the 
               large window, gazing inside. She slides one hand enticingly 
               across her breast and thigh, striking a seductive pose.

               He points toward the door, motioning for her to unlock it. 
               She looks away. Frustrated, Ned tries the window. It's locked.

               He picks up a wrought iron chair, SLAMS it into the window! 
               The heavy chair falls apart. The glass doesn't even vibrate!

               He sees a riding power mower in the driveway... jumps into 
               the seat, starts the engine... barreling toward the front of 
               the house! THUNDER CRASHES and LIGHTNING FLASHES in the sky!

               He PLOWS into the side of the house, SMASHING a huge hole 
               thru the wall!... MOWING a swath in the carpet!

               Lola GASPS. Ned climbs off the mower, moving toward her. She 
               opens her arms, breathless. The MUSIC SWELLS dramatically! 
               She intercepts him, embracing him passionately.

                                     LOLA
                         I knew you'd come back...

                                     NED
                              (looking past her)
                         I forgot my car keys.

               He struggles free, grabbing his car keys from the hall table. 
               She follows, embracing him again, even more tenaciously.

                                     LOLA
                         That's not what you came back for.

                                     NED
                         Yes it is.

               Impatient, she crushes her mouth against his, kissing him 
               hard, desperately clawing at his clothes. She's relentless... 
               devouring him with her lips and tongue.

               Overwhelmed, he succumbs to her passion. His car keys drop 
               from his hand. She pushes him down toward the floor.

               LOW ANGLE - AT FLOOR LEVEL

               Her hands grasp his shirt, ripping it open. The buttons fly 
               in all directions! She grabs at his leather belt, twisting 
               it in her hands... ripping it in two!

               She grabs his pants by the cuffs... rips one pant leg off! 
               Then the other!... tossing them over each shoulder!

               Ned and Lola tumble across the floor, arms and legs 
               entangled... rolling themselves up in a rug in the process.

               ANGLE - FIREPLACE

               A roaring fire. We HEAR O.C. MOANING and HEAVY BREATHING. 
               The CAMERA TILTS DOWN to a sheepskin rug in front of the 
               fireplace. No one is there! A crystal vase falls, CRASHING 
               on the stone hearth. The CAMERA TILTS UP to REVEAL Ned and 
               Lola... stretched out on the mantle, ravishing each other.

               ANGLE - THE REFRIGERATOR

               The door suddenly BURSTS OPEN! Ned and Lola tumble out... 
               wrapped in each other's arms, food tumbling out with them.

               OMIT

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               ANGLE - THE DINING ROOM TABLE

               The table wiggles. The CAMERA MOVES UP to REVEAL Ned and 
               Lola kissing passionately. She lays on the table, arms and 
               legs stretched upward... a spinning plate balanced on the 
               pointed finger of each hand... and a large spinning platter 
               balanced on the end of her pointed left toe. Her right foot 
               brushes the platter to keep it spinning. The Ed Sullivan 
               Show position.

               SEVERAL ANGLES - IN BED

               -- Ned and Lola's entangled legs, moving under the sheets.

               -- Ned sitting, wrists tied to the brass bed with silk 
               scarves.

               -- Lola, also with her wrists tied to the bed with silk 
               scarves.

               -- Then... A WIDER ANGLE... revealing that they are BOTH 
               tied... at opposite ends of the same bed!

               ANGLE - THE BASEMENT STAIRS

               Wrapped in each other's arms, they tumble down the stairs... 
               crashing into a workbench, still kissing passionately!

               ANGLE - A WALL SOCKET

               Ned's hand plugs in a cord. RACK FOCUS to a soft lamb's wool 
               BUFFER WHEEL rising into frame, WHIRRING. It dips into an 
               open can of FLOOR WAX... then moves over to Lola's naked 
               body, buffing the surface of her skin to a high gloss. The 
               CAMERA MOVES to her EYES. They're CROSSED in ecstasy.

               ANGLE - THE BEDROOM FLOOR

               HEAVY BREATHING. SQUEAKY BED NOISES. The CAMERA MOVES up 
               along the mattress. The bed moves with a jerky rhythm. The 
               CAMERA REVEALS Lola's hand, grasping the sheet tightly. WE 
               MOVE UP to Lola, lying face down against the pillow.

                              (breathless)
                         ...don't... stop...

               FULL SHOT - THE BED

               Ned jumps up and down on the bed like a trampoline! Lola is 
               on her stomach, bouncing each time Ned's feet hit the bed.

                                     LOLA
                         ...Oh Ned... please... don't... 
                         stop...

               He does a complete BACK FLIP!... then keeps bouncing.

               EXT. THE ROOFTOP - NIGHT

               The wind blows. THUNDER and LIGHTNING! RAIN pours down.

               Ned and Lola, both in yellow rain slickers, ravish each other 
               lustfully on the roof, sliding down the incline of shingles. 
               Oblivious to the peril, they slip right over the edge!

               They hang from the eaves trough, each clutching it with one 
               hand while still holding one another with their free arms... 
               kissing passionately. The trough breaks! They fall!

               ANGLE - THE GROUND BELOW

               They roll out of the bushes onto the lawn, arms and legs 
               entangled. They fall apart, gasping for breath. A beat.

                                     LOLA
                         That takes care of foreplay.

               Ned's eyes widen. Lola grins lustily, rolling on top of him.

               INT. PRISON CELL - MORNING

               The cell wall is a clutter of PHOTOS: Hitler... Mussolini... 
               Charles Manson... and his mother, Mrs. Shady.

               A man's muscular naked torso rises into frame, his back to 
               us. He's doing pull-ups, his body covered with TATTOOS!

               Quotes on each arm... "Don't have a cow, man!" - Bart 
               Simpson... and "I know you are, but what am I?" - Pee Wee 
               Herman.

               On one shoulder, a gravestone with the epitaph "I told you I 
               was sick!"

               In the center of his back... we see a big tattoo of Ned's 
               face labeled "DEAD MEAT."

               A GUARD opens the cell door.

                                     GUARD
                         It's time, Max.

               The prisoner turns. He's butt-ugly, hard, nasty looking. 
               It's MAX SHADY... with a HUGE "Double Corona" CIGAR in his 
               mouth. On his chest is a tattoo that reads: THIS SPACE FOR 
               RENT. He walks right toward the CAMERA LENS and the FRAME 
               goes TO BLACK.

                                                              MATCH CUT TO:

               BLACK FRAME

               EXT. FEDERAL PRISON - MORNING

               Two huge iron doors swing open and a mob of milling REPORTERS 
               rushes forward, surrounding Max Shady. He wears a blue suit 
               just like Ned's. The Reporters have no microphones, but shove 
               their empty hands at Max as if they do. They shout questions.

                                     MAX SHADY
                         Yeah. The bastard gave it to me as a 
                         gift... to make up for losing my 
                         case. Now I'm going to wear it to 
                         his friggin' funeral!!

               Shady sees someone o.s., waves like a gleeful little kid.

                                     MAX SHADY
                         Ma!

               INT. LOLA'S HOUSE - MORNING

               A ceiling fan rotates slowly... a pair of shorts and a nylon 
               stocking hanging from the blades. The house is a wreck!

               The CAMERA MOVES DOWN to Ned and Lola, both reclining in a 
               big claw-foot bathtub, facing each other, their arms draped 
               lazily over the sides. Ned's eyes are closed.

               "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida" plays on the stereo in the b.g.

               Lola's hand reaches for an ICE PICK on the floor, raising it 
               up slowly. Then... CLICK!... ignites the cigarette lighter 
               in the handle, touching the flame to the end of her cigarette.

               She chips away a big chunk of ice from the block in a silver 
               ice bucket beside her... then sensuously rubs the ice across 
               her breasts. Ned winces at the sight of this.

               Lola smiles at him, then lets the chunk of ice slide into 
               the water... and pushes it between Ned's legs. He cringes, 
               eyes crossed. The familiar repetition of MUSICAL notes from 
               the stereo DRONES LOUDER... grabbing Ned's attention.

                                     NED
                         That's Madam Butterfly, isn't it?

                                     LOLA
                         It tells the sad story of a woman 
                         who is rejected by her lover after a 
                         brief, but torrid, affair... so she 
                         stalks him with an ice pick and stabs 
                         him with it more than a thousand 
                         times.

                                     NED
                         Really? I never could understand the 
                         lyrics.

               He lifts his feet out of the water, dangles them over each 
               side of the tub. He's still wearing one blue sock. Lola raises 
               her feet out of the water. She's still wearing her high heel 
               shoes. They are dripping.

                                     NED
                         You know, what happened last night 
                         was very, uh...

                         Yes... it was. I should check on my 
                         homeowners insurance.

                                     NED
                         But we can't ever let it happen again. 
                         Ever!

                                     LOLA
                         What are you saying, Ned? That you're 
                         rejecting me, your lover, after a 
                         brief, but torrid, affair?!

               Ned pulls his feet in, sits up... suddenly feeling vulnerable. 
               He measures his words very, very carefully.

                                     NED
                         I wouldn't put it exactly like that. 
                         It's just that... well, I'm married 
                         to a wonderful woman... who is very, 
                         very attractive...
                              (but adds quickly)
                         ...not that you aren't very 
                         attractive!

               His voice begins to ECHO and FADE as the CAMERA MOVES IN to 
               a CU of Lola's enraged EYES!

                                     NED
                              (voice echoing)
                         ...you aren't very attractive... you 
                         aren't very attractive... you aren't 
                         very attractive...

               And then WE SEE...

               A CLOSE SHOT of her hand, grasping the ice pick... scratching 
               it along the side of the tub, peeling back the porcelain. A 
               GRATING SCREECH OVERLAPS to...

               INT. PET STORE - DAY

               TIGHT on a SCREECHING TROPICAL BIRD. We PULL BACK to reveal 
               Ned looking around the store. His ripped pants have been 
               temporarily repaired with big pieces of masking tape. A CLERK 
               steps over with two big Parrots on her shoulders.

                                     CLERK
                         Don't touch anything. You bond with 
                         it... you buy it. Whatdya want?

                                     NED
                         I'd like to buy a pet.

               She eyes him suspiciously.

                                     CLERK
                         Yeah. For what purpose?

                                     NED
                         It's a gift... for my wife.

                                     CLERK
                         Right. They all say that.

                                     NED
                         She spends a lot of time alone. I 
                         thought it might be nice if she had 
                         something to keep her company.

                                     CLERK
                         Yeah. Sure. I bet. How do I know 
                         you're not the kind of guy who punches 
                         out parakeets? Or takes some poor 
                         defenseless animal, throws it in a 
                         sack and runs over it with your car 
                         five or six times.

                                     NED
                         I would never hurt an animal.

                                     CLERK
                         Boy, I would. They're driving me 
                         CRAZY!

               Turns and SHOUTS at the noisy birds.

                                     CLERK
                         Shuddup!

               They do. She turns back to Ned.

                                     CLERK
                         Okay... tell me more about this broad 
                         you're married to. I like to match 
                         people with the pets they deserve.

               INT. POLICE SQUAD ROOM - DAY

               A typical police squad room... smoke-filled, cluttered, busy. 
               Arch sits at a desk doing paperwork, surrounded by the Gang 
               Members... who are also filling out papers. Arch SINGS to 
               himself, munching on nachos from a big pile of chips. The 
               Gang Members harmonize with him.

               A Gang Member reaches for a nacho chip. Arch grabs for the 
               gun in his shoulder holster.

                                     ARCH
                         Uh-uh.

               The Gang Member drops the chip. Arch pops it in his mouth, 
               continues singing. The Gang Members join in with harmony.

               Ned enters in the background, carrying a box with airholes 
               in it. He steps over to his desk, looking at the singing 
               Gang Members, then motions like a choir leader, cutting them 
               off neatly.

                                     NED
                              (doubtful)
                         You do all my paperwork?

               They all hand over their completed paperwork. Ned stares at 
               them for a beat... surprised.

                                     NED
                         Get out of here.

               They do. He opens the files... checks out the papers. Arch 
               notices something O.S. and gets up.

                                     ARCH
                         And a damn good job, too. One of 'em 
                         even did it in Spanish.

               Arch turns the sound up on a wall-mounted TV monitor.

                         Hey Ned! Catch this! Friend of yours.

               On the screen... it's Max Shady speaking to the press.

               Arch slumps in his chair, really stunned.

                                     ARCH
                         Christ, Ned... you're in deep shit.

               Ned laughs it off. He starts checking through the messages 
               and paperwork on his desk. The PHONE RINGS. He picks it up.

                                     NED
                         Lieutenant Ravine.

               Ned's face darkens. He turns away.

               INT. LOLA'S HOUSE - TIGHT SHOT - LOLA'S MOUTH - DAY

               Speaking into the phone... intense, obsessive.

                         I told you not to call me! It's 
                         finished between us. No. No, I'm not 
                         sucking anything of yours anymore!
                              (voice gets louder)
                         It's done! OVER!

               He SLAMS the receiver down, shattering the phone! Everyone 
               stares at Ned in stunned silence.

               She's in the bathtub, phone receiver in one hand, still 
               jabbing at the porcelain tub with the ice pick. Water squirts 
               from the holes she's punctured in the side of the tub. She 
               flings the ice pick at the wall. It sticks!

               EXT. PARK - DAY

               Lana is seated on a park bench wearing a trenchcoat, hat and 
               sunglasses. Frank walks up, looks around nervously, pretending 
               not to know Lana. He sits down next to her.

                                     FRANK
                         How come we gotta meet here?

                                     LANA
                         We have to be careful now. We can't 
                         risk being seen together at the house 
                         or someone might connect us to the 
                         murder later on.

               She hands him a hat.

                                     LANA
                         Here... put this on.

               She takes her sunglasses off, looks at him. He hesitates, 
               staring at the hat. A dignified looking OLDER GENTLEMAN 
               approaches. Frank quickly slips the hat on his head.

               The Older Gentleman sits on the bench across from them. He 
               opens a paper sack and begins neatly laying his lunch out 
               next to him. An apple, sandwich, napkin, Mountain Dew.

                                     LANA
                              (whispers to Frank)
                         Speak Yiddish.

                                     FRANK
                         What?

                                     LANA
                         Red Yiddish.

               We see the SUB-TITLE "Speak Yiddish." From this point on, 
               all their dialog is in YIDDISH... but it appears in ENGLISH 
               SUB-TITLES across the bottom of the screen.

                                     FRANK

                              too complicated.)

               INTERCUT - ANGLE ON OLDER GENTLEMAN

               He tosses crumbs of his sandwich to the pigeons, occasionally 
               glancing up at Frank and Lana. Whenever they speak, however, 
               his eyes look down toward their legs.

               INTERCUT - MEDIUM TWO-SHOT ON FRANK AND LANA

               with SUB-TITLES across the bottom of screen, about knee-level.

               He looks around nervously.

                                     FRANK

                                     OLDER GENTLEMAN
                         There's very little risk involved.

                         thirty-two percent of all murderers 
                         are ever apprehended.

               They both look at him... stunned. A long beat.

                                     LANA
                         You speak Yiddish?

                         No. But I can read sub-titles.

               Frank and Lana are speechless. But across the bottom of the 
               screen we see a SUB-TITLE reflecting their thoughts.

                                     SUB-TITLE
                         Oy vay!

               INT. NED'S LAW OFFICE - DAY

               Ned enters, carrying the box. He sets it down on her desk.

                                     LAURA
                         Oh gee, you shouldn't have...

                                     NED
                         I didn't. It's for my wife.

               He goes into his office, starts to change out of his tattered 
               suit. Laura talks to him from the outer office.

                                     LAURA
                         She called. Wondered why you never 
                         came home last night. I told her you 
                         were working with a client, 
                         undercover.

               She steps into the doorway of his office.

                                     LAURA
                         Were you?

                                     NED
                         What?

                                     LAURA
                         There's lipstick on your collar.

               She returns to her desk. Disturbed, Ned quickly pulls the 
               shirt collar out, checks it.

                                     NED
                         No there isn't.

                                     LAURA
                         No... there isn't. But you answered 
                         my question. She's a real looker, 
                         huh?

                                     NED
                         Who?

                                     LAURA
                         Lola Cain.

                                     NED
                         I hadn't noticed.

               She opens the blinds behind her and looks at Ned through the 
               window between their offices.

                                     LAURA
                         Yeah, I noticed how you hadn't 
                         noticed.
                              (returns to work)
                         That's alright. She noticed enough 
                         for both of us.

               She picks up a stack of papers from the FAX machine. Ned 
               steps into the doorway, wearing a clean shirt.

                                     LAURA
                         I worry about you, Ned. I worry a 
                         lot.
                              (hands him papers)
                         Max Shady's been faxing death threats 
                         to you all morning.

                                     NED

                         Did you get to the one...?

                                     NED
                         ...cut it off... shove it in a 
                         blender.

                                     LAURA
                         Yeah... that one.

                                     NED
                              (tosses them aside)
                         He's just getting it out of his 
                         system. Once they say it... they 
                         never do it. You know... like the 
                         President.

               There's a KNOCK at the door. They look up to see an ominous 
               SILHOUETTE of a MAN on the milkglass. Ned starts toward the 
               door. Laura grabs his arm, stopping him.

                                     LAURA
                              (whispers)
                         Wait. It might be him.

               She opens her purse, pulls out a big COLT .45, holding it 
               out to him. Ned stares at it, taken aback.

                                     NED
                         Where did you get that?

                                     LAURA
                              (as if obvious)
                         From my purse.

                                     NED
                         What are you doing with it?

                                     LAURA
                              (still obvious)
                         Handing it to you.

                                     NED
                         Jeez, Laura, what do you use a gun 
                         for?

                                     LAURA
                         You shoot it. A bullet comes out. 
                         Gosh, Ned, after all your years as a 
                         cop, I'd think you'd know these 
                         things.

                                     NED
                         Laura... put the gun away.

               He hands the gun back to her... goes to the door... opens 
               it. There's a young DELIVERY MAN holding a bouquet of flowers.

                                     DELIVERY MAN

                         Hey... aren't you that lawyer guy? 
                         Man, you are dead meat!

               Ned grabs the flowers, slams the door. Laura takes the 
               envelope from the flowers... opens it.

                                     LAURA
                         Is this another sick joke from Max 
                         Shady?

               She looks at the card... her expression turning cold.

                                     NED
                         What is it...?

                                     LAURA
                              (hands it to him)
                         Lola Cain.

               She grabs the flowers... takes them into the bathroom.

                                     LAURA
                         I'll put these in water for you.

               Ned opens the envelope. An audio cassette drops into his 
               hand. Written on the label: PLAY ME.

               From the bathroom, we hear the LOUD SOUND of a TOILET 
               FLUSHING.

               INT. NED'S CAR - NIGHT

               It's raining. Ned pops the cassette into the tape player.

                                     LOLA'S VOICE
                         Ned, darling... I know this seems 
                         like a strange way to talk with you... 
                         but since you won't take my calls, I 
                         have no other choice.
                              (then suddenly)
                         Watch it! That red car's turning 
                         left!

               Ned swerves to avoid a collision, HONKING his horn.

                                     LOLA'S VOICE
                         I love you, Ned. We're meant to be 
                         together... forever.
                              (then suddenly)
                         The light's changing! Floor it! Go! 
                         Go! Go!

               Ned guns it!... accelerating through a yellow light.

                                     LOLA'S VOICE
                         Nice move!
                              (then sincere again)
                         Nothing can keep us apart, Ned. Not 
                         even your wife. I'd hate to have to 
                         tell her about us, but if necessary... 
                         I will.

               We see HEADLIGHTS behind Ned's car.

               INT. LOLA'S CAR - NIGHT

               She is following him, her eyes intense, obsessed. Dizzy sits 
               in the back seat, noodling softly on his saxophone.

               INT. NED'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               Ned steps into the living room carrying the box. Lana comes 
               down the stairs, pulling on a bathrobe.

                                     LANA
                         What happened to you last night?

                                     NED
                              (guilty as charged)
                         Why? What have you heard?

                                     LANA
                              (sarcastic)
                         You could have called. But then, I 
                         suppose you were tied up.

                                     NED
                              (reflecting back)
                         Only part of the time.

                                     LANA
                         I never know when you're coming home, 
                         Ned. How can I ever make any plans?

               In the b.g., through the window, WE SEE Frank drop from the 
               second floor, right onto the seat of a waiting motorcycle. 
               He ZOOMS OFF into the night.

               Ned steps up behind Lana, slips his arms around her.

                                     NED
                         I promise I'll spend more time with 
                         you. I know it's been rough, being 
                         alone so much. But I'll make it up 
                         to you. Maybe we should try again, 
                         you know... to have a baby.

               She rolls her eyes at this... changes the subject.

                                     LANA
                         So what's in the box?

                                     NED
                         Oh... I brought you a present!

               He hands it to her. She opens it, looks in. She looks up, 
               struggling unsuccessfully to hide a look of displeasure.

                                     LANA
                         What is it?

                                     NED
                         It's... sorta like a cat.

               Ned pulls out a PET SKUNK and puts it in Lana's lap. She 
               forces a weak smile.

                                     LANA
                         Not enough like a cat.

                                     NED
                         It's a little skunk. I got it at 
                         Birds-and-Skunks-R-Us.

               EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

               Lola stands in the pouring rain outside, drenched... staring 
               at Lana and Ned through the window.

               INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

                                     NED
                         So... what're you going to name him?

                                     LANA
                         How about... Ned?

                                     NED
                              (thinks about it)
                         Yeah. Got a nice ring to it. I've 
                         always liked the name Ned.

                                     LANA
                         No kidding.

               He puts his arms around them both.

                                     NED
                         So whatdya think? You love Ned Junior 
                         as much as you love me?

                                     LANA
                         At least.

               The phone RINGS. Lana stands up, unceremoniously dropping 
               the Skunk into Ned's arms. She goes into...

               THE ADJOINING ROOM

               ...to answer the phone.

                                     LANA
                         Hello?... Hello?... Hello?
                              (then, whispering)
                         Frank? Is that you?

               EXT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT

               Lola is in a glass telephone booth with venetian blinds and 
               a ceiling fan. She cracks the blinds open. In the background, 
               through a window, we can see Lana in the house on the phone.

                                     LANA
                              (filtered)
                         I told you not to call. Frank? FRANK!

               INT. COURTHOUSE - DAY

               Ned enters the cavernous marble rotunda, turns down a hallway 
               crowded with milling attorneys and defendants. Lola suddenly 
               intercepts him... a newspaper trailing from her high heel 
               shoe.

                                     LOLA
                         Who's Frank?

                                     NED
                         Frank? The only Frank I know is an 
                         auto mechanic... but I sure as hell 
                         wouldn't recommend the guy. He's 
                         really slow.

               He starts to move off, but she stops him, impassioned.

                                     LOLA
                         I had to see you, Ned. I need to 
                         feel your arms around me! I wanna 
                         suck your toes til the nails pop 
                         off!

               Lola's voice ECHOES. BYSTANDERS gather, listening. Ned looks 
               around self-consciously, embarrassed.

                                     NED
                         I told you, what happened was a big 
                         mistake. A one night stand. It's 
                         over. I have a wife...

               The CROWD presses closer... not missing a thing. A WOMAN 
               snaps a FLASH PICTURE! A MAN turns on his video camera.

                                     LOLA
                         It doesn't matter. She'll know all 
                         about us soon anyway. I want YOU! In 
                         my bed... in my arms... in MEEEEEEE!

               Mortified, Ned spins on his heels and makes a bee-line for 
               the safety of the Men's Room. Lola holds up two tickets.

                                     LOLA
                         I got us tickets to see Iron 
                         Butterfly!

                                     NED
                         I hate opera!

               INT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY

               Ned bursts in, goes to the urinal... not noticing BEN ARUGULA, 
               an older gentleman in a business suit, standing at the urinal 
               next to him. A beat later... Lola enters.

                                     LOLA
                         Why are you running from me? Didn't 
                         it mean ANYTHING to you?... buffing 
                         my buns with carnuba wax?
                              (looks down)
                         Come on, Neddy-poo. Doesn't Mr. Pokey 
                         want to go exploring?

                                     NED
                         He's busy right now.

               Arugula glances sideways at Ned, curious and uneasy.

                                     NED
                         Look, I told you... Mr. Pokey made a 
                         big mistake! One lousy mistake in 
                         his whole stinkin' life! So why don't 
                         you give him a BREAK! Besides... he 
                         belongs to my wife!

               EXT. SHOOTING RANGE - DAY

               Lana FIRES her gun rapidly... BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!... 
               over her shoulder, behind her back, under her leg.

               ANGLE ON TARGET

               A full-body cut-out of a man, wearing one of Ned's trademark 
               gray suits. A HUGE SMOKING HOLE has been blown right through 
               the crotch! Lana smirks, inhales the SMOKE from the gun 
               barrel... and blows it out.

               INT. COURTROOM - DAY

               TILT DOWN from an official government seal that reads "ARS 
               GRATIA ARTIS." JUDGE Ben Arugula... the distinguished looking 
               gentleman from the men's room, sits on the bench. Ned, Laura 
               and a SLIMY DEFENDANT stand at the defense table.

                                     JUDGE ARUGULA
                         I'd like to congratulate Mr. Pokey 
                         for setting yet another unusual legal 
                         precedent. This is the first time 
                         I've ever tried a case in which the 
                         JURY was found to be insane.

               ANGLE - JURY AND BAILIFF

               The BAILIFF is handing out straitjackets to all the JURORS. 
               The Jury Foreman struggles to get his on and laced up.

                                     BAILIFF

                         What're you? A thirty-eight long?

               BACK TO JUDGE ARUGULA

                                     JUDGE ARUGULA
                         The jury will be remanded to the 
                         Center For Unclear Thinking in Simi 
                         Valley. Court's adjourned.

               INT. COURTHOUSE HALLWAY - DAY

               The JURY is led from the courtroom in straitjackets and 
               chains. Ned and Laura follow them out.

                                     NED
                         Your BIRTHDAY! Today? Why didn't you 
                         tell me?

                                     LAURA
                         It's not important. I just had one 
                         last year.

                                     NED
                         Well, I'm taking you out to celebrate!

               In the b.g. the Slimy Defendant pulls a gun and forces 
               CITIZENS... including Judge Arugula... up against the wall, 
               robbing them!

                                     LAURA
                         Oh no no! It's no big thing. I'll 
                         have another one sometime.

                                     NED
                         I insist. And I want to get you a 
                         nice present.

                                     LAURA
                         You're so sweet. You don't have to. 
                         You gave me a present last year. 
                         Those lovely Ginzu knives.

                                     NED
                         Yeah... aren't they great! They last 
                         forever. And you can cut right through 
                         a shoe with 'em!

               As they walk off, we HOLD ON a CLOSE SHOT of a newspaper. 
               The headline reads: EX-CON STALKS COP/LAWYER NED RAVINE! 
               Below it is a picture of Max Shady, eyes wide with psychotic 
               rage... a huge cigar in his mouth, wearing a garish Hawaiian 
               shirt.

               Hands lower the newspaper... revealing Max himself, with the 
               same cigar, shirt and crazed look on his face.

               INT. LE MISS FASHION BOUTIQUE - DAY - MONTAGE

               Laura models hats... each one becoming more outrageous. She 
               coaxes Ned into joining her. They BOTH try on WOMEN's hats... 
               smiling and laughing... as "Brown Eyed Girl" plays.

               In one of the mirrors, we SEE Max Shady's reflection... as 
               he also tries on women's hats, watching them, puffing his 
               cigar.

               INT. LE HULA BOWL RESTAURANT - NIGHT

               Laura wears a baseball cap with beer cans attached to each 
               side with long, curved plastic straws. The cap emblem reads 
               "BEER BIMBO." A price tag hangs from it. She is beaming.

               In the b.g., Hawaiian DANCERS juggle flaming torches as they 
               dance around an ICE SCULPTURE of a Hula Dancer.

                                     NED
                         It's nice to be off the streets... 
                         away from all the pain and misery 
                         out there.

               Ned motions casually toward the world "out there"... sticking 
               his thumb into the eye of a WAITER who is bending over to 
               pick up a spoon, setting off a chaotic CHAIN REACTION of 
               small disasters that finally culminates with someone near 
               the dance floor bumping into the Torch Juggler, throwing his 
               rhythm off.

               Distracted, he starts catching the FLAMING ENDS of the 
               torches! OW! OH! YI! OUCH! YIPES!

               He drops them all. The Waiter who bumped into him, politely 
               picks up one of the flaming torches and hands it back to the 
               Torch Juggler. He grabs the flaming end of the torch... and 
               lets out a SCREAM!

               He lunges toward a voluptuous HULA GIRL ICE SCULPTURE, 
               grabbing the frozen breasts. His burned hands SIZZLE!

               Ned and Laura don't even notice... gazing only at each other.

                                     LAURA (V.O.)
                         What's he thinking when he looks at 
                         me with that goofy smile...?

                                     NED (V.O.)
                         Boy, does she look stupid in that 
                         hat.

                                     LAURA (V.O.)
                         If I told him how I really feel, 
                         he'd probably fire me. What am I 
                         saying? He probably doesn't even 
                         know I exist.

                                     NED (V.O.)
                         Laura's incredible. And so smart. 
                         Smart enough to recognize that Ginzu 
                         knives are the gift of a lifetime.
                              (then, concerned)
                         But she never goes out with guys. I 
                         wonder why?

                                     LAURA (V.O.)
                         I guess I'll just have to wait. But 
                         he's married. I could wait forever. 
                         Than again... maybe Lana will get 
                         hit by a runaway truck. There's always 
                         a chance that...

                                     NED (V.O.)
                              (interrupting)
                         But who cares if she... Oh, sorry.

                                     LAURA (V.O.)
                         That's alright. I was just rambling.

                                     NED (V.O.)
                         Go ahead...

                                     LAURA (V.O.)
                         No, no, really... you first...

                                     NED (V.O.)
                         I insist... please...

                                     LAURA
                         Oh, uh... I just wanted to remind 
                         you about...

                                     NED
                         ...the Legal Symposium...

                                     LAURA
                         ...in Santa Barbara...

                                     NED
                         ...tomorrow...

                                     NED & LAURA
                              (in unison)
                         ..."How To Sue Your Loved Ones."

                                     NED
                         Yeah. I'm driving up in the morning.

               ANGLE - MAX SHADY

               sits at a corner table wearing a chic beret from the hat 
               store, voraciously devouring a huge Hawaiian Pit Roasted 
               Pig. He wrenches the apple from the Pig's mouth... takes a 
               huge bite!

               BACK TO NED AND LAURA

               A saxophone begins to wail "Lola's Theme." Ned looks up, his 
               eyes drawn to the lounge. He sees...

               Lola... striking a sexy pose on a bar stool, eyes locked on 
               Ned. Dizzy walks thru, behind the bar, playing his sax.

               She grabs a handful of cherries from a glass on the bar, 
               shoves them in her mouth, cheeks bulging, tongue moving 
               furiously. A moment later, she pulls out a long chain of 
               inter-locked cherry stems.

               Ned reacts, shaken, glancing nervously at Laura. She smiles, 
               unaware. His eyes flash back to Lola.

                                     LAURA (V.O.)
                         He's so cute. He can't even look me 
                         in the eye.

               Ned's reacts intensely to...

               LOLA - NED'S POV

               She stretches out sensuously on the bar, executing a series 
               of humanly impossible erotic gymnastic positions! Then, 
               wrapping her legs around a brass pole, she spins no-handed... 
               until her thighs begin to SMOKE!

               REVERSE ANGLE - ON ENTIRE ROOM

               The eyes of every MALE in the restaurant are riveted on Lola!

               CLOSER ON NED AND LAURA

               The table starts to rise slowly on Ned's side, glasses sliding 
               toward Laura. She reaches out to stop them... noticing Ned's 
               distracted expression.

                                     LAURA
                              (touching his arm)
                         What is it, Ned? You can tell me.

                                     NED
                              (sighs, reluctant)
                         I'm a man, Laura. And all men feel 
                         passion at one time or another. Even 
                         me.

                                     LAURA
                              (hopeful)
                         Really?

                                     NED
                         What would you think of a married 
                         man who gave in to those wild, 
                         sensual, raging desires?

                                     LAURA
                         Oh... wow... golly...

               She gulps, eyes wide. The DRUMS pound faster as the Dancers 
               in the b.g. pick up the frenetic tempo!

                                     NED
                         What if, for just one crazy moment, 
                         he couldn't resist...? He got knocked 
                         for a loop and lost control?

                                     LAURA
                              (smiles, eager)
                         Gosh... that might be okay.

               Breathless, she breaks a sweat, gasping for air. The DRUMS 
               beat LOUDER, FASTER. The b.g. Dancers whip into a frenzy!

                                     NED
                         What if a tidal wave of lust crashed 
                         over him and he was sucked into a 
                         vortex of wild, thrashing urges?

               Both of Laura's ballcap beer cans EXPLODE! Beer SPRAYS out 
               in a huge gush, drenching her! Ned is so preoccupied with 
               his own dilemma, he doesn't even notice. He heaves a sigh... 
               pats her hand... smiles philosophically.

                                     NED
                         Well... it's not your problem. I'll 
                         work it out.

               ANGLE - AN ICE PICK

               grasped tightly in Lola's hand. She walks toward Ned and 
               Laura, a seething rage in her eyes.

               As she passes the ice sculpture, she stabs the ice pick into 
               the crystalline Hula Dancer's neck! The head breaks off. She 
               catches it and keeps coming, tossing the head casually in 
               one hand, like a basketball.

               Lola appears suddenly at Ned and Laura's table. They look 
               up.

                                     LOLA
                              (to Laura)
                         Like some ice for your drink?

               She drops the ice Mermaid head. It shatters Laura's glass to 
               bits! Lola turns to Ned with a cold glare.

                                     LOLA
                         Does your wife know you're... 
                         "working" late? I certainly hope so, 
                         Mr. Ravine.

               She lights her cigarette with the ice pick lighter, then 
               flips it like a jackknife. It STICKS into Ned's chair, right 
               between his legs.

               Lola flashes a coldly arrogant smile at Laura... then exits.

               EXT. NED'S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - MORNING

               Frank opens the hood to Ned's car, holding a screwdriver in 
               one hand... a wrench in the other. He doesn't know where to 
               start.

               CLOSE ANGLE - MAX SHADY'S FEET - MORNING

               A NEWSBOY tosses a folded newspaper. It lands at Max Shady's 
               feet. Max picks up the paper, opens it. The headline says: 
               SHADY READS NEWSPAPER IN FRONT OF RAVINE RESIDENCE! Max looks 
               around self-consciously, eyes shifting uneasily.

               INT. NED'S HOUSE - MORNING

               Lana stands by the front door. She calls upstairs to Ned.

                                     LANA
                         Hurry up, darling. You'll be late!

               Frank slips in, wearing his greasy overalls. He wipes his 
               hands on a rag... giving Lana a sly wink.

                                     FRANK
                              (whispering)
                         It's all taken care of. When do I 
                         knock on the door?

                                     LANA
                         Wait until I signal you. When I raise 
                         the blinds... you knock.

               She steps over to the blinds and demonstrates. He knocks.

                                     LANA
                         Not now!

                                     FRANK
                         Oh, later... right... okay.

               She nods, patronizing. Frank exits. Lana picks up the Skunk, 
               cuddling him. Ned comes down wearing his trademark gray suit. 
               Lana kisses him passionately... a final farewell.

                                     LANA
                         Drive carefully, sweetheart. Say bye-
                         bye to Little Ned. He loves his 
                         daddy... don't you Stink Pot?

                                     NED
                              (pets the skunk)
                         See you tonight, Junior.

               As soon as Ned closes the door, Lana's smile vanishes and 
               she casually tosses the Skunk aside with a LOUD CRASH O.C.

               EXT. NED'S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - MORNING

               Ned turns the car key. Nothing. He gets out, opens the hood. 
               He stares... dumbfounded.

               INT. THE HOUSE - MORNING

               Ned comes in, visibly upset. Lana acts surprised.

                                     LANA
                         What's wrong?

                                     NED
                         This neighborhood is getting worse 
                         all the time! Damn kids stole my 
                         engine!

                                     LANA
                         Why don't you catch the train to 
                         Santa Barbara? It leaves in twenty 
                         minutes.

                                     NED
                         I'll just fly up.

                                     LANA
                         No!

               Ned looks at her strangely. She catches herself.

                                     LANA
                         I mean... you can't. Armed terrorists 
                         seized the airport this morning. A 
                         plane crashed into the tower... and 
                         all the runways are on fire!

                                     NED
                         Yeah. So?

                                     LANA
                         And it's fogged in.

                                     NED
                              (disappointed)
                         Dammit.

                                     LANA
                         For my peace of mind... take the 
                         train.

               Lana goes to the window, starts to raise the blinds.

                                     NED
                         I can't do it. You know how I feel 
                         about riding trains.

               She stops... letting the blinds drop down.

                                     LANA
                         Darling... it's only a short trip.

                                     NED
                              (reconsiders)
                         Yeah... right. A short trip.

               She starts to raise the blinds again. He picks up the phone.

                                     NED
                              (he hesitates)
                         A short trip to hell in a metal tomb!

               He slams the receiver down. Lana drops the blinds again...

                                     LANA
                         Just because both your parents died 
                         in a train wreck...

                                     NED
                         And my brother, Jeff...

                                     LANA
                         And your brother, Morty...

                                     NED
                         My two sisters...

                                     LANA
                         Right...

                                     NED
                         My best friend, Al... my dog, Woof... 
                         Grandma Rose... and Uncle Lionel. 
                         All killed by trains!

                                     LANA
                              (very convincing)
                         Coincidence, Ned. Beside... that's 
                         the past. They're gone.

                                     NED
                              (sighs, resigned)
                         Yeah. I guess I can't bring them 
                         back by not riding on a train.

                                     LANA
                         That's right.

               She starts to raise the blinds again...

                                     NED
                         But I just can't get over this stupid 
                         nagging fear that...

               She abandons the blinds, leaving them raised part way...

                                     LANA
                         Fear! What about our baby, Ned? I 
                         don't want to raise a child in a 
                         home filled with fear!

               There's a KNOCK at the door. Lana tugs on the cord and the 
               blinds drop with a CRASH. The KNOCKING stops. She pretends 
               it didn't even happen, racing on.

                                     LANA
                         But if you can conquer your fear... 
                         maybe I can conquer my fear of having 
                         a baby with a father who's fearful.
                              (goes for broke)
                         Ned... don't let a train kill our 
                         child before it's even conceived!

                                     NED
                              (heaves a sigh)
                         I guess you're right.

               She grabs the cord, then hesitates...

                                     LANA
                         You're sure now...?

               A beat. He nods. She quickly pulls the blinds up.

                                     NED
                         But we'll never make it to the 
                         station. By the time a cab gets 
                         here...

               A LOUD KNOCK at the front door. Lana opens it. It's Frank.

                                     FRANK
                         I was in the neighborhood. Thought 
                         I'd stop by and pick up my tools.

                                     LANA
                         Frank will drive you. Won't you Frank?

                                     FRANK
                         Sure, I'll take you to the train 
                         station.

               They all freeze. Lana glares at Frank, who is completely 
               unaware of his faux pas... while Ned tries to figure out why 
               that response didn't sound right.

               INT. FRANK'S VAN - DAY

               They climb into the van. Ned nervously checks his watch.

                                     NED
                         Twelve minutes. We'll never make it.

               EXT. FRANK'S VAN - DAY

               The CAMERA BOOMS DOWN LOW to reveal Max Shady under the van, 
               hanging on like a leech, his back only inches from the road. 
               The van drives off.

               INT. FRANK'S VAN - MINUTES LATER

               At an intersection... they see a "DETOUR" sign. Frank and 
               Lana exchange concerned looks. Frank turns the corner. The 
               van starts vibrating violently, tossing them around.

                                     NED
                              (checks his watch)
                         We're not going to make it.

                                     FRANK
                         We'll make it!

               He shifts gears, guns the engine. They rocket ahead, BOUNCING 
               WILDLY, their heads THUMPING the car roof! The van SPLASHES 
               through deep water, a huge fantail spraying out on both sides.

               EXT. TRAIN STATION - DAY

               The train is pulling in. The CAMERA PANS to Frank's muddy 
               van as it drives up nearby. Frank waits in the van as Ned 
               and Lana get out and walk toward the train.

               They pass a feeble OLD WOMAN struggling to drag a HUGE STEAMER 
               TRUNK along the platform... inches at a time. A REDCAP passes 
               her also, carrying a small overnight case for an attractive, 
               elegantly attired SOCIALITE. Everyone ignores the Old Woman.

               Ned looks nervously at the train, already pale.

                                     LANA
                         Okay... now what're you going to do 
                         if you feel queasy going through the 
                         tunnel?

                                     NED
                         I'll stand in the vestibule between 
                         the cars.

                                     LANA
                         That's right. When you get queasy... 
                         go stand in the vestibule between 
                         the cars.

               She kisses his cheek. He reluctantly boards the train. Her 
               smile vanishes.

               She hurries back to the next car, nods at Frank, boards the 
               train. Frank peels off his coveralls, follows her on.

               ANGLE - COACH PLATFORM

               Laura's Husband steps from the train, holding the deflated 
               Ninja Turtle float ring. He looks around, then walks toward 
               the cab stand. The CAMERA MOVES with him, then HOLDS ON...

               MAN READING NEWSPAPER - TIGHT SHOT

               The headline says: SHADY VOWS BLENDER VENGEANCE ON RAVINE! 
               Under the headline is a picture of Max Shady... muddy, bloody, 
               greasy, clothes ripped, cigar shredded... looking off.

               The paper lowers, revealing Max... a battered mess, looking 
               off. He picks up a small violin case and quickly moves toward 
               the train as it starts to pull out.

               We now SEE that the seat of Max's pants has been ripped out, 
               his naked buttocks scratched and scraped raw by the road.

               INT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY

               Ned stares out the window... apprehensive, nervous.

               Frank and Lana enter at the opposite end of the coach. They 
               spot Ned, quickly ducking into a seat where they can observe 
               him yet remain hidden from view behind the tall seatbacks.

               INT. FIRST COACH CAR - DAY

               Max walks through the car looking for Ned. He pauses, puffing 
               on his big cigar. A WOMAN PASSENGER looks up and is shocked 
               to see Max's scraped bare butt hanging out only inches away.

                                     WOMAN PASSENGER
                         OH! My dear gracious!

               Max swivels around to look at her... turning his bare behind 
               toward an IRRITABLE MAN across the aisle.

                                     IRRITABLE MAN
                         SIR! Would you PLEASE extinguish 
                         that foul smelling cigar?

                                     MAX
                              (turning slowly)
                         You want me to put out my CIGAR? YOU 
                         want me to put out my cigar? You 
                         want ME to put out my CIGAR?

                                     IRRITABLE MAN
                         Yeah.

                                     MAX
                         Certainly.

               INT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY

               Max enters through the vestibule, without his cigar, stopping 
               in his tracks when he sees Ned. He smiles to himself, then 
               ducks back into the lavatory.

               INT. LAVATORY - DAY

               Max looks at himself in the mirror. He's a disaster. He opens 
               the violin case, pulling out his trademark "Ned Ravine" gray 
               suit on a hangar. It's not even wrinkled.

               INT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY

               Ned looks pale... sweating... reacting tensely to every lurch 
               and bump the train makes. The feeble Old Woman strains to 
               pull her huge steamer trunk down the aisle, inch by inch, 
               toward Ned.

               ANGLE ON FRANK AND LANA

               Lana peers over the seat, watching Ned with a cruel smile.

                                     LANA
                         It's already getting to him. He'll 
                         be out of that seat and into the 
                         vestibule within ten minutes... I 
                         guarantee it.

               INT. LAVATORY - DAY

               Max is cleaned up, dressed in the suit. He straightens his 
               tie, slicks his greasy hair back, sticks a big cigar in his 
               mouth and grins at himself in the mirror.

                                     MAX
                         You talkin' to me? You talkin' to 
                         ME? You... talkin'... to... ME?

               He reaches into the violin case, pulls out a complex 
               assortment of metal parts, assembling them swiftly. CLICK... 
               SNAP... CLUNK! It's an incredibly nasty looking high-tech, 
               automatic weapon with gigantic cartridge clip.

               He screws on a long silencer and points the gun at the 
               ceiling. POOF!... a muffled gunshot! Debris fall around him. 
               He looks up. He has blown a HOLE through the roof of the 
               coach.

               He adjusts the Silencer Volume Control, which has a scale 
               from 1 thru 11. He turns it all the way down to "0"... DEAD 
               SILENT. He pulls the trigger. The gun RECOILS, but there is 
               absolutely NO SOUND! He has blown another HOLE in the ceiling.

               INT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY

               Ned looks across the aisle to see a GROSS SLOB pulling all 
               kinds of strange food items from a paper bag, making a big, 
               sloppy, disgusting SANDWICH that squirts and drips all over. 
               Ned turns away... really queasy now.

               INT. LAVATORY - DAY

               Max reaches into the case, pulls out A BLENDER! He plugs it 
               into the outlet and REVS it a couple times, grinning wickedly.

               INT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY

               Max steps out of the lavatory and sees the CONDUCTOR coming 
               his way collecting tickets. He quickly spins around, slides 
               the door open and steps into the vestibule between cars.

               The Conductor can't get past the Old Woman, so he climbs 
               over the top of her trunk, with no thought of helping her.

               INT. VESTIBULE - DAY

               Max looks out the side window, trying to conceal the weapon 
               in front of him. The Conductor enters, sees him.

                                     CONDUCTOR
                         Ticket?

               Without turning, Max holds the ticket up over his shoulder. 
               The Conductor takes it, punches it, notices the gun barrel.

                                     CONDUCTOR
                         Sorry pal... automatic weapons are 
                         only allowed in the club car after 
                         nine p.m.

               Max turns, raising the gun with a nasty GROWL. The Conductor 
               casually snaps a baggage tag to the barrel, taking the gun.

                                     CONDUCTOR
                         I'll check it with baggage. You can 
                         claim it at the depot in Santa 
                         Barbara.

               The Conductor drops the weapon into a big mesh bag... along 
               with a dozen other guns he's collected. He exits. Max whirls 
               around facing the window, eyes filled with rage. Now what?

               INT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY

               A gun barrel slowly protrudes between the seats in front of 
               Frank and Lana. Their eyes widen. Suddenly, a stream of water 
               hits Frank in the face! He sputters. A LITTLE KID named JEFF 
               scrambles into the aisle.

                                     JEFF
                         Hi! I'm Jeff and I'm eight years 
                         old. Didja know if ya put a penny on 
                         the track it'll make the train crash? 
                         No kiddin'! You ever been in a wreck? 
                         My uncle has. Lotsa times. It's really 
                         neat. Everybody gets creamed! All 
                         bloody guts... heads ripped off and 
                         stuff... Hey... wanna hear my song 
                         "Great Green Gobs of Greasy Grimy 
                         Gopher Guts"?

               Lana turns to Frank... inspired. She leans toward Jeff.

                                     LANA
                         You want to earn a couple bucks, 
                         kid?

               ANGLE ON NED

               Jeff bounces into the seat across from Ned.

                                     JEFF
                         Hi! I'm Jeff and I'm eight years 
                         old. Didja know if ya put a penny on 
                         the track it'll make the train crash?

               ANGLE ON FRANK AND LANA

               Lana peers over the seat at Ned. She smiles.

                                     LANA
                         He's losing it. You better get up to 
                         the next car. Remember, give me the 
                         high sign as soon as you see the 
                         river. It'll be two minutes and nine 
                         seconds past the tunnel. I'll take 
                         care of the rest. Anything goes 
                         wrong... just make sure you back me 
                         up.
                              (grabs his collar)
                         And don't let him see you.

               Frank gets up, moves down the aisle slowly, eyes on Ned. He 
               can't squeeze past the Old Woman, who is still struggling to 
               pull her huge trunk down aisle. So... he climbs right over 
               the top of it... oblivious to her.

               Frank stares at Ned warily as he gets closer. Suddenly, Jeff 
               squirts a stream of water in Ned's eyes. Frank sees his 
               chance, rushing past Ned toward the vestibule.

               INT. VESTIBULE - DAY

               Frank races through the vestibule behind Max's back. By the 
               time Max turns to see who's there... Frank is gone.

               INT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY

               Ned wipes the water from his eyes, blinking. He grabs the 
               squirt gun away from Jeff, holding it up angrily.

                                     NED
                         This... is not a toy!

                                     JEFF
                         Yes it is.

               A beat. Ned realizes he's right. Acting tough, he pulls the 
               plug and drains the water out of the gun, then tosses it 
               back to Jeff.

               Without missing a beat, Jeff drops the empty water magazine 
               from the grip and jams a full one in... just like loading a 
               cartridge clip. He smirks, ready for action.

               In the aisle next to them, the Old Woman now pulls her trunk 
               back toward the vestibule. Jeff points the squirt gun at 
               her. Suddenly, she whips around and SQUIRTS HIM in the face 
               with her own squirt gun! He sputters!

               INT. VESTIBULE - DAY

               Max stares out the window, still seething. Behind him, the 
               Old Woman moves into the vestibule, inch by inch, trying to 
               drag her trunk into the first coach car.

               Max turns, sees her struggling and goes to her aid.

                                     MAX
                         Here... let me help you with that.

               He pushes the trunk into the first coach car, then very 
               politely holds the door open for her. She smiles sweetly at 
               him as she shuffles through.

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         What a nice young man. You are so 
                         polite.

                                     MAX
                              (smiles)
                         I try to be.

               INT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY

               Jeff is SINGING to Ned... to the tune of "The Old Gray Mare."

                                     JEFF
                         Great green gobs of greasy, grimy 
                         gopher guts... mutilated monkey 
                         meat... chopped up dirty birdie's 
                         feet... one pint jar of all-purpose 
                         porpoise pus... cooked in a Mulligan 
                         stew.

               Ned turns queasy. The train lurches. He stiffens.

               INT. FIRST COACH CAR - DAY

               The Old Woman has unpacked her huge trunk. She has hung up 
               clothes... set out a vase with flowers... hung up a big framed 
               painting... and turned on a floor lamp. She pulls out a set 
               of dumbbells, pumps them a couple times... and drops them on 
               the floor with a loud CLUNK!

               Frank watches her from his seat across the aisle with a blank 
               expression... only his eyes moving.

               The Conductor punches the Old Woman's ticket, then holds out 
               his hand, waiting. She pulls out a Smith & Wesson .44 
               Magnum... drops it in his bag. He waits. She pulls out an 
               Uzi.

               EXT. THE TRACKS AHEAD - MOVING SHOT - DAY

               Up ahead, we see a tunnel approaching.

               OMIT

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               INT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY

                                     JEFF
                              (still singing)
                         French fried eyeballs and ugly scabs 
                         you wanna pick... stuff to make your 
                         mother sick... dog poop on a stick... 
                         puke and snot all mixed together in 
                         a pot...

               Ned is looking very pale and queasy. Suddenly, Jeff jumps 
               up... presses his face against the window.

                                     JEFF
                         Oh boy! Here comes the tunnel!

               Ned can't take it anymore. He gets up, pale and sweating.

               EXT. TRACKS AHEAD - MOVING SHOT - DAY

               ...racing toward the tunnel!

               INT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY

               Lana sees Ned stumble shakily into the aisle, moving toward 
               the vestibule.

                                     LANA
                         Way to go, Ned. Right on time.

               The train enters the TUNNEL. Everything goes PITCH BLACK. A 
               few beats, then... LIGHT fills the car again as they emerge 
               from the tunnel. Lana looks. Ned is gone! She heads down the 
               aisle.

               INT. FIRST COACH CAR - DAY

               The Conductor is still tagging weapons as the Old Woman comes 
               up with a Ruger Mini 14 machine gun, a Mauser C96 automatic 
               handgun, a sawed-off double-barreled .12 gauge shotgun... 
               and an old wooden slingshot.

               INT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY

               Lana looks through the small window into the vestibule and 
               catches a glimpse of a gray suit. She ducks back, leaning 
               against the lavatory door.

               INT. LAVATORY - THE MIRROR - DAY

               Ned's dripping face rises up from the sink into view. He 
               splashes more water on, trying to overcome his queasiness.

               INT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY

               Lana reaches into her purse, pulls out a gun. She looks 
               through the vestibule windows into the first coach car, her 
               eyes searching for Frank.

               INT. FIRST COACH CAR - LANA'S POV - DAY

               Frank pokes his head out into the aisle, looking toward Lana. 
               He waves at her.

               INT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY

               Lana ducks back, pressing herself against the lavatory door... 
               gripping the gun, tense.

               INT. LAVATORY - DAY

               Ned starts to open the door, then stops. He notices the violin 
               case. Opens it. A couple of bullets roll around inside. Then, 
               he sees the blender... puzzled.

               INT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY

               Lana leans forward, looking through the vestibule windows, 
               watching desperately for Frank's signal.

               INT. FIRST COACH CAR - DAY

               Frank looks out the window and sees...

               EXT. THE RIVER - FRANK'S POV

               It looms ahead.

               INT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY

               Lana sees Frank's frantic signal. She raises the gun, pulls 
               the hammer back and steps quickly into...

               INT. THE VESTIBULE - DAY

               Max hears someone enter. He stiffens...

               INT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY

               Ned steps out of the lavatory.

               INT. VESTIBULE - DAY

               Lana FIRES!... blowing a hole right through Max and the window 
               behind him! She keeps firing! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! 
               BLAM! More bullets than the gun could ever possibly hold!

               INT. SECOND COACH CAR - DAY

               Ned hears the GUNSHOTS and whirls around, looking into the 
               vestibule through the glass window, just as...

               INT. VESTIBLE - DAY

               ...Max turns to face Lana, filled with bloody bullet holes.

                                     MAX
                         You shootin' at me?

               Shocked to see it's Max, Lana empties the rest of the bullets 
               into him... BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! Max is SLAMMED back into 
               the vestibule door by the impact!

                                     MAX
                         Yeah... you're definitely shootin' 
                         at me.

               She fires one last shot... BLAM!!!

               EXT. TRAIN ON BRIDGE - DAY

               Max flies out the door, executing a perfect "full gainer 
               with a triple twist and a half-tuck"... a flawless Olympic 
               style dive... ending with a dead body "belly flop" into the 
               water!

               INT. FIRST COACH CAR - DAY

               Frank sees Max hit the river and lets out a loud "WHOOP!" 
               The Old Woman shoots him a nasty look. He stifles himself.

               INT. VESTIBULE - DAY

               Ned slides the vestibule door open... steps toward Lana. In 
               a daze, she raises the gun, points it at him, pulling the 
               trigger... CLICK... CLICK... CLICK. He takes the gun from 
               her gently.

               INT. FIRST COACH CAR - DAY

               Frank jumps up, rushing forward. He skids to a stop... seeing 
               Ned through the glass! Shocked, he ducks back.

                                     NED
                         Jeez... they're really throwing some 
                         tough questions out there today.

                                     LAURA
                         They're just doing their job.

                                     NED
                         Yeah... well I call it a "high-tech 
                         lynching of an uppity white 
                         housewife."

               INT. CAVERNOUS ROOM - DAY

               It's huge, dark and shadowy. More than a dozen heavily armed 
               POLICE OFFICERS stand guard all around the perimeter. In the 
               center is a cell constructed of iron bars, like an animal 
               cage. Ned and Laura enter. Arch steps over.

                                     NED
                              (seeing the cage)
                         What's this?

                                     ARCH
                         Only cell available. They had that 
                         serial killer locked up here... you 
                         know, the one who talks his victims 
                         to death then eats them... Hannibal 
                         the Lecturer. But they let him out 
                         for a three week tour to publicize 
                         his new book.

               Arch hands him a hardbound book.

                                     NED
                              (reading the cover)
                         "To Serve Man."

                                     ARCH
                         It's a cookbook.

               Ned flips it over.

               ANGLE - THE BOOK - NED'S POV

               On the back is a picture of HANNIBAL THE LECTURER... wearing 
               a baseball catcher's mask with barbed wire over the mouth.

               BACK TO SCENE

                                     ARCH
                         And look, look... he autographed it.

               Arch pulls the front cover of the book open, pointing.

                                     NED
                              (reads it)
                         To Arch... Love to have you for dinner 
                         sometime... Hannibal.
                              (hands it back)
                         Very nice.

               Arch points toward the cage.

                                     ARCH
                         They're waiting for ya. They didn't 
                         want to start without her attorney 
                         being present.

               CLOSE ON LANA - CANTED ANGLE

               There's a BIG MOTH on her mouth. The CAMERA PULLS BACK SLOWLY. 
               A beat... she spits the moth off, irritated.

                                     LANA
                         PFFFTT! Damn moths! This place could 
                         use a good exterminator.

               Three POLICE INVESTIGATORS sit opposite Lana at a long table. 
               Moths flutter everywhere.

                                     INVESTIGATOR # 2
                              (to Police Guard)
                         Let's get the SWAT Team in here.

               Ned, Laura and Arch enter the cage as the Guard exits.

                                     LANA
                         Can't you get me out of this cage, 
                         Ned? I'm goin' buggy in here.

                                     NED
                         Judge said no bail. Don't worry. 
                         Just tell the truth, you'll be fine.

               He turns to the Investigators.

                                     NED
                         Who's gonna handle the interrogation?

                                     INVESTIGATOR 1
                         It's your collar... your bust... 
                         your call... your show... your play... 
                         your move... your wife...

                                     NED
                         Okay, okay!... I'll handle it.

               Laura sits at the far end of the table and opens her notebook. 
               Lana pulls out her mirrored compact, starts to apply lipstick.

                                     INVESTIGATOR 2
                         Sorry Mrs. Ravine... there's no makeup 
                         allowed in this building.

               He nods toward a warning sign: a circle around a LIPSTICK 
               with a diagonal line thru it. She responds, cool, confident.

                                     LANA
                         What're you gonna do... arrest me 
                         for primping?

               In the b.g., members of the SWAT Team desperately swat at 
               the fluttering moths.

               Ned spins his chair around, plants one foot on it, leans on 
               his knee, looking hard at Lana.

                                     NED
                         Don't give us a tough time. Just 
                         spill it! What were you doing on 
                         that train?

                                     LANA
                         Well...

               Ned raises his hand, sits down, leans close, changing his 
               tone.

                                     NED
                              (confidential)
                         As your attorney, I must advise you... 
                         you don't have to answer that 
                         question.

               Ned stands, paces, agitated... plants his foot on the chair 
               again. He leans toward her... getting tough again.

                                     NED
                         Alright, quit playing games with us!
                              (fires questions)
                         Who put ya up to it? Where'd you get 
                         the gun? What's your link with the 
                         CIA?

                                     LANA
                         I...

               Ned jumps in, motioning with his hands for this to stop.

                                     NED
                         Whoa whoa whoa whoa! That's it! I 
                         will not tolerate this unwarranted 
                         badgering of my client. She'll have 
                         her day in court, gentlemen.

               He slams his briefcase shut and turns to Lana, sincere.

                                     NED
                         I want to thank you, Mrs. Ravine, 
                         for being so cooperative with these 
                         gentlemen.
                              (turns to Laura)
                         Did you get all that down, Laura. 
                         Every word she said?

                                     LAURA
                         Yep. Both of 'em.

               EXT. NED'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY

               The CAMERA MOVES IN to a wire mesh cage at the very back of 
               the yard. A small sign on it says: NED JUNIOR. The door is 
               open. The cage is... empty!

               EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - DAY

               Lola rides the roller coaster with Lana's pet Skunk. She 
               LAUGHS maniacally as they plunge down a steep grade!

               The Skunk stands stiffly on her lap, his paws planted on the 
               guard rail, eyes bulging out!... his fur standing straight 
               up!

               INT. NED'S HOUSE - DAY

               Ned hesitates at the front door. It's open a crack. He moves 
               inside cautiously. There is a strange BUBBLING SOUND coming 
               from the kitchen. He moves toward it... apprehensive.

               He enters the kitchen and SEES... a huge bubbling pot on the 
               stove, foam spilling over from under the lid! His mind reels! 
               He charges out the back door.

               EXT. BACK OF HOUSE - DAY

               Ned bursts out the back door... CAMERA TRACKING with his 
               feet as he dashes across the huge back yard... MUSIC POUNDING!

               He SEES the EMPTY animal cage! The door is open. A fuzzy 
               blanket hangs halfway out.

               Shocked, Ned spins around... running back toward the house... 
               CAMERA TRACKING HIS FEET, struggling to keep up. The CAMERA 
               SLAMS into a tree!... CRACKING the LENS!

               INT. NED'S HOUSE - THE KITCHEN - DAY

               Ned bursts in... SEES the bubbling pot!... a huge butcher 
               knife on the counter!... and LOLA, arms outstretched to greet 
               him.

                                     NED
                         NO!

                                     LOLA
                         Yes.

                                     NED
                         NOOOOO!

                                     LOLA
                         Yes!

                                     NED
                         NOOOOOOOooooooo!!!

               She whips the cover off the bubbling pot.

                                     LOLA
                         YES! Cappelini pomodoro!

                                     NED
                         What?

               She lifts up pasta with a spaghetti spoon... tossing a sprig 
               of basil into the pot from the basil-leaf crown she wears.

                                     LOLA
                         Pasta with tomato sauce. Whatsa matta? 
                         You don't like Italian?

                                     NED
                         Where's Ned Junior? WHERE IS HE?!

                                     LOLA
                         I thought he might like to get out, 
                         so I took him to the amusement park.

               He grabs Lola's arm and drags her toward the front door.

                                     NED
                         You can't just break into my house, 
                         cook my food... borrow my skunk!
                              (opens the door)
                         Leave me alone. Stay out of my face! 
                         Out of my neighborhood! Out of my 
                         LIFE!

               She steps outside... turns to him.

                                     LOLA
                         You haven't seen the last of me, 
                         Ned.

               He SLAMS the door in her face... hesitates a beat, curious... 
               then pulls the door open. Lola's still there.

                                     LOLA
                         I told you.

               Ned SLAMS the door again.

               EXT. COURTHOUSE STEPS - DAY

               It's a media circus! Vendors sell "TRIAL BALLOON" balloons.

               PRESS PHOTOGRAPHERS cluster around a squad of CHEERLEADERS 
               wearing sweaters emblazoned with "FREE LANA OR BUST!" across 
               their chests.

               They perform a rousing CHEER in front of a sign on the 
               building that reads... "LE COURTHOUSE".

                                     CHEERLEADERS

               A BBC COMMENTATOR speaks to a TV camera.

                                     COMMENTATOR
                         Once again, Americans are making a 
                         mockery of their courts, turning a 
                         murder trial into a media circus! 
                         How can justice ever prevail when it 
                         is ridiculed and reviled in such a 
                         heinously revolting manner? This is 
                         Clement Von Franckenstein returning 
                         you to our BBC studios in London for 
                         the latest photographs of Lady Di 
                         naked in the bath.

               Ned and Laura push their way through the crush of REPORTERS.

               INT. COURTROOM - DAY

               Spectators pour through several turnstiles, shoving in their 
               tokens. TV cameras have been set up to broadcast the trial.

               A UNIFORMED THEATER USHER escorts JURY MEMBERS in, checks 
               their tickets, hands them programs and directs them to their 
               seats.

               Ned and Laura sit at the defense table, next to Lana... who 
               is oblivious to everything, deeply engrossed in a pocket 
               video game. Ned looks toward the gallery and does a disturbed 
               take.

               It's Lola!... sitting in the back row wearing a tailored 
               suit, large brimmed hat with dark veil... and a SKUNK SKIN 
               STOLE draped around her shoulders!

               Dizzy sits next to her, playing softly on a MUTED SAX.

                         Los Angeles is now in session. And 
                         here he is... direct from a triumphant 
                         one-week engagement in Las Vegas 
                         Circuit Court... the honorable... 
                         the venerable... the totally 
                         irrepressible... Judge Harlan Skan-
                         kyyyyyyy!

               Flashing "APPLAUSE" signs and flashing "ALL RISE" audience 
               prompters. Everyone gives the Judge a standing ovation.

                         Wow... has this defense team been 
                         HOT! Thirty-seven straight victories 
                         this year! Let's go down for the 
                         coin toss.

               ANGLE - COURTROOM

               The Bailiff flips a coin, motions to the PROSECUTOR.

                                     SPORTSCASTER (V.O.)
                         The Prosecution wins the flip of the 
                         coin and elects to kick things off.

               INT. COURTROOM - LATER

               The PROSECUTOR delivers her impassioned opening statement.

                                     PROSECUTOR
                         ...the prosecution will prove that 
                         this repulsive and degenerate woman 
                         coldly murdered a decent, law-abiding 
                         citizen...

                                     NED
                              (jumps up)
                         Objection! Move to strike. Hearsay, 
                         irrelevant, stupid, idiotic, caca-
                         doody poo-poo...

                                     JUDGE SKANKY
                         Sustained.

               INT. COURTROOM - LATER

               Laura is on the stand. Ned hands her a sheet of paper.

                                     NED
                         And can you tell us what this is?

                                     LAURA
                         Yes. It's a death threat that Max 
                         Shady FAXED to you on the day he was 
                         released from prison.

               Ned snatches it back, pacing, folding it into a paper 
               airplane.

                                     NED
                         A FAX in which he threatened to puree 
                         certain parts of my anatomy in a 
                         blender! I'd like to submit this 
                         into evidence.

                                     PROSECUTOR
                              (jumps up)
                         Objection! Who cares about the FAX 
                         in this case?

                                     JUDGE SKANKY
                         I'll allow it.

               Ned sails the paper plane toward the COURT CLERK, who is at 
               an evidence table already piled high with tagged guns, 
               appliances, knickknacks, auto parts and other junk.

               The plane sails toward an open window. The Clerk grabs it... 
               going OUT the window with the plane!

               EXT. COURTHOUSE LAWN - DAY

               The Cheerleaders lead the SPECTATORS in an exuberant CHEER.

                                     CHEERLEADERS
                         U-G-L-Y! You ain't got no alibi! 
                         You're ugly! Yeah, you're ugly! M-A-
                         M-A! How you think you got that way? 
                         Your Mama! Yeah, your Mama!

               In the b.g., the Court Clerk plummets to the ground, then 
               staggers to his feet, and stumbles... dazed... back toward 
               the courthouse.

               INT. COURTROOM - LATER

               One of the JURORS watches a "DICK VAN DYKE" re-run on a small 
               portable TV monitors, oblivious to the testimony. In the 
               b.g., the battered Clerk stumbles back in with the paper 
               plane. The Conductor is on the stand. Ned holds up a BLENDER.

                                     NED
                         And is this the blender you found in 
                         the lavatory of the train?

                                     CONDUCTOR
                         Yes... it is.

                                     NED
                         I'd like this marked as evidence.

               The Bailiff reaches out, Ned waves him off... instead, tossing 
               the blender over several heads to the Court Clerk... who 
               runs to catch it, CRASHING into the wall. The blender falls, 
               SHATTERS.

                         Awwwww... a bad call by Ravine. Let's 
                         check out the re-play.

               On the RE-PLAY SCREEN we see the action repeated in SLOW 
               MOTION as the Sportscaster draws lines, circles, x's and 
               squiggles.

                                     SPORTSCASTER
                         Look at THAT! The Bailiff is wide 
                         open! But instead of handing it off, 
                         Ravine goes for the long bomb. Ohhhh! 
                         The pass is wide! A real wobbler! 
                         There's no way! He scrambles, but he 
                         just can't get his hands on it... 
                         And RIGHT THERE!...
                              (freezes the frame)
                         ...WHAM! That blender is gone!

               INT. COURTROOM - LATER

               At the defense table, Laura glances over at Lana, who is 
               casually browsing through a copy of GALS & GUNS magazine. 
               Laura reacts, then, trying to be as diplomatic as possible...

                                     LAURA
                         Ned... did you ever consider that 
                         maybe you don't know women as well 
                         as you think you do?

                                     PROSECUTOR (O.S.)
                         Now would you tell the court, in 
                         your own words, what you said to Mr. 
                         Ravine?

               They both look toward the witness stand. Ned is shaken.

                                     NED
                              (whispers)
                         I'm really worried about this guy. 
                         He could blow our whole case right 
                         out of the water.

               ANGLE - WITNESS STAND - MOMENTS LATER

               Jeff, the little boy from the train is on the witness stand. 
               The Prosecutor stands by, listening as...

                              (singing)

                         gopher guts... and me without a spoon!

               The JURORS turn pale and reach for the air sickness bags in 
               front of them. The Courtroom erupts. The Judge pounds his 
               gavel LOUDLY.

                                     JEFF
                              (pointing at Lana)
                         That lady paid me two bucks to sing 
                         it to him...!

               But NO ONE hears this in all the confusion. The Judge, also 
               looking ill now, bangs his gavel again.

                                     JUDGE SKANKY
                         Recess! Ten minutes!

               the swings, teeter-totters, monkey bars... having a blast! 
               Ned and the Prosecutor play "dodge-ball." Laura cheers Ned 
               on. The Prosecutor rockets the ball at Ned... and just misses!

                         No way! Uh-uh! Missed by a mile!

               The BAILIFF steps into CLOSE UP, blowing a whistle loudly!

                         Helen Shady... is gonna take the 
                         stand! This will be the first 
                         defensive play of the afternoon.

               INT. COURTROOM - SAME TIME

               Mrs. Shady is on the stand. Ned paces.

                                     NED
                         Mrs. Shady... would you tell us about 
                         your son, Max. Was he a... a good 
                         boy?

                                     MRS. SHADY
                         He was the best. And that's not just 
                         a mother talking. You can ask anybody.

                                     NED
                         But he got into trouble once in 
                         awhile... like all kids do?

                                     MRS. SHADY
                         Well, you know, pranks. Little jokes 
                         and things. But he was so cute. I 
                         have pictures!

               She reaches down into her huge purse, pulling out a photo 
               album. She opens it, showing Ned.

                                     MRS. SHADY
                         Here. This is when he set the cat on 
                         fire...
                              (then, assuring him)
                         Oh... but the cat deserved it.

                                     NED
                              (looks, points)
                         And what, uh... what are these...?

                                     MRS. SHADY
                         Marshmallows. He just loved to toast 
                         marshmallows over a roaring cat. 
                         Burned on the outside... all soft in 
                         the middle.
                              (turns page)
                         And right here... this was taken on 
                         the day he left the priesthood to 
                         join the Green Berets.

               They rise slowly out of their seats, craning their necks, 
               trying to see the photos.

               BACK TO SCENE

               Ned is now seated next to Mrs. Shady in the witness box, 
               looking at the photo album with her. Judge Skanky peers over 
               the side of the bench.

                                     NED
                         This is cute.

                              (laughs, delighted)
                         Oh yes! That was during his Ku Klux 
                         Klan phase. He would take the sheets 
                         right off my bed... cut those little 
                         holes in them. What a stitch he was!

               ANGLE - THE SPECTATORS

               are now on their feet, all straining to catch a glimpse of 
               the photos in the album.

                                     NED
                         And is this Max... with all the 
                         tools... fixing his bike?

               She snatches the photo out of the album.

                                     MRS. SHADY
                         Why that shouldn't even be in there! 
                         It's his rotten little half-brother.
                              (rips up photo)
                         Stinkin' little pecker... he never 
                         was any good...

               The Sportscaster is pushing his face against the broadcast 
               booth glass, trying to see what everyone's looking at.

                                     MRS. SHADY
                              (points at another)
                         Oh! I didn't like these neo-Nazi 
                         boys. They were all so fussy and 
                         persnickety about everything. Heil 
                         this and heil that.

                         Oh look... here's Max with his 
                         chainsaw. He loved to go to the 
                         national park and cut down those 
                         giant old trees. It made him feel so 
                         patriotic. You know, if he hadn't 
                         been such a successful criminal... I 
                         think he would have been a lumberjack.

               The Court Clerk, Bailiff and Court Recorder have all moved 
               around behind the witness stand, peering over Mrs. Shady's 
               shoulder at the photos.

                                     MRS. SHADY
                              (tearful, angry)
                         But now he'll never be anything! Not 
                         since...
                              (stands up, points)
                         ...that woman, your wife, pulled the 
                         trigger and put my little Max in his 
                         grave!

                                     JUDGE SKANKY
                         Mrs. Shady! Do not POINT your finger 
                         in my courtroom. It's discourteous, 
                         impolite and disrespectful.

                                     MRS. SHADY
                         Don't you tell me what to do with my 
                         finger! It's been more places than 
                         you've ever dreamed of!

                                     JUDGE SKANKY
                              (bangs gavel)
                         Sit down!

                                     MRS. SHADY
                         I'll point my finger wherever I want!

               Mrs. Shady goes berserk... leaping from the witness stand, 
               pointing several different fingers at Judge Skanky.

               The Bailiff attempts to restrain her, but she breaks free... 
               scurrying around the courtroom, pointing fingers at everyone!

               CHAOS prevails!

               INT. COURTROOM - LATER

               The Irritable Man from the train is on the stand... Max's 
               huge cigar stuck in his ear! The hair around his ear is 
               scorched.

                                     NED
                         Did you encounter the victim... Max 
                         Shady... on board the train?

                                     IRRITABLE MAN
                         Yeah. And I told him... "this is the 
                         NO SMOKING car! Would you please put 
                         out your damn cigar!"

                                     NED
                         And is that the cigar in your ear?

               The Man strains to see the cigar out of the corner of his 
               eye. Impatient, Ned finally holds up a small pocket mirror.

                                     IRRITABLE MAN
                         I believe it is.

                                     NED
                         I'd like the cigar and the head of 
                         this witness entered into evidence.

               The Bailiff picks up the Irritable Man and dumps him on the 
               evidence table, where he is tagged by the Court Clerk.

                                     NED
                         The defense calls... Lana Ravine!

               INT. COURTROOM - LATER

               Lana is on the stand. The Bailiff swears her in.

                                     BAILIFF
                         Do you swear to tell the truth, the 
                         whole truth and nothing but the truth 
                         so help you God?

                                     LANA
                              (looks to Judge)
                         Do I have to answer that, Harlan?

                                     JUDGE SKANKY
                         No, no dear. I'll vouch for her.

               Ned approaches.

                                     NED
                         Now, Mrs. Ravine... may I call you 
                         Lana?

                                     LANA
                         No. Call me Angel Tits.

                                     PROSECUTOR
                         I object!

                                     JUDGE SKANKY
                         Sustained. Counselor... you will 
                         address Angel Tits as Mrs. Ravine.

                                     NED
                              (after a beat)
                         Mrs. Ravine... would you please tell 
                         the court... what were you doing on 
                         that train?

                                     LANA
                         I saw Max Shady at the station... 
                         saw him get on board. I knew he'd 
                         made threats to kill you and mutilate 
                         your reproductive organs...

               Ned and EVERY MALE in the courtroom winces at this, doubling 
               over in imagined agony. Lana pauses, then continues...

                                     LANA
                         ...so I got on the train too... so I 
                         could warn you.

                                     NED
                         Do you want to have children?

                                     LANA
                         Someday. With the right man.

                                     NED
                         But you couldn't have children if 
                         my...
                              (makes a gesture)
                         ...were...
                              (another gesture)
                         ...and, uh...

                                     LANA
                         It would be difficult.

                                     NED
                         So you followed him, knowing you had 
                         to protect me... your husband... 
                         your best friend... the man you 
                         love... the future father of your 
                         children.

                                     LANA
                         Something like that.

                                     NED
                         And when you saw that maniac standing 
                         in the vestibule, waiting to pulverize 
                         my pee-pee... you pulled the gun and 
                         fired and fired and FIRED!

                                     LANA
                         And fired and fired and fired and 
                         fired and fired and fired and fired...

               She pauses to count off on her fingers, then...

                                     LANA
                         ...and fired and fired and fired.

                                     NED
                         The defense rests, your Honor.

               INT. COURTROOM - LATER

               The COURTROOM ARTIST has been sketching intensely throughout 
               the trial. We finally see... he's been sketching a BOWL OF 
               FRUIT on the Court Recorder's desk. Ned picks up some fruit 
               from the bowl and approaches the defense table.

                                     NED
                         How can you convict a courageous 
                         woman who risked everything to save 
                         the life of her beloved husband? A 
                         woman who acted boldly to stop a 
                         demented maniac from doing THIS!...

               Ned shoves the BANANA and two PLUMS into a demonstration 
               blender on the defense table. He hits the puree button and 
               the blender WHIRRS loudly!

                                     NED
                              (shouts over)
                         ...pulverizing the private parts of 
                         the man she loves!

               All MALES in the courtroom react with pained expressions, 
               cringing and doubling-over. Ned turns the blender off.

                                     NED
                              (directly to Jury)
                         Lana Ravine is a loving wife and the 
                         potential mother of my potential 
                         child. I challenge YOU to strike a 
                         blow for motherhood and the American 
                         justice system! Put the "con" back 
                         in the Constitution. Put the "ju" 
                         back in jurisprudence. Put the "can" 
                         back in American. And put the "dom" 
                         back in freedom. Find this woman 
                         INNOCENT!... so we can all go to bed 
                         happy tonight!

               INT. PRESS ROOM - LATER

               A REPORTER opens the door marked PRESS ROOM. Inside, a DOZEN 
               REPORTERS press their pants on a dozen ironing boards.

                                     REPORTER
                         The jury's back!

               The Reporters scramble for the door, pulling their pants on!

               INT. COURTROOM - LATER

               The CAMERA FOLLOWS a folded piece of paper as the Jurors 
               pass it along to the FOREMAN... who hands it to the Bailiff... 
               who hands it to the Judge. He unfolds it, reads it... then 
               winks flirtatiously at the FEMALE JUROR who wrote it. She 
               blushes.

                                     JUDGE SKANKY
                              (back to business)
                         So... has the jury reached a verdict?

                                     JURY FOREMAN
                              (stands up)
                         Yes we have, your Honor.

                                     JUDGE SKANKY
                         How do you find the defendant... on 
                         the count of manslaughter?

                                     JURY FOREMAN
                         Not guilty.

                                     JUDGE SKANKY
                         On the count of murder in the first 
                         degree?

                                     JURY FOREMAN
                         Not guilty.

                                     JUDGE SKANKY
                         On the Count of Monte Cristo?

                                     JURY FOREMAN
                         Not guilty.

               A BOISTEROUS CLAMOR in the court. The electronic signs FLASH 
               "NOT GUILTY!"... "NOT GUILTY!"... "NOT GUILTY!"

                                     JUDGE SKANKY
                         Good. Then on the count of three, 
                         let's all get the hell out of here! 
                         One... two...

               The Jury and Spectators start to rise. The Judge hesitates, 
               gavel poised, shooting them a warning look.

                                     JUDGE SKANKY
                         Wait... for... it...

               Everyone FREEZES halfway out of their seats... waiting.

                                     JUDGE SKANKY
                         Two and a half... THREE!

               He smacks his gavel. Everyone scatters for the doors, but 
               Judge Skanky beats them out of the room.

               Lana turns cool, dropping her courtroom facade. She plucks 
               off her earrings, unbuttons the neck of her dress, reaches 
               in and magically pulls out her bra, tossing it away.

                                     LANA
                         Well, counselor, looks like you won 
                         another case. Lucky for me.

               TWO LEGAL AIDES sneak up behind Ned and dump a big plastic 
               barrel of Gatorade cans over his head!

                              (over P. A. system)
                         Attention courtroom shoppers! All 
                         trial evidence now on sale. Forty to 
                         sixty percent off all exhibits! 
                         Everything must go!

               They turn to SEE: Spectators and Jurors browse through the 
               clutter of junk in front of the Court Clerk on the evidence 
               table. An IRRITABLE WOMAN claims the Irritable Man, grabbing 
               the cigar from his ear and throwing it down.

                                     IRRITABLE WOMAN
                         I told you, Bernard... smoking cigars 
                         is bad for your hearing!

               She pulls him away as Lana steps up, with a cigarette dangling 
               from her lips. Lana picks up her gun and spins the cylinder. 
               It's loaded. The battered Court Clerk limps over, smiling.

                                     COURT CLERK
                         Mrs. Ravine! What can I do for ya?

                                     LANA
                         How much for my gun?

               Laura sees this... turns to Ned with a look of shock.

                                     LAURA
                         I don't believe it! She just bought 
                         her gun back! The gun she used to 
                         kill a man!

               Ned looks off toward Lana with admiration.

                                     NED
                         Yeah... the same gun that saved my 
                         life. I'm sure it has sentimental 
                         value.

               As Lana wades into the crowd of REPORTERS, some still without 
               pants, the CAMERA MOVES TO Lola, who is watching Lana from 
               the back of the courtroom.

               Lola pulls a small cord hanging from the side of her hat... 
               opening her veil like window drapes. She's not happy.

               INT. FRANK'S GARAGE - DAY

               Frank lays on a mechanic's "creeper", working under a car. 
               Lana steps between his feet. He hears her and rolls out, his 
               crotch sliding to a stop against her legs. He looks up, 
               covered with black grease.

                                     FRANK
                         So... you did it. Ya beat the rap.

                                     LANA
                         No thanks to you.

               He gets to his feet, cocky.

                                     FRANK
                         Hey... I knew he'd spring ya.

               She walks toward him, her voice cold, accusing. He backs up.

                                     LANA
                         You didn't lift a finger, Frank. You 
                         let me take all the heat.

                                     FRANK
                         Heeeee-eeey... what could I do?

               Lana pulls the gun from her purse, pointing it at him.

                                     LANA
                         You were gonna let me rot in the 
                         slammer... never say a thing.

                                     FRANK
                         Look... you're out... free. Now we're 
                         together. That's what counts. We can 
                         try again! Forget triple indemnity. 
                         We'll whack him and split three mil.

                                     LANA
                         I'm not splitting anything, Frank.
                              (cocks the gun)
                         And you know too much.

                                     FRANK
                              (arrogant)
                         Come on, Lana. You're not gonna shoot 
                         me.

               He brashly turns his back to her, putting some tools away. 
               She sees a huge electric powered SCREWDRIVER on the workbench 
               next to her, smiling diabolically. She lowers the gun.

                                     LANA
                         You're right.
                              (then, seductive)
                         Maybe I'll just screw you to death.

               He laughs arrogantly... starts to unbutton his shirt.

                                     FRANK
                         Now you're talkin' baby.

               EXT. THE GARAGE WINDOW - DAY

               We see Lana's SILHOUETTE on the window as she raises the big 
               power screwdriver and turns it on. WHIRR-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R-R!

               The CAMERA WHIPS AROUND and PUSHES IN TO...

               LOLA

               watching the murder from her car. There is a... FLASH! Then 
               another! And another! We are...

               INT. THE GARAGE - LATER

               A POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER takes FLASH pictures of the crime scene. 
               The CORONER, COPS, FORENSIC MEN... all do their thing. Ned 
               and Arch amble in, looking around. Arch is eating Nachos.

                                     FORENSIC MAN
                         Watch your step, guys. There's a lot 
                         of blood.

               Throughout this scene, in the b.g., the milling COPS and 
               INVESTIGATORS slip on all the blood, as if on slick ice, and 
               fall out of frame, their arms and legs flailing helplessly!

               One of the Coroner's INVESTIGATORS approaches Arch and Ned.

                                     INVESTIGATOR
                         Looks like a suicide. We found a 
                         note.

               He holds up a rolled piece of paper with a pair of tweezers. 
               Ned takes it, trying to unroll it.

                                     INVESTIGATOR
                         It was stuck up his nose.

               Ned hands it off to Arch, who casually unrolls it. The 
               Investigator slips, arms waving, and falls out of frame.

                                     ARCH
                              (reading it)
                         "I can't take it anymore. I'm a 
                         mediocre mechanic... and a lousy 
                         lover."

                                     NED
                         He's sure got that right.

               Arch gives Ned a very strange look. Ned feels his stare.

                                     NED
                         The "mechanic" part, I mean.

               In the b.g., various COPS pair up to have their pictures 
               taken by the Police Crime Scene Photographer... posing, 
               grinning.

                                     NED
                              (stares at the body)
                         I don't know why, Arch, but I just 
                         can't shake this crazy hunch it wasn't 
                         suicide.

               THE CAMERA MOVES

               behind Ned on his line, revealing Frank... pinned to the 
               wall by the power screwdriver stuck in his back! It's still 
               running... vibrating with a GRINDING HUM.

               Ned reaches out and turns the screwdriver OFF.

               INT. NED'S HOUSE - DAY

               Ned enters, pausing. He hears VOICES. He goes to the living 
               room. Lana and Lola turn to see him in the doorway. He is 
               shocked. Lana looks shaken. But Lola is cool... in control.

                                     LANA
                         Oh... uh, Ned... This is Lola, um...

                                     NED
                              (nervous, defensive)
                         Um? She told you her name was Um? 
                         And what other lies did she tell 
                         you? I've never seen this woman in 
                         my life! Never followed her home! 
                         Never had sex with her in the 
                         refrigerator! It's all a sick 
                         fantasy... and I deny everything!

               He turns to Lola.

                                     NED
                         When will women like you learn, you 
                         can't tear apart a perfectly good 
                         marriage with your vicious lies... 
                         Miss UMMMM!

                                     LOLA
                         Actually... it's Smith. Lola Smith. 
                         I sell vacuum cleaners, Mr. Ravine. 
                         The big powerful kind that suck up 
                         everything in sight. I was just 
                         telling your wife, if she wants to 
                         get rid of all her dirt, she has to 
                         be willing to pay the price.

               She turns to Lana with a cold and contemptuous glare.

                                     LOLA
                         Let me know what you decide, Mrs. 
                         Ravine. I'm sure we can work out a 
                         convenient "payment" plan. A pleasure 
                         meeting you... Ned.

               Lola exits. As soon as the door closes, Lana whirls around 
               in a fury!... SMASHING a lamp! She SHRIEKS furiously!

                                     LANA
                         I... hate... SALESMEN!

               He puts his arms around her, comforting.

                                     NED
                         I know it's been a tough ordeal... 
                         with the trial and everything. Tell 
                         you what... let's take a trip.

                                     LANA
                         A trip?

                                     NED
                         Yeah. Just the two of us.

                                     LANA
                              (darkly inspired)
                         I like that. Just you and me... all 
                         alone. I'll start packing.

                                     NED
                         Great. Listen... I got something to 
                         take care of. I'll be back in awhile.

               He kisses her and exits. Lana turns to look up toward the 
               landing, a vengefully insane smile clouding her face.

               INT. LOLA'S HOUSE - DUSK

               A demanding KNOCK at the door. Lola hesitates at the door.

                                     LOLA
                         Who is it?

               The door CRASHES OPEN! Ned is silhouetted in the doorway. He 
               looks really pissed! Lola turns and runs. Ned sprints after 
               her, leaping through the air... bringing her down with a 
               tackle!

                                     NED
                         I just want to talk.

                                     LOLA
                         Why didn't you say so?

               Her foot shoots out, smashing him right in the face... WHAM! 
               She jumps up and scrambles away. Ned pursues her. She grabs 
               a bottle of scotch from the counter, spins around.

                                     LOLA
                         Would you like a drink?

               She throws the bottle! He ducks and it shatters on the wall!

                                     NED
                         No thanks. I'm driving.

               She whirls on one foot, nailing him in the head with a FLYING 
               SPIN KICK! He stumbles back, dazed. She grabs an ice pick.

                                     LOLA
                         Then let's get to the point!

               Lola charges! Ned rolls onto his back, jamming both feet 
               into her stomach, heaving her up over him... thru the air! 
               She SLAMS into the wall!... then slowly turns... still cool 
               and collected. She raises a cigarette... lights it with the 
               ice pick "lighter."

                                     LOLA
                         So what's your problem, tough guy?

                                     NED
                         Stay away from my life, my wife, my 
                         home and my pets! I'm taking Lana on 
                         a vacation and when I come back, I 
                         don't ever want to see your face 
                         again!

               He shoves her against the wall... the cigarette flying away.

                                     LOLA
                              (shocked)
                         A VACATION! She doesn't deserve a 
                         VACATION! She's a brat! A bad girl! 
                         She always was and always will be!

               He grabs her by the shoulders, shaking her.

                                     NED
                         What are you talking about? You don't 
                         know anything about Lana?

                         you? TELL ME!

               She clams up. He slaps her.

                                     NED
                         Who is she!

                                     LOLA
                         She's your wife!

                              (slaps her again!)
                         Who is she!?

                              (slaps her again)
                         Liar! Who is she?

                                     LOLA
                         She's your wife!

               He raises his hand to slap her hard.

                                     NED
                         WHO IS SHE!

               She SLAPS him!

                                     LOLA
                         She's my sister!

               She continues to slap him... back and forth... repeating her 
               answers... "She's your wife"... "She's my sister!"... "Your 
               wife!"... "My sister!"... "Wife!"... "Sister!"

               He reaches a boiling point, raising two fingers, preparing 
               to give her the Three Stooges "two-fingered eye poke." She

               executes a perfect Three Stooges "wiggly-hand head slap", 
               telling him...

               Ned is stunned. MUSIC THUNDERS dramatically! Lana clicks the 
               stereo off. The MUSIC STOPS.

                         She was spoiled rotten! She stole

                         Dwayne. The boy's gym teacher. He 
                         was older. So mature... so strong. 
                         He smelled like dirty sweat socks 
                         and old basketballs. And he was all 
                         mine. For awhile.

                         But Lana wasn't satisfied with her 
                         own things. She had to have mine 
                         too. She took it all... my makeup, 
                         my sweaters, my shoes, my underwear...

                         she smashed my face in with a shovel.

                         face, he left me for HER... because 
                         she looked more like me than I did! 
                         First she stole my looks... then she 
                         stole the only man who ever loved 
                         me!

               INT. NED'S CAR - NIGHT

               Ned wanders to his car, climbs in, sits there... stunned.

                                     NED (V.O.)
                         The pieces of the puzzle were falling 
                         into place and I didn't like the 
                         picture they were making. If Lana 
                         really killed Frank Kelbo, then I 
                         had misjudged her by a mile. Sure... 
                         he was a lousy mechanic. But murder?

               Ned rubs his temples, shuts his eyes.

                                     NED (V.O.)
                         It was all starting to give me a 
                         headache bigger than the national 
                         deficit.

               INT. LOLA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida" plays on the stereo. Lola sits on the 
               floor by an end table, eyes dazed, staring blankly. A lamp 
               with a "clapper" switch sits on the table.

               As the CAMERA MOVES IN SLOWLY to her, she absently "claps" 
               the light off... then on... then off... then on... then off...

               INT. NED'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               CLOSE ON female hands using a keyhole saw to cut through a 
               railing on the second floor landing above the foyer.

               Outside... the SOUND of a car... headlights! The sawing stops.

               EXT. NED'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               Ned pulls up. The house is dark and ominous. So is the MUSIC.

               INT. NED'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               The front door is open a crack. He cautiously pushes it and 
               the door CR-E-A-K-S open very slowly. The door STOPS, but 
               the LOUD CREAKING continues. Ned touches it lightly with the 
               tip of his finger. The CREAKING STOPS.

                                     NED
                         Lana?

               Ned moves up the stairs. The CAMERA BOOMS UP with him, HOLDING 
               ON an ECU of the partially severed railing.

               INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

               Ned enters. Hot water gushes from the faucet into a clawfoot 
               bathtub. He turns the water off, looking around, puzzled.

               Loosens his tie, rubs his head. A splitting headache. Opens 
               the medicine cabinet and... SCREECH! YEOW! CRASH! A CAT leaps 
               out!... darts away. There's a NOISE from downstairs.

               INT. THE KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

               Someone is POUNDING on the door. Ned enters and opens it. 
               It's Laura.

                                     LAURA
                         Ned! I'm glad you're here. I have so 
                         much to tell you.

                                     NED
                         Come on in. I'll make some tea. Grab 
                         a chair.

                                     LAURA
                         Thanks... I brought my own.

               She drags a chair in behind her, sits at the kitchen table. 
               Ned puts a kettle on the burner, turns it on. He starts 
               searching through the cupboard for teabags.

                                     NED
                         So... what have you got?

                                     LAURA
                         A lottery ticket and a laundry 
                         receipt.
                              (lays them on table)
                         I found them in the pocket of that 
                         suit you wore the night you were 
                         working under cover with a client.

               Ned freezes, staring out the window, unable to face her.

                                     LAURA
                         You remember that night, don't ya 
                         Ned? Then it hit me. Lottery starts 
                         with L-O. Laundry starts with L-A. L-
                         O... L-A. Lola.

               Ned turns to her when he hears Lola's name... looking baffled 
               by this convoluted piece of logic.

                                     LAURA
                              (shrugs it off)
                         Don't sweat it. It's the way a woman's 
                         mind works.

               He turns back to the cupboard, picking up a container.

                                     NED
                         How about Ovaltine?

                                     LAURA
                         Fine. Then I remembered you told me 
                         some guy named Frank had been working 
                         on your wife's car for two months. 
                         You with me so far?

                                     NED
                         I'm way ahead of you.

               He brings the Ovaltine container to the table.

                                     LAURA
                         Well back it up. You probably took a 
                         wrong turn. Remember your insurance 
                         policy... the one we couldn't find? 
                         I started thinking, who else had 
                         access to it beside you and me? The 
                         answer came up... Lana. And since 
                         she's a woman, it's probably hidden 
                         right here.

               A huge ceramic cookie jar sits on the table in front of them. 
               Laura SMASHES it with her fist, breaking it open! Cookies 
               spill out... and the insurance policy.

                                     NED
                         So that's where she hid the Oreos.

               He sits down... starts eating Oreos... twisting them apart.

                                     LAURA
                         Ned, Lana wasn't trying to save your 
                         life when she shot Max Shady. She 
                         and Frank were plotting to kill you 
                         and collect on your insurance policy. 
                         But she shot the wrong guy.

                                     NED
                         That's the craziest thing I ever

                                     LAURA
                              (she presses on)
                         Don't you see... Frank was going to 
                         let her take the fall. So she murdered 
                         him and tried to make it look like 
                         suicide.
                              (beat)
                         That's when I realized there was a 
                         connection between Lola and Lana...

                                     NED
                         Yeah... they're sisters. Twin sisters.

                                     LAURA
                         Well, hang on to your jock strap, 
                         Ned. There's more.

               She unrolls a complex genealogical chart... walks him thru 
               it.

                                     LAURA
                         Not only is Frank's father Dwayne 
                         Kelbo, notoriously amorous gym teacher 
                         and Lola Cain's former lover... 
                         Frank's mother is Helen Shady. Max 
                         and Frank are half-brothers who never 
                         met.

               Laura pauses dramatically, then announces.

                                     LAURA
                         Your lovely wife, Lana, murdered 
                         both of Helen Shady's sons.

                         This is so unbelievable.

                                     LAURA
                         And you haven't even heard my story.

               INT. HOUSE - UPSTAIRS LANDING - NIGHT

               The keyhole saw cuts through the railing. The CAMERA REVEALS 
               Lana, eyes filled with Machiavellian rage.

               She enters the bathroom, lays the saw blade down. Suddenly... 
               a PAIR OF HANDS plunge into frame, grabbing her by the throat!

               We GO WITH HER as she is pushed back into the tub, the hands 
               forcing her head under water. Lana grabs a diving mask, clamps 
               it over her face. One of the attacking hands rips it away! 
               Lana grabs a snorkel, sticking it in her mouth. The hand 
               pulls it from her, tossing it aside.

               The hand shoves a little RUBBER DUCKIE into Lana's mouth! 
               Lana struggles, finally going limp. Her open eyes stare up 
               from beneath the water. The last few bubbles rise to the 
               surface.

               INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME

                                     LAURA
                         He turned into a monster. And that's 
                         when I left him. I just couldn't...

               The tea kettle WHISTLES! Laura pulls it off the burner. The 
               whistling subsides... replaced by the distant SOUND of water 
               running upstairs. Ned cocks his head, listening.

                                     NED
                         That damn faucet keeps turning on 
                         all by itself. I'll go check it.

                                     LAURA
                         Okay. I'll make the Ovaltine.

               Ned exits. Laura opens the Ovaltine container. It's empty. A 
               DARK SHADOW moves past the window behind Laura. Suspense 
               MUSIC. Laura opens the cupboard. PIGEONS explode out, wings 
               beating furiously! She catches her breath, looks in the 
               cupboard. The cans and boxes are covered with pigeon shit. 
               She shoves them aside, looking for the Ovaltine.

               INT. FOYER - SAME TIME

               Ned looks up toward the light from the bathroom. Water seeps 
               over the edge of the landing and down the steps. As he moves 
               up the steps, the SOUND of MUSIC... the familiar strains of 
               "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida"... grows louder and LOUDER.

               INT. BATHROOM - SAME TIME

               It's filled with steam. He waves the steam away... STARTLED 
               to see Lana's lifeless body beneath the water, the rubber 
               duckie jammed into her mouth. The tub overflows on the floor.

               He turns the faucet off. The water stops... and so does the 
               MUSIC. Puzzled, he turns the faucet on. The MUSIC STARTS. 
               Turns it off. The MUSIC STOPS.

               INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME

               As Laura turns away to enter the pantry... her Husband's 
               twisted face suddenly appears in the kitchen window!

               INT. BEDROOM - SAME TIME

               Ned enters. The MUSIC is coming from the closet. Ned yanks 
               the door open! A flock of PIGEONS bursts out!... revealing a 
               GUEST MUSICIAN playing an instrument.

                                     GUEST MUSICIAN
                         I'm sittin' in for Dizzy. He had a 
                         gig tonight.

               Ned shuts the door, eyes shifting. Lola must be near.

               INT. PANTRY OFF KITCHEN - SAME TIME

               Laura searches the large walk-in pantry for tea bags. She 
               hears a LOUD CRASH of BREAKING GLASS in the kitchen... stops 
               and listens... then casually shrugs it off.

               INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME

               Laura's Husband stands in the kitchen. The back door is 
               open... the window shattered. He SEES... the kitchen towels 
               hanging sloppily on the rack! The disorganized clutter of 
               cans and boxes in the cupboard! WE PUSH IN to his wildly 
               insane eyes!

               INT. UPSTAIRS LANDING - SAME TIME

               As Ned enters the upstairs landing, we hear VOICES in his 
               mind.

                                     NED
                              (ECHOING V.O.)
                         Women are an open book. You can always 
                         tell the rotten apples from the 
                         peaches. I'd stake my career on it... 
                         stake my career on it... stake my 
                         career on it...

               The repetitive ECHO gets to him. He smacks his head with the 
               palm of his hand. The skipping stops... followed by...

                                     NED
                              (ECHOING V.O.)
                         ...If anyone ever proves me wrong, 
                         I'll throw away my badge.

               IN THE DARKNESS

               A woman's HAND unrolls a leather kit... the "U-Pick an Ice 
               Pick Porta-Pik-Pak!"... with seven ice picks in separate 
               slots, each labeled with a day of the week.

               The hand selects "Wednesday's" ice pick, pulls it out. Then... 
               BONG... BONG... BONG... BONG...!

               CANTED ANGLE ON - A GRANDFATHER CLOCK

               It CHIMES loudly. It's twelve midnight!

               THE HAND

               returns the ice pick to its slot, selects the one for 
               Thursday.

               INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME

               Laura comes out of the pantry. She stops... gasps! Everything 
               in the cupboard is neatly stacked! All the towels are 
               straight!

               She whirls around... coming face to face with her Husband! 
               He smiles demonically, holding up the Ninja Turtle float 
               ring.

                                     LAURA'S HUSBAND
                         Forget something, sweetheart?

               INT. UPSTAIRS LANDING - SAME TIME

               Ned nears the bathroom door and suddenly... A PIERCING SCREAM! 
               Lola charges, an ice pick raised over her head! She knocks 
               him backward, into the bathroom, slashing at him. But he 
               deflects the attack, grabbing at her arms.

               INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME

               Laura backs away from her Husband. He holds her wedding ring.

                                     LAURA'S HUSBAND
                         You forgot to flush, darling.

               INT. UPSTAIRS LANDING - SAME TIME

               As Ned and Lola continue their violent struggle... Lola grabs 
               toiletries to aid in her attack. She squirts Ned with SHAVING 
               CREAM... squeezes TOOTHPASTE in his hair... and throws BATH 
               POWDER in his face!

               Ned is blinded. Gaining the advantage, Lola shoves him back, 
               slamming his head into the wall. He's dazed, helpless.

               Lola raises the ice pick, moving forward to strike! But Ned 
               grabs a HAIR BLOWER and swings it around, pointing it at her 
               like a gun! She freezes... then smiles contemptuously.

                                     LOLA
                         What're you gonna do, Ned? Blow me 
                         away?

               She LAUGHS arrogantly. Ned clicks on the hair blower to HIGH, 
               a blast of HOT AIR hitting Lola's face, puffing her cheeks 
               out, pushing her back, hair flying wildly!

               Her backside hits the railing where Lana has cut it... the 
               wood splintering!

               Lola tumbles over backward, SCREAMING! She hangs suspended 
               in mid-air for a moment, like a cartoon character, arms 
               flailing. Then... WHOOM!... she FALLS to the marble floor 
               below, hitting with a LOUD THUD!

               INT. THE KITCHEN - SAME TIME

               Laura's Husband hears Lola fall, turning. Laura grabs the 
               iron skillet and CLOBBERS him with it! BONG! He goes down.

                                     LAURA
                         I never forget anything... honey.

               INT. UPSTAIRS LANDING - SAME TIME

               Ned stares at the hair blower in his hand. Filled with disgust 
               and revulsion, he throws the "weapon" down.

               INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME

               Laura pulls TWO REVOLVERS from her purse... spinning them 
               like John Wayne... expertly tossing one over her back, 
               catching it in front! She heads for the foyer.

               INT. FOYER - A MOMENT LATER - ON LOLA'S BODY

               Laura pauses, looks down at Lola's body... notices something. 
               She pushes Lola's skirt a bit higher with the toe of her 
               shoe.

                                     LAURA
                              (outraged)
                         Those are MY panties!

               She looks up... sees a light emanating from the bathroom.

               ON THE LANDING

               Laura moves through the shadows... stops outside the bathroom, 
               pressing her back against the wall, guns up and ready.

               She swivels into the doorway... taking a shooter's stance... 
               guns pointed! She sees... LANA... submerged in the tub, face 
               up, the rubber duckie in her mouth.

               Laura steps back and turns... right into a THING covered in 
               white! Startled, she SHRIEKS! Ned drops the white towel he's 
               using to wipe off all of the shaving cream and toothpaste. 
               Relieved to see it's Ned, she throws her arms around him!

                                     LAURA
                         Oh Ned!

                                     NED
                         You were right... there's a million 
                         things I don't know about women. 
                         Maybe you can teach me a few hundred.

               He pulls out his police badge, looks at it.

                                     NED
                         Hell... I had too many careers anyway.

               He tosses it away, over the railing.

               INT. FOYER - ECU LOLA - SAME TIME

               The badge drops from above, landing on the floor right in 
               front of Lola's lifeless face. A beat. Her eyes pop open!

               INT. BATHROOM - ECU ON BATH WATER - SAME TIME

               Suddenly, the rubber duckie pops to the surface.

               ON THE LANDING

               Laura hugs Ned again, arms locked around his neck, still 
               gripping a gun in each hand.

                                     LAURA
                         Oh Ned, I love you. I always loved 
                         you!

               INT. FOYER

               Lola sits bolt upright, bloody but still bouncy.

               INT. BATHROOM

               Lana suddenly SITS UP in the tub, inhaling a huge GASP of 
               air, her eyes wild!

               INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

               Laura's Husband's eyes POP OPEN! He SITS UP suddenly... 
               smashing his head into the sharp corner of the kitchen table! 
               He topples back slowly... really dead! Finally.

               INT. THE STAIRCASE

               Lola's feet move steadily up each stair... her bloody hand 
               grasping the ice pick.

               INT. BATHROOM FLOOR - LOW ANGLE

               Lana's feet step out of the tub, water dripping all around. 
               She picks up the pointed saw from the floor.

               ON THE LANDING

               Ned and Laura still embrace, her forearms crisscrossed behind 
               his neck. It's been a long embrace.

               Suddenly, Lana and Lola both appear, SCREAMING like banshees!

               Lana charges from the bathroom, grasping the sharp saw blade! 
               Lola races at them from the stairway... with the ice pick!

               Without missing a beat, Laura raises the barrels of both 
               guns and FIRES at them simultaneously... right next to Ned's 
               ears.

               The impact of one bullet knocks Lana all the way back through 
               the bathroom, CRASHING spectacularly out the window! The 
               other bullet sends Lola flipping down the staircase!

               Ned looks stunned, his eyes crossed... the thundering gunshots 
               still ringing in his ears. Laura proudly blows the gunsmoke 
               away from the end of each barrel.

                                     LAURA
                         Got 'em!

                                     NED
                              (deafened)
                         WHAT?

                                     LAURA
                         I said... I GOT 'EM!

                                     NED
                         HUH?!!!

                                     LAURA
                              (yells)
                         THEY'RE DEAD! GONE! KA-PUT!

               He strains to make out what she's saying, ears still ringing.

                                     NED
                              (yells back)
                         SURE I'LL MARRY YOU! NEXT TUESDAY 
                         WOULD BE PERFECT!

               A beat. Laura opens her mouth to correct him, then decides 
               against it. She smiles... speaking softly, almost shyly.

                                     LAURA
                         Okay. But I want to have kids.

               He hears THIS... smiles at her.

                                     NED
                         Great.

               They embrace.

               EXT. NED'S HOUSE - WIDE SHOT - NEAR DAWN

               We MOVE IN SLOWLY toward the house.

                                     NED (V.O.)
                         So... maybe I was wrong. Maybe women 
                         really are like a big jigsaw puzzle... 
                         with pieces that never seem to fit 
                         where you want 'em to.

               INT. NED'S HOUSE - THE BEDROOM - SAME TIME

               Ned and Laura are in bed, wrapped in each other's arms.

                                     NED (V.O.)
                         All I know is, there are three things 
                         that men can't possibly ever do...

               NEW ANGLE - NED AND LAURA

               Revealing that it's NOT "voice over narration." Ned is 
               actually rattling on aloud again.

                                     NED
                         ...understand women... give birth... 
                         and program a VCR. And giving birth 
                         is the easy one.

                                     LAURA
                         Ned...

                                     NED
                         Yeah, Laura?

                                     LAURA
                         Knock off the chatter, will ya?

               He smiles at her. They kiss. Romantic SAXAPHONE MUSIC begins 
               to play... only this time, it's "Laura's Theme."

               The CAMERA PULLS BACK SLOWLY... revealing Dizzy laying on 
               the bed beside them... playing the sax.

               After a beat, Laura turns to Dizzy.

                                     LAURA
                         We won't need you anymore.

               Ned casually slips him a twenty dollar bill. Dizzy slips off 
               the bed and out the door. Laura turns to Ned.

                                     LAURA
                         We can make our own music.

               Her hand reaches slowly over the edge of the bed, toward the 
               floor. Suddenly... she comes up with a CONCERTINA, a small 
               accordian... and begins to play it!

               Ned lays there listening for a few moments, a stunned look 
               frozen on his face. Then... he reaches under the pillow and 
               pulls out a HARMONICA and joins in.

               The CAMERA BOOMS UP to a HIGH ANGLE SHOT... as they play 
               MEDLEY of all the MUSIC heard in the film.

                         Ned, do you know... I want you to

                                     NED (V.O.)
                         No. But if you hum a few bars... 
                         I'll fake it.

               CREDITS SEQUENCE: EXTREME CLOSE-UPS
               An unfinished mechanical device: a scaffold of thin metal
               pipes, levers, pulleys, wiring, serve-motors.
               THOMAS CRAWFORD works on it: in his 40s, well-dressed but in
               disarray, graying stubble, hair and clothes unkempt.
               Magnifying glasses distort his eyes, making them huge and
               strange.
               He sets aside a tool, takes a marble-sized ball-bearing and
               drops it into a slot at the top of the device.
               His enlarged eyes follow the metal ball -
               - as it rolls and flips and spirals through a Rube-Goldberg-
               style maze, setting off bells, clicking past turnstiles -
               - then missing a leap and clattering across the work-table.
               Eyes on the device, Crawford's hand traps the ball.
               He stays still, analyzing.
               He selects a tiny screwdriver from a neat array of metal-
               working and electronics tools. Makes a miniscule adjustment
               to a single joint. Drops in another ball.
               It rolls and flips and spirals all the way down.
               Crawford doesn't react.   Just studies the machine.
               Behind him, on a desk: a framed photograph of a beautiful
               woman in her mid-30s.
               His wife.

               


               INT. LUXURY BEACH-HOTEL ROOM - THE SAME TIME

               JENNIFER CRAWFORD is just reaching orgasm -
               - with ROB NUNALLY: mid-30s, good-looking, aging-boyish.
               They clutch each other, shuddering, lost in passion. And
               then, breathing heavily, caressing each other - Nunally rolls
               off her - slowly coming back to earth.
               Jennifer studies her lover, a quiet play of relief and
               gratitude and satisfaction on her face -
               - darkened by a troubled distance, maybe even fear.
               She is, after all, having an affair.

               

                                                                              2

               

               


               INT. CRAWFORD'S OFFICE - DAY

               Crawford stares through the grotesque lenses, motionless,
               expressionless.

               He takes a deep breath and checks his watch.   Then he stands,
               removing the glasses.

               We now see his office: large, austere. Decor and equipment
               related to aircraft engineering. Outside big windows, jets
               take off from an industrial airstrip.

               Crawford gets a brand-new bottle of Jack Daniels from a desk
               drawer, uncaps it and swigs as he opens the door to a private
               bathroom.

               He gargles, spits into the sink. He pours out more, then
               puts the half-empty bottle back on his desk.

               He collects a home-made device from the workbench: it looks
               like a PDA connected by wires to a blank credit card.

               He puts it in the pocket of his suit jacket, which he sets on
               the desk. Adjusts the placement of the open bottle, nearby.
               Crawford goes to a light-box, studying a set of large X-rays:
               dark strips of welding in a grayish fuzz of metal.

               TINA, his assistant, appears in the doorway.

                                        TINA
                           The N.T.S.B. guys are here.

                                        CRAWFORD
                                  (Doesn't look up)
                           Yep.

               She hesitates a second, glancing at the bottle.
               Crawford ignores her, pulling an x-ray off the light-box and
               grabbing his jacket -
               - which knocks over the bottle.   It skitters across the desk,
               liquor spilling.
               Crawford just walks out past Tina.

               


               INT. AIRPLANE HANGER - SOON AFTER

               The twisted, torn and burned wreckage of a large private jet
               is being reassembled on the big empty concrete floor.

               

                                                                             3

               

               
               N.T.S.B. INVESTIGATORS in shirtsleeves and AIRCRAFT COMPANY
               EXECUTIVES in suits cluster around work-boards covered with
               photographs and diagrams of a crash site.
               They look up, falling silent, as Crawford comes in carrying
               the X-ray. A few exchange surprised, concerned glances; this
               is not a man who skips a shave.
               But when he gets to them, Crawford is laser-like - holding
               the X-ray and pointing to a spot three inches above it:

                                         CRAWFORD
                            It's here.

               He hands a startled Investigator the film and strides off
               toward the giant open doors out to the airfield.
               His foot knocks a piece of the carefully-laid-out wreckage in
               passing; it clatters across the concrete, but Crawford
               doesn't slow or look back.

               


               INT. LUXURY BEACH-HOTEL ROOM - SOON AFTER

               Rob is still in the bed, naked under the sheet - watching
               Jennifer adjust the straps of her bathing suit.

                                         ROB
                            What about dinner tonight?

               She looks at him, surprised.    Smiles, comes to sit beside
               him. Gently:

                                         JENNIFER
                            We go out to dinner - we might never
                            come back.

               Beat.   Rob nods.

                                         ROB
                            Okay.
                                   (Beat)
                            I want to wake up with you.    I want
                            to...

               He gropes for words, but it's too big and he relents - scales
               back, sighing:

                                         ROB
                            ...at least see where you live.

               She regards him tenderly, feeling the same reckless yearning.
               But also fear. She rubs his hair.

               

                                                                             4

               

               

                                        JENNIFER
                           I live...here.

               She leans over to kiss him delicately on the lips.

               


               EXT. SANTA MONICA STREET - DAY

               A black Porsche speeds down a quiet street near the beach,
               pulls into a parking space.
               Crawford gets out, goes to a pay phone. He puts his cell
               phone on top of it, drops in some change and dials.

                                        OPERATOR (ON PHONE)

                           L.A.P.D.

                                        CRAWFORD
                           Lieutenant Nunally, please.

               He listens to hold music and checks the time.

                                        OPERATOR (ON PHONE)
                           He doesn't come on til six. You want
                           his voice mail?

                                         CRAWFORD
                           No.  Thank you.
                                  (beat)
                           I'll see him later.

               He hangs up, grabs his cell, and takes off down the sidewalk.

               


               INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

               Crawford enters. He knows where he's going - past the front
               desk and outside to the -

               


               EXT. HOTEL POOL - DAY

               Jennifer swims laps with strong, even strokes.   Rob is
               enjoying the sun in a lounge chair.
               Crawford eyes them as he passes on the other side of a low
               fence. Unnoticed, he heads upstairs.

               

                                                                             5

               

               


               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY

               Crawford stops at a room with a DO NOT DISTURB sign on the
               knob. He takes out his PDA-device and slides its card into
               the key-card slot of the lock.
               The lock clicks to green.

               


               INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

               Crawford enters, quietly closing the door behind him.
               He just stands there, taking it all in. The unmade bed, the
               ripped-open condom packet, the clothes on the floor.
               He is silent.   Very still.

               


               EXT. CRAWFORD'S STREET - LATER

               Jennifer drives her Mercedes convertible past expensive
               houses in the late-afternoon light.
               She goes up the driveway of the Crawfords' stark mordern home.
               Across the street, MR. GIFFORD is playing catch with his
               GRANDSON. He waves to Jennifer.
               She waves back, friendly but distracted, on her way to the
               front door.

               


               INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Cold. Elegant. Metal planters with bamboo trees. Glass
               doors out to a back garden. A fire in the fireplace.
               In a corner is another of Crawford's Rube Goldbergs - this
               one the size of a refrigerator. On a coffee table in the
               center of the room, a big wooden bowl of ball-bearings.
               Jennifer hurries in, dropping her keys on a table and -
               - freezes, startled.
               Crawford waits in the center of the room; despite the outer
               "disarray", he is calm and focused.

                                        JENNIFER
                           You're - home early.

               

                                                                            6

               

               

                                        CRAWFORD
                           I just felt a sudden urge.

                                        JENNIFER
                           Are you...okay?
               Crawford shrugs, smiling strangely.   He looks pained.

                                        CRAWFORD
                           I could use a hug.
               Jennifer submits guiltily.   Crawford embraces her, tight.
               She waits it out, until:

                                        JENNIFER
                           Have you been drinking?
               He lets go and she steps back.   Studying him.   Scared.

                                        CRAWFORD
                           I've been watching you sleep.   At
                           night.

                                        JENNIFER
                                  (Gently)
                           That's creepy.

                                        CRAWFORD
                           Sometimes when I'm at work, I'll start
                           thinking about you and I'll just get -
                           just - overwhelmed.

                                        JENNIFER
                           Tommy -

                                          CRAWFORD
                           It's a dense, crushing -
                           geophysical force. Like I'm
                           pinned. At the core - where things
                           change.
                                   (beat)
                           You ever get that way about me,
                           Jen?

                                        JENNIFER
                           What are you talking about?

                                        CRAWFORD
                           I'm trying to describe my feelings.

                                        JENNIFER
                           Those don't sound like feelings.

               

                                                                                     7

               

               

                                           CRAWFORD
                           No?
                                   (Beat)
                           What's the sound of one feeling...in a
                           forest?

                                        JENNIFER
                           You think you're so much smarter
                           than I am. That must make you feel
                           very powerful.

                                        CRAWFORD
                           Helpless, actually.
               Silence.

                                           JENNIFER
                           Okay.     Maybe it's time to really talk.

                                           CRAWFORD
                           No.

                                           JENNIFER
                           No?
               He shakes his head.     Frayed and worn, she sighs.

                                       JENNIFER
                           Fine. Whatever. I'll make you some
                           dinner.
               He watches her turn and head for the kitchen.          To her back:

                                           CRAWFORD
                           I know.     Everything.
               She stops, exhales.    Looking down.   Afraid.    Grateful it's
               happening at last.

                                           JENNIFER
                           I'm so sorry.

                                         CRAWFORD
                           Don't be. Knowledge is pain.         I'm
                           used to that.
               Jennifer winces, feeling some sympathy.     Preparing herself to
               turn and end it, to grow, to move on.

                                        CRAWFORD
                           It's not like I don't let little
                           pleasures, in return for the pain.

               

                                                                              8

               

               
               She frowns and turns - and her eyes go big with fear.
               Crawford is holding a semi-automatic pistol, aimed at her
               face. Very still.
               The gunshot explodes out of the muzzle - bright, harsh, loud.

               


               EXT. GIFFORD HOUSE - FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS

               Gifford and his Grandson turn to look at the Crawford house.

               


               INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Crawford stands, tilting his head to watch the slow hypnotic
               curl of smoke leaking from the gun in his extended hand. The
               hand, we might notice now, wears a surgical glove.
               He lowers the gun, bends to pick up the ejected shell-casing
               from the floor. He wipes it and tosses it aside, on his way
               to Jennifer.
               He stands looking down at her: face-up on the floor, head in
               a small pool of blood, eyes and mouth open.
               The doorbell rings.

               


               EXT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

               Gifford leans on the frosted-glass panel next to the door -
               hands cupped around his eyes, trying to see in.

                                          GIFFORD
                           Tom?   Jen?   Everything okay in there?

               


               INT. CRAWFORD FOYER - CONTINUOUS

               Crawford steps in from the living room.

                                        CRAWFORD
                           Everybody just LEAVE US ALONE!
               He calmly aims up at the frosted-glass transom and fires
               three times - watching Gifford fling himself away.
               Crawford collects the shell casings, wipes them, drops them
               back on the floor.
               Peeling off the rubber gloves, he crosses to the fireplace
               and throws them into the flames. They curl and blacken.

               

                                                                              9

               

               
               Crawford watches, expressionless - then looks around,
               satisfied. Waiting.

               


               EXT. CRAWFORD'S STREET - DUSK

               Helicopters overhead, SWAT teams setting up. Nearby houses
               have been emptied, gawking NEIGHBORS and media vans moved
               back to a block away.
               UNIFORM COPS pull aside the barriers as a plain-wrap sedan
               rolls through. It pulls up by the SWAT Command Truck.
               ROB NUNALLY gets out, surveying the scene. The guy who spent
               his afternoon with Jennifer Crawford in the hotel is an
               L.A.P.D. Detective.

                                        SWAT COMMANDER
                           You the Negotiator?

                                          NUNALLY
                           Yeah.    What do we know?

               


               INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - SOON AFTER

               Crawford waits, with the gun.    The phone rings.   He picks up:

                                           CRAWFORD
                           Yes?

                                                             INTERCUT WITH:

               


               EXT. CRAWFORD'S STREET - CONTINUOUS

               Nunally is standing by the open trunk of his sedan, wearing a
               Kevlar vest now - putting on his shoulder-holster over it.
               Into his cell-phone:

                                           NUNALLY
                           Mr. Crawford?

                                           CRAWFORD
                           Who is this?

                                        NUNALLY
                           My name is Lieutenant Robert Nunally.
                           I'm a hostage negotiator for the Los -
               Crawford hangs up.   Thoughtful.

               

                                                                                10

               

               

                                           NUNALLY
                           Mr. Crawford?
               Nunally grimaces, shuts his phone, shaking his head. But
               then he turns - with the SWAT Commander and everyone else -
               - as Crawford's front door unlocks and opens a few inches.
               Nunally considers this, looks at the SWAT COMMANDER.

                                         NUNALLY
                           Okay then.   Here we go.
               He pulls his suit jacket back on, then reaches into the trunk
               for his back-up gun. He tucks it into the back of his belt,
               concealed under the jacket.
               He takes a walkie-talkie and starts for the house.
               The spectators fall silent.    Radios crackle and hiss as he
               heads up the driveway.

               


               INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

               Crawford watches Nunally's silhouette appear on the frosted
               glass, from across the living room.

                                           NUNALLY (O.S.)
                           Mr. Crawford?
               The door pushes open very slowly.     Nunally stays in the
               doorway.

                                           NUNALLY
                           Hey.
               Crawford studies him, staying back.

                                        CRAWFORD
                           Get rid of the vampires.
               Nunally is confused; Crawford gestures at the flood-lit lawn
               outside. Nunally glances back, sees the SWAT teams and -
               down the street - the distant barricades, the media.
               He nods, steps in and lets the door shut.     Careful silence.

                                        CRAWFORD
                           Do I call you Rob?

                                           NUNALLY
                           If you want.

               

                                                                             11

               

               

                                           CRAWFORD
                           Not vampires.

                                           NUNALLY
                           What?

                                           CRAWFORD
                           Not vampires.     Ghouls.   Sorry.
               Nunally nods, humoring him, glancing around. Sees the small
               pool of blood where Jennifer fell. Plays it cool.

                                        NUNALLY
                           Mr. Crawford, what do you say you give
                           me the gun - so I can pay more
                           attention to what you're saying?
               Crawford sighs.

                                         CRAWFORD
                           Is that your best shot?
                                  (Beat)
                           So to speak.

                                        NUNALLY
                           I just think - maybe it would -

                                        CRAWFORD
                           Tell you what: I will if you will.
               Nunally frowns, wary.
               Crawford moves to the coffee table in the center of the room,
               holds his gun out over it.

                                        CRAWFORD
                           We both put down our guns.      At the
                           same time.
               Crawford gestures to a chair across the room - by the foyer
               door, near Nunally.

                                         CRAWFORD
                           We set them down and step away.
                                  (Beat)
                           Then you can "pay more attention" to
                           what I'm saying.
               Nunally studies Crawford...and the gun, hovering above the
               coffee table. Looking for a trick, a catch. But there isn't
               one. If Crawford sets down his gun and steps away, he'll be
               standing in the open center of the room.

               

                                                                           12

               

               

                                        CRAWFORD
                           Happy ending, then.
               Nunally stares Crawford in the eyes -
               - then slowly takes his gun from his shoulder holster.
               Eyes on each other from across the room - moving very slowly -
               the two men cautiously set down their guns -
               - and step away.   Crawford smiles.
               Nunally smiles, too, reassuring and false. Begins to edge
               forward - alert to the possibility of a lunge for the gun or
               having another weapon. But Crawford stays absolutely still.

                                        NUNALLY
                           Mr. Crawford, your neighbor mentioned
                           that your wife -

                                         CRAWFORD
                           It's Tom.

                                         NUNALLY
                           I'm sorry?

                                        CRAWFORD
                           You can call me Tom.

                                         NUNALLY
                           Tom.   Your wife. Is she here?

                                         CRAWFORD
                           Yes.
               Crawford gestures to a library alcove, behind him, out of
               view.

                                        NUNALLY
                           Is she all right?
               Nunally begins to drift slowly to the side, to see.

                                        CRAWFORD
                           I don't think she is.     I shot her,
                           Rob.
               Nunally's nodding, edging to look into the alcove -

                                        NUNALLY
                           You shot your wife.

               

                                                                             13

               

               

                                        CRAWFORD
                           It was like I just suddenly - snapped.
                           We were arguing - and I got the gun.

                                        NUNALLY
                           - okay - I hear you -

                                         CRAWFORD
                           And I shot her in the head.   I know it
                           was wrong.
                                  (Beat)
                           Are you listening to me?
               But Nunally is not. He's frozen - staring, shocked, at the
               back wall of the alcove - which he can now see.
               There's a big framed black-white photograph: a portrait of
               Jennifer Crawford.

                                        NUNALLY
                           Oh Jesus Christ.
               Nunally fumbles for his walkie-talkie, rushing past Crawford
               toward the alcove -
               - kneeling by Jennifer, who lies, face-up in a red puddle -

                                        NUNALLY
                                  (into walkie-talkie)
                           We need a medic in here! Get the
                           ambulance up! RIGHT NOW! NOW! NOW!
               Nunally feels her neck frantically for a pulse - looking in
               her open, vacant eyes for some sign -

                                        NUNALLY
                           Oh no - God no - I can't - get a -
               Nunally desperately starts C.P.R., his hands getting bloody.
               He stops to check her neck for a pulse now and then -
               - as Crawford slowly approaches from the living room,
               standing behind Nunally. Cold.

                                        CRAWFORD
                           You know, I think I read somewhere
                           that a good place to find a pulse is
                           the femoral artery. It's on the inner
                           surface of the upper thigh. If you
                           put your fingers - you know, right up
                           inside her dress -

               

                                                                             14

               

               
               Nunally turns and lunges up, smashing a fist into Crawford's
               face. Crawford reels backward with Nunally -
               - the two of them falling with Nunally on top, beating
               Crawford furiously, cursing -
               - as SWAT COPS burst in, grabbing Nunally, dragging him back -
               knocking into PARAMEDICS trying to get to Jennifer -
               - Nunally kicking, flailing, spitting at Crawford - who's put
               face-down on the floor, to get cuffed.
               Nunally pulls free from the SWAT cops, distraught, angry -
               going to retrieve his gun and shove it in his shoulder-
               holster, struggling to regain control.

                                        PARAMEDIC
                           Wait a second - she's not dead!
               Nunally whirls - everyone freezing, breathless, falling
               silent.
               The Paramedics kneeling around Jennifer work -
               - as Crawford lies on the floor, staring at his wife. Like
               she's a machine that defied astronomical odds and refused to
               behave according to his calculations.

               


               EXT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - SOON AFTER

               Jennifer's stretcher is loaded into an ambulance, doors
               slamming shut and sirens kicking on -
               - as Crawford, cuffed behind his back, is pushed into the
               back seat of a police car. His eyes on the ambulance as it
               pulls away, carrying his wife.

               


               INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - SOON AFTER

               A DETECTIVE uses a pencil to lift Crawford's gun from the
               coffee table and carefully put it in an evidence bag.
               Nunally stands back, watching the COPS and TECHNICIANS work
               the scene - lost in his thoughts, shaken.

                                        SWAT COMMANDER
                           You all right?
               Nunally "wakes" - nods.   Absently:

               

                                                                             15

               

               

                                           NUNALLY
                           Yeah.     I'm good.
               To avoid talking more, he heads out to the glaring lights and
               chaos outside.

                                                              FADE OUT

               


               INT. WILLY'S APARTMENT - THE NEXT MORNING

               The alarm clock shifts to 6:00 am and pops on to local news
               and traffic -
               - but the narrow futon bed is already empty.
               WILLY SLOCUM works at a laptop on his second-hand desk, lit
               by a solitary lamp.
               He is in his late-20s, good-looking. Short hair, office-pale
               but athletic, wearing mis-matched sweats from Eastern
               Oklahoma State College.
               He jots a final note, sets his yellow legal pad aside. As he
               goes to the closet-sized bathroom, pulling off his sweatshirt
               and starting the tiny pre-fab shower, we linger on the laptop
               screen: rental listings for a new apartment.

               TIME CUT
               The bare overhead bulb is on, revealing the concrete floor
               and painted-plywood walls. His clothes hang neatly on a
               length of pipe suspended by ropes from the exposed rafters.
               Law school texts fill cinderblock-and-board shelves.
               The radio chatters.    Willy knots a tie in his crisp white
               collar.

               TIME CUT
               Willy methodically packs legal folders from last night's
               "homework" into his big, battered briefcase. He has to work
               to stuff all the files in.
               He pulls on his suit jacket, settles the shoulders, tugs at
               his cuffs. Uncaps a pen, leans over a one-sentence letter
               waiting on the desk. Reads it over.
               As he signs, we glimpse:
                   - hereby give notice that I will be resigning my
                   position at the District Attorney's Office as of
                   Novemb-

               

                                                                             16

               

               
               Willy savors the moment.
               Then he tucks the letter into an envelope, gets the heavy
               briefcase - goes to shut off the light and open the door -
               - which swings about six inches, then clonks into something.
               Willy grimaces.   Peeks out, goes to pound on a wall.

                                           WILLY
                           Mrs. Demello?
                                  (Beat)
                           MRS. DEMELLO!    Your CAR!
               Silence. He sighs.    Shuts the door and presses a button near
               the light-switch.
               There's mechanical grinding noise as the far wall slowly
               rolls up, letting in daylight and revealing an alley beyond
               the hanging clothes and cinderblock shelves.
               He presses the garage-door-opener button again, and hurries
               across the apartment to duck out under the closing door.

               


               EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

               Willy straightens and takes a breath, re-settling his suit
               jacket with an irritable glance at his landlady's car, parked
               sloppily next to the garage, blocking his door.
               As he walks away, down the alley, we rise up to reveal the
               hazy sprawling landscape of L.A. - and the towers of
               Downtown, rising ahead of Willy like Oz.

                                        WILLY (V.O.)
                           Come on, Phil: I called you as a
                           courtesy, and you start looking to
                           take advantage?

               


               INT. WILLY'S OFFICE - LATER THAT MORNING

               An ancient fluorescent-lit cubby crammed with documents, case
               files, notes, reference books. Willy on the phone:

                                        WILLY
                           I'm not knocking it down to a Class C.
                           My backlog of open cases does not
                           mitigate the fact that your client
                           tried to kill his brother-in-law with -
                           oh, right, a "golfing accident"? Your
                           client owns one golf club and no golf

                                        (MORE)

               

                                                                          17

               

               
                                        WILLY (cont'd)
                           balls - and the "accident" took place
                           in the stairway of an illegal after-
                           hours gambling club. Yeah, okay -
                           I'll see you in court.
               His cell phone rings.   As he gets it:

                                        WILLY
                           Well, I won't see you in court, but
                           someone from this office will. You
                           take it up with them, I gotta go.
                                  (switching phones)
                           Willy Slocum. Oh - hey, hi, yes.
               Assistant District Attorney NORMAN CHANG (mid-30s) throws the
               door open without looking:

                                           NORMAN
                           Wooton Sims?!
               Willy holds up a finger, talking into his cell:

                                           WILLY
                           No, I didn't.     Wow.   Okay.
               Norman mouths "WOOTON SIMS?!" repeatedly during:

                                        WILLY
                           No - short notice is...fine. No, I
                           can. Black tie. Sure. What time?
                           Okay. Yes. Thank her.
               He hangs up, exhales slowly.    Looks at Norman.

                                           NORMAN
                                             Wooton - SIMS?!
                           Wooton Sims?!

                                        WILLY
                           Please stop saying, "Wooton Sims" over
                           and over. It's starting to sound like
                           nonsense words.

                                           NORMAN
                           You asshole!

                                        WILLY
                           Okay: go back to "Wooton Sims."
               As Willy gets up and goes out, past Norman -

                                        NORMAN
                           How the hell did you get a job at
                           Wooton Sims?! I can't even get an
                           interview!

               

                                                                           18

               

               


               INT. DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - DAY

               Norman follows Willy out to a central bullpen area where the
               shared ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANTS work: MONA and GLADYS.

                                        NORMAN
                           I've been here five years. I'm your
                           supervisor. I graduated USC, summa!

                                        WILLY
                           We're just going to pretend he's not
                           talking, okay?

                          MONA                            NORMAN
                 No problem.                     I'm serious.

                                        WILLY
                           I'm really jammed-up all day, and I
                           need to rent a tuxedo - for tonight.

                                         NORMAN
                           A tuxedo?! Oh, come on!     You are so
                           full of shit.

                                        WILLY
                                  (Jotting notes)
                           There must be a place that does that,
                           right - same day? I'm also gonna need
                           a messenger to bring it here. This is
                           my suit size and my shirt size...I
                           really appreciate this.
               Mona nods, taking notes as Willy gets out a credit card.
               Other DDAs are gathering to soak up some vicarious kicks.

                                        MONA
                           What's going on?

                                        WILLY
                           Wooton Sims buys a whole lot of seats
                           to this charity opera thing every
                           year, because Bob Wooton is the
                           chairman of this committee -

                                        NORMAN
                           "Bob" Wooton?!

                                        WILLY
                                  (Enjoying, mock-helpless)
                           It's what the man told me to call him.

               

                                                                            19

               

               

                                        GLADYS
                           You're gonna need to pick out a style,
                           Willy.

                                           WILLY
                           A style.

                                        GLADYS
                           For the tuxedo.
               Willy hesitates, in over his head.   A DDA helpfully does the
               Travolta finger-in-the-air pose.

                                        WILLY
                           I don't know - I just don't want to
                           look like I'm going to the prom.

                                        GLADYS
                           You wanna go Classic.    Fix him up.

                                        MONA
                           We'll get you something Classic.
                                  (Picks up a ringing phone)
                           Willy Slocum's office.

                                        NORMAN
                           Make sure it comes with cuff-links and
                           knee-pads.

                                        WILLY
                           Oh, that's very nice: it's good to be
                           back in high school.

                                          MONA
                                    (Hanging up)
                           Willy?
               Her tone makes him - and everyone else - turn.

                                        MONA
                           God wants to see you.

                                           WILLY
                                  (Beat)
                           Our God?

                                        MONA
                           Who art on the Eleventh Floor.
               Willy, startled, looks around. Approving nods, raised
               eyebrows. He tightens his tie and heads for the elevators.

               

                                                                           20

               

               

                                        NORMAN
                           There is no justice! There is no
                           justice in the city of Los Angeles!

               


               INT. LOBRUTO'S OFFICE - SOON AFTER

               District Attorney JOE LOBRUTO, 50-ish, sits behind a massive
               oak desk, studying a thick file. Doesn't look up as a
               SECRETARY shows Willy in.
               Willy hesitates. Looks around: he's never been here. Flags,
               wood panelling, leather furniture, windows overlooking the
               city. Finally Lobruto looks up, takes Willy in.

                                        LOBRUTO
                           William No-Middle-Initial Slocum.

                                        WILLY
                           Yes sir.

                                        LOBRUTO
                           Sit.
                                  (As Willy does:)
                           Eighty-four-percent conviction rate.
                           That's remarkable.

                                        WILLY
                           Thank you.

                                         LOBRUTO
                           With a case load thirty percent higher
                           than any other first-year DDA.
                                  (Beat)
                           Of course - you also swapped more
                           cases than the rest of them put
                           together.
               Willy considers his options.   He always does.

                                        WILLY
                           I offered my losing cases in exchange
                           for two or three of anyone else's
                           possible convictions. They couldn't
                           handle their workloads, and I prefer
                           not to lose.
               Lobruto knew this; the question was would Willy admit it.

                                        LOBRUTO
                           You're going to need a middle initial.

               

                                                                           21

               

               

                                           WILLY
                           Sir?

                                        LOBRUTO
                           You're going to Wooton Sims.

                                           WILLY
                           In two weeks.

                                        LOBRUTO
                           You'll be able to afford a better
                           suit. But those guys all play squash
                           and have middle names. They go in for
                           the mother's maiden name a lot.
               Beat. Willy doesn't like the implied personal judgement, but
               the only way it shows is how calm he stays.

                                        WILLY
                           My mother didn't have a maiden name.
               Lobruto nods, unruffled by Willy's hard calm.

                                        LOBRUTO
                           So you're a bastard; sometimes I can
                           be a son-of-a-bitch. Maybe you belong
                           here.

                                        WILLY
                           I didn't work this hard to stay where
                           I belong.

                                        LOBRUTO
                           You're a street-fighter, Willy. You
                           should be in court. We can move you
                           up to better cases.

                                        WILLY
                           I appreciate the offer.

                                        LOBRUTO
                           I didn't think so.
                                  (Closes the file, stands)
                           Well - you got your litigation
                           experience. Your chops. And your
                           juicy private sector job. Anything
                           else the City of Los Angeles can do
                           for you?
               Willy's amused.    He stands, too.   As they shake hands:

               

                                                                             22

               

               

                                        WILLY
                           No, I think that's everything - thank
                           you.

                                        LOBRUTO
                           The offer stands. If you get tired of
                           carrying a spear.
               Willy nods - but Lobruto notes the tiny flicker in his eyes:
               not getting it and trying to cover. Lobruto smiles gently.

                                        LOBRUTO
                           It's an opera joke. Give my regards
                           to Bob.

               


               INT. WILLY'S OFFICE - LATER

               Willy's twisting in his rented tux, trying to adjust a buckle
               on the side of the vest.
               The phone rings and he gives up, frustrated - pushing the
               plastic garment-bag aside to answer -
               - knocking a full cup of take-out coffee on to his chair.
               Which is where he left his suit.
               Willy freezes. Watching the coffee seep into the fabric.
               Into the phone, distracted:

                                           WILLY
                           Willy Slocum.

                                                            INTERCUT WITH:

               


               INT. NORMAN'S OFFICE - THE SAME TIME

               Norman's looking at a case file.

                                        NORMAN
                           I've got an Attempted Homicide.
                           Conley caught it last night, but he's
                           hung up in motions with Gardner.
                           Arraignment in Part Seven, at three
                           o'clock.

                                        WILLY
                           Three o'clock is in fifteen minutes.

                                         NORMAN
                           Thank you.   What's the temperature?

               

                                                                           23

               

               

                                        WILLY
                           I can't do it.

                                        NORMAN
                           You do still actually work here,
                           Willy, right? I mean, you're still
                           going to be cashing your paycheck for
                           another two weeks and everything?

                                           WILLY
                              Just get somebody else for this one.

                                           NORMAN
                              Everybody's booked up. Look: it's not
                              going to trial. There's a weapon with
                              prints, and a confession. Take the
                              arraignment and wait for the plea.

                                            WILLY
                                     (Beat)
                              A real confession?

                                           NORMAN
                              Spontaneous and signed.   Come on,
                              Willy.
               Willy sighs.     Looking down at his coffee-soaked suit.

                                            WILLY
                              Okay.   Here's the problem.

               


               INT. NORMAN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

               Norman slowly smiles, listening.

                                           NORMAN
                              You know - I really wish I was going
                              to see this.

               


               INT. COURTROOM - LATER

               Willy slips self-consciously through the double-doors,
               wearing the tuxedo.
               He gets even more self-conscious when he notices a handful of
               local REPORTERS. He hurries in -
               - passing Nunally, in the back row. Nunally is making a good
               show of keeping it together...but it's only a show.
               JUDGE IRENE FELDMAN, 50-ish, looks over her half-glasses.

               

                                                                             24

               

               

                                        JUDGE FELDMAN
                           Mr. Slocum. Nice to see a man who
                           dresses for court.

                                        WILLY
                           Sorry, your honor.    Long story.
               Willy, hurrying to Prosecution Table, barely glances at the
               Defense Table -
               - but Crawford, sitting beside his PUBLIC DEFENDER in an
               orange jumpsuit and handcuffs, never takes his eyes off
               Willy, intrigued.

                                        JUDGE FELDMAN
                           Grapevine has it the punch-line is
                           Wooton Sims.

                                         WILLY
                           Yes, ma'am.

                                        JUDGE FELDMAN
                           Good for you, double-oh-seven.
                                  (Signaling the Bailiff)
                           Let's see what public service is
                           offering you by way of a send-off:

                                        BAILIFF
                           The State of California Versus Thomas
                           Crawford.
               The Defense rises; Crawford hardly pays any attention to the
               Judge - glancing back and noticing Nunally, whose eyes bore
               into him, haunted and burning.
               Crawford stares at him impassively a second, then turns to
               lean past his P.D. and watch Willy hastily skim the file.

                                          JUDGE
                           Mr. Crawford, you've been charged with
                           section 664 slash 187 of the
                           California Penal Code: Attempted
                           Murder, with additional allegations of
                           Assault With a Deadly Weapon - Penal
                           Code section 245 dash A2, with Great
                           Bodily Injury, P.C. Section 12022.07.
                                   (Beat)
                           Do you waive further reading of the
                           complaint and complete statement of
                           rights?

               

                                                                              25

               

               

                          P.D.                              CRAWFORD
                     (sotto)                    I do.     But, your honor -
                 You do.

                                        JUDGE FELDMAN
                           And do you wish to enter a plea at
                           this time?

                                        CRAWFORD
                           Not guilty. But I also want to waive
                           my right to counsel, and represent
                           myself.
               Willy looks up from the file - startled.

                                        JUDGE FELDMAN
                           Do you have a problem with your
                           appointed counsel, Mr. Crawford?

                                        CRAWFORD
                           No. I just want to do it myself.     I
                           believe it's within my rights.

                                        P.D.
                           Your honor, if I could have a moment
                           with my client -

                                        CRAWFORD
                           I'm not your client. Try and keep up,
                           would you?
               The P.D. shuts up, taken aback. The Judge considers
               Crawford, thoughtful, then turns to Willy.

                                        JUDGE FELDMAN
                           Do the People have an objection or a
                           comment for the record, Mr. Slocum?
               Willy hesitates, held by Crawford's strange, amused gaze.
               Shakes it off:

                                        WILLY
                           I'm sorry, your honor: we've got the
                           weapon and a signed confession. I
                           really think Mr. Crawford needs a
                           competent attorney to - frankly -
                           negotiate a plea.
               Crawford reaches up with cuffed hands and adjusts an
               imaginary bow-tie. Willy self-consciously touches where
               Crawford indicated on his own collar, straightens his clip-
               on.

               

                                                                             26

               

               
               Crawford nods: you're welcome.    Willy turns to the Judge.

                                        WILLY
                           I - can't - this was supposed to be -
                           with a pro se defendant, this is going
                           to drag out for months - and I'm not
                           even going to be here. The People
                           request a continuance to -

                                        CRAWFORD
                           Excuse me? Your honor? I'm willing
                           to waive my right to a preliminary
                           hearing and go directly to a jury
                           trial.
                                  (To Willy)
                           Does that help?

                                        JUDGE
                           You don't need to look out for Mr.
                           Slocum, Mr. Crawford. The District
                           Attorney's office can shift another
                           prosecutor to the case -

                                        CRAWFORD
                           No, I like Mr. Slocum.
               Beat.

                                         JUDGE FELDMAN
                           Mr. Slocum?   He likes you.

                                         WILLY
                           Terrific.

                                        JUDGE FELDMAN
                           Mr. Crawford seems to understand his
                           rights and responsibilities.

                                        WILLY
                           All due respect, your honor, I'm
                           worried this may turn into some sort
                           of a - circus -

                                        JUDGE FELDMAN
                           I appreciate your concern for the
                           dignity of my courtroom, Mr. Slocum -
                           considering you're making the argument
                           dressed as a game-show host.
                           Unfortunately, the man is a tax-paying
                           citizen, entitled by our Constitution
                           to try and manipulate the legal
                           system, like everybody else.
                                  (turning)

                                        (MORE)

               

                                                                              27

               

               
                                       JUDGE FELDMAN (cont'd)
                          As for you, Mr. Crawford, I strongly
                          urge you to retain counsel. Lack of
                          same will not be grounds for appeal.

                                           CRAWFORD
                           I understand.     Thank you.

                                        JUDGE FELDMAN
                           Are the People ready to go to trial
                           without a preliminary hearing?
               Willy hesitates, irritated. Looks through the file again.
               Checks Crawford - waiting, polite.

                                         WILLY
                           Sure.   Why not.
               Crawford smiles at him, as the Judge opens her calendar.

               


               INT. PARKING STRUCTURE - LATER

               Willy, in his tux, comes out of a staircase and stops.   Rob
               Nunally is waiting by Willy's parked car.

                                        NUNALLY
                           You're supposed to be good.
               Willy takes him in - wary, seeing an edge of anger and fear
               beneath the tough controlled cop manner.

                                        WILLY
                           Is that what I'm supposed to be?

                                        NUNALLY
                           I asked around. You're supposed to be
                           top-notch - but to me it looks like
                           you've got one foot out the door, and
                           you're wiping the rest of us off the
                           bottom of the other one.

                                        WILLY
                           I'm sorry to...disappoint you.
               Nunally is silent - frustrated. The concrete walls and
               ceilings echo from distant cars.

                                        NUNALLY
                           I took Crawford's confession.

                                        WILLY
                           And now you want mine?

               

                                                                            28

               

               

                                          NUNALLY
                             I'm here to warn you. Take this
                             seriously, because it's serious. This
                             guy is stone cold - and his wife - is
                             lying in a hospital bed - with brain
                             damage...
               He struggles to keep himself under control.

                                           WILLY
                              Are you all right?

                                           NUNALLY
                              Are you gonna be on this, or what?

                                           WILLY
                              Yeah.  I'm on it.
                                     (Gently)
                              You got a confession. You took the
                              gun out of his hand. It's done.

                                           NUNALLY
                              I'm just - telling you. Is that okay?
                              Or are you too friggin' busy?!

                                            WILLY
                              No.   It's okay.
               Willy waits.    Watching the tortured cop wrestle with demons.

                                            NUNALLY
                              Forget it.
                                     (Beat)
                              It's a lock. We're good.   Put him
                              down. Bury him.
               Willy nods.    Nunally turns and walks away, down a ramp.
               Willy watches him go. Sad. Like he's watching Nunally
               drown. But he's seen people drown before...and he's not
               about to put out a hand. Might get pulled in himself.

               


               INT. CHANDLER PAVILION - LOBBY - LATER

               Willy moves uneasily among clusters of laughing, chatting,
               sparkling FORMAL-DRESSED PEOPLE.
               NIKKI GARDNER joins him, strolling alongside. She's his age,
               but her elegant dress, unlike his tux, was made for her.

                                           NIKKI
                              Are you a shark?

               

                                                                             29

               

               

                                          WILLY
                           Sorry?

                                        NIKKI
                           You've been circling the lobby for
                           half-an-hour now, like if you stopped
                           you'd die.

                                        WILLY
                           If I stopped, I'd be standing around
                           with no one to talk to. At which
                           point, death would be a relief.

                                        NIKKI
                           Why don't you talk to Bob?
               Willy stops walking, getting a little careful.

                                         WILLY
                           "Bob" is talking to the Governor.
                                  (Beat)
                           Do I know you?
               She puts a hand out, gently amused.

                                        NIKKI
                           Nikki Gardner. Senior Associate,
                           Wooton Sims.

                                        WILLY
                                  (Shakes)
                           Oh - hey, hi. It was your office that
                           called, with the invitation.

                                        NIKKI
                           On Bob's orders.

                                        WILLY
                           Listen, I don't...actually know "Bob."
                           I mean, I've only met the man once.
               Nikki nods, considering this.      And him.

                                          NIKKI
                           Interesting.
               They're each conscious of an unexpected buzz of attraction.
               The lobby lights flicker, breaking the spell a little. As
               the CROWD begins to drift toward the auditorium doors:

                                        NIKKI
                           You like opera?

               

                                                                          30

               

               

                                        WILLY
                           Truth is, I haven't really had that
                           much expos-

                                           NIKKI
                           Neither do I.
               With a conspiratorial head-tip, Nikki moves toward the plaza
               doors. Willy follows.

               


               EXT. ARTS CENTER - SOON AFTER

               They stroll the emptying plaza, dressed to the nines.

                                        NIKKI
                           Bob assigned you to my team. I'll
                           supervise your case-work, steer you
                           through the office arcana, and
                           generally keep an eye on you.

                                        WILLY
                           Kind of like a mentor.

                                        NIKKI
                           Kind of like a probation officer.
               Beat. Willy nods, meeting Nikki's gaze as she looks to make
               sure he's got it.

                                           WILLY
                           Okay.

                                        NIKKI
                           Wooton Sims expects absolute loyalty
                           and a hundred-and-ten-percent
                           performance. But: you get to work on
                           legendary litigation. National,
                           sometimes global, in scope. It's high-
                           stakes. And cut-throat - even within
                           the team. We burn out associates at
                           an astonishing rate.

                                        WILLY
                           You're trying to scare me.

                                           NIKKI
                           Yes.

                                        WILLY
                           You're going to have to try harder.
               She stops walking.   Studying Willy.

               

                                                                         31

               

               

                                        NIKKI
                           Can I ask you something personal?

                                           WILLY
                           Sure.

                                           NIKKI
                           Who are you?
               Willy doesn't answer. Maybe uncertain what she means. Maybe
               not wanting her to know. Or even not knowing, himself.

                                        NIKKI
                           We have a guy in our criminal
                           division, fresh out of Yale, named
                           Calvin Tyler. One of our very rich
                           clients gets pulled over, D.U.I. -
                           which is routine bullshit, so Calvin
                           gets it. Against you. Next thing we
                           know, Calvin is fired, and Bob Wooton,
                           who has never even interviewed a
                           junior associate before - let alone
                           hired one - says you're on my team.
               Willy weighs his options.    Decides to level:

                                        WILLY
                           It was a good bust, so Calvin came to
                           me for a deal. I told him if he could
                           arrange an interview for me with Mr.
                           Wooton, I would throw the case. I
                           laid out his arguments and evidence
                           for him - and I showed him how I would
                           lose. Calvin set up my appointment
                           for the day after our court date.
                           Then he did what I had suggested in
                           court - and I wiped the floor with
                           him. Your client got the maximum.
                           Next day, I met with Mr. Wooton.
                                  (Shrugs)
                           Bob.
               Beat.

                                       NIKKI
                           Wow. You know what's brilliant about
                           that?

                                           WILLY
                           Yes.

               

                                                                          32

               

               

                                        NIKKI
                           You didn't actually do anything all
                           that wrong.

                                        WILLY
                           Well - I wasn't entirely honest with
                           Calvin.
               His cell-phone rings.    He ignores it.

                                        NIKKI
                           You gonna get that?

                                        WILLY
                           Everyone I need to talk to is here.
               They are both feeling the electricity in the air between them.
               They wait the phone out, enjoying the forbidden insanity of
               it. But then:

                                        NIKKI
                           We need to talk about your transition
                           timetable.

                                          WILLY
                           All right.

                                        NIKKI
                           Bob believes in trial-by-fire. He
                           wants you up-to-speed two weeks from
                           Tuesday, because we're getting on a
                           plane to Chicago for depositions in a
                           class-action against our biggest
                           client, Armstead Pharmaceutical.

                                          WILLY
                           No problem.
               She studies Willy, trying to make sure he understands:

                                        NIKKI
                           That's catch-up on three years' work -
                           and you haven't closed out your old
                           job yet.

                                        WILLY
                           I'm good at trials.    Even by fire.
               Beat.

                                        NIKKI
                           You know, a little bit of fear can be
                           a very healthy thing to have.

               

                                                                                33

               

               

                                        WILLY
                           I'm looking forward to when I can
                           afford the luxury of having some.
               Nikki sighs, smiles.    Enjoying him, somewhat reluctantly.

                                        NIKKI
                           I'll have them put the Armstead
                           materials in your new office.

                                          WILLY
                           Thanks.    Boss.
               He watches her head off into the night. He remains, alone,
               in his tuxedo, looking at the elegant glittering arts plaza.
               Then he checks his cell-phone.     Dials.

                                                               INTERCUT WITH:

               


               INT. FORENSICS LAB - LATER

               MARCHAND, Senior S.I.D. (Scene Investigation Division) Tech,
               works as he talks into a speaker-phone. He and Willy have
               teamed-up often, and an underlying respect lets them mock
               each other.

                                          MARCHAND
                           Marchand.

                                        WILLY
                           It's Willy Slocum.     What's up?

                                        MARCHAND
                           Your gun in that Palisades shooting is
                           no good.

                                        WILLY
                           How can the gun be "no good"?

                                        MARCHAND
                           It's a perfectly good weapon. A
                           Heckler & Koch nine-millimeter. It's
                           just no good as evidence. It's never
                           been fired.

                                        WILLY
                           It's the gun from the scene?

               

                                                                         34

               

               

                                        MARCHAND
                           Yep. Bought by Mr. Thomas Crawford
                           and registered to his wife, about a
                           month ago. Apparently a gift.

                                        WILLY
                           And between the shooting and arrest,
                           this guy was locked inside his house.

                                         MARCHAND
                            Is that a question?

                                         WILLY
                            No, I mean, just: what's the point?
                            Playing games with the gun. He's
                            alone in the house with the victim,
                            and he confessed - it's not like the
                            gun's gonna get him off the hook.

                                         MARCHAND
                            Do you have a question I can answer?
               Beat.   Willy shakes the puzzle off, irritated:

                                         WILLY
                            Look, our weapon is in that house
                            somewhere. Get a team out to search
                            it tomorrow morning.

                                         MARCHAND
                            Ya think?

                                         WILLY
                                   (Sighs, smiles)
                            Thank you.
               He shuts the phone. Takes a moment, looking around again at
               where he is. Absently tugs at his tie and vest, lets the
               case go. Heads in to the opera.

               


               INT. WILLY'S OFFICE - A WEEK LATER

               Controlled chaos. A week's work has emptied the shelves and
               cleared the surfaces, but the file-cabinet drawers are all
               half-open: Willy sorts folders, neatly marking and packing
               them. White "trans-file" storage boxes are piled all over.

                                         MESSENGER (O.S.)
                            Slocum?
               Willy looks up, at a MESSENGER with another file box.

               

                                                                              35

               

               

                                         WILLY
                           Yeah.

                                        MESSENGER
                           Where do you want it?

                                        WILLY
                           The idea here is we're trying to take
                           boxes out - not bring more in.

                                        MESSENGER
                           Is that the idea?
               Willy sourly gestures to a chair; checks the label as the
               Messenger sets it down -

                                        WILLY
                           Whoa - wait a second, this is a screw-
                           up. I already have these documents.
                           I sent this box: to the Defendant, at
                           County.

                                        MESSENGER
                           I picked up at County.    Slip says
                           bring 'em here.
               Messenger holds out a clipboard. Willy reluctantly signs.
               As the Messenger leaves, Willy cuts the tape and takes out a
               folder. Opens it:
               Crawford has scrawled NO in red marker across the top sheet.
               Willy turns to the next page.     A big red NO across that, too.
               Pulls out more documents - flips through: NO - NO - NO - NO -
               red letters wriggling across the typed pages, like flip-book
               animation.
               Beat.   Disturbed, he picks up the phone, dials.

                                                             INTERCUT WITH:

               


               INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - THE SAME TIME

               S.I.D. TECHS are taking the place apart: opening HVAC vents,
               pulling books off shelves, upending chairs and tables,
               removing drawers from cabinets.
               Marchand, supervising, answers his cell-phone:

                                         MARCHAND
                            Marchand.

               

                                                                       36

               

               

                                        WILLY
                           Where are we on this gun?

                                        MARCHAND
                           We can't find it, Willy.

                                        WILLY
                           I'm in trial on Monday.

                                       MARCHAND
                           I know. I don't know what to tell
                           you. I'm there now.

                                        WILLY
                           You said you'd get a team out a week
                           ago -

                                         MARCHAND
                           I'm here now. My team has been here
                           twice already.
                                  (Beat)
                           Do you really need it?

                                        WILLY
                           Do I need it?! The weapon?!
               He takes a second.   Sighs, exasperated - but honest:

                                        WILLY
                           I don't know. Probably not.
                           Defendant's a whack-job.

                                        MARCHAND
                           He went pro se, right?

                                        WILLY
                           Yeah. Just when you think they're not
                           really stupid, they defend themselves.

                                        MARCHAND
                           You've got a confession and an
                           airtight bunch of circumstantial.
                                  (Apologetic)
                           We've gone over this place top-to-
                           bottom three times now, Willy.
               Willy takes a breath.   Thinks it through.

                                         WILLY
                           Yeah, okay. Don't worry about it.
                                  (Beat)
                           Sorry - got a lot going on.

               

                                                                          37

               

               

                                        MARCHAND
                           Must be rough, figuring out what
                           you're gonna do with all that money.

                                        WILLY
                           Hey, I had to sit through an opera
                           last week.

                                        MARCHAND
                           Oh gee - lemme see if I can express
                           how much sympathy I have:
               Marchand snaps his phone shut.
               Willy smiles, hangs up. But then his smile fades, as he
               glances down again at Crawford's box of papers.
               Hundreds of pages.   Every single one scrawled NO.
               Willy considers them.

               


               INT. COUNTY JAIL - INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER

               Metal chairs. Bad light. Crawford sits, cuffed, at a table,
               waiting. Looks up as the door unlocks.
               A GUARD lets Willy in, locks the door behind him.
               Crawford watches Willy take a legal pad, files, pens from his
               briefcase, set them on the table.

                                        CRAWFORD
                           How's my wife?

                                           WILLY
                           I don't know.

                                        CRAWFORD
                           I heard somewhere, I think it was on
                           N.P.R., that you're supposed to talk
                           to people in a coma. Play their
                           favorite music. Supposedly it reaches
                           them.
               Willy, now ready, lets Crawford study him.

                                        CRAWFORD
                           You represent Jennifer. The voice of
                           the victim, judicially speaking. But
                           you haven't gone to see her?

               

                                                                    38

               

               

                                        WILLY
                           Not yet.

                                        CRAWFORD
                           Too busy getting up to speed on
                           Armstead Pharmaceutical?
               Beat.

                                        WILLY
                           I beg your pardon?

                                        CRAWFORD
                           I'm not judging you. I think anyone -
                           coming from...what you came from -
                           then paying your way through East-Okie
                           Cowshit College and Tulsa Law by
                           writing papers for Princeton kids on
                           the internet - my God, it must have
                           eaten your liver! Sixty-thousand
                           dollars in debt, eighty-four percent
                           conviction rate: you deserve this.
               Willy tries to stay in control.

                                        WILLY
                           What the hell have you been doing.

                                         CRAWFORD
                           I'm permitted the use of a private
                           investigator.

                                        WILLY
                           Not to investigate me!

                                         CRAWFORD
                           Why not?   You're investigating me.

                                        WILLY
                           You shot your wife.

                                        CRAWFORD
                           Allegedly. That's how it works,
                           right? If I can't introduce something
                           in court as evidence - it doesn't
                           exist. Legally.

                                        WILLY
                           Look - I don't want to play games with
                           you.

                                        CRAWFORD
                           I'm afraid you have to.

               

                                                                        39

               

               
               Beat. Willy reconstructs his formal cool. Takes some pages
               scrawled NO from a folder, pushes them across the table.

                                        WILLY
                           Is this some form of - communication?

                                        CRAWFORD
                           You sent me a box of papers.

                                        WILLY
                           It's called Discovery.       The State has
                           a legal obliga-

                                        CRAWFORD
                           There's nothing in it, Willy. You
                           haven't 'discovered' anything. Have
                           you found the gun?
               Beat.

                                             WILLY
                           Not yet.

                                             CRAWFORD
                           No.
                                  (Beat)
                           Does it bother you that I call you
                           Willy?

                                             WILLY
                                    (Lies)
                           No.
               Crawford nods.    Pleased.    Leans forward.

                                        CRAWFORD
                           I'd like you to consider becoming my
                           lawyer. I'll pay you. A lot of
                           money.

                                        WILLY
                           I'm - prosecuting you.

                                        CRAWFORD
                           Yeah, but I'm offering you a chance to
                           get on the right side of this whole
                           mess while you still can.

                                        WILLY
                           Are you out of your mind?

               

                                                                             40

               

               

                                        CRAWFORD
                           I think - on advice of counsel - I'll
                           decline to answer that one.
               Willy studies him. Decides: it's an elaborate act.   Begins
               to put away his papers.

                                        WILLY
                           I don't need the gun to convict you,
                           by the way.

                                        CRAWFORD
                           She was cheating, you know.
               Willy looks at him, slightly taken aback.   He didn't know; it
               wasn't in the confession.
               As he considers whether it makes a difference - he notices
               Crawford watching, enjoying. Willy shuts his briefcase.

                                        WILLY
                           It doesn't matter what she did...Tom.
                           What you did is a crime.

                                        CRAWFORD
                           Perhaps. But - maybe my so-called
                           peers will look at me and see
                           themselves. Betrayed. Frustrated.
                           Humiliated. And you and I both know,
                           Willy, that people have an infinite
                           capacity for believing in their own
                           innocence.

                                         WILLY
                           Great.   Take the stand. Tell your
                           story.   I'd appreciate it.

                                        CRAWFORD
                           Not to mention the fact you have no
                           actual evidence connecting me to the
                           crime.
               Willy smiles, gets up.

                                        WILLY
                           Except your confession.
               Crawford watches him go to the door.

                                        CRAWFORD
                           My grandfather was an egg farmer.
               Willy stops, annoyed.

               

                                                                      41

               

               

                                         WILLY
                            Is this gonna be about how you had a
                            rough childhood?

                                           CRAWFORD
                            I used to candle eggs at his farm.
                            You know what that is? You hold an
                            egg up to a light, and look for
                            imperfections.
                                    (beat)
                            The first time I did it, he told me to
                            put the ones that were cracked or
                            flawed in a bucket - for the bakery.
                                    (beat)
                            He came back an hour later and there
                            were three hundred eggs in the bakery
                            bucket. He asked me what the hell I
                            was doing.
                                    (beat)
                            I found a flaw in every single one.
                            Thin places in the shell, minuscule
                            cracks.
                                    (smiles)
                            Look closely enough and you'll find
                            everything has a weak spot...where it
                            can break.

                                         WILLY
                            Looking for mine?

                                         CRAWFORD
                            No, I've found yours.

                                         WILLY
                            Illuminate me.
               Crawford considers how to put it.

                                         CRAWFORD
                            You're a winner, Willy.
               Silence.   Willy pushes the call-button by the door.

                                            WILLY
                            Huh. Well.      Joke's on me then, I
                            guess.

                                            CRAWFORD
                            Yes.   It is.

                                         WILLY
                            I'll see you in court, Mr. Crawford.

               

                                                                           42

               

               
               The door unlocks.   Crawford winks.
               Willy hesitates for a second - then leaves.

               


               INT. WOOTON, SIMS - EMPTY OFFICE - LATER

               It's big. It's got a window. It's got a sofa. Undecorated,
               except for a pile of materials & boxes marked ARMSTEAD

               PHARMACEUTICAL.
               Willy is filling out forms - tax, citizenship, benefits.   He
               doesn't notice Nikki when she comes to the door.

                                          NIKKI
                             Make sure you sign the one with the
                             devil in blood. It's not binding
                             otherwise.
               He looks up, smiles.

                                          WILLY
                             Just want to be ready for Chicago.
                             I'm all closed-out, downtown. Last
                             trial starts Monday.
               Beat.   Not pleased:

                                          NIKKI
                             You've got a trial Monday?

                                          WILLY
                             Yeah: attempted murder.

                                          NIKKI
                             That gives you three days. You told
                             me - and I told Bob - that you would
                             be ready to hit the ground r-

                                          WILLY
                             The man confessed.    And he's pro se.

                                          NIKKI
                             Willy, some but acting as his own
                             lawyer - he could drag it out for
                             months!

                                          WILLY
                             You want to hear his witness list?
               Nikki nods.   Willy is silent.     She frowns.

               

                                                                              43

               

               

                                           NIKKI
                           No witnesses?
               Willy leans in, enjoying this part - analyzing, even
               admiring, Crawford's ploy:

                                           WILLY
                              It's kind of clever: this guy is
                              trying to provoke the system into
                              declaring him insane. I think he
                              thinks we'll call in the doctors and
                              he can fake 'em out by refusing the
                              defense. He's acting out this really -
                              organized plan to appear crazy.
               Beat.   Nikki considers Willy.

                                           NIKKI
                              You're gonna miss being in court,
                              aren't you?
               He studies her, confident.    Gestures to the stacks of
               Armstead materials:

                                           WILLY
                              I'm almost halfway through these. And
                              I think I've already found about six
                              disqualifiers in Delaware, Ohio, and
                              Florida. I have to check case law in
                              each state, but it looks good. I'll
                              get the rest done over the long
                              weekend.
               Nikki sighs, smiles a little, against her will.      He's won her
               over...again.
               Willy shrugs, grins.    In the silence, the impossible
               electricity returns.    After a moment - to defuse it:

                                           NIKKI
                              You don't go home for Thanksgiving?
               Slight beat.

                                           WILLY
                              No.
               She studies him a moment, thoughtful.    Careful.

                                           NIKKI
                              If you want - you're welcome at mine.
                              My family's.

               

                                                                                44

               

               

                                           WILLY
                            Really?
               She nods. Smiling a little, knowing her family and starting
               to know Willy:

                                         NIKKI
                            I think it would be interesting.
               Beat.

                                           WILLY
                            Yeah.    Okay, thank you.

                                           NIKKI
                            Cool.
               Beat.   She leaves.    Willy doesn't go back to work right away.

               


               INT. COURTROOM - THE NEXT DAY

               JUDGE ROBINSON presiding. A mid-sized crowd, including a few
               REPORTERS. A UNIFORM COP is in the witness box, Willy stands
               in the Prosecution Table.

                                         UNIFORM COP
                            We established a perimeter around the
                            house and then waited for SWAT and the
                            Negotiator. It was strictly by the
                            book.

                                         WILLY
                            So the house was completely surrounded
                            within how long of the first shots?
               Crawford sits alone at the Defense Table. He wears an
               expensive suit and no handcuffs, but two DEPUTIES sit behind
               him. He's barely listening to the testimony - drawing on his
               legal pad: intricate, dense complex diagrams of "Rube
               Goldberg" contraptions.

                                         UNIFORM COP
                            Maybe ten minutes.

                                         WILLY
                            And when you arrived at the sc-
               Crawford noisily tears a page off his pad.     Looks up - sees
               Willy, and everyone else, turned to him.

                                           CRAWFORD
                            Sorry.

               

                                                                           45

               

               
               Willy sighs, returns to the Cop.

                                        WILLY
                           When you arrived on the scene, was
                           there a crowd?

                                        UNIFORM COP
                           Oh yeah. Neighbors, came out to look
                           soon as it started.

                                        WILLY
                           And from what you could ascertain, no
                           one went into or came out of the house
                           until SWAT and the negotiator arrived?

                                        UNIFORM COP
                           Definitely not.

                                         WILLY
                           Thank you.   No further questions.

                                           JUDGE ROBINSON
                           Mr. Crawford?
               Crawford looks up from his drawing.

                                           CRAWFORD
                           What?

                                        JUDGE ROBINSON
                           Your witness, Mr. Crawford.
               Crawford takes in the Uniform Cop.

                                        CRAWFORD
                           No questions for this witness.
               Willy watches Crawford return diligently to his doodles.

                                                            DISSOLVE TO:

               

               CLOSE-UP: THE DEFENSE TABLE - LATER THAT AFTERNOON
               It's a mess of loose legal-pad pages torn from Crawford's
               pad, each covered in madly intricate schematics. He works on
               yet another, head down, intent.
               Dr. MARION KANG is on the stand, using a marker on a big
               diagram of a head:

               

                                                                             46

               

               

                                        DR. KANG
                           - through the frontal cortex and the
                           temporal lobe, coming to rest against
                           the back of the skull.

                                        WILLY
                           So this bullet inflicted serious
                           injury?

                                        DR. KANG
                           It inflicted serious and irreparable
                           injury.
               Willy nods, allowing the jury time on this. He checks a note-
               card, glances at Crawford. Considers his options.

                                        WILLY
                           Dr. Kang, is it safe to say that
                           someone inflicting this kind of wound
                           intended to kill?
               Judge Robinson gives Willy a warning look.

                                        JUDGE ROBINSON
                           Mr. Crawford, you might want to
                           object. The witness can't know your
                           state of mind.
               Crawford doesn't even look up from his drawing.

                                        CRAWFORD
                           No thank you, your honor.
               Willy gives Judge Robinson an I-told-you-so shrug.     Turns to
               Dr. Kang.

                                        KANG
                           I would say so, yes.

                                        WILLY
                           Thank you, Dr. Kang.
               Crawford tears off the page, starts another.

               


               INT. COURTROOM - LATER

               Nunally on the stand.    Focused, professional.   Crawford
               draws, ignoring him.

                                        WILLY
                           So after you put down your gun, what
                           did Mr. Crawford do?

               

                                                                             47

               

               

                                        NUNALLY
                           He confessed to shooting his wife.

                                         WILLY
                           He confessed.
                                  (Beat)
                           Did Mr. Crawford appear confused or in
                           any way intoxicated, impaired?

                                       NUNALLY
                           No. Not at all. He knew what was
                           going on.

                                        WILLY
                           What did Mr. Crawford say?
               Nunally looks at Crawford, enjoying the fatal blow:

                                        NUNALLY
                           He said, "I got the gun and I shot my
                           wife. God help me, I shot her in the
                           head. I know it was wrong."

                                        CRAWFORD
                                  (low, still drawing)
                           Objection.
               Everyone turns, surprised.

                                        JUDGE ROBINSON
                           I'm sorry - Mr. Crawford, did you say
                           something?
               Crawford sets aside his pen for the first time.   Looks up.

                                         CRAWFORD
                           Yes.   I want to object.

                                        JUDGE ROBINSON
                           On what grounds?

                                           CRAWFORD
                           I don't know.

                                           WILLY
                           Your honor -

                                        CRAWFORD
                           I don't know what you'd call it. They
                           - it wasn't the first time, either,
                           but - I don't know the legal term.

               

                                                                            48

               

               

                                        JUDGE ROBINSON
                           Why don't you just explain it in
                           layman's terms.

                                        CRAWFORD
                           Fucking the victim.
               Uproar in the court.

                                        JUDGE ROBINSON
                           Mr. Crawford -

                                        CRAWFORD
                           You said layman's terms -

                                          WILLY
                           Your honor -

                                        CRAWFORD
                           I'm sorry - what would you call it -
                           legally - when the officer who
                           arrested you has been having sexual
                           intercourse with your wife?
               Utter silence. Willy whirls a look at Nunally.     The cop
               meets his eyes - a deer in headlights.

                                           WILLY
                                  (Low)
                           Oh - shit.

                                        CRAWFORD
                           I think it's objectionable - maybe I'm
                           wrong.

                                           WILLY
                           Your honor...

                                        JUDGE ROBINSON
                           Detective Nunally?
               Nunally looks down, silent.    Shaking his head.

                                           CRAWFORD
                           Rob?

                                        WILLY
                           Your honor, the People request a -
               Nunally suddenly launches himself over the witness box rail
               to attack Crawford - as the Deputies leap forward to stop him -
               all of them flailing and cursing in a tangle -

               

                                                                          49

               

               
               - spectators screaming, fleeing, gawking.   Chaos.

               


               INT. JUDGE ROBINSON'S CHAMBERS - SOON AFTER

               The Judge grim, Willy panicked, Crawford calm.

                                        WILLY
                           He had my witness list.   He should
                           have filed to suppress.

                                        CRAWFORD
                                  (Shrugs)
                           My mistake. Sorry.

                                        JUDGE ROBINSON
                           Mr. Crawford, I warned you about
                           representing yourself.

                                        CRAWFORD
                           What about the fact that it's true?
                           I mean, isn't that the point here: to
                           get to the truth?

                                        JUDGE ROBINSON
                           Mr. Slocum - is it true?

                                        WILLY
                           I don't know. I only heard about it
                           five minutes ago.

                                        CRAWFORD
                           Put him back on the witness stand if
                           you don't believe me.

                                        WILLY
                           We can't put him back on now! Not
                           after what the jury just saw. Your
                           honor, I told you this would turn into
                           a circus. First he provokes the
                           witness with an outrageous allegation -

                                        CRAWFORD
                           My Dick has evidence.
               The Judge and Willy look at Crawford like he's truly insane.

                                        JUDGE ROBINSON
                           Excuse me?

                                        CRAWFORD
                           My investigator. I call him Dick. I
                           guess I should call him as a rebuttal

                                        (MORE)

               

                                                                                50

               

               
                                         CRAWFORD (cont'd)
                           witness? He's got phone records,
                           credit receipts, photographs,
                           videotapes - all documenting the
                           affair. In graphic detail.
                                  (Beat. Mildly:)
                           Dick is good.
               The Judge looks at Willy.    This is bad.    Thinking fast:

                                        WILLY
                           Okay - um: I'll stipulate that my
                           witness was less than forthcoming
                           ...and that can more or less cancel
                           out the fact that the defendant
                           withheld a crucial -

                                        JUDGE ROBINSON
                           Mr. Slocum - your witness was intimate
                           with the victim, and he assaulted the
                           defendant during the arrest.

                                         CRAWFORD
                           Actually, while obtaining my so-called
                           "confession."
               Willy stares at Crawford, shaken.    Understanding the trap.

                                         WILLY
                           No way.   Your honor -

                                        JUDGE ROBINSON
                           He's got a point. They were alone in
                           the house. The confession is no good.

                                        WILLY
                           Oh - come on!

                                        CRAWFORD
                           Is this a legal argument?       "Oh come
                           on"?

                                        WILLY
                                  (Whirls on him)
                           You want to get into it?!
               Crawford raises his eyebrows. Awkward silence.         Willy takes
               a deep breath. Turns to the Judge.

                                           WILLY
                           Sorry.
                                  (Beat)
                           He dictated and signed his confession,
                           after that incident.

               

                                                                              51

               

               

                                        JUDGE ROBINSON
                           In police custody. Arguably, in fear
                           for his life. I'm sorry, Mr. Slocum -
                           it's all 'fruit of the tainted tree.'
                           We have to exclude all versions of the
                           confession and any evidence collected
                           by Lieutenant Nunally or by other
                           police officers on the night he was
                           present.

                                        WILLY
                           This is insane!

                                        CRAWFORD
                           It's Biblical, isn't it?   The fruit
                           and the tree and -

                                        WILLY
                           He set this up! Don't you see what
                           he's doing?!

                                        JUDGE ROBINSON
                           Yes, I do. And I don't like it. But
                           it's done, so we have to deal with it.

                                        CRAWFORD
                           Do you think I could go home today,
                           your honor? With Thanksgiving around
                           the corner -

                                         JUDGE ROBINSON
                           Don't push it, Mr. Crawford.
                                  (Beat)
                           What we're going to do is give Mr.
                           Slocum a few days to regroup and come
                           up with new evidence. If he doesn't -
                           then you can go home. That's going to
                           put us into the long weekend. We
                           reconvene Monday morning.
               Willy just stands there: blind-sided, shell-shocked.
               Crawford smiles at him.

               


               INT. WILLY'S OFFICE - THAT EVENING

               The end of a bad, bad day.   Willy flips on the lights as he
               comes in, shaken.
               A package is on the empty desk. Addressed in red marker.
               The return address: TC, County Jail.
               Willy just stands looking at it.

               

                                                                              52

               

               


               INT. COUNTY JAIL - THE SAME TIME

               Crawford sits on the metal bunk in his prison jumpsuit.
               Alone. Looking down.

               


               INT. WILLY'S OFFICE - RESUME

               As Willy takes a letter-opener from the desk drawer - the
               phone rings. He answers it, eyes still on the package:

                                           WILLY
                           Willy Slocum.

                                                             INTERCUT WITH:

               


               INT. GLAMOROUS BAR - THE SAME TIME

               Crowded with UPSCALE YOUNG PROFESSIONALS.    Nikki is on her
               cell-phone, hand over her other ear:

                                        NIKKI
                           Well - you've gotta admire the
                           cleverness of it.
               Willy begins cutting open the package as he talks:

                                           WILLY
                           Do I?

               


               INT. COUNTY JAIL - CONTINUOUS

               Crawford very slowly raises his eyes, until he is looking
               directly at us.

                                        NIKKI (V.O.)
                           Come on, Willy - give the devil his
                           due.

                                         WILLY (V.O.)
                           Yeah. I'm just trying to figure out
                           what that is.

               


               INT. WILLY'S OFFICE/GLAMOROUS BAR - RESUME


                                        NIKKI
                           Okay: then listen - I checked with Bob
                           on how he wants you to handle this.

                                        NIKKI (cont'd)
                           Has LoBruto tried to take you off the
                           case yet?

                                           WILLY
                           No.

                                        NIKKI
                           Well, he pretty much has to if he's
                           gonna save any face. So here's the
                           strategy: you let him.
               Willy cautiously lifts the box's flaps - pulls aside tissue
               paper - to reveal:
               A single eggshell.   Broken, empty.

                                           WILLY
                           I let him?

               


               INT. COUNTY JAIL - CONTINUOUS

               Crawford begins to smile.

                                        NIKKI (V.O.)
                           Yeah, damage control. Stop getting
                           your face on TV. As it is, I had to
                           talk Bob down from cancelling your
                           contract.

               


               INT. WILLY'S OFFICE/GLAMOROUS BAR - RESUME

               Willy is staring down at the broken eggshell, barely
               listening to Nikki.

                                        NIKKI (CONT'D)
                           But we've got to move fast and get out
                           from under. Otherwise, and I quote:
                           "Stick a fork in this kid's ass and
                           turn him over, he's done."

                                        WILLY
                           I can't just - walk away.

                                        NIKKI
                           Willy: today, you got killed. The
                           issue now is saving your new life.
               Willy can't take his eyes off Crawford's "gift."

                                        WILLY
                           I guess...that would be the smart way
                           of looking at it.

               

                                                                                   54

               Crawford stares right at us.       Smiling.   Ice cold.

               


               INT. WILLY'S OFFICE/GLAMOROUS BAR - RESUME

               Nikki is sympathetic, misunderstanding Willy's quiet:

                                           NIKKI
                              You want to come out and get drunk?

                                           WILLY
                              No. Thank you. I've got some stuff
                              to take care of.

                                             NIKKI
                              All right.    Don't beat yourself up.

                                             WILLY
                              I won't.
               He hangs up.    Considering the empty eggshell.       But then he
               looks up:
               District Attorney Lobruto is in his office doorway, trying to
               decide whether to be angry.

                                           LOBRUTO
                              You don't look into who the victim
                              was sleeping with?
               Willy burns, ashamed.       But unable to admit it.

                                           WILLY
                              He - threw me off.
                                     (Frustrated)
                              Look, Crawford knew he'd be the prime
                              suspect, so he gave us everything -
                              but he made it all radioactive. The
                              night this went down, it was over.

                                           LOBRUTO
                              But you still walked   it into court,
                              Willy. We might not    have a case...but
                              it didn't have to be   a public
                              humiliation for this   office and the
                              police department.
               Silence.

               

                                                                    55

               

               

                                       WILLY
                          Are you taking me off?

                                       LOBRUTO
                          You're leaving anyway.

                                       WILLY
                          I'm starting to get a sense of this
                          guy.

                                       LOBRUTO
                          That's not new evidence.

                                       WILLY
                          I can take him now: he thinks he's
                          smarter than I am.

                                       LOBRUTO
                          It's not about you, Willy.

                                       WILLY
                          Yeah, it is. He made it that way.
                                 (Shows him the egg)
                          He likes me.

                                       LOBRUTO
                          What is that - some kind of Oklahoma
                          insult?

                                       WILLY
                          Let me do this. I won't make you look
                          bad.
               Beat.

                                         LOBRUTO
                          No. You won't. That's what I need to
                          make sure you understand. I remove
                          you now: I'm covered, I took some
                          action.
                                  (Beat)
                          If you go on with this, when you lose -
                          blame has to come down. And it'll
                          come down on you. I'll have to
                          investigate you for improprieties,
                          incompetence - anything I can. In
                          public. I'll hang you out to dry.
                          For the good of this office.
               Silence.

                                       WILLY
                          If I lose.

               

                                                                             56

               

               

                                           LOBRUTO
                             What?

                                          WILLY
                             You said "when."
               Lobruto grimaces.     He shakes his head.    Sighs.

                                           LOBRUTO
                             All right.   It's yours.
               Willy nods.   Stubborn.    Scared.

               


               INT. MOTEL ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

               Local news on the TV: Willy pushing past media outside the
               courthouse; official photo of Nunally; footage from the
               standoff at Crawford's.
               The sound is low, and Nunally isn't watching. He's sitting
               on the edge of the bed...looking down at his gun, in his
               hands.
               A knock on the door "wakes" him. Beat. He sets the gun
               aside, goes to peek out the curtains. Lets Willy in.

                                          WILLY
                             You're not easy to find.      I had to
                             call Internal Affairs.

                                          NUNALLY
                             Yeah - they put me on a desk - 'til
                             this gets...sorted out.
               He uncomfortably watches Willy glance around at the half-
               empty liquor bottle, the mismatched suitcases and paper bags
               full of balled-up clothes. And the gun on the bed.

                                          NUNALLY
                             Got home - my wife already took the
                             kids to her folks. Press is all over
                             our front lawn. Friggin' vampires.
               He falters, haunted by the echo.      Willy doesn't notice:

                                          WILLY
                             What the hell were you thinking.
                             You're on the job and you get called
                             to your girlfriend's house -

               

                                                                            57

               

               

                                       NUNALLY
                          I didn't know it was her house.      I'd
                          never been there.

                                           WILLY
                              It was her name!

                                           NUNALLY
                              I didn't know her name!
               Willy waits.    Nunally explains, reluctant to expose himself:

                                           NUNALLY
                              No last names. Her rules. We met at
                              the same hotel room, twice a week - no
                              phone calls, no questions. She didn't
                              want us to know too much about each
                              other. She said it was like...travel
                              in a foreign country. No baggage -
                              from our lives. Just us. Escaping.

                                           WILLY
                              Did you get the feeling she had rules
                              because she had done it before? With
                              other guys?

                                            NUNALLY
                              No.  I don't know. Maybe.
                                     (Thinking, remembering:)
                              No. It was all just this...crazy
                              thing. For both of us. It was...
                              real. You know? We didn't expect
                              that, when we started. We didn't know
                              where it was going. I had cheated so
                              many times, I was numb - but she was
                              ...new. And she made me feel like
                              there was - some chance. To change.
                              We were scared. It was like we were
                              afraid to go forward, but we couldn't
                              go back.
                                     (Beat)
                              You always think you have time. To
                              work it out. Or make things right.
                                     (Angry)
                              What was I supposed to do?!

                                           WILLY
                              You were supposed to tell me!

                                             NUNALLY
                              I'm married!    I have kids!

               

                                                                               58

               

               

                                        WILLY
                           You thought nobody knew - so maybe you
                           could just walk away clean.

                                        NUNALLY
                           No! I didn't think HE knew! OKAY?!
                           Even - after. I thought it was just -
                           massively fouled-up...bad luck. Like -
                           God - telling me - something.
                                  (Anguished)
                           I'm there. My mind is going crazy. I
                           know the confession won't hold if
                           anyone finds out.
                                  (Beat)
                           I thought the guy was a whack!

                                            WILLY
                              Yeah?   Well, he's not.
               Nunally won't look at Willy.      He just sits there, numb.

                                           WILLY
                              Is there anything else you can give
                              me. Anything that might get us some
                              evidence.
               Nunally shakes his head.      Willy grimaces.   Goes to the door.

                                           NUNALLY
                              I...tried to warn you.
               Willy stops.    Looks back.

                                           WILLY
                              You warned me he was smart. You
                              didn't warn me you were stupid.
               Nunally winces. Takes it. Willy feels a little badly.         Two
               guys in a shabby motel room, in terrible trouble.

                                           NUNALLY
                              How do we get the confession back in?

                                             WILLY
                              We don't.

                                           NUNALLY
                              What are you gonna do?
               Willy shakes his head.     Walks out.

               

                                                                             59

               

               


               INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - THE NEXT DAY

               A massive search is under way.
               Marchand's S.I.D. Team has been doubled, back-up by a dozen

               SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES -
               - passing hand-held metal detectors along the furniture -
               - taking pictures down from the walls -
               - turning over mattresses - patting-down every item hanging
               in the closets -
               - wriggling into crawlspaces - poking into light fixtures
               recessed into the ceilings -
               - opening the air-conditioning unit, up on the roof -
               - ripping out Crawford's high-end home-theater system -
               - taking apart the Porsche in the garage.
               Willy paces the edges of the action, restless, edgy.

               


               INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER

               Willy stops in the doorway - watching a DEPUTY shut the
               stainless-steel freezer, open a wired-glass cabinet and poke
               around.

                                          WILLY
                             Shake the boxes.

                                          DEPUTY
                             Huh?

                                          WILLY
                             The cereal boxes - shake 'em. And
                             there's a chicken in the freezer.
                             Thaw it out, check inside.
               The Deputy stares like he's nuts. Willy doesn't blink.    The
               Deputy goes to shake the boxes, eyes on Willy: okay?
               Willy nods.   Moves on.

               


               EXT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - LATER

               Hours have passed.

               

                                                                             60

               

               
               Willy steps out of the front door, because he's going stir-
               crazy inside. Stands watching two TECHS walk the lawn and
               flower-beds with metal detectors.
               He notices, past the S.I.D. vans and Sheriff's Dept. black-
               and-whites parked in the driveway:
               Nunally, in his parked car, across the street.
               He meets Willy's eyes.    Worried.
               Willy can't give him any news. So he pretends he didn't see
               the question in Nunally's eyes, looks away. Takes a breath,
               turns and goes back in to work.

               


               INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DUSK

               It's getting dark out. Techs pack equipment cases, carry
               them out. The place is a disaster area.
               Marchand watches Willy pace the living room.

                                          WILLY
                           The garage?    Washer-dryer?

                                        MARCHAND
                           And the tool shed, and the roof, and
                           the H.V.A.C. ducts.

                                        WILLY
                           What about the door frames?    The
                           floors?

                                        MARCHAND
                           What did he do: rip open a door frame,
                           hide the gun inside and re-plaster the
                           wall before SWAT showed up?

                                        WILLY
                           What about the neighbors' property?
                           He could have thrown it over the
                           hedges.

                                         MARCHAND
                           We checked.
                                  (Beat)
                           He might have passed it off to
                           somebody, Willy. Had an accomplice,
                           waiting, out the back.
               Willy shakes his head, grim.    Pacing.

               

                                                                            61

               

               

                                        WILLY
                           This isn't an accomplice sort of guy.
               He slows. Looking across the room at the big Rube Goldberg
               device. As he moves toward it:

                                        WILLY
                           This is a...guy who likes to show off.
               He examines the intricate workings, eyes travelling the
               clutter of metal and wires and motors.
               Checks Marchand - who shakes his head.

                                         WILLY
                           You sure?

                                         MARCHAND
                           I'm sure.
               Willy grimaces.   Fuming, relentless:

                                        WILLY
                           It's a physical object. It can't just
                           vanish. We're missing something -
                           some step in the story.
               He begins walking through the crime, "the stations of the
               cross" - re-enacting it, starting from the front door,
               methodical, reciting it to himself:

                                        WILLY
                           The neighbor sees her get home. He's
                           already inside. She lets herself in.
                           A minute or two later: blood-pattern
                           says she's standing over there - he's
                           somewhere around here.
               Willy stands where Crawford was.     Raises a finger-gun.

                                         WILLY
                           Boom.
               As Willy goes to where Jennifer fell:

                                        MARCHAND
                           But then he carries her back there.
                           Why?
               Willy walks along the path defined by the drops of blood:

               

                                                                             62

               

               

                                        WILLY
                           Because he's gonna need time. To
                           confess. When she's alone with the
                           cop.
               Willy stops in the alcove, looking down at the dried blood,
               the discarded paramedic-supply-wrappers.

                                        MARCHAND
                           Neighbor comes to the door.
               Willy nods, comes out - crosses to the foyer:

                                        WILLY
                           Crawford shouts, "Leave us alone" and
                           fires three more rounds: boom-boom-
                           boom.

                                        MARCHAND
                           So everybody knows he's dangerous -
                           and she might still be alive.

                                         WILLY
                           So they'll call the Negotiator.
                                  (Beat)
                           Now he's got about ten minutes.
               And that's it. He stands there with the imaginary gun in his
               hand. Looking around. Trying to think like Crawford.
               He can't.

                                        MARCHAND
                           I'm sorry, Willy.
               Willy won't respond - because accepting the apology means
               admitting he's got nothing left.

               


               INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LATER

               It's night. The house is empty. Except for Willy, turning
               on lights as he gets to each room, turning them off as he
               leaves.

                                        WILLY (V.O.)
                           Do you dare stay out?
                           Do you dare go in?
               Studying framed photos: Jennifer - now and then with Crawford -
               in Italy, Bermuda, Colorado. Always a bit posed and formal
               when they're together.

               

                                                                             63

               

               

                                        WILLY (V.O.)
                           And IF you go in -
                           Should you turn left or right?
                           Or right and three-quarters?
                           Or maybe not quite.

               


               INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - BATHROOM - SOON AFTER

               Checking the contents of the medicine cabinet.

                                        WILLY (V.O.)
                           You can get so confused that you'll
                             start in to race,
                           Down long wiggled roads at break-
                             necking pace
               No longer really looking for the gun.   He's looking for
               insight. Contact. A way in.

               


               INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - DRESSING ROOM - SOON AFTER

               Willy wanders through Jennifer's spacious dressing room.

                                         WILLY (V.O.)
                           And grind on for miles across weirdish
                             wild space,
                           Headed I fear, toward a most useless
                             place.
               He idly surveys the vanity, cluttered with cosmetics, skin-
               care products. Lifts her perfume, sniffs.

                                        WILLY (V.O.)
                           The Waiting Place...
                           For people just waiting.
                           Waiting for a train to go
                           Or a bus to come, or a plane to go
               Notices a storage box on the floor, left partly-open in the
               search. He shifts the lid aside.

                                        WILLY (V.O.)
                           Or the mail to come, or the rain to go
                           Or the phone to ring, or the snow to
                           snow
               A high-school yearbook. An old photo album. A teddy bear.
               A snow-globe. A well-worn book by Dr. Seuss.

               

                                                                             64

               

               

                                        WILLY (V.O.)
                           Or waiting around for a Yes or No
                           Or waiting for their hair to grow.
                           Everyone is just waiting.
               Willy stares down at the souvenirs of a lost life.

               


               INT. HOSPITAL - I.C.U. - NIGHT

               The room is dim, and silent except for the hiss-click of the
               respirator, the monotonous beep of the heart monitor.

                                        WILLY (V.O.)
                           Waiting for the fish to bite
                           Or waiting for wind to fly a kite
                           Or waiting around for Friday night
                           Or waiting perhaps for their Uncle
                             Jake
               Jennifer Crawford lies with her head wrapped in gauze, eyes
               shut, plastic tubing down her throat held in place with tape.
               Willy sits beside her bed, reading Dr. Seuss:

                                        WILLY
                           Or a pot to boil, or a Better Break
                           Or a string of pearls, or a pair of
                             pants
                           Or a wig with curls...
                           Or Another Chance.
               He stops reading a moment.   Watching her:

                                        RESIDENT (O.S.)
                           What are you doing?
               Willy turns. A work-weary RESIDENT comes past him to check
               the I.V.'s and monitors. He's about Willy's age.

                                        WILLY
                           I heard it might - help - if somebody
                           talked to her.

                                        RESIDENT
                           Who told you that?

                                        WILLY
                                  (Reluctantly)
                           The man who shot her.
               The RESIDENT looks up at Willy - who shrugs, uncomfortable.

               

                                                                     65

               

               

                                        WILLY
                           Is there any chance...she might come
                           out of this?

                                        RESIDENT
                           Are you a member of the family?

                                         WILLY
                                  (Getting out ID)
                           Sorry. I'm with the District
                           Attorney's office.
                                  (Beat)
                           We don't have any other witnesses.

                                        RESIDENT
                           This woman had a bullet plow through
                           her brain.

                                         WILLY
                           I know. But you hear about people
                           waking up from comas. After everybody
                           said pull the plug - they wake up.
                                  (Beat)
                           You hear stuff like that all the time.

                                         RESIDENT
                           You hear about Elvis and Aliens, too.
                           All the time.

                                        WILLY
                           It's not impossible, though. Is it?
                           I mean - why else are you keeping her
                           like this?
               Beat.   The Resident sighs.

                                          RESIDENT
                            No. It's not impossible. But even if
                            she did, she might not remember how to
                            talk - let alone anything about how
                            she was shot.

                                         WILLY
                            When I was here alone before, she
                            moved a little.

                                         RESIDENT
                            Are you just going to keep asking the
                            same question in different ways until
                            you hear the answer you want?
               Beat.

               

                                                                              66

               

               

                                        WILLY
                           That's how it works with the law.

                                        RESIDENT
                           I knew I should have gone to law
                           school.
               Willy watches the Resident go out. Then he looks back down
               at Jennifer. Listening to the machines.

               


               INT. CRAWFORD OFFICE - THE NEXT DAY

               Willy wanders.   Tina, the assistant, waits in the doorway.
               He's trying to conceal the fact that he's on a fishing
               expedition.

                                        WILLY
                           So this is all exactly how he left it.

                                         TINA
                           Yes.
               Browses a wall of framed photos: Crawford at crash sites,
               universities, engineering test-labs - awards, certificates,
               articles from industry publications lauding Crawford as the
               Go-To-Guy for investigating mechanical failures of aircraft.

                                        WILLY
                           And he was - distraught.

                                        TINA
                           He was drinking. The past few weeks.

                                        WILLY
                           But he was working on this.
               He stands over unfinished Rube Goldberg device.   Tools laid
               out on the work table - meticulous, organized.

                                        WILLY
                           All distraught and everything.
               It's not evidence.

                                        TINA
                           Do you want coffee.    He said I should
                           ask.
               Willy turns, a little rattled.    Beat.

               

                                                                          67

               

               

                                         WILLY
                            Tell him I said no thank you.

               


               INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

               The room where Jennifer and Nunally met. Cleaned-up now,
               anonymous, empty. Willy stands looking at it.
               There's nothing to see. He grimaces, nods - heads out, past
               the ASSISTANT MANAGER waiting in the doorway.

               


               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

               As Willy comes out of the room - he slows, noticing the
               little gray plastic surveillance-camera-ball in the ceiling.

                                         WILLY
                            How long do you keep the tapes?

                                             ASSISTANT MANAGER
                            A month.
               Willy considers it.     He's got nothing else to try.

                                         WILLY
                            Can I get a copy of October 9th?

                                         ASSISTANT MANAGER
                            I'll have it for you Friday.

                                         WILLY
                            I'm kind of under the gun here.

                                         ASSISTANT MANAGER
                            We're short-staffed tonight and
                            tomorrow.
               Beat.   Seeing Willy's confusion:

                                             ASSISTANT MANAGER
                            Thanksgiving?
               Willy nods, trying to pretend he hasn't forgotten:

                                             WILLY
                            Right.   Okay.

               

                                                                             68

               

               


               INT. GARDNER HOUSE - DINING ROOM - LATER

               A faux-Tudor Hancock Park dining room.   Wealthy, but lived
               in.
               JUDGE LEWIS GARDNER, your basic Henry Fonda/Jimmy Stewart-
               type patriarch, carves a turkey at the head of a long table,
               wearing a worn and gravy-splattered apron. Platters
               circulate in both directions among Nikki's older siblings
               (BURTON and SANDRA), their spouses, their children.
               Willy sits next to Nikki, who is high-stylish despite the
               fact that she's dressed "casual."

                                        GARDNER
                           White or dark, Willy?

                                        WILLY
                           Anything is fine, your honor.

                                        GARDNER
                           I'm off-duty, you can call me Lew.
               While Gardner piles turkey on a plate and passes it:

                                        WILLY
                           So - is everyone in this family
                           involved in the law?

                                        SANDRA
                           Well, Nikki's not.

                                        NIKKI
                           Ha ha.
                                  (To Willy:)
                           Burton's a counsel for Sierra Club,
                           and Sandra's ACLU - so they use the
                           holidays as an opportunity to give me
                           a hard time, because I can buy and
                           sell them.

                                        SANDRA
                           We're not actually for sale, Nick.
               Nikki gives Willy a did-I-tell-you? look.

                                        GARDNER
                           Nicole decided early-on that black
                           sheep was the most effective role in
                           which to distinguish herself from her
                           siblings.

               

                                                                     69

               

               

                                         NIKKI
                            You know of any other family in
                            America where the corporate lawyer
                            who's going to make partner by thirty-
                            five is the "black sheep"?

                                         GARDNER
                            Well - you may be lost beyond
                            recovery, but maybe we can still
                            convince Willy that defending giant
                            corporations against injured citizens
                            is not the best use of his skills.

                                         WILLY
                            I don't think so, sir.
                                   (smiles)
                            It's where the money is.

                                         GARDNER
                                   (Scolding mildly)
                            I believe that phrase refers to banks.
                            And it was coined by a thief.
               Beat.   Willy remains polite, but won't back down.

                                         WILLY
                            Times have changed.

                                         NIKKI
                                   (To Willy)
                            You don't have to do this.

                                          WILLY
                            I don't mind; I get this kind of thing
                            now and then.
                                   (to Gardner)
                            Almost always from people with money.

                                         GARDNER
                            Appearances can be deceiving, Willy.
                            I grew up with eight brothers and
                            sisters on a farm up in Fresno, and I
                            promise you I saw my share of hard
                            times.
               Willy considers his options.

                                         WILLY
                            My mom OD'd fairly frequently, so they
                            put me in a Group Home. My younger
                            sister is dead and my older brother is
                            doing twenty-five-to-life.

               

                                                                       70

               

               
               Awkward silence.

                                             GARDNER
                             You win.
               Beat.   Willy looks down, begins to eat again.

                                             WILLY
                             I usually do.

                                            GARDNER
                                      (Gently)
                             Yes.    I see that.

                                          BURTON
                             I don't know if you will against the
                             wife-shooter, though.
               The click of silverware.

                                             SANDRA
                             Whoops.

                                             NIKKI
                             Nice, Burton.
               Beat.   Willy looks up at Burton, steady.     Shrugs.

                                          WILLY
                             It's not over 'til it's over.

                                          BURTON
                             That looked pretty over.

                                          NIKKI
                             Anyway, Willy's been taken off the
                             case.

                                          GARDNER
                             It might not seem like it now, but
                             that's a blessing in disguise, Willy.
               Willy nods.   Beat.     To Nikki, uncomfortable:

                                             WILLY
                             I wasn't.
               Nikki looks at Willy.

                                             NIKKI
                             What?

               

                                                                          71

               

               

                                         WILLY
                           Taken off.

                                        NIKKI
                           That...doesn't make any sense.
                           Lobruto has to do some kind of damage
                           control -

                                         WILLY
                            I asked him not to.
               Silence.   Nikki is staring at him.    Angry.

                                         NIKKI
                            You are really stupid, did you know
                            that?
               Willy doesn't know how to handle this; everyone else tries to
               be polite, eating and pretending not to notice.

                                         WILLY
                            I'm - getting new evidence -

                                         NIKKI
                            Where? The Evidence Store?! Oh,
                            that's right - they open early the day
                            after Thanksgiving. You're gonna be
                            fine!

                                         WILLY
                            Did it ever occur to you I might be
                            good enough to still win?!

                                          NIKKI
                                        Who cares?!
                            Win what?

                                         WILLY
                            The man shot his -

                                         NIKKI
                            You wanted corporate, right?! You
                            wanted to play in the big leagues?!

                                         WILLY
                            Yeah, I'm just -

                                         NIKKI
                            You go to all that trouble getting
                            yourself in - and then you just pay no
                            attention to wh-

               

                                                                             72

               

               

                                        WILLY
                           Look - I'm sorry - can we not talk
                           about this here?!
               Nikki stops. Refusing to look around.     Ashamed at losing
               control, turns back to her food:

                                        NIKKI
                           Fine.

                                        WILLY
                           Thank you.
               Everyone eats in silence a moment - then Nikki tosses down
               her napkin:

                                        NIKKI
                           I need to talk with you.
               She gets up and walks out of the room. With an awkward
               glance around, Willy excuses himself and follows her.

               


               EXT. GARDNER HOUSE - FOYER - CONTINUOUS


                                        WILLY
                           Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell you -

                                        NIKKI
                           Did you hear me, when I said Bob
                           wanted you gone as soon as this thing
                           broke?! Did you hear me say I went
                           out on a limb to convince him -

                                        WILLY
                           Wouldn't it be better than damage
                           control if I actually turn it around?

                                        NIKKI
                           And what if you don't?
               Willy has no answer. He doesn't think that way. And she
               sees that. She sees a young man from Oklahoma, in way over
               his head. Desperate to get through:

                                         NIKKI
                           You don't get it at all, do you?! You
                           pulled a stunt to get yourself this
                           job. Fine: you're a hot-shot!
                                  (Beat)
                           Wooton Sims does not need hot-shots.
                           Because you don't win. The firm wins.
                           Bob wins.

                                         (MORE)

               

                                                                           73

               

               
                                          NIKKI (cont'd)
                                   (Beat)
                            And you just put yourself head-to-head
                            in conflict with Bob.
               Silence.   Shaken:

                                         WILLY
                            What am I supposed to do?

                                         NIKKI
                            We told the man you're getting on a
                            plane to Chicago, Tuesday.
               Painful silence.

                                            WILLY
                            Yeah.   Okay.
               Nikki watches him dealing with it, sympathetic. The
               impossible feelings always running under the surface for them
               have developed a darker, aching tone. If anything, stronger.

                                         WILLY
                            I think maybe I'm gonna go now.

                                          NIKKI
                            All right.
                                   (Beat)
                            Call if you want.
               He nods. Neither one moves. Judge Gardner enters cautiously
               from the dining room - breaking the spell.
               Nikki nods goodbye to Willy, and goes out quickly without
               meeting her father's eye. Awkward pause.

                                         WILLY
                            I've got some work to do.
                            I need to call a cab.
               Gardner nods respectfully, but doesn't move quite yet.
               Studying the torn-up young man.

                                         GARDNER
                            You know what nobody understands about
                            certain kinds of underpaid public
                            service work? Now and then you get to
                            put a fucking stake in a bad guy's
                            heart. We're not supposed to talk
                            about that when we visit a third-grade
                            class on Career Day, and it doesn't
                            get you very far into the country-club
                            locker room - but it's hard to beat
                            when you actually get to do it.

               

                                                                               74

               

               
               Willy looks at the kindly old judge, a little surprised.
               Gardner shrugs: my two cents.      He goes to a side-table, finds
               the Yellow Pages.

               


               INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT

               Empty.   Dark.   Willy lets himself in.
               He looks for the light-switch - finds only a complex
               computerized dimmer-panel. He tries it.
               Accent lights come on, buried in the living room planters.
               He can't get any other pre-sets to work.
               The crime scene is creepy, lit like that. The dried blood is
               black. Shadows stretch up the walls, strange.
               Willy grimaces, moves through it - sees another panel by the
               French doors to the garden. Goes over -
               - and jumps back, startled -

                                          WILLY
                            Shit!
               - by Nunally, on the other side of the glass.
               Catching his breath, Willy stares. He unlocks the French
               doors and Nunally steps in, uneasy, haggard.

                                         WILLY
                            The hell are you doing here?
               Nunally looks around - taking a pint bottle from his overcoat
               pocket, uncapping it.

                                         NUNALLY
                            We need to talk.
               He drinks, then offers the bottle.     Willy hesitates, takes
               it. As he drinks:

                                         NUNALLY
                            We have to find the gun.
               Willy winces at the liquor and the remark, hands back the
               bottle.

                                         WILLY
                            Thank you, Professor Einstein. It
                            would also be good to find a couple of

                                         (MORE)

               

                                                                                 75

               

               
                                        WILLY (cont'd)
                           eyewitnesses. If one could be the
                           Dalai Lama, it would be even better.

                                           NUNALLY
                              No - Willy: we need to find the gun.

                                           WILLY
                              I've had three different teams here -

                                            NUNALLY
                              He didn't leave between the shooting
                              and when we took him out in cuffs.
                              The gun is here.
                                     (beat)
                              So we have to find it.

                                           WILLY
                              Well - we can't! You want to move on?
               Nunally tosses something from an inside pocket of the coat -
               - Willy catches it.       A Heckler & Koch nine-millimeter in a
               plastic bag.
               Willy stares down at it. Then at Nunally, who holds up: a
               bullet, deformed by impact.

                                           NUNALLY
                              There's a guy in the Evidence Room,
                              owes me a favor. Well - it's not so
                              much a favor as I know stuff about
                              him. He can trade this for the bullet
                              from Jennifer, give us a ballistic
                              match.
               Beat.

                                             WILLY
                              It's a crime.

                                           NUNALLY
                              So who's gonna get away with a crime -
                              this asshole, or us?
               Willy sighs.    Tosses the gun back.

                                             WILLY
                              Go home.

                                           NUNALLY
                              What else have you got?!

                                           WILLY
                              I'll find a way.

               

                                                                                  76

               

               
               Beat.

                                           NUNALLY
                           No you won't.
               Willy watches Nunally stalk out through the big, strangely-
               lit room. The front door opens, and slams.
               A little worried, Willy takes a deep breath.       Gets to work.
               He still has three days to break this open.
               Walking through the crime again.
               Playing it out in his mind. Standing in different places,
               getting different perspectives.
               Willy stands in the alcove.    Looking around.
               There's something here.     But he can't get it.
               His eye falls on the Rube Goldberg device.       Moves closer,
               peering into the mechanism.
               Turns away: no gun. But now he's facing the big wooden bowl
               of ball-bearings, sitting out in the middle of the room on
               the coffee table.
               Hide in plain sight.
               He walks over - pushes his fingers in, feels around.
               Nope. He sighs. Takes a ball-bearing, rolls it in his hand.
               Goes to the device - drops the ball in the slot.
               The machine is amazing. The ball rolls and leaps and
               clatters - lights flash, elevators rise and fall, at one
               point the ball lifts on a jet of compressed air - then it
               spirals out of sight and reappears somewhere unexpected -
               - until at the end the ball suddenly catapults out and sails
               across the living room -
               - to land neatly back in the bowl on the coffee table.
               Willy grimaces.   This guy is really good.

               


               INT. MARCHAND'S OFFICE - S.I.D. - SUNDAY AFTERNOON

               A mess of courtroom exhibits, copies of evidence, lists,
               depositions, photos, diagrams, take-out food containers and
               coffee cups.

               

                                                                            77

               

               
               Marchand surveys it.    The bleary end of a long day - sifting
               clues, dead-ends.

                                           MARCHAND
                           Willy.     There's nothing here.
               Willy has barely slept all weekend. He shakes his head,
               reviewing the hotel surveillance tapes on a VCR/TV, stubborn.

                                        WILLY
                           Guns don't just walk out of crime
                           scenes.
               Marchand waves copies of Crawford's evidence - stills printed
               from home-video Dick took at a hostage negotiation: Nunally
               doing his job, his methods, his routine.

                                        MARCHAND
                           Two months before he shot his wife,
                           this guy had his investigator watching
                           the cop at work. He knew exactly how
                           it would go down - and he didn't leave
                           any loose ends.

                                        WILLY
                           Then what is this:
               Willy uses the remote. On the TV, in black-and-white:
               Jennifer and Nunally come out of their room and head for the
               pool - indistinct figures zip jerkily in and out of rooms on
               fast-forward -
               - until he slows it: Crawford comes to let himself in.

                                        WILLY
                           Hotel surveillance.     From that day.
                           He was there. Why?
               Marchand watches over Willy's shoulder.    Shrugs.

                                        MARCHAND
                           Had to see it for himself.

                                           WILLY
                           See what?     They were out at the pool.

                                        MARCHAND
                           The unmade bed. Her panties. Man's
                           gonna shoot his wife in the head, he
                           needs to get himself all worked up.
               Willy stares at the grainy black-and-white figure emerging
               from the room, walking away down the corridor. Unconvinced:

               

                                                                               78

               

               

                                           WILLY
                           Yeah.     Worked up.
               Marchand gets his jacket, pulls it on.

                                        MARCHAND
                           Willy, go home. Tomorrow you go back
                           into court and take your lumps - then
                           you start your cushy new life, and you
                           forget all about this one.
                                  (Hoping to get a smile:)
                           And then you can lend me money and
                           shit.
               Willy says nothing.    Runs the tape back and then slow-motions
               it forward again.
               Marchand goes out.    Leaving Willy alone, watching Crawford.

                                                             DISSOLVE TO:

               


               INT. WILLY'S APARTMENT - VERY LATE THAT NIGHT

               Willy stands over crime scene photos and diagrams spread out
               on his narrow futon. "Walking the scene" again, on paper.
               The whole apartment is an array of law books, notes,
               exhibits, marked-up depositions.
               He's staring at evidence he's already stared at a hundred
               times.
               He grinds the palms of his hands into his eye sockets, a dull
               moan rising into a yell -
               - as he sweeps everything off his bed in a storm of paper -
               throwing books - tearing up printouts - pulling out drawers,
               emptying them, smashing them on the desk -
               - yelling in a frenzy until his throat is hoarse, his shabby
               garage apartment is trashed, and he's sitting, exhausted, in
               his chair.
               There's a knock on the door.
               Willy frowns, checking the clock: it's two-thirty a.m.   He
               goes to open it -
               - revealing Nunally, standing in the darkness, a haunted
               shadow of the boyish confident cop we met making love to
               Jennifer Crawford.

               

                                                                             79

               

               

                                        NUNALLY
                           It's done. In the tool shed: taped to
                           the blade, inside the lawn-mower.
               Before Willy can say anything - Nunally walks away.
               Willy doesn't move.   Watching the tormented cop disappear
               down the alley.

               


               INT. DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - BULLPEN - THE NEXT MORNING

               Willy - in a clean suit and crisp suit, carrying his
               briefcase - hurries through, paying no attention to the
               SECRETARIES and OTHER D.D.A.s who watch like he's on his way
               to his own execution.
               At his office door, he gestures for Mona to come in with him.
               Surprised, she gets up - taking with her an envelope with a
               messenger-receipt taped to the front.

               


               INT. WILLY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

               Mona watches Willy shut the door behind her.

                                           MONA
                           You okay?

                                         WILLY
                           Yeah.  Maybe.
                                  (Hesitates)
                           Can I ask you to do something for me
                           this morning?

                                           MONA
                           Sure.

                                        WILLY
                           Write down your cell number.
                                  (As she does)
                           Once my trial is in session, wait
                           outside. I might call - and just hang
                           up. If I do, I want you to come into
                           court and whisper to me that we got a
                           tip about the murder weapon.

                                           MONA
                           You found it?
               Beat.

               

                                                                             80

               

               

                                        WILLY
                           I haven't decided yet.
               Mona studies Willy - then accepts it's don't-ask-don't-tell,
               hands him her number. Willy nods, grateful.
               Turning for the door, she remembers the envelope in her hand.

                                        MONA
                           Oh: this came for you.
               He takes it, and as she leaves, checks the return address:
               Wooton Sims.
               Willy grimaces, opens it. Inside are an airline ticket to
               Chicago - first class - and a handwritten note, on Wooton
               Sims stationery:
                             We only win the favor of the Gods
                                   by making a sacrifice
                                      See you tomorrow
                                           - Nikki
               He stands in his empty office, considering the ticket and the
               note.

               


               INT. COURTHOUSE - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

               Willy steps off the elevator, into a crowd of REPORTERS AND
               SPECTATORS outside the courtroom.
               He's startled for a moment: it's worse than he expected - the
               dense buzz of talk in the marble corridor and all the eyes
               tracking him like he's walking into an arena - a freakshow
               performer -
               - but he doesn't slow, ignoring the comments and questions,
               avoiding eye contact -
               - until he sees Nunally by the courtroom doors, his eyes
               fixed on Willy.
               Willy meets Nunally's gaze...moving on, giving back nothing.
               Nunally watches Willy disappear into the courtroom, stares at
               the closing doors - uncertain, on edge. Lost, no matter
               which way this goes.

               

                                                                             81

               

               


               INT. COURTROOM - SOON AFTER

               Mr. Gifford, the Crawford's neighbor, is on the stand.   Willy
               questions him, standing by the Prosecution Table.
               Behind him, the court is standing-room-only. REPORTERS,
               SKETCH ARTISTS, SPECTATORS. Nunally, sitting near the front.
               Lobruto, standing at the back.
               Crawford writes intently on a legal pad, filling pages with
               dense scribble.

                                        WILLY
                           So - between the time you heard the
                           first gunshot and called 911, and the
                           time of Mr. Crawford's arrest - you
                           had the Crawford house in view?

                                       GIFFORD
                           Yes. I was very concerned about
                           Jennifer. She was a lovely woman.

                                        WILLY
                           No one but Thomas Crawford came in or
                           out?

                                        GIFFORD
                           That's correct.

                                        WILLY
                           Thank you, Mr. Gifford.    No further
                           questions.

                                           JUDGE ROBINSON
                           Mr. Crawford?
               Crawford glances up at the Judge. Then at Gifford, as if
               he's just noticed him up there. Beat. Without getting up:

                                        CRAWFORD
                           Did you see the guy run out the back
                           door?

                                           GIFFORD
                           What..."guy"?

                                        CRAWFORD
                           The other guy. The one who shot my
                           wife. Did you see him run out the
                           back of the house, carrying the gun?
               Willy closes his eyes.   Gifford grimaces.

               

                                                                           82

               

               

                                        GIFFORD
                           I couldn't see the back of the house.
                                  (Trying to salvage it:)
                           I believe...the police went around
                           back when they arrived.

                                        CRAWFORD
                           No further questions.
               Willy immediately stands:

                                        WILLY
                           Re-direct, your honor.
               But Crawford is standing too - with his handful of pages:

                                        CRAWFORD
                           I've also written a motion to dismiss.

                                        WILLY
                           Objection - I'm on re-direct!
               The Judge hesitates.   Both men standing.

                                        JUDGE ROBINSON
                           On what grounds, Mr. Crawford?

                                        CRAWFORD
                           The prosecutor doesn't have any actual
                           evidence.

                                        WILLY
                           I'm in the middle of presenting -

                                        CRAWFORD
                           All of his witnesses are going to
                           testify to the same facts: that my
                           wife was shot and that I was,
                           tragically, in the house at the time
                           ...a witness - and, in a way, a victim
                           myself. I'll stipulate to Mr.
                           Slocum's entire witness list right
                           now, a request a directed verdict or
                           dismissal, per California versus
                           Collier, 1982, and the Appellate court
                           decision, v. Watrus, 486.19.
               Willy stares at Crawford, stunned. As the Judge reluctantly
               nods to the Bailiff to collect Crawford's pages and opens a
               law book:

               

                                                                                 83

               

               

                                        JUDGE
                           Your legal skills seem to have
                           improved over the long weekend, Mr.
                           Crawford.
               While the Judge checks the citations, Crawford glances at
               Willy. Amused.
               Beat. Willy looks down - reaches into his briefcase, moves
               his cell-phone out from under some papers. To where he can
               get it easily.
               Looks back up at Crawford.   Smiles slightly.

                                         JUDGE ROBINSON
                           Mr. Slocum?
               Willy and Crawford turn to the Judge.

                                        JUDGE ROBINSON
                           Have you got any new evidence?
               Beat.

                                        WILLY
                           May I have a moment, your honor?
               The Judge nods.
               Willy nods down. Trying to focus. He's got nothing, and
               everyone in the room knows it. He can hear it, he can feel
               it. There's a restless, hungry edge to the crowded
               courtroom.
               He stares into his open briefcase: the cell phone.
               Next to it: the first class ticket and Nikki's note.
               Willy glances back at the gallery. Nunally's eyes burn into
               him. In the back: Lobruto frowns, concerned.

                                         JUDGE ROBINSON
                           Mr. Slocum?
               Willy turns back to his briefcase.     He breathes.   Press the
               MENU button - selects SPEED DIAL.
               On the tiny screen, a list of names.    Selected: MONA/CELL.

               

                                                                                84

               

               


               INT. COURTHOUSE - CORRIDOR - THE SAME TIME

               Mona sits on a bench, a few steps down the corridor from the
               courtroom doors. Cell phone in her hand.

               


               INT. COURTROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Willy stands at the Prosecution Table.       Hearing his own
               pulse.
               Crawford studies Willy, curious.

                                        CRAWFORD
                           Your honor? Can we signal the
                           prosecutor from here on planet Earth?
               Willy's fingertip hovers over the cell phone keypad.       Press,
               and a path is chosen. Possibly for life.
               Next to the cell-phone, the ticket and the note.       See you
               tomorrow.
               Nunally sits forward.    Lobruto is watching intently.
               Willy doesn't move.

                                           JUDGE ROBINSON
                           Mr. Slocum?     Now or never.
               Willy won't look up.
               Nunally stares, agonized.
               Willy grimaces slightly, as if he feels his soul burning up,
               turning to ash and blowing away -
               - nods, closing the cell phone, sliding it under Nikki's
               note. Shuts the briefcase. Looks at the Judge.

                                        WILLY
                           I have no further evidence at this
                           time, your honor.
               Crawford begins to smile.
               Lobruto looks down.    A buzz rises in the gallery -
               - as Nunally gets up, furious - stalks to the doors, slams
               out.

               

                                                                              85

               

               
               Judge Robinson looks at Willy a moment - then at Crawford,
               who has been waiting, calm and polite. Very reluctantly:

                                         JUDGE ROBINSON
                            Motion to dismiss is granted.
               Uproar.   The Judge bangs his gavel -

                                        JUDGE ROBINSON
                            Order! The jury is released, with our
                            apologies -
               - practically shouting over the chaos - REPORTERS hastily
               heading for the doors, pulling out cell phones -

                                         JUDGE ROBINSON
                            - and the Defendant is free to go.
               Crawford gives the Judge a gentlemanly bow of the head.
               Willy begins to pack his papers into the briefcase.   Refusing
               to look up.
               The Judge and the Bailiff might be saying other things, but
               no one is listening - SPECTATORS swarm up the aisles, out to
               the hallway - and the Court starts to close down.
               Crawford comes over to Willy, holds out a hand.
               Willy looks him in the eye.   Doesn't move.   Crawford shrugs.

                                         CRAWFORD
                            Even a broken clock gets to be right
                            twice a day.
               He winks, and heads up the aisle.
               As Willy watches Crawford go out the doors into a clamor of
               lenses, hand-held mikes, white-hot halogen glare and flashes -
               - he hears a buzzing noise. Looks down at his briefcase,
               moves the papers aside: his cell phone is vibrating.
               Willy stares at it, as if he'd forgotten the thing could be

               INT. WOOTON SIMS - NIKKI'S OFFICE - THE SAME TIME

               Nikki sits at her beautiful desk with stellar views out the
               windows behind her.

                                            NIKKI
                              Hey, you.

                                            WILLY
                                      (It's an effort)
                              Hey.

                                           NIKKI
                              What did you think - I wasn't keeping
                              tabs?

                                           WILLY
                              I don't know what I thought.
               Awkward silence.      She tries to get past it:

                                           NIKKI
                              Listen: what do you say I take you out
                              tonight and get you completely
                              trashed? Tomorrow's just a travel da-
               - there's a gun shot outside the courtroom.
               Willy turns.    Shocked.    Screams and shouting in the corridor.

                                            WILLY
                              Hang on -
               We move with Willy as he shuts the phone and heads for the
               doors - faster, pushing out -

               


               INT. COURTHOUSE - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

               - into the echoing chaos of the corridor - trying to move in
               the crowd -
               - shoving through to where people are yelling and clustered
               around a figure lying on the floor.
               Willy pushes closer, until he catches glimpses of:
               Nunally.   Lying on the marble floor. His gun in his lifeless
               fingers.   Blood all over, from his head.
               Willy stops pushing. Won't let himself look away - the
               screams and commotion around him retreating into a numb blur.

               

                                                                             87

               

               
               Then suddenly Willy looks up - as if he's been called -
               - to find Crawford, standing very still, in the crowd, on the
               other side of the body. Everyone else is moving, talking,
               gawking at the body or averting their eyes -
               - except Crawford.   He's looking straight at Willy.
               Pleased.   Triumphant.
               Willy stares into Crawford's eyes.

               


               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - LATE THAT NIGHT

               The life support system clicks and hisses and beeps.
               Jennifer is curled into a fetal position, despite the tubes
               and wires.
               Willy sits by her bed. Still in his suit from court, the
               jacket off, the tie loose.
               He's been there a while.   But now he speaks.

                                           WILLY
                            Your husband said something...that I
                            can't seem to shake loose of. He said
                            I'm a winner.
                                    (Beat)
                            And he's right. I can't lose. I
                            can't stand people who lose.
                                    (Beat)
                            I may have been working so hard to put
                            some distance between me and...people
                            like you - that maybe I messed up. I
                            don't know if did anything wrong.
                            Or what I should have done. I really
                            don't know, any more...what I'm
                            supposed to do.
                                    (Beat)
                            But I feel like I let you down.
                            Somehow in the...process. And if I
                            did, I'm sorry. That's all. I just -
                            I hope you...have...just, some...
                                    (Beat)
                            Anyway.
               He feels stupid. Takes a breath.     Looking at her pale,
               drawn, comatose face.
               He stands, goes to get his jacket, lying folded on a table by
               the door. Pulls it on, settles the shoulders, tugs at his
               cuffs. Gets his briefcase.

               

                                                                            88

               

               
               He goes to the door, and as he opens it - he looks back.
               Freezes.
               Jennifer's eyes are wide open.
               She's staring at him.   Willy stands, breathless, watching
               her.

               


               INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - LATER

               Sliding glass doors suck open, Willy walks with the Resident
               from the other night:

                                        WILLY
                           She was looking at me.

                                        RESIDENT
                           Yeah, I understand -

                                        WILLY
                           No, she was looking at me.

               

               CLOSE UP - JENNIFER'S EYEBALL
               A beam of light slides across it.

               


               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               The Resident tucks his flashlight in a pocket, draws a pin
               from his lapel. Gently sticks Jennifer's cheek. Willy
               winces, watching.

                                        WILLY
                           She's reacting.
               The Resident ignores him. Pricks her forehead - her chin -
               her big toe. Each time she twitches. He runs his thumb
               along the sole of Jennifer's bare foot. It arches up.

                                         WILLY
                           You see?

                                        RESIDENT
                           The normal reflex goes downward.   Up
                           indicates brain trauma.

                                        WILLY
                           She's in there. She was looking at
                           me.

               

                                                                            89

               

               
               The Resident sighs.   Sympathetic, but plain:

                                        RESIDENT
                           Sometimes we have to tape their eyes
                           shut. They all move - they make
                           sounds, they twitch. You think
                           they're dreaming. But they're not.
                           It's just what's left of the system,
                           sending broken signals.

                                        WILLY
                           Can we do other tests? Like an M.R.I.
                           or something? And I want a coma
                           specialist to see her.

                                        RESIDENT
                           You're not authorized to order tes-

                                        WILLY
                           I'll get you authorization.      First
                           thing tomorrow.
               The Resident studies Willy.   Reluctantly:

                                        RESIDENT
                           You get the paperwork, I'll do what I
                           can.
               Willy nods, grateful. As the Resident heads out, Willy sits
               by Jennifer's bed - protective, intent.

               


               INT. HOSPITAL - LOBBY - THE NEXT MORNING

               Crawford comes in through the lobby: rested, well-dressed.   A
               free man. He slows, surprised -
               - seeing Willy come off the elevators. Willy hasn't left
               Jennifer's bedside. He's in the same suit and carrying his
               briefcase from the courthouse.

                                         CRAWFORD
                           Mr. Slocum.

                                        WILLY
                           Just...visiting.

                                        CRAWFORD
                           This isn't like you at all.

                                         WILLY
                           No?

               

                                                                      90

               

               

                                          CRAWFORD
                             You haven't got anything to gain.

                                           WILLY
                             Oh - right. That's my weak spot.
                                    (Beat)
                             Ever think about what yours might be?
                             Your flaw?

                                          CRAWFORD
                             Of course I have.
                                    (Leans in)
                             The truth about me is, Willy...I'm
                             really not very nice.
               Willy nods.    Concealing the ace up his sleeve.

                                          WILLY
                             You sure do know a lot, though. Got
                             everybody all figured out, everything
                             set up, like one of your contraptions.
                             Then you just sit back and watch it
                             all fall right where you want it to.
                             Must be kind of...boring. At that
                             point.

                                           CRAWFORD
                             Not an ounce of sympathy, Willy?
                                    (Beat)
                             Imagine it - imagine she was yours.
                             And you knew you were losing her.
                                    (beat)
                             Imagine days. Weeks. Going through
                             her desk. Her purse. Her closet.
                             Alone. Staring at her clothes. Her
                             shoes. Knowing this is what it will
                             be like. After.
                                    (beat)
                             Do you have any idea how hard it was
                             to go on living - with her - every
                             day, knowing?

                                          WILLY
                             But you had to, right? You needed
                             time to set it all up...your "crime of
                             passion."

                                          CRAWFORD
                             There are many kinds of passion,
                             Willy.

               

                                                                              91

               

               

                                          WILLY
                            Yeah.  There are.
                                   (Beat)
                            So - thank you.
               Crawford frowns.     Starting to feel wary.   Willy sees it.
               Enjoys it.

                                          WILLY
                            For sharing your wisdom. All your
                            little helpful bits of information.
                                   (Beat)
                            You were right.

                                           CRAWFORD
                            About...?

                                         WILLY
                            Talking to her.
               Beat.   Willy winks.    He goes past Crawford and out the doors.
               Crawford doesn't move - except to turn and watch Willy.
               Uncertain, for the first time since we've met him.

               


               INT. WOOTON SIMS - RECEPTION - LATER THAT MORNING

               Willy - still unshaved, unslept, in yesterday's suit - comes
               off the elevator, fishing out ID as he passes a RECEPTIONIST:

                                         WILLY
                            Hi, I'm just -
               - going directly to the key-card slot by the glass double-
               doors to the rest of the floor. He swipes his card and pulls
               the handle -
               - but it stays locked.     Willy swipes his card again.   No go.

                                         WILLY
                            Excuse me - I'm new, I just started -
                            and there's something wrong with my
                            card. Can you buzz me in?

                                         RECEPTIONIST
                            Who are you here to see?

                                           WILLY
                            I work here.    Willy Slocum.    I'm new -
               He stops, realizing how he must look.

               

                                                                             92

               

               

                                        WILLY
                           Nikki Gardner. Willy Slocum, for
                           Nikki Gardner.
               As he calls in, Willy sees Nikki through the doors - one of
               a half-dozen ASSOCIATES trailing in the wake of BOB WOOTON.
               They all carry expensive business luggage, except Wooton -
               who is powerful, perfectly groomed, and two decades older.

                                        WILLY
                           Wait a second - never mind, here she
                           is, thank you.
               Willy goes toward the glass doors as Wooton comes through -
               nodding deferentially to the boss, semi-apologetic:

                                        WILLY
                           Hey...Bob -
                                  (To Nikki)
                           Can I talk to you for a second?
               Wooton glances back at Nikki, eyes saying: don't take long.
               She nods as Wooton and the team continue to the elevators -
               staying back by the glass doors to talk with Willy:

                                        WILLY
                           You let him know what happened last
                           night?

                                         NIKKI
                           I told him.

                                        WILLY
                           Great - who do I work with on it while
                           you're gone?

                                        NIKKI
                           You don't work with anyone.

                                        WILLY
                           Nikki: the man has power-of-attorney
                           and a health-care proxy, he can
                           disconnect her life-support whenever
                           he wants. If we don't move fast -
               Nikki explodes - but quietly, not wanting the team to hear:

                                        NIKKI
                           Jesus, Willy, wake up! It's over!
                           What is wrong with you - it's first
                           year law: that woman could fully
                           recover and swear he shot her and it

                                        (MORE)

               

                                                                           93

               

               
                                       NIKKI (cont'd)
                          wouldn't matter. Double jeopardy!
                          You can't take him back into court!

                                        WILLY
                           I told you - we bring a civil suit -

                                        NIKKI
                           You've got no standing.

                                        WILLY
                           It doesn't have to stick: we just need
                           to get a court order for now - to keep
                           Crawford from pulling the plug! With
                           all the brain-power here, I'm sure
                           somebody can come up with a pretext or
                           call in a favor. Then we can tie this
                           up in court while we arrange a state-
                           appointed conservatorship - so we can
                           protect her while we fight him on -

                                        NIKKI
                           What's the point, Willy?

                                           WILLY
                           The point?!
               Willy stares. Because she's drawn a line in the sand. One
               he already crossed, without truly understanding...and now
               he's standing out there alone - feeling the sand slither away
               under his feet.

                                        WILLY
                           This man is going to kill his wife.

                                           NIKKI
                           Yeah.
                                  (Beat)
                           What does that have to do with Wooton
                           Sims?
               Willy just breathes.   Vulnerable like we have never seen him
               before.
               He looks across the big reception area, at Wooton and the
               team of associates. Some look away.

                                           NIKKI
                           I warned you.

                                        WILLY
                           No, this is insane.

                                        NIKKI
                           It's what it is.

               

                                                                                94

               

               
               Ding!   The elevator.    Nikki grimaces, frustrated - and sad:

                                            NIKKI
                            I warned you.
               She starts for the elevators, Willy following -

                                         WILLY
                            You're not really just gonna let this
                            happen, are you?!

                                         NIKKI
                            Oh I'm supposed to lose my job over
                            your problems?!

                                         WILLY
                            My problems?! Wait a second - this is
                            not about my anything any more -
               Willy grabs Nikki's arm to stop her, turn her around - and
               she shoves him away, hard, tears welling in her eyes -
               - Willy letting her go - as the Receptionist quietly calls
               for help -
               - and Nikki hurries into the waiting elevator.     The Associate
               holding the doors lets them go.

                                          WILLY
                            This is about taking a couple of
                            goddamn weeks off to try and save a
                            woman's life!
               The doors begin to close. Willy stands facing the cluster of
               lawyers in expensive suits, their expressions ranging from
               pity to contempt -
               - except Nikki, whose eyes are full of shame and guilt and
               defensive anger.
               As the doors shut across them.
               Willy doesn't move.     Confused, humiliated, frustrated.
               He turns when a bunch of OTHER LAWYERS emerge from the
               offices, ready to act as bouncers. People gawk from behind
               the glass doors.
               Beat.   Willy holds up his palms.

                                            WILLY
                            Don't bother.     I got it.

               

                                                                               95

               

               

               

               
               He bangs open the paddle-sign on the stairway door, setting
               off the fire alarms as he stalks out.

               


               INT. WOOTON SIMS - BUILDING STAIRWAY - SOON AFTER

               Willy runs down the stairs furiously -
               - the clanging alarm, several floors above now, a little
               fainter.
               He suddenly stops - clinging to the railing, bent over.    He
               sways, dizzy, gasping -
               - backs up until he's against the concrete wall. Presses
               himself against. Listening to his own ragged breathing.
               Scared out of his mind.

               


               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DUSK

               Crawford stands by the bed, glancing over a set of forms on a
               metal clipboard.
               DR. LUNT, a senior neurologist, and a HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATOR
               wait. The machines hiss and click, keeping Jennifer alive.
               Crawford signs the forms, expressionless.

               


               EXT. COURTHOUSE - THE SAME TIME

               Willy's walking alongside Judge Robinson, as they leave the
               building. The Judge is wearing his "civilian clothes."

                                        JUDGE ROBINSON
                           What do the doctors say?

                                        WILLY
                           People wake up out of these things.

                                        JUDGE ROBINSON
                           What did the doctors say, Mr. Slocum?

                                        WILLY
                           They said...there's no way to really
                           know. I'm trying to get them to run
                           more tests - but I was there, and I'm
                           telling you.

               

                                                                             96

               

               

                                        JUDGE ROBINSON
                           I'm sorry. I have no probable cause
                           to issue a court order against Mr.
                           Crawford - and he's protected agai-

                                        WILLY

                           WHAT ABOUT HIS WIFE?!   WHAT'S

                           PROTECTING HER?!
               The Judge stops - giving Willy a hard eye: I'm sympathetic,
               but yelling at me is not a smart approach.
               Willy looks at the Judge a second - hapless, frustrated,
               scared - then nods and shakes his head and turns away -
               hurrying off through the homeward-bound crowds.
               The Judge watches him go.   Grimaces.

               


               INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - KITCHEN - THAT EVENING

               Crawford is carefully preparing an elegant, solitary meal.
               Music plays on his state-of-the-art sound system.
               He stops, noticing a pair of Jennifer's reading glasses,
               folded up by a note-pad and pen next to the telephone. He
               picks them up. Stylish, feminine.
               He goes to the trash, steps on the pedal to flip open the
               lid, and drops the glasses in.
               Goes back to cooking.

               


               INT. LOBRUTO HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT

               Lobruto - at the dinner table with his family - looks up,
               surprised, as the doorbell rings. He excuses himself -
               - goes to open the door. Willy's outside: apologetic but
               urgent, near the end of his rope.

                                        WILLY
                           I'm sorry - but nobody else seems to
                           give a damn that sooner or later this
                           guy is gonna finish what he started.
               Beat.

                                        LOBRUTO
                           Have you been home at all today,
                           Willy?

               

                                                                            97

               

               
               Willy looks down at himself: he's unshaven, in the same
               rumpled clothes he wore to court yesterday. Exasperated:

                                        WILLY
                           No - I've been trying to get some-

                                        LOBRUTO
                           There's a court order out against you.

                                         WILLY
                           What?

                                         LOBRUTO
                           A restraining order.
                                  (Beat)
                           You were at the hospital?       Talking to
                           her doctors?
               Willy nods. Lobruto looks out at the confused, frantic young
               man - truly sorry that he can't help Willy fight his way back
               toward doing some good in this mess.

                                        LOBRUTO
                           Crawford hired a lawyer this time.
                           They saw Judge Gorman this afternoon.

                                         WILLY
                           Against me.

                                         LOBRUTO
                           You need to stay away from him, and
                           his wife, and the hospital. He can
                           have you arrested if you don't.
                                  (Beat)
                           I'm sorry.
                                  (beat)
                           I can't help you. I told you how it
                           would go.
               Willy stares a second, slowly understanding his situation.

                                        WILLY
                           Can you do anything for her?
               Beat.

                                        LOBRUTO
                           I don't see how.
               Willy grimaces.   But nods.   Turns away.

               

                                                                             98

               

               


               EXT. LOBRUTO HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

               We move with Willy out to the quiet street. The windows of
               the houses he passes seem warm and safe - and very far away.
               Behind him, Lobruto watches from his lighted doorway.
               Willy walks, shaken, determined, into the night.

               


               INT. HOSPITAL - I.C.U. - THE NEXT MORNING

               A NURSE checks Jennifer Crawford's vital signs. She then
               begins to gently wash Jennifer's face, where it's not taped
               or bandaged.
               The monitor beeps, the ventilator hisses.

               


               INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - THE SAME TIME

               Crawford knots his necktie, studying himself in the mirror.
               Expressionless.

               


               EXT. GARDNER HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - SOON AFTER

               Judge Gardner pulls his car out to the street -
               - swerving hastily, as Willy's car skids alongside and forces
               him to the curb, horn honking.
               Willy pulls to a stop, blocking Gardner's way, and gets out
               of the car - holding up both palms: just wait.

               


               INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - LATER THAT MORNING

               Dr. Lunt takes a chart from the I.C.U. Nurses' Station.

                                        DR. LUNT
                           Has Mrs. Crawford been prepared?

               


               INT. CRAWFORD'S CAR - SOON AFTER

               Crawford drives, wearing a dark suit, sunglasses.   Calm.

               

                                                                             99

               

               


               INT. JUDGE GARDNER'S CHAMBERS - SAME TIME

               Willy watches GARDNER'S SECRETARY bring in a document, fresh
               off the laser-printer. As Gardner signs:

                                        WILLY
                           Can I use your fax machine?

                                        GARDNER
                           These have to be served in person.

               


               INT. PARKING STRUCTURE - DOWNTOWN L.A. - CONTINUOUS

               Willy brakes as he drives around a corner and sees a DRIVER
               wrangling with the BOOTH GUY. He grimaces, looks around -
               - backs up, tires squealing, heading for another exit.

               


               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Dr. Lunt stands by Jennifer's bed, supervising the Nurse and
               an Orderly as they prepare her.

               


               INT. HOSPITAL - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

               Crawford walks in, goes toward the elevators.

               


               INT. WILLY'S CAR - INTERSECTION - CONTINUOUS

               He floors it, racing under a light going red - narrowly
               misses getting broad-sided.

               


               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Dr. Lunt looks up from making notes on Jennifer's chart, as
               Crawford enters the room.

               


               EXT. EMERGENCY ROOM ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

               Willy pulls into a NO PARKING zone and jumps out, papers in
               hand - tossing the keys to an ORDERLY smoking a cigarette -

                                        WILLY
                           Move it if you need to!
               - running through the automatic doors.

               

                                                                            100

               

               


               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Standing beside Dr. Lunt, Crawford watches, expressionless -
               - as the Nurse and the Orderly work, efficient and silent,
               disconnecting the oxygen tubes, unplugging the monitor -

               


               INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY - SOON AFTER

               Willy dodges people, coming to the elevators - which open.
               Too crowded.

               


               INT. HOSPITAL STAIRWAY - SOON AFTER

               Willy gasps a little as he hurries up the stairs -

               


               INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - SOON AFTER

               - comes out of the fire stairs, hurrying toward I.C.U. -

               


               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               - and into Jennifer's room, where he stops.     Shocked.
               The bed is being stripped, the equipment rolled out.
               Willy stares, breathless, overwhelmed.

                                           NURSE
                              You just missed her.

                                           WILLY
                              What?

                                           NURSE
                              She just went on up.
               Willy struggles to control his emotions.     Looks down.

                                           WILLY
                              How long ago...did she die?

                                          NURSE
                           What?
                                  (Beat)
                           The roof.
                                  (Beat)

                                          (MORE)

               

                                                                           101

               

               
                                        NURSE (cont'd)
                           Medevac transfer. Out to a long-term
                           care facility up in Santa Barbara.
                           They just left, you can probably still
                           catch 'em.
               Willy tries to understand her.   With growing horror.

                                        WILLY
                           He's - moving her by helicopter?

                                        NURSE
                           Nothing but the best.
               We hear the surge of a jet engine -
               - as Willy runs out of the room.

               


               EXT. HOSPITAL ROOF - HELIPAD - LATER

               A Sikorsky S-76 Medevac chopper is preparing to take off,
               very loud and windy.
               Through the open doorway and the thick windows, we can
               glimpse Crawford sitting beside Jennifer, who is strapped on
               to a gurney. She's connected to life-support equipment.
               The MED TECH is outside, checking a few last supplies and
               giving Crawford a moment alone with his wife.
               Crawford moves. He may be whispering to her.    Or adjusting
               her pillow. Hard to tell.
               As he climbs out of the chopper -
               - he sees Willy across the roof, arguing with Dr. Lunt, who
               is skimming the court documents, shaking his head.
               Crawford, curious, walks toward the two men.

               


               EXT. HOSPITAL ROOF HELIPAD - WILLY - THE SAME TIME

               Dr. Lunt hands Crawford the court order. As Crawford reads
               them, Lunt and Willy shout over the helicopter engine:

                                        DR. LUNT
                           This orders him not to take her off
                           life support! He's not! We can't
                           stop the man from -

                                        WILLY
                           Then just hold it - for a couple of
                           hours! Have it inspected!

               

                                                                            102

               

               

                                        DR. LUNT
                           You're talking about a phenomenally
                           expensive delay, Mr. Slocum - when the
                           man has every right to move his wife!

                                        WILLY
                           She's not gonna get there!
               He looks at Crawford: reading - amused, thoughtful.

                                        WILLY
                           This man is a mechanical engineer with
                           expertise in air crashes! He has
                           access to airfields and he knows
                           exactly how to make it look like an
                           accident! You know what he did! You
                           know why she's like this!
               Lunt hesitates, feeling a tiny edge of doubt.
               Crawford checks his watch.   Looks into Willy's eyes -
               - then gestures for Willy to join him, and turns back to walk
               across the pad to the helicopter. Climbs in.
               Willy stares, stunned.
               Lunt looks at him: case closed. The rotors whirl faster,
               engine noise rising to a scream.
               From the open chopper doorway, Crawford looks at Willy again
               and gestures for him to get on.
               Willy doesn't know how to react.   Slowly, he starts to walk
               toward the helicopter.

               


               INT. HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS

               Willy bends, coming to the door - wind-whipped, flinching.
               Crawford holds out a hand to help him in.
               Willy doesn't move.   The PILOT glances back.
               Crawford's eyes are locked with Willy's.
               Willy stares at Crawford, scared. But unable to back down
               from the crude, plain challenge. Which Crawford is clearly
               counting on.
               Angry, at himself, Willy climbs in without taking Crawford's
               hand. As he nervously figures out how to buckle himself in -

               

                                                                               103

               

               
               - the Med Tech secures the door, the Pilot turns to face
               front - and they lift off.

               


               EXT. ABOVE LOS ANGELES - SOON AFTER

               Looking directly down at the Sikorsky as it glides over a
               picturesque mapscape of streets and freeways, gray and terra-
               cotta rooftops, blue kidneys and rectangles of pool.

               


               INT. HELICOPTER - SAME TIME

               Willy watches Crawford, who stares back at him.       Calm.
               Glances uneasily at the Pilot, bug-headed in sun-goggles and
               headphones. Flying them, calm.
               The Med Tech, adjusting Jennifer's portable ventilator.
               Calm.

               


               EXT. ABOVE LOS ANGELES - SOON AFTER

               The Sikorsky glides over cross-hatched parking lots, a pale
               swath of beach -
               - and the white foaming edge of the Pacific.

               


               INT. HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS

               Willy looks up from the view.       Scared.   Yells to the Pilot.

                                        WILLY
                           Why are we going out over the ocean?

                                           PILOT
                           Less traffic.
               Willy looks at Crawford.

               


               EXT. ABOVE THE OCEAN - SOON AFTER

               Deep dark vast blue.   The Sikorsky flies over.      Small.

               


               INT. HELICOPTER - SOON AFTER

               Willy stares into Crawford's eyes.

               

                                                                            104

               

               
               Then he looks around at the vibrating metal box carrying him
               hundreds of feet above the earth. The sunlight glare in the
               scratched windows. The blur of the rotors against the empty
               sky. The edges of the door frame. The rivets in the roof.
               Crawford's eyes.   Amused.
               Willy unbuckles his seat-belt, lurches toward the Pilot -

                                        WILLY
                           We have to turn back!

                                        PILOT
                           Get in your seat!

                                        WILLY
                           He's doing something - we have to turn
                           back!

                                        PILOT
                           Who's doing something?
               Willy points to Crawford, who's just sitting there -

                                         WILLY
                           He is!   You have to get us DOWN!

                                        PILOT
                           Get back in your goddamn seat!

                                        CRAWFORD
                           Willy, I'm not doing anything.
                           Everyone can see that.

                                        WILLY
                           I'm TELLING you, we have to TURN BACK!
                           He's DOING SOMETH-
               An alarm begins to shriek - on the ventilator.
               Everyone turns as the Med Tech hastily kneels next to it -

                                        WILLY
                           What's happening?!

                                         MED TECH
                           I don't know - I'm - there's a -
                           malfunction -
               - Willy whips around to look at Crawford, with fury in his
               glare: oh, you bastard.
               Crawford almost smiles.

               

                                                                         105

               

               
               The Med Tech is flipping switches, checking wires -

                                        MED TECH
                           I can't do anything with this, up
                           here.
               The Pilot turns - steeply, Willy falling over, the Med Tech's
               supplies spilling - as the Med Tech hastily removes
               Jennifer's breathing tube and prepares to begin C.P.R. -

                                          CRAWFORD
                           She's D.N.R.
               The Med Tech looks up - startled.     Confused.

                                          WILLY
                           What is it?

                                          CRAWFORD
                           Check.
               Willy watches, wide-eyed, as the Med Tech grabs up his
               paperwork, searching it -

                                          WILLY
                           What?
               The Med Tech looks up at Willy, scared.

                                        MED TECH
                           She's Do Not Resuscitate.
               Willy turns on Crawford.   He shrugs.

                                        CRAWFORD
                           It's in her living will.
               The Med Tech looks at Willy, paralyzed.

                                          MED TECH
                           She's D.N.R.    She signed it.

                                        WILLY
                           There's a restraining order - she's
                           protected - I'm authorizing you to do
                           it!
               The Med Tech turns to Crawford, uncertain -

                                      CRAWFORD
                           No extraordinary measures.
                                  (Turns to Willy)
                           Unless your court order specifies

                                      (MORE)

               

                                                                                  106

               

               
                                      CRAWFORD (cont'd)
                           contravening her living will. But I
                           don't think it would. I think you got
                           one that forbids me from disconn-
               Willy throws himself at Crawford - attacking him, as the Med
               Tech grabs him, drags him back -

                                        PILOT

                           WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON BACK THERE?!
               - the Med Tech holding Willy down on the floor by Jennifer's
               stretcher - Willy struggles furiously -

                                          WILLY
                           Wait!    WAIT - LOOK!
               Willy is pointing at Jennifer - shocked -
               - as the Med Tech lets him up and they kneel by her, the Med
               Tech taking her pulse - Willy, staring down at her, intent:
               She's breathing.

                                             WILLY
                           Yes.     Yes.
               Willy whirls around to Crawford.        Who's frowning.

                                        WILLY
                           You messed up. With all your plans
                           and games.
               Willy turns back to Jennifer. Delicately strokes the side of
               her face. Her eyes flutter open -

                                          WILLY
                           Shhhh.    It's okay.       It's all right.
               - she stares into Willy's eyes. He takes her hand.        Silent
               awe in her eyes. Yearning. Fear.

                                        WILLY
                           You're gonna be okay?
               She squeezes his hand.      Very weakly.
               Crawford is looking daggers: die, bitch.
               Jennifer's eyes - fixed on Willy - roll back.        She fights it.

                                             WILLY
                           Jennifer?       Hang on.
               Something sad in her wordless gaze.        As it starts to fade.

               

                                                                                107

               

               

                                           WILLY
                           Jennifer?!     JENNIFER?!
               She's slipping. Her eyes gone empty.        Her hand becoming
               lifeless in his.

                                           WILLY
                           No.     Come on, Jennifer.    Fight back.
               Tears well up in Willy's eyes, but he struggles against them -
               feeling Crawford's gaze, refusing him the satisfaction.

                                           WILLY
                           Don't let go.
               But she's gone. He stares down. Mourning her. Letting his
               grief slowly burn into rage. He gently reaches up and closes
               her eyes.
               Then he looks up at Crawford, who smiles sympathetically.

                                         CRAWFORD
                           You pushed it, Willy. We didn't have
                           to be here.
                                  (Beat)
                           But now you're my witness. You saw:
                           I didn't touch anything, I didn't do
                           anything. The machine went down.
                           Anybody asks - you'll have to tell
                           them. What you saw.
                                  (Beat)
                           That's really kind of perfect, isn't
                           it?
               Willy stares into his eyes. Cold.        Then he looks away.    Out
               the window, into the sun-glare.

                                                               SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

               


               INT. WILLY'S APARTMENT - A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER

               The garage door is open, letting in daylight. We can see the
               alley especially well, because there are only empty hangers
               on the clothes-bar, and the cinderblock shelves have been
               taken apart, stacked on the floor.
               Willy is packing.    He's wearing jeans, an old t-shirt.
               He carries a heavy pile of legal textbooks out to the trash
               bins, throws them away.

               

                                                                         108

               

               
               As he turns to go back in - he sees Lobruto coming along the
               alley, wearing a suit. Surprised, waits.

                                        LOBRUTO
                           You're not answering your phone.
               Beat.

                                        WILLY
                           That's kind of an answer in itself,
                           isn't it?
               Willy heads back in, starts to pack again.

                                        LOBRUTO
                           Where are you headed?

                                        WILLY
                           Haven't decided yet.    Just someplace
                           else.
               Lobruto nods.   Willy packs.

                                         LOBRUTO
                           I shouldn't have let it get so far out
                           of control.
                                  (Beat)
                           We all lose, Willy.

                                         WILLY
                           Yep.

                                        LOBRUTO
                           We just have to live with that, and
                           keep fighting the good fight.

                                        WILLY
                           That's not what I was doing.

                                        LOBRUTO
                           You belong in a courtroom.
               Willy packs, thinking about that.   Shakes his head.

                                        WILLY
                           I need to - get to know myself better.

                                        LOBRUTO
                           You're a good lawyer. All this may
                           have even made you a better lawyer.
                           Don't waste it.
               Willy turns on him - angry, confused, bitter:

               

                                                                            109

               

               

                                        WILLY
                           I didn't just lose a case!     I let a
                           man get away with murder.
               Lobruto nods. Respecting his pain.     Shrugs, accepts the
               decision, with regret.
               Willy nods his thanks, and turns back to packing.
               Lobruto starts to leave.    But from the alley door:

                                        LOBRUTO
                           If it makes you feel any better -
                           technically, you let a man get away
                           with attempted murder.
               Willy doesn't respond.    Keeps packing.
               Lobruto goes out.
               After a moment, Willy stops.    Looking up.   Something turning
               over in his mind.

               


               EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

               Lobruto is walking toward his car when Willy steps out of the
               garage and calls after him:

                                        WILLY
                           His wife is dead!
               Lobruto turns.   Uncertain what Willy is getting at.

                                        WILLY
                           We can still get him.    We can take him
                           back to court.

                                        LOBRUTO
                                  (Gently)
                           Willy...
               Willy comes toward him - excited, insistent:

                                        WILLY
                           Double jeopardy doesn't apply! We
                           bring a new charge - of homicide.

                                         LOBRUTO
                           Willy - what happened to you, on the
                           helicopter - we don't even know if we
                           could prove -

               

                                                                                  110

               

               

                                         WILLY
                           No: he shot her and she died. The
                           fact that it took time - the fact that
                           he went to trial in between, just for
                           shooting her - doesn't matter. He
                           fired a gun and caused her death, and
                           that's murder.
                                  (Beat)
                           If he can twist the law around - then
                           so can we.
               Lobruto thinks it out.    Wary.

                                        LOBRUTO
                           A second indictment on the same
                           incident?

                                        WILLY
                           A man burns down a house; we charge
                           him with arson. There were people
                           sleeping upstairs - and after weeks in
                           the hospital, they die. We'd charge
                           him with murder. Right?
               Lobruto nods. On the fence, but seeing it now.         Impressed
               with the young man's fervor, and his logic.
               But he shakes his head.

                                        LOBRUTO
                           All your evidence is still toxic.      The
                           confession, the arrest - it's all
                           still inadmissible.
               Willy grimaces.    Looks down.    Thinking, intense.

                                        LOBRUTO
                           I'm sorry, Willy. It was a good idea,
                           but -

                                        WILLY
                           I'll get something new.

                                          LOBRUTO
                           How?
               Willy looks up at him.    Calm now.

                                        WILLY
                           You don't want to know.

                                        LOBRUTO
                           Willy, you can't -

               

                                                                            111

               

               

                                         WILLY
                           I don't work for you.
                                  (Beat)
                           Right?
               Beat. Lobruto sighs, as Willy nods and turns to start back
               to the garage. With work to do.

                                        LOBRUTO
                           Don't do anything crazy.

                                        WILLY
                           What else have we got left?
               Willy disappears inside.

               


               INT. S.I.D. LAB - LATER

               End of the day. Marchand pulls on his coat, shuts down his
               computer. He turns to go -
               - Willy is standing in his doorway.

                                        WILLY
                           I need a favor.

               


               INT. POLICE EVIDENCE WAREHOUSE - SOON AFTER

               Willy follows an EVIDENCE CLERK along an aisle between floor-
               to-ceiling steel shelves of boxes marked with case numbers.

                                        CRAWFORD
                           These are from that thing at the
                           courthouse, right?

                                          WILLY
                           Uh-huh.
               The Clerk stops, checking a number against a slip of paper in
               his hand - pulls down a box for Willy.

               


               INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - THAT NIGHT

               Crawford is building a new Rube Goldberg device, tools and
               parts laid out precisely on a table.
               Eyes enlarged by the glasses, he silently connects two tiny
               pieces of metal -

               

                                                                            112

               

               
               - when a French door suddenly implodes, a metal lawn chair
               hurled in from the backyard smashing through it.
               Crawford stands, taking off the glasses -
               - as Willy walks in over the broken glass, carrying Nunally's
               gun.

                                         CRAWFORD
                            Very dramatic.
               Willy crosses the room to the alarm panel on the wall.

                                         WILLY
                            You ain't seen nothin' yet.
               He presses the POLICE emergency button, then turns to
               Crawford.

                                         WILLY
                            I want the gun.

                                          CRAWFORD
                            Why?   You've already got one.

                                         WILLY
                            I want the gun you shot your wife
                            with. Now.
               Crawford doesn't move.
               Willy raises his gun, points it at Crawford's face.

                                         WILLY
                            One way or another, I'm going to see
                            to it you receive justice tonight.
               Crawford studies Willy.

                                         CRAWFORD
                            You're serious, aren't you.

                                          WILLY
                            Oh, yes.

                                         CRAWFORD
                                   (A smile dawning)
                            Willy. You got religion, didn't you?!
                            You care. That's...priceless.
               He laughs.   Willy keeps the gun aimed at him.

               

                                                                         113

               

               

                                        CRAWFORD
                           No, it's very sweet. Really.

                                        WILLY
                           Gonna be a whole lot less funny in
                           about a minute.
               Crawford nods.    Considering the game.   Unruffled.

                                        CRAWFORD
                           Getting it like this: is that going to
                           hold up in court?

                                        WILLY
                           I don't work for the D.A. any more.
                           I'm just a guy who broke into your
                           house. When the police arrest me -
                           they'll inventory anything in my
                           possession. If that happens to be
                           crucial evidence in another case,
                           well: some prosecutor just got lucky.
               Silence. Crawford studies Willy's eyes, over the muzzle of
               the gun between them.

                                        CRAWFORD
                           It takes a very special kind of person
                           to look right into someone's eyes and
                           pull the trigger. It takes a unique
                           kind of strength.

                                        WILLY
                           I guess you'd know that.

                                          CRAWFORD
                           Yes.    I would.
               Willy cocks the gun.
               Crawford shakes his head.    Eyes on Willy.

                                        CRAWFORD
                           I don't think so.
               Willy doesn't lower the gun.    But he doesn't pull the
               trigger, either.

                                        WILLY
                           You don't know me.

                                           CRAWFORD
                           No?

               

                                                                         114

               

               
               Beat.   Crawford smiles slightly.

                                         CRAWFORD
                            Then I'm in for a - rude awakening.
               Willy glares over the gun.     Crawford shrugs.

                                           CRAWFORD
                            Tick-tock.
               Willy's angry.   Frustrated.    Trapped.
               His bluff called.     Refusing to back down.

                                         CRAWFORD
                            Where did you even get yourself a gun?

                                         WILLY
                                   (Bitter)
                            It's Nunally's.
               Crawford is thrown by this - but conceals it well.

                                           CRAWFORD
                            Nunally's.    Really.
               Willy grimaces, over the gun still aimed at Crawford's face.

                                           WILLY
                            Yeah.    Really.
               He has backed himself into a corner, and he's getting scared.
               Because all of a sudden the threat he came to fake Crawford
               out with -
               - is starting to seem like his only way out.
               Even Crawford sees it. In Willy's eyes. The uncertain edge
               of the idea. He could just do it. End the game. Blow
               Crawford's brains all over the wall.

                                         WILLY
                            There I was, with a perfectly good
                            weapon just sitting in the evidence
                            warehouse.
               It would be so easy. With his life already a shambles.   With
               everything already lost. At least he would have this.

                                           CRAWFORD
                            Willy.    Put it down.

               

                                                                         115

               

               

                                        WILLY
                           I thought you might appreciate the
                           ...irony.
               Willy's finger tightens on the trigger.

                                         CRAWFORD
                           Willy.   Think.
               And Willy does.   Hesitating.
               Distracted, by a thought.
               Lowering the gun slightly, looking at it - remembering:

               


               INT. S.I.D. LAB - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

               Marchand, on the phone - holding the gun Crawford
               surrendered, in its plastic EVIDENCE bag:

                                        WILLY (V.O.)
                           "A perfectly good...Heckler and Koch
                           nine-millimeter."

               


               INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - (RESUME)

               Crawford is getting edgy, watching Willy study Nunally's gun:

                                        CRAWFORD
                           The police will be here very soon.

                                        WILLY
                           The exact same type of gun you bought
                           your wife, a month before.
               He looks up at Crawford.    Getting it.

               


               INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - (FLASHBACK)

               Nunally setting down his pistol on the chair - as Crawford,
               across the room, sets down his on the table.

               


               INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - (RESUME)


                                         CRAWFORD
                           If they see you with a gun in your
                           hand - they're not likely to ask a lot
                           of questions.

               

                                                                            116

               

               

                                         WILLY
                            That's why you went to the hotel.

               


               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY (FLASHBACK)

               Surveillance-cam view: Crawford lets himself into the room -

                                         WILLY (V.O.)
                            That's why you went into the room.

               


               INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY (FLASHBACK)

               Crawford quietly closes the door behind him.     Stands, taking
               it all in -

               


               INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - (RESUME)

               Willy looks at Crawford.    Stunned.

                                         WILLY
                            You took his gun.

               


               INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY (FLASHBACK)

               Crawford checks the dresser drawers, the night-table - finds
               Nunally's badge, holster and gun.

                                         WILLY (V.O.)
                            And you left him yours.
               Crawford replaces Nunally's gun with his own matching pistol,
               which was tucked into the back of his belt.

               


               INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - (RESUME)

               Beat.   Crawford shrugs - arrogant:

                                         CRAWFORD
                            I gave it back.

                                           WILLY
                            Yes you did.

               


               INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - (FLASHBACKS - VERY QUICK)

               Crawford fires at Jennifer - Crawford shoots at the transom -

               

                                                                            117

               

               

                                        WILLY (V.O.)
                           After you'd used it.
               Crawford holds out the gun, to Nunally: making the offer -

                                        WILLY (V.O.)
                           Then you told Nunally you'd put it
                           down - if he put down his.
               Nunally setting down his pistol on the chair, as Crawford,
               across the room, sets down his on the table.

               


               INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - (RESUME)

               Willy turns, looking into the alcove:

                                        WILLY
                           That's why you moved her back there -

               


               INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - (FLASHBACK)

               Nunally rushes past Crawford to kneel by Jennifer - shocked,
               frantic -

                                        CRAWFORD (V.O.)
                           The truth is I could have done it
                           right in front of the man and he
                           wouldn't have noticed.
               - ignoring Crawford behind him.

               


               INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - (RESUME)


                                        CRAWFORD
                           He had...other things on his mind.

               


               INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

               Nunally's calling for help on the walkie-talkie, desperately
               starting C.P.R. -
               - as behind him, Crawford picks up the murder weapon,
               (Nunally's gun) from the table -
               - and walks over to the chair where Nunally left Crawford's
               gun (from his holster).

               

                                                                           118

               

               

                                        WILLY (V.O.)
                           And all you had to do was switch the
                           guns back - in the commotion -
               Crawford picks up his gun and sets the murder weapon on the
               chair in its place.

                                        WILLY (V.O.)
                           - and then wait -
               He then comes back to put his gun on the table, where it will
               be mistaken for the murder weapon. Straightens, done.

               


               INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACKS)

               Nunally grabs up the murder weapon from the chair, upset,
               distracted - puts it in his holster -

                                        WILLY (V.O.)
                           - until Nunally walked the murder
                           weapon right out of the house.
               A Detective drops Jennifer's gun into an evidence bag -
               - as Nunally walks out.

               


               INT. CRAWFORD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - (RESUME)

               Willy stares at Crawford.    In real wonder.

                                           WILLY
                           Brilliant.

                                        CRAWFORD
                           You know, this is really kind of fun.
                           It's like showing some caveman a
                           cigarette lighter.
               Willy looks down at the gun in his hand.    Thoughtful.

                                        WILLY
                           This caveman's gonna put you in prison
                           for the rest of your life.

                                        CRAWFORD
                           It's still not evidence, Willy.
                           There's no prints left by now.
                           Nothing ties that gun to me.
               Willy smiles, slow...    Enjoying himself, at last.

               

                                                                               119

               

               

                                        WILLY
                           No. That would be true.        Except for
                           all those eggs.

                                            CRAWFORD
                           Those what?
               Willy nods to himself, going to the wooden bowl of ball-
               bearings - selecting one, carrying it to the Rube Goldberg
               machine:

                                        WILLY
                           With all those little cracks and weak
                           places. Like Nunally. Shooting
                           himself, right there in the
                           courthouse. I didn't think he was
                           going to do that. Did you?

                                            CRAWFORD
                                   (Wary)
                           No.
               Studying the complex device, toying with Crawford:

                                        WILLY
                           I mean, we all knew he was going to
                           fall apart sooner or later. That was
                           part of your plan, right? Like a bank
                           shot, on a pool table: you kill your
                           wife - and destroy her lover. With
                           one bullet.
                                  (Turns)
                           Well: four bullets, actually. Right?
               Crawford frowns.   Trying to see what Willy's getting at.

                                        WILLY
                           First bullet goes into your wife.

                                                       INTERCUT QUICK FLASHBACKS:
               Crawford fires at Jennifer -

                                        WILLY (V.O.)
                           Then three more out the front of the
                           house, to get some attention.
               - and fires three times at the transom.

                                        WILLY
                           Then while you're waiting for the show
                           to begin - you have to reload
                           Nunally's gun.

               

                                                                          120

               

               
               Crawford pushes new bullets into the clip -

                                        WILLY (V.O.)
                           I mean, you don't want him wondering
                           where the hell four bullets went,
                           considering he never fired his gun
                           that night.

               - and slides the clip back into the gun, pleased.
               Willy nods, thinking it out.   Sure of himself.
               He sets the ball-bearing into the slot at the top of the
               machine -

                                         WILLY
                           And I'm betting you didn't worry about
                           fingerprints.

               Crawford reacts.
               CLOSE: Crawford's fingers, putting the bullets in the clip.
               Willy lets the ball go - watching it begin rolling down the
               ornate tracks.

                                        WILLY
                           I mean, why would you? Nobody's going
                           to be looking at his gun.

               The ball tumbles and clatters - flipping and clicking through
               the ingenious, precise, heartless machinery -

                                        WILLY
                           And sooner or later, life goes on,
                           those four incriminating bullets would
                           get used, and be gone forever.

               - and Crawford is recognizing, slowly, his one mistake.
               The gun in Nunally's limp dead fingers, glimpsed on the
               marble courthouse floor, through the crowd.

                                        WILLY (V.O.)
                           Except Nunally only fired one of those
                           bullets. Into himself.

               Willy turns from the machine -
               - which continues clattering and working, beside him.

               

                                                                              121

               

               

                                         WILLY
                           Which means there are still three left
                           with your fingerprints on them - Tom.
                           In this clip.

               He holds the gun up.     Savoring Crawford's growing fear.
               They can hear a car rolling up the driveway. Red and blue
               lights sweep the frosted glass by the front door.

                                        WILLY
                           Everybody has a weak spot, right?
                           Some place they break.

               Without looking, Willy gently pushes the machine, moving it a
               fraction of an inch on the floor -
               - as the ball catapults out - sailing across the living room
               in a perfect, graceful arc -
               - that misses the bowl.

               Outside, the police car doors open and then slam.
               Crawford, going pale, watches the metal ball roll off the
               coffee-table and across the floor toward him.
               Crawford doesn't move.     Trying to focus.    His mind working.
               The ball comes to rest against Crawford's shoe.
               The doorbell rings.

               Crawford looks up.     Meeting Willy's eyes.
               Smiling slightly, Willy tucks Nunally's gun into his belt and
               puts his hands in the air.
               And gives Crawford a wink.
               Crawford is staring at Willy, frozen - panic and hatred and
               fear curdling in his eyes -
               - as behind him, the police begin pounding on the front door.

               

               

                                             THE END
The French Connection

INT. CORRIDOR

High angle - complete reverse.  As the Detective starts to
open his letter-box in B.G. a hand pointing a gun moves in
foreground and blows off half of the French Detective's head
with the first shot.

Cut to Nicoli C.S. who just fired.

EXT. A BAR IN BED-STUY - DAY

A large man in a Santa Claus suit and white beard is
entertaining a group of black children.  He leads them in
the singing of a Christmas Carol (Hark the Herald Angels
Sing).  The man is DETECTIVE FIRST GRADE JIMMY DOYLE.  His
attention is split between the children and the activity
inside the bar.

INT. THE BAR - DOYLE'S POV - DAY

The place is crowded with mid-day drinkers.  Dimly outlined
at the far end of the bar are TWO BLACK MEN involved in some
kind of transaction in which a package is exchanged for
money.  As the transaction seems to be completed, cut to

EXT. THE BAR - DAY

Santa Claus (DOYLE) starts to ring his big Christmas bell,
above the singing.  The bell is a signal to DETECTIVE SECOND
GRADE BUDDY RUSSO.  At this moment RUSSO is in the clothes
of a hot dog vendor and is in fact working behind a hot dog
wagon.  At the ringing of DOYLE's bell he takes off his
apron, leaves the wagon, and runs toward the bar.

                         DOYLE
                   (as RUSSO passes him)
            The guy in the brown coat.

INT. THE BAR - DAY

RUSSO enter the bar on the run.  He stops and looks over the
room.

RUSSO'S POV

There are TWENTY or THIRTY MEN at the bar, at least TEN are
wearing brown coats!  The TWO MEN involved in the deal see
RUSSO and start to run.  One (THE BUYER) takes off out of
the back door.  The other (THE PUSHER) jumps over the bar
and heads for the front entrance.

                                                            3.


EXT. THE BAR - DAY

THE PUSHER dashes out past Santa Claus (DOYLE).  RUSSO
follows him and all three give chase.

EXT. BED-STUY TENEMENT ALLEY - DAY

THREE FIGURES running down a New York tenement alley, the
first in flight, the others in pursuit.  We pick up the
incredible clutter of such an alley, mounts of rusting beer
cans, paper bags of garbage bulging and ripping open, old
bed springs, burned out mattresses, etc.

EXT. BED-STUY TENEMENT ALLEY - DAY

Close shot of BLACK PUSHER tripping on the tangle of trash
going up against the wall in his stumble, face toward the
camera, and the figures of RUSSO and DOYLE leaping upon him
from off-camera.  There is a blur or fast struggle as DOYLE
and RUSSO try to get his arms and put him against the wall.
BLACK PUSHER writhes loose and we close in on a knife in his
hand, plunging rapidly into RUSSO'S left forearm.

                         RUSSO
            Son of a bitch!

The words are both warning and a grunt of pain.  As RUSSO
takes the blade and utters the words, we simultaneously go
to DOYLE crouching and snatching his .38 out of the right
ankle holster.

EXT. BED-STUY TENEMENT ALLEY - DAY

Close shot of DOYLE and the BLACK PUSHER, DOYLE pistol-
whipping him into submission with three lightening chops of
the gun to the PUSHER'S head.  DOYLE continues to beat the
man mercilessly into submission.

INT. DOYLE'S CAR - DAY

3-shot of BLACK PUSHER sitting between DOYLE and RUSSO.
DOYLE is at the wheel.  BLACK PUSHER is sitting on his
hands, wrists manacled behind him, his head down and dripping
blood onto the jacket and the canary-yellow turtleneck.  All
three are breathing hard.

                         DOYLE
            What's your name, asshole?

                         BLACK PUSHER
            Fuck you, Santa Claus!

DOYLE hits him across the face.

                                                            4.


                         RUSSO
            Your name is Willie Craven.

BLACK PUSHER doesn't look up.

                         DOYLE
            Who's your connection, Willie?
            What's his name?

No response.

                         RUSSO
            Who killed the old Jew in the
            laundromat?

BLACK PUSHER's brow furrows, looks up just a little.

                         BLACK PUSHER
            I don't...

                         DOYLE
            Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?

                         BLACK PUSHER
            What?

                         DOYLE
            Did you ever pick your feet in
            Poughkeepsie?

                         BLACK PUSHER
            I don't know what you're talkin'
            about.

                         DOYLE
            Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?

                         BLACK PUSHER
            No... yeah...

                         DOYLE
            Did you ever sit on the edge of the
            bed, take off your socks and stick
            your fingers between your toes?

                         BLACK PUSHER
            Man, I'm clean.

                         DOYLE
            You made three sales to your
            roaches back there.  We had to
            chase you through all this shit and
            you tell me you're clean?

                                                            5.


                         RUSSO
            Who stuck up the laundromat?

                         DOYLE
            How about that time you were
            picking your feet in Poughkeepsie?

The BLACK PUSHER'S eyes go to RUSSO in panic, looking for
relief from the pressure of the inquisition.

                         RUSSO
                   (in pain)
            You better give me the guy who got
            the old Jew or you better give me
            something or you're just a memory
            in this town.

                         BLACK PUSHER
            That's a lot o' shit.  I didn't do
            nothin'.

The BLACK PUSHER's eyes are on DOYLE, frozen in confusion
and fear.

                         DOYLE
            You put a shiv in my partner.  Know
            what that means?  All winter I
            gotta listen to him gripe about his
            bowling scores.  Now I'm gonna bust
            your ass for those three bags -
            then I'm gonna nail you for pickin'
            your feet in Poughkeepsie.

EXT. HEADQUARTERS NARCOTICS BUREAU OF THE NYPD 12 OLD SLIP
AND SOUTH STREETS - NIGHT

DOYLE and RUSSO standing side by side on the front steps of
the old First Precinct on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.
RUSSO has his overcoat over his shoulders as a cape.  The
sleeve of his left arm is rolled up over a blood-stained
bandage on the left forearm.

                         DOYLE
            Havin' trouble?  You're a dumb
            guinea.

                         RUSSO
            How'd I know he had a knife.

                         DOYLE
            Never trust a nigger.

                         RUSSO
            He coulda been white.

                                                            6.


                         DOYLE
            Never trust anybody.  You goin' sick?

                         RUSSO
            Not a chance.

RUSSO nods in acceptance of the remark.  The easy, synical
rapport between them is obvious: they are partners in a
business where somebody is always getting hurt and pain is
part of the inventory.

                         DOYLE
            Let's popeye around the Chez for a
            half hour, catch the end of the
            show and a couple drinks.

                         RUSSO
            Some other time Jimmy, I'm beat.

DOYLE reaches into the right side pocket of BUDDY's suitcoat
for a cigarette and matches.  He lights up two in the pause,
sticks one in RUSSO's mouth.

                         DOYLE
            Come on -- one drink.  Whatta you
            say?

                         RUSSO
            Drink this.

                         DOYLE
            Whip it out.

INT. THE CLUB - NIGHT

THE TITLES COMMENCE

                    THE FRENCH CONNECTION

Titles over a close shot of a chorus line, with lots of tits
and ass and lean, long legs in a brassy blare of music.  We
zoom back to the area where DOYLE and RUSSO are beginning to
occupy a table.  RUSSO takes the seat on the right, eyes
immediately on all that ginch, while DOYLE standing, gives
their order.  We do not hear the dialogue but DOYLE asks
RUSSO what he wants BUDDY looks up and says "Cinzano." DOYLE
turns and says "Two of these." DOYLE slips into the chair
opposite RUSSO and the titles roll on.  Unlike RUSSO who is
concentrating on the girls, DOYLE is digging the room and
the people who occupy the tables in it, as if he is the sort
of man who cannot relax until he knows who is around him,
why they are there.

                                                            7.


INT. THE CLUB - NIGHT

A long view from DOYLE's position of the room, a quick
certain survey that stumbles twice; on laughter that seems
too raw and then over a flurry of activity by WAITERS and
CAPTAINS serving a table on the main floor.  DOYLE's
attention is apprehended by the noise and activity that
emanate from the same large table.

                         DOYLE
            I make at least two junk connections
            at that table in the corner.  The
            guy is the stripe combo, I know him
            too.

                         RUSSO
            Hey, I thought we come for a drink.

INT. THE CLUB - NIGHT

A long view of the table with DOYLE and RUSSO very close
foreground, left and right.  DOYLE is leaning on an elbow.

                         DOYLE
            Who is that guy?

                         RUSSO
            Policy man in Queens.

                         DOYLE
            What about the last of the big-time
            spenders.  You make him?

RUSSO's eyes come off the show.  It is a direct line from
DOYLE's gaze to the round, ruddy and arrogant face of SAL
BOCA, the apparent host of the table of EIGHT MEN AND WOMEN,
the Men in dinner jackets with ties tucked under the collars
of blue or white lace-trimmed shirts, the Women in a mixture
of pant suits and Catskills cocktail party dresses, their
hair coiffed towers.

                         RUSSO
            No, you?

                         DOYLE
            Hunh-uh.  Check the bread.  He
            spreads it like the Russians are in
            Jersey.

                         RUSSO
            He probably sells insurance.  Owns
            a chicken farm in Hackensack.

                                                            8.


Zoom in slowly on SAL as he deals tips and orders.  Through
DOYLE's eyes, we go from Guest to Guest at SAL's table,
taking apart their manners and styles as they talk and
laugh, lost in the show chatter.

INT. THE CLUB - NIGHT

DOYLE finishing his drink, still looking at the table.

                         DOYLE
            Dig who's just come over.  The
            creep on the end.

INT. THE CLUB - NIGHT

The camera pans down the table to dig the "creep on the end."

                         RUSSO (VO)
            Jewish Lucky from the Bronx... He
            don't look the same without a
            number across his chest.

INT. THE CLUB - NIGHT

DOYLE close in right profile, SAL's table in the far blurred
background.

                         DOYLE
            Whatta you say we wait and give him
            a tail?

                         RUSSO
            Give who a tail?

                         DOYLE
            The greaser with the blonde.

                         RUSSO
            What for -- you wanna play Hide the
            Salami with his old lady?

                         DOYLE
            Come on -- just for fun --

INT/EXT. DOYLE'S CAR - NIGHT

The view from the back seat of DOYLE's car.  DOYLE is at the
wheel, RUSSO packed uncomfortably into the corner at DOYLE's
right.  Seventy-five yards away on the other side of the
street the canopied entrance of the Club.  A Continental is
parked in front of the club.  The DRIVER leaning on a fender
talking with the DOORMAN.  DOYLE frisks his own pockets for
a cigarette, coming up with a collection of laundry slips,
crumpled notes, toothpicks and matches.

                                                            9.


One of the slips of paper catches his eye as he is going
through the ritual of the cigarette mooch, a slip bearing
the name of a girl.  His attention is really on the entrance
of the Club and both his conversation and the cigarette
business are detached and incidental to the art of waiting
through the stakeout.  He stuffs the cards back into his
pocket.

                         DOYLE
            Monica?  Who's Monica?

                         RUSSO
                   (handing him a cigarette)
            A and A, that's all you're
            interested in -- Arrests and Ass.

As soon as DOYLE has finished lighting the cigarette SAL and
his PARTY come bubbling out of the Club noisily, a little
drunkenly.  SAL waves to the attentive DOORMAN.

DOYLE close, leaning forward over the wheel to put his hand
on the ignition key.  He does not turn it.  He is waiting
for the cover of noise from the starting of SAL's car.
RUSSO is turning the opposite corner of the car into a bend,
his head back, arms across his chest.

                         DOYLE
            Cloudy, I'll lay odds he takes us
            to Little Italy.

DOYLE reaches under his seat for the straw surveillance
hat - throws it up to read ledge of car.

                         RUSSO
            I'm telling you, Popeye, he owns a
            bagel mine in the Bronx.

A long view of the Club entrance.  SAL and ANGIE, a well-
built "classy" blonde with good legs, get into their black
Mercury sedan.  The Mercury takes off towards First Avenue.
We hear DOYLE's car start and we move off after them on the
last blink of tail-lights at the corner.

EXT. BROADWAY - NIGHT

Cabs, Daily News and Times delivery trucks, bakery vans and
a few cruising cabs, one or two passenger cars and a coasting
green and black police cruiser -- this is the 4:30 a.m.
traffic through which DOYLE moves.

A rear-window view of SAL and ANGIE BOCA, in animated
conversation.  His head is turned toward her, his hand
raised in a gesture.  ANGIE is sitting in a corner with her
back to the door, in profile to the back window.

                                                           10.


Her blonde head bobbles with laughter over some remark SAL
has made.

the sparse traffic.

Close shot of the license plate on BOCA's car.

Close shot DOYLE staring at license plate, memorizing it.

EXT. RATNER'S - DAY

BOCA and ANGIE exit restaurant, get into their car and drive
off.  Hold for DOYLE's car as it passes through after them.

EXT. MULBERRY STREET - DAY

Side close view of SAL turning south into Mott Street
panning to pick up the Italian names on the candy stores,
funeral parlors, bars, grocery stores, social clubs.

A long view of SAL's car from the DOYLE-RUSSO auto, over the
shoulders of the two cops.  DOYLE is leaning on the wheel of
his car.  He's against the curb about 100 yards behind SAL.

Medium close view of SAL in the middle of Mott Street,
walking quickly toward the opposite side of the street,
hands in the pocket of his white raincoat.  He glances over
his shoulder in the direction of DOYLE's car.

Close of RUSSO who has come awake.  The smart-ass demeanor
has dropped away.  DOYLE turns to him and smiles.  This
district is the heart of every illegal activity in New York.

Close rear view of DOYLE and RUSSO ducking down to the level
of the dashboard, a reflex action.  He couldn't see them at
that distance, although SAL, lighted by his own headlights,
can be seen in the background walking around the cars,
across the sidewalk and stopped at a recessed doorway.

Medium close shot of SAL and partially visible FIGURE at the
doorway.  With another glance up the street, SAL takes
something out of his raincoat pocket and steps up and into
the doorway.

INT. DOYLE'S CAR - DAY

Close from the front of DOYLE and RUSSO low against the
dashboard.

                         DOYLE

DOYLE's face, close, light smile.

                                                           11.


Long view of SAL walking down the sidewalk quickly for about
a quarter of a block while the headlights of his car, with
ANGIE apparently driving, move up with him.  At another
doorway, he looks back and then steps inside.

EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY

Long view of SAL's Mercury moving over Brooklyn Bridge.

Close shot of the DOYLE-RUSSO car from RUSSO's side.  BUDDY
now interested, watching.

Overhead view of cars circling block, first Mercury turning
corner, then DOYLE's Ford.

cars (as seen from DOYLE-RUSSO car) stopping and parking.
Hold on Mercury as SAL and ANGIE get out of it.  SAL locking
it up, and starting to walk toward a line of parked cars.

Close shot from rear seat of DOYLE and RUSSO glancing at
each other.

SAL and ANGIE stop in the street beside beat-up white Dodge.
Without a word they get in.  Hold as they get in, SAL starts
and they begin to drive out of the spot.

Close on DOYLE.

                         DOYLE
            It's startin' to cook, Cloudy, my
            man is cookin'...

candy store as SAL and ANGIE open door and go in.

Close shot of DOYLE and RUSSO parked.  DOYLE is looking in
the rear-view mirror while BUDDY is turned around on the
seat, looking out the rear window.

A long shot, from the DOYLE-RUSSO viewpoint of the candy
store.  The door is open, the street is deserted.  Lights
are going on in the little shop.

                                                           12.


Hold on the storefront as SAL appears, this time in a candy
store operator's smock over a white undershirt, baggy slacks.
He's carrying a stack of newspapers.  Zoom in on SAL stacking
the Sunday Times and the Daily News on the rack in front of
the store as ANGIE appears in the doorway.  She's blackhaired
now, the blonde wig gone, also wearing a grey cotton smock
over a plain skirt and sweater, holding a cup of coffee.  We
hold on them for a beat, then

                                            CUT TO:

DOYLE and RUSSO close just looking at each other.  The look
says everything about the freak case they have stumbled into.

            pour moi c'est d'avoir un chantier
            qui puisse recevoir les plus grands
            bateaux du monde.

                         MARCEL
            Dis moi vieille branche?  Comment
            fais tu pour rester si jeune avec
            la vie que tu mènes?

                         CHARNIER
            Quelle vie Marcel?  J'ai plus rien
            foutu depuis que je suis descendu
            de ces cabines.

                         RUSSO

                         DOYLE

                   (pause)

DOYLE and RUSSO in parked car.

                         RUSSO
            The building's clean.  I checked
            the tenant list -- Don Ameche, the
            actor lives there -- oh, and
            somebody else.  Do the name Joel
            Weinstock ring a bell?

TIME LAPSE

Late day.  WEINSTOCK leaving building, nodding to doorman.

                         DOYLE

DOYLE and RUSSO in parked car.

                         RUSSO
            No sir -- this is where Joel lives.

                         DOYLE
            He was the bank on that shipment
            outta Mexico three years ago.

INT. LEATHER FACTORY - DAY

Across street from Candy Store.  DOYLE and RUSSO at the
printing machine.

                         DOYLE
                   (at leather printing machine)
            Got a job for me when this is over,
            Mrs. Levene?

They have a view of the Candy Store across street.  Various
people go in and out.  Next to DOYLE, at a stamping machine,
is MRS. LEVENE, the factory owner.

                         MRS. LEVENE
            What are you fellows looking for?
            What do you want from that nice
            candy store?

                         DOYLE
            We have reason to believe it's a
            front for the biggest counterfeiting
            operation in the country.

                         MRS. LEVENE
            What?

                         DOYLE
            That's right.  They're trying to
            steal the formula for Hershey
            bars --

DOYLE continues his work at the print-out machine, while
observing the candy store.

We see SAL leaving the store.  He crosses to his car, near
the RUSSO car.  As he passes it, he sees RUSSO locked in
embrace with a lady in a babushka.  As SAL drives off, we
get a closer look at the "LADY" in the babushka: DETECTIVE
JAMES DOYLE.

                                                           22.


INT. RUSSO'S CAR ON TRIBORO BRIDGE CROSSING TO WARD'S ISLAND

                         DOYLE
            What the hell am I drivin' for?
            I'm a first grade Detective.
            You're a second grade guinea.

                         RUSSO
            I'm wounded.  Oh, oh.

SAL up ahead in the Mercury.

                         DOYLE
                   (at the wheel)
            What?

EXT. WARD'S ISLAND - BRIDGE

The Mercury crossing the bridge to the Island.

                         RUSSO
            He's goin' to Ward's Island.  We'll
            get spotted.  What the hell's he
            goin' there?

DOYLE-RUSSO car B.G.

                         DOYLE
            Maybe he's goin' to see his brother.

                         DOYLE
            Or could be another drop.  I guess
            he gets a free ride.

EXT. BROOKLYN STREET - DAY

A Brooklyn slum street on a morning in November.  It is
about 11 o'clock and relatively quiet.  A scattering of
tenement URCHINS give the street some sound and life.  There
are a couple of dark shops on the street and a bar, all
appearing to be closed.  We look down the street and pick up
DOYLE and RUSSO coming down it, walking very quickly.  They
are heading toward the bar.  A young man is coming out -
they grab him and throw him back.

INT. BAR ROOM - DAY

The Young Man is thrown in, followed by DOYLE and RUSSO.
There are about 20 or 30 PUETRO RICAN and BLACK MEN in the
joint, a couple of BLACK WOMEN.  They are in all manner of
dress.  Half of them are wearing shades.  The bar is noisy
with conversation, laughter and music.

                                                           23.


DOYLE and RUSSO standing in the doorway, DOYLE slightly to
the left, RUSSO a little behind him.  DOYLE's arms are at
his sides.  RUSSO's right hand is crossed over his belt,
under his jacket and on the butt of his .38, ready, waiting
to back his partner's play or respond to any move within the
bar.

DOYLE moving into the bar alone.  He pulls the plug out of
the Juke Box, plunging the room to silence.

                         DOYLE
            Hands on your heads.  Popeye's here!

Twenty men raise hands to their heads as one.  The raggle-
taggle swarm plays a kind of human chicken, refusing to move
until the last moment then stepping out of his way.  One of
the customers doesn't.

                         DOYLE
            What's my name?

                         1ST MAN
            Doyle.

                         DOYLE
            What?

                         1ST MAN
            Mr. Doyle.

                         DOYLE
            Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?

                         1ST MAN
            What?

DOYLE raises his left arm and pushes the MAN aside.  The
MAN's eyes go to RUSSO, off-camera at the door, and back to
DOYLE.  He doesn't resist; he gets in line with the rest of
them, a line formed about four or five feet from the bar,
running the length of it.

Close of DOYLE at the bar, holding an ashcan and skimming
the metal underrailing with one finger, knocking off the
magnetized key boxes into the ashcan.  He isn't even looking
at them.  His eyes are across the bar, staring down the
customers.

Close shot of the ashcan and the little metal boxes clinking
into it.

Close shot of DOYLE, the ashcan now on the bar, opening one
of the boxes, taking out the ten dollar bill, putting it on
the bar.

                                                           24.


Then, opening another, taking out the glassine deck of
heroin.  Then another, containing a glassine deck.  He
empties the glassine envelopes on the bar into a cocktail
mixer which he proceeds to shake.  The shaker is half-filled
with tomato juice.

DOYLE leaning over the bar toward the glaring crowd, pours
the mixture into the ashcan.

                         DOYLE
            Milk shake anyone?

He wiggles his finger.  It is a command for THREE MEN to
step forward.  The MEN do not move at first.

                         DOYLE
            Move ass when I tell you.

They move, shuffling, hesitatingly.  But they move -- TWO
BLACKS and A PUETRO RICAN.

                         DOYLE
            Put it on the bar.

Hands of the THREE MEN going into pockets.

Close of a miscellany of keys, coins, cigarettes going onto
the bar -- with two hypodermics, six or eight marijuana
cigarettes, a small plastic vial of barbiturates.

                         DOYLE
                   (collecting the works)
            All right, you three clowns step
            into those phone booths, you're
            goin' in.  Go on.  Stand in there
            till I'm ready for you.

The three men turn and enter the individual phone booths.
They stand, waiting, like contestants in the $64 Question.

                         DOYLE
            Everybody goes when the whistle
            blows.

RUSSO is with another man from whom he's just taken a set of
works.

                         RUSSO
            What's your story?

                         DANCER
            Gimme a break, Mr. Russo.  I'm in
            show business.

                                                           25.


                         RUSSO
            You're in show business.

                         DANCER
            S'right.

                         DOYLE
            What do you do in show business?

                         DANCER
            I'm a dancer.

                         RUSSO
            All right, get up on that bar and
            dance.

                         DANCER
            What?

                         RUSSO
            Get up on the bar and show me how
            you work.  If I like it you don't
            have to go in.

                         DANCER
            You're for real?

                         JERRY LEON
            Hey man, why don't you let the
            fella alone.

                         RUSSO
                   (a shout)
            Am I talkin' to you -

                         JERRY LEON
            No, but I'm talkin' to you.

                         RUSSO
            I'm tellin' you to shut up and
            stand over there.

                         RUSSO
                   (to Dancer)
            Get up there.

The man climbs up on the bar.

                         DANCER
            I got no music!

                         RUSSO
            Fake it.

                                                           26.


The man goes into a fast tap dance.  But he only gets in a
few steps --

                         DOYLE
            All right, that's enough, you're
            under arrest.

RUSSO pulls the man off the bar, sends him into one of the
phone booths.

DOYLE coming down the front of the bar.  He stops before
another man, who has just come out of the toilet.

                         DOYLE
            What about you?  Can you stand a
            toss?

                         2ND MAN
            I'm clean.

                         DOYLE
            You don't use shit?

                         2ND MAN
            No.
                   (he goes for his wallet)


                         DOYLE
            Did I say you could move that
            hand -- I'm not gonna get stuck am I?

                         2ND MAN
            No - no.

                         DOYLE
            Cause if I do.

DOYLE frisks the man.  Comes up with vial of pills and two
roaches.

                         DOYLE
            Wise guy, huh?  Let's see what else
            you got.
                   (to RUSSO)
            - Buddy!

He collars the man and shoves him towards the toilet.

RUSSO, eyes moving everywhere, hand on the gun.

                                                           27.


                         RUSSO
            If I see any shit on the floor,
            it's yours, so keep your eye on
            your neighbor.

Inside the toilet of the bar.  The MAN is up against the
wall.  DOYLE is only inches away.

The MAN is an AGENT and this is the only way DOYLE can get
immediate information from him without destroying the man's
cover.  Their conversation is in whispers.  And very fast.

                         DOYLE
            How's everything?

                         2ND MAN
            Everything is everything.

                         DOYLE
            How come there's nothing out there?
            That stuff is all milk.

                         2ND MAN
            There's nothing around.  Nobody's
            holding.

                         DOYLE
            I got a name - Sal Boca, Brooklyn.

                         2ND MAN
            Boca?

                         DOYLE
            B.O.C.A.

                         2ND MAN
            Doesn't register.

                         DOYLE
            Got a wife named Angie.

                         2ND MAN
            No, nothing.  There's only some talk.

                         DOYLE
            What?

                         2ND MAN
            Coming in this week, week after.
            Everybody going to get well.

                         DOYLE
            Who brings it?

                                                           28.


                         2ND MAN
            Who knows?

                         DOYLE
            Where do you want it?

                         2ND MAN
            This side.

Door of toilet.  There is a hell of a crash and slamming
behind it.  Door opens and DOYLE steps out over the crumpled
prostrate form of the INFORMER.  He has just decked the man
to continue the protection of the cover.  He pauses halfway
down the line as if he's speculating on beating up another
one because he didn't get any information.  But he decides
that would be futile too.

                         DOYLE
            I'm goin' check on this address in
            the Bronx, if you're bullshitting
            me, it's your ass.

                         RUSSO
            Tell everybody we'll be back in an
            hour.

                         DOYLE
                   (to all)
            We're goin' now!  Goodbye.

EXT. PASSENGER SHIP - DAY

Close shot of DEVEREAUX, New York harbor in the background,
being interviewed by television reporters on his arrival in
the U.S. abroad a passenger ship.  He is smiling, jovial,
charming.

                         REPORTER 1
            How long will you be here?

                         DEVEREAUX
            Not long enough.  Two... perhaps
            three... weeks at most.

Medium close shot of DEVEREAUX and THREE TV REPORTERS, as
they talk, a crane moves into action behind them and lifts
out of hold.  LA VALLE is with DEVEREAUX as Translator and
Interpreter.

                         GIRL TV REPORTER
            Why did you come by ship, Mr.
            Devereaux?

                                                           29.


                         DEVEREAUX
            The next several weeks will be very
            difficult and the middle of the
            ocean is the only place where the
            telephone isn't ringing all the time.

                         REPORTER
            What will be the viewpoint of your
            documentary.

                         DEVEREAUX
            To make a Frenchman feel what it is
            like to be a New Yorker.

                         LA VALLE
            That's enough now, ladies and
            gentlemen.  M. Devereaux is due at
            his hotel in half an hour.

Overhead the Lincoln comes down from the hold of the ship.

EXT. WEST SIDE DRIVE - DAY

A long view of the pier from the opposite (east) side of
West Street, beneath the steel trusses and girders of the
West Side Drive and through the forest of cars that are
parked there, the jam of traffic that develops around every
unloading vessel.  It is a view that takes in the front end
of the Lincoln inching off the pier.  HENRI DEVEREAUX at the
wheel, turns to his right.  We watch until the point of view
on the sidewalk.  ALAIN CHARNIER and PIERRE NICOLI are
standing there watching.  When the car (off-camera) turns
east on the way to the garage, NICOLI glances to CHARNIER.
CHARNIER does not look back.

EXT. DORAL HOTEL - LINCOLN PULLS IN - DAY

INT. POLICE OFFICE - NIGHT

Close shot of WALTER SIMONSON at desk in the large square
office he occupies as a Lieutenant of Detectives in charge
of the Manhattan Narcotics Bureau.  He is the immediate
superior of RUSSO and DOYLE, head of the 200-man narcotics
squad that polices Manhattan.

                         SIMONSON
                   (with coffee cup)
            All that is great -- but you guys
            work Bed-Stuy.  You're not supposed
            to be in Ridgewood.

DOYLE, RUSSO and SIMONSON

                                                           30.


                         DOYLE
            Detach us.  Let us have a shot at
            it, at least until we see if
            there's anything here or not.
            Everybody wants Weinstock, right?
            So maybe here's a lead.  We deserve
            it.

                         SIMONSON
            You couldn't burn a three-time
            loser with what you're bringing in
            here.  You know you stiffs could
            run yourselves an entrapment rap.
            The guy has done nothing -- Brooklyn
            is full of Candy Store guys with
            two cars who like to go to
            nightclubs.

                         RUSSO
            Put this little candy hustler
            together with Joel Weinstock and it
            could be we stumbled into a big
            score.

                         SIMONSON
                   (moves to window)
            Big score!  He's dealin' a few bags
            here and there on the side.

                         DOYLE
            Simonson, I wouldn't be infringing
            on your coffee break if I thought
            he was a nickel and dimer.

                         SIMONSON
            Your hunches have backfired before,
            Doyle.

DOYLE, close, no comment.

Back to SIMONSON.

                         SIMONSON
                   (moves back to stand
                   at desk)
            Jimmy, what the hell's happening
            with you lately?
                   (pause)
            You got more collars than any Narc
            in the bureau.  What was it.  Over
            100 last year?  Terrific.  But who?
                         (MORE)

                                                           31.


                         SIMONSON (CONT'D)
            You stop and shake down a bellboy
            because he's got three joints in
            his sock.  You hit a high school
            kid in short pants who looks like
            he's got a twitch.

RUSSO.  Getting it back on the track.

                         RUSSO
                   (moves in to desk)
            We got information that there's no
            shit in the street -- it's like a
            desert full of junkies with a big
            score coming in to make everybody
            well.

DOYLE

                         DOYLE
            This could be it, Walter.  This
            Candy Store guy, putting on a big
            show in a fancy nightclub with
            known connections all over him.
            Then on our own, after working the
            whole day and night, we tail him
            out to Brooklyn and sit on him for
            a week practically, and who do we
            come up with?  Joel Weinstock.
                   (he leans forward)
            You gotta let us have it.

THREE SHOT - RUSSO, DOYLE, SIMONSON

                         SIMONSON
                   (pause, he turns to RUSSO)
            You really believe all this crap?

                         RUSSO
            I go with my partner.

A pause.

                         SIMONSON
            What'll it take?

                         RUSSO
            First a wire.

                         DOYLE
            Two wires.  One on the store and
            one on his house.

                                                           32.


                         SIMONSON
            You know I have to get a court
            order for wiretaps.

                         RUSSO
            Try... okay?

                         DOYLE
            We know you can do it, Walter.

They start to leave.

Close on SIMONSON.

                         SIMONSON
            Popeye...

Close on DOYLE at the door.  RUSSO beside him.

Back to SIMONSON

                         SIMONSON
            You still pickin' your feet in
            Poughkeepsie?

           SAL (V.O.)                     RUSSO
  What's this crap.  I just          (He raps on table
  spoke to my wife and she           with a coffee cup.
  says you're raisin' me a           Doyle gets up.)
  halfa cent on the cups.        C'mere and lissen to your

           (V.O.)                He's fightin' with somebody

  C'mon Sal, I got my orders,

           SAL (V.O.)
  Well, if you can't do better
  than that, you can stick the
  cups.

EXT. AUTO GRAVEYARD (HUNTS POINT AND EAST RIVER) - DAY

HIGH ANGLE: Close shot of CHARNIER, MARIE and LA VALLE
walking slowly together toward the camera.  They are at the
auto graveyard and the scene of an auction of cars towed off
New York streets by the Police Department.  About twenty
other men are walking around, looking at the cars.

A POLICEMAN blows a whistle and the prospective car buyers
gather around the auction trailer in the b.g.

                         LA VALLE
            There are four auto graveyards like
            this one in the other boroughs,
            handling about a thousand vehicles
            a month.  Those that aren't claimed
            are auctioned here once a month.

                         MARIE
            Just for mistakes of parking?

                                                           34.


                         LA VALLE
            No.  Many are involved in crimes
            and confiscated... or just abandoned.
            This is, as you know, your prime
            source of scrap metal, M. Charnier.

                         MARIE
                   (off camera)
            Darling, may I have this one?

Medium close shot MARIE, standing next to an LTD.

                         MARIE
            It looks so lonesome here.

CHARNIER and LA VALLE approach her.

                         CHARNIER
            It would look even more lonesome in
            our garage.

INT. THE AUCTION TRAILER - DAY

Within the large trailer, about TWENTY MEN are seated at two
long benches to each side.  Some are standing to the rear.
At the front, an AUCTIONEER stands at a lectern.  To his
left sits a CLERK at a small table.  The AUCTIONEER wears a
sweater and hat.  The buyers are tough types, young and old.
All have inventory lists.  The atmosphere is informal.  The
CHARNIERS and LA VALLE enter the trailer at the back.

                         AUCTIONEER
            Every car sold today must be
            removed at the purchaser's own
            expense.  We have no keys or
            anything to start the vehicles with.
            You buy 'em as you see 'em and
            where you see 'em.  All right, the
            first car offered is Number 24398.
            A Plymouth sedan.  Do I hear
            fifteen dollars?

The bidding goes up to forty dollars.  A large BURLY MAN
wins the bid.  He goes up to the CLERK and accepts the bill
of sale.

                         AUCTIONEER
            We go to 24399 -- A Pontiac Station
            wagon.  Do I hear ten dollars?

                         LA VALLE
                   (aside to CHARNIER)
            Notice he will never mention the
            year of the car.

                                                           35.


                         AUCTIONEER
            I got a fifteen dollar bid going...
            Do I hear anymore...
            Eighteen... who'll say Eighteen?
            Twenty...
            Twenty-three...
            Anymore...
            Twenty-five.  Twenty-five once --
            Do I hear twenty-eight...
            All right, last call for twenty-
            five...

            for shipment?

                         LA VALLE
            Yes, sir.  That man in the dark
            jacket is our buyer.

EXT. WARD'S ISLAND (UNDER WEST ABUTMENT OF THE HELLGATE
BRIDGE)

Pick up CHARNIER, MARIE and MAURICE LAVALLE

As the camera plays over the bridge: (in French)

                         CHARNIER (V.O.)
            It's beautiful.

                         LA VALLE (V.O.)
            It was built in 1917 - and was one
            of the two heaviest bridges in the
            world.  The arch is still the
            largest in the world.

                         CHARNIER
            Who financed it?

                                                           37.


                         LA VALLE
            Two railroads as part of a
            connecting railway which provided
            passage from New England to the
            South.  It was actually the first
            railroad through New York City.

                         MARIE
            Why is it called Hellgate?

                         LA VALLE
            The river at this point is the most
            dangerous on the East Coast.  Years
            ago, hundreds of ships went down
            here.

                         CHARNIER
            If this bridge were in Europe, it
            would be on every tourist's sight-
            seeing list.

                         LA VALLE
            Most New Yorkers never notice it -
            most Americans have never heard of
            it.

                         CHARNIER
            Look how gracefully they conceived
            that arch.  Like a bowstring.  It
            was built from both ends.  With no
            support in the middle.  Beautiful.

                         LA VALLE
            Mmm.

                         MARIE
            Alain is the only man I know who
            can become as enthusiastic about a
            bridge as he can about a woman.

                         CHARNIER
            Not any woman, Marie.  Just one.

                         LA VALLE
            I'm afraid the rest of Ward's
            Island isn't nearly as romantic - a
            pollution plant, a hospital, a
            training school for garbage men and
            that area over there, where the old
            cars are kept, prior to being
            processed for shipment to, among
            other places, The Charnier Shipping
            Company, of Marseilles, France.

(NEAR CREMATORIUM)

                         MARIE
            What is that old building?

                         LA VALLE
            Oh, it's been abandoned for years.

                         MARIE
            What was it?

                         LA VALLE
            It was a crematorium.

                         MARIE
            For garbage?

                         LA VALLE

caught in an ecstasy of pain and pleasure.  The tempo of the
strokes rises.  Suddenly it reaches a crescendo and he
screams out in orgasm.

Close, full-length shot of a nude BLONDE GIRL, wearing only
black boots and silk panties.  She's walking away from the
camera, throwing aside a small cat-o-nine-tails flagellant
whip.  We can hear NICOLI's heavy breathing until the girl
speaks as she moves toward a couch.

            You're Fifty Dollars short.

The look of anger turns to one of consternation as NICOLI
reacts to her.

INT. MUTCHIE'S BAR - NIGHT

In Lower Manhattan.  There are SIX or EIGHT MATRONS still
there, stevedores and truck drivers.  Most of them are
clustered at the far end of the bar, where MUTCHIE, a gray-
haired gone-to-paunch Irishman with spectacles as thick as
pop-bottle bottoms stands behind the mahogany bar.  The
cluster of customers is involved in a typical New York
saloon argument.

DOYLE is ignoring the debate and watching the television.
He is approached by a small MAN in a long coat and baggy
suit with suspenders.  This is JESUS THE BOOSTER.

                         JESUS
            Hey, Bo.

                         DOYLE
            Hiya, Jesus.

                         JESUS
            Can you use a new suit for
            Christmans?

                         DOYLE
            Whatta you got?

JESUS reaches into his trousers and pulls out three suits
(jackets and pants).  They are of the latest style and
color, and still on hangers!

                         JESUS
            Whatta you?... a 44... 46?

DOYLE examines one of the jackets.

                                                           42.


                         DOYLE
            Where'd you get this fag shit?

                         JESUS
            This is what the tough guys are
            wearin'.  You know I only steal
            from the best.  It's Bonwit Teller.

                         DOYLE
            Pass.

                         JESUS
            Forty dollars -- was $250.

                         DOYLE
            Whyn't you get it dry cleaned and
            burned.

JESUS blends into the crowd and we pick up the dialogue of
MUTCHIE and his cronies, BAD EDDIE, LEE and PUGGY.

                         MUTCHIE
            A big man could alluz beat a little
            man.  That's why Wilt Chamberlain
            could murder Jim Brown if they ever
            fought.

                         BAD EDDIE
            No chance.  Brown'd kill him.

                         MUTCHIE
            Chamberlain's seven foot tall,
            right?  He's got a twelve-foot
            reach.  It's geophysics.  He's
            punchin' down on you with leverage.
            He cave your chest in.

                         BAD EDDIE
            Best I ever seen was The Rock.  He
            was the calmest and the meanest.
            Guys like Sugar'd be pukin' before
            a fight.  Jake LaMotta'd be pukin'.
            Marciano was calm like he was goin'
            to church.  What about the night he
            fought LaStarza?  He hit him so
            hard he broke the blood vessels in
            LaStarza's arms.  He was the
            strongest meanest bastard ever lived.

                         PUGGY
            Hey, Mutchie, give us another bullet.

MUTCHIE pours him a straight Scotch in a shotglass.

                                                           43.


                         MUTCHIE
            Blackjack Burns coulds been the
            greatest ever --

                         PUGGY
            -- He was a stone tanker.

                         MUTCHIE
            That's right, he couldn't fight
            legit.  One night at the Garden
            about 1950, '51 -- he fought either
            Jake LaMotta or Gus Lesnevich, I
            think it was -- he took one o'
            those cream puff punches in the
            sixth -- the laziest left you ever
            seen -- missed him entirely.  Down
            goes Blackjack without even workin'
            up a sweat and the whole Garden
            gets up in its feet and I swear to
            Christ, everybody starts singin'
            "Dance With Me Henry."

                         LEE
            I fought a guy in Cleveland once.
            I knew he was a dirty fighter so I
            stick a crowbar in my crotch.
            Right here.  Second round he gives
            me a shot -- Boom -- he breaks his
            hand, the fight's over.

                         PUGGY
            Fuck it, I like nitroglycerin,
            that's my game.

                         MUTCHIE
            What about you, Doyle?  Who's the
            best fighter you ever seen?

                         DOYLE
                   (a few drinks behind him)
            Willie Mays.

                         BAD EDDIE & LEE
            Willie Mays?!

                         DOYLE
            With a baseball bat!  One swing!
            Knock your fuckin' head off.

TIME LAPSE.  The DRINKERS are gone.  MUTCHIE is at the bar
cleaning up.  DOYLE is in the open adjoining kitchen area
cooking breakfast.

                                                           44.


                         MUTCHIE
            What ya doin' out so late?  Hidin'
            from the cops?

                         DOYLE
            I hear the health department is
            going to close this joint for
            selling dirty beer.  I come by to
            help you carry out your money.

                         MUTCHIE
            They'll close you down if they ever
            get a look at those busted-valise
            broads you run with.

                         DOYLE
            You want some eggs.

                         MUTCHIE
            Why not?

                         DOYLE
                   (looking around for bacon)
            Hey, Mutch!  You want bacon?

                         MUTCHIE
            Yeah!

                         DOYLE
                   (rattling pans,
                   looking around)
            Where the hell is it?

                         MUTCHIE
            Where the hell do you think it is,
            potato head?

DOYLE opens the door to the icebox.

                         MUTCHIE
            No wonder there's so many Mafia
            around.  Ya couldn't find a Puerto
            Rican in Spanish Harlem.

TIME LAPSE.  Almost morning.  Close on DOYLE and MUTCHIE
eating bacon and eggs.  MUTCHIE is standing behind the bar
as he eats, DOYLE is sitting in front of it.  They both have
a bottle of beer.

                                                           45.


                         MUTCHIE
            I got this little chick I'm tryin'
            to hit on.  She's about 20, 21... I
            take her to Jilly's last night and
            she's tellin' me about how she
            wants to settle down one day, get
            married... I says, "Hey, this is
            1971, baby, I'm just a dirty old
            man lookin' to score with some
            pussy."

                         DOYLE
            Strike out, eh?

                         MUTCHIE
            Yeah.  In the late innings.  Ya
            look like a night's sleep wouldn't
            kill ya.

                         DOYLE
            A piece of ass wouldn't kill me.

                         MUTCHIE
            When ya go back on?

                         DOYLE
            Morning.  Sometime.

                         MUTCHIE
            Whyn't ya stretch out on the pool
            table for a couple hours.  The kid
            comes in at six will wake ya.  A
            couple eggs and a beer is cheaper
            than keepin' a dog around the joint.

EXT. MUTCHIE'S BAR - DAY

Close of DOYLE going to his car.  He stops for a light.
DOYLE is red-eyed and in need of a shave.  He fidgets
through his pockets looking for a cigarette but doesn't find
one.  As he drives along a GIRL CYCLIST comes into view
alongside.

Our view is DOYLE's view of her long, lean tapered legs.  If
he looks further, and DOYLE always looks further, he will
see there is a bra-band sweater covering her well-formed
breasts.  The pendulous swing is there as she bends over the
handlebars.

Close front view of DOYLE looking back to the light, then
back to the legs.

Close outside view, the cyclist, of DOYLE leaning out the
window with his badge in his hand.

                                                           46.


                         DOYLE
            You got a pedaller's license?

                         GIRL
            What?

                         DOYLE
            You're under arrest.

INT. SIMONSON OFFICE - DAY

Medium close shot of RUSSO and SIMONSON.  PHIL KLEIN, a
federal narcotics agent, is reading aloud from an article in
the New York Daily News.  MULDERIG is listening and sipping
coffee.

Close shot of BILL MULDERIG, a Fed narcotics agent.

                         MULDERIG
            Whatta you got -- four more years,
            Walter?

Medium close of SIMONSON and RUSSO

                         SIMONSON
            Three.

Close shot of MULDERIG.

                         MULDERIG
            Christ, by the time you get out all
            this shit'll be legal.

Wide shot of room, taking in SIMONSON, RUSSO, MULDERIG and
PHIL KLEIN.  SIMONSON hands BUDDY a stack of warrants.

                         SIMONSON
                   (rises, to RUSSO)
            The judge gave you ten days on
            these.  Klein and Mulderig will be
            sitting in for the Federals.  Tell
            Doyle they'll make all the buys,
            and that they're to be kept informed
            of everything that goes down.

SIMONSON turns to MULDERIG.

                         SIMONSON
            You know Doyle, don't you Bill?

Close of MULDERIG.

                                                           47.


                         MULDERIG
                   (rises)
            Sure, I know Popeye.  The Master of
            undercover, whose brilliant idea of
            disguise is to limp into a room on
            his left foot and limp out on his
            right.  Whose brilliant hunches
            cost the death of a good officer --

Close of RUSSO

                         RUSSO
            If that's how you're coming in, why
            not stay home and save us all a lot
            of grief.

MULDERIG, close.

                         MULDERIG
            That's just my opinion.

RUSSO, close.

                         RUSSO
            Whyn't you shove it up your ass!

EXT. DOYLE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Long shot of RUSSO approaching housing project group of
buildings.  This is where DOYLE lives.

INT. HALLWAY TO DOYLE'S APARTMENT

RUSSO rings the bell.  No response.  He knocks.  Again
nothing.  He hears a shower working inside the apartment.

                         RUSSO
            Popeye.

No answer.

                         RUSSO
            Popeye.

                         DOYLE
                   (off, weakly)
            Yeah.

                         RUSSO
            It's Cloudy.  Open the door.

                         DOYLE
                   (off)
            I can't.

                                                           48.


                         RUSSO
            Why not?

                         DOYLE
                   (off)
            Let yourself in.

RUSSO reaches into his jacket pocket and gets a celluloid
card, his PBA card, which he slides into the door at the
lock.  He gives it a juggle and the lock is free but the
door moves grudgingly.

INT. DOYLE'S APARTMENT - DAY

The door to DOYLE's apartment, a close view from inside.
There's a bike propped against it and BUDDY RUSSO is trying
to push it open from the outside.

                         RUSSO
                   (behind door)
            What the hell you got holding the
            door?

The bike teeters and falls with a crash and RUSSO comes into
the room puzzled, exasperated.

INT. APARTMENT - RUSSO'S POV - DAY

DOYLE is anklecuffed to the bedpost at the foot of the bed.

                         RUSSO
            What happened to you?

                         DOYLE
                   (sleepy)
            The crazy kid handcuffed me to the
            bed.  With my own cuffs.

The shower goes off.  RUSSO puts the bike upright on its
stand and squeezes the horn, which makes a loud beep.

The BIKE GIRL appears in the bathroom door, wrapped in a
towel.

                         BIKE GIRL
            Oh!

RUSSO sees key on dresser - tosses it to DOYLE.  There are
clothes all over the place, the GIRL's cycling outfit,
DOYLE's pants and shoes and socks.  The decor is completely
impersonal.  RUSSO looks up.

                                                           49.


                         RUSSO
                   (looking at scrapbook
                   on dresser)
            You oughta get plastic covers for
            this stuff like I did - your
            scrapbook's a mess like everything
            else in your life.

RUSSO goes to chair.

                         DOYLE
            Gimme my pants.

RUSSO, who is half sitting on them, pulls the pants loose
and hands them to DOYLE.

                         DOYLE
            You got the warrant?

                         RUSSO
                   (sitting)
            We also got Bill Mulderig and Phil
            Klein.

Close on DOYLE, buttoning his pants.

                         DOYLE
            What do we need those pricks for?

Medium close on RUSSO picking around through the clothes,
coming up with a pair of panties.  He holds them out.

                         RUSSO
            Because by actual count our bureau
            has exactly nine hundred eighteen
            dollars and fifty-four cents to
            make buys and Mulderig's Feds can
            get all of Uncle Sam's money he
            wants by just asking.

DOYLE sitting on bed, strapping the holster on his ankle.
He checks his gun.

                         DOYLE
            Throw 'em in the bathroom, will you?
            How good are the warrants?

                         RUSSO
                   (on the move down
                   hall, at bathroom door)
            Sixty days.  Here.  Don't mention it.

                                                           50.


DOYLE is checking various items that go in his briefcase -
notebook, handcuffs, book of laws, field reports, pencils,
binoculars, candy bars, etc.

Medium close shot of RUSSO looking toward the bathroom door.

                         RUSSO
            Hi!

RUSSO looks back to DOYLE.  There is the sound of a kickstand
being kicked back in place, the door opening and the GIRL
leaving.

Medium close shot of DOYLE tying the shoes, wincing.  Looking
up to the departing GIRL.

                         RUSSO
            Drive carefully!

EXT/INT. RUSSO'S CAR - DAY

Close shot of BILL MULDERIG in back seat.  BUDDY is in
front, next to DOYLE at the wheel.

                         MULDERIG
            Strictly small potatoes.

We can see DOYLE working to keep up with the black Mercury
as they cross the Brooklyn Bridge in fairly heavy traffic.
The Mercury cuts around in and out, DOYLE plunges after him.

                         MULDERIG
            You really know how to pick 'em,
            Doyle.

RUSSO turns his head in anger.

                         MULDERIG
            Still wearing your gun on your ankle?

No answer.

                         MULDERIG
            Somebody told me the reason you did
            that was so's when you met a chick
            and rubbed against her she wouldn't
            know you were a cop.

No answer.

                         MULDERIG
            I said that was bullshit.  It must
            be some kind of fast-draw gimmick
            or something.

                                                           51.


                         RUSSO
            Knock it off, Bill.

                         MULDERIG
            He's gettin' too far ahead.  You're
            gonna lose him.

DOYLE cuts into the next lane to a lot of horn-blowing and
comes to a dead, screeching stop.  DOYLE sits up sharply
erect in the seat, craning to see where SAL is going.  He
throws open the door and hurls himself out.

EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY

Rear medium close shot of DOYLE climbing up on the side of
the car to look ahead, then jumping down and running off.

DOYLE running as hard as he can.

Medium close side shot of SAL turning off the bridge onto
the FDR Drive, moving quickly and smoothly uptown.

DOYLE running to a stop, and staring ahead.  Breathing hard,
horns are blowing on the bridge and they drown out the words
as he curses, "Dirty Sonofabitch."

INT. RUSSO'S CAR - DAY

RUSSO is on the blower.

                         RUSSO
            Phil -- it's Cloudy -- we lost
            him --

Static comes over the two-way radio.

EXT. BOCA'S CAR COMES OFF RAMP, PAN TO

INT. KLEIN'S CAR - DAY

KLEIN is parked on Pearl Street below the Brooklyn Bridge.

                         RUSSO (V.O.)
            He just got off the Bridge - He's
            all yours if you can find him.
            Sonofabitch!

KLEIN starts his car.

EXT. A PARKING GARAGE IN THE EAST 40'S - DAY

SAL emerges from the garage and heads toward Madison Avenue.
He passes a man looking in a store window, PHIL KLEIN.
KLEIN follows him.

                                                           52.


EXT. A STREET IN THE EAST 40'S - DAY

SAL stops abruptly at the corner and turns around.  KLEIN is
forced to pass him and cross the street.

SAL crosses the street to his left, at a right angle to KLEIN.

EXT. MADISON AVENUE - LATE DAY

SAL moving north on Madison Avenue.  He is walking in a
triangular trap of foot surveillance.  We begin to learn
this when we fall back twenty feet behind SAL and pick up
the figure of JIMMY DOYLE, moving at exactly the same pace.
While he keeps looking forward after SAL, he also looks
regularly to the left, across to the West side of Madison
where we quickly zoom in on the figure of BILL MULDERIG, who
is on an even line opposite SAL and moving almost precisely
in step with the subject of their surveillance.  MULDERIG
keeps an eye on SAL but is also glancing north ahead of SAL
to BUDDY RUSSO, who is 20 or 30 feet ahead of SAL, thus
forming the triangle of the A-B-C tail.

SAL bobbing along.

DOYLE following.

MULDERIG keeping pace.

RUSSO up front.

SAL suddenly turning East at the Northeast corner of 46th
Street, the block occupied by the Roosevelt Hotel.

MULDERIG yanking at his right ear.

RUSSO spinning around, hurrying back toward the corner.

DOYLE turning East at the Southeast corner of 46th Street.

RUSSO coming around the corner looking to DOYLE.

DOYLE indicating the Roosevelt entrance with his chin while
MULDERIG comes up to join DOYLE.

RUSSO moving quickly into the Roosevelt entrance on 46th
Street between Madison and Vanderbilt.

INT. ROOSEVELT LOBBY - DAY

Roosevelt lobby stairs with ALAIN CHARNIER, PIERRE NICOLI,
SAL greeting.

                         CHARNIER
            Excuse me.

                                                           53.


                         RUSSO
                   (he is moving through
                   the jam they form on
                   the stairs)
            Excuse me.

We move into the lobby of the Roosevelt and then spin around
quickly, to watch CHARNIER, NICOLI and SAL moving upstairs
and out the door.

EXT. DAY

A distant view from the Northeast corner of 46th Street and
Madison Avenue of the Roosevelt Hotel marquee and the three
men under it, CHARNIER, NICOLI and SAL.  They are in animated
conversation.

DOYLE and MULDERIG on the point-of-view corner across
Madison, MULDERIG with his back to the camera, DOYLE talking
and watching over Mulderig's shoulder.

Close shot DOYLE's face, eyes bright with excitement.

Long view of CHARNIER, NICOLI and SAL under the marquee from
DOYLE's view, zooming in on CHARNIER, who continues to talk,
look up, then look back to SAL.

                         DOYLE
            You take Sal.  I'll stick with the
            beard if they split.

EXT. MADISON AVENUE - DAY

Rear view of ALAIN CHARNIER and PIERRE NICOLI strolling
slowly down Madison Avenue in the Forties.

An overhead view of the pair, CHARNIER and NICOLI, including
DOYLE 20 or 30 yards behind, RUSSO across the street, even
with him.

CHARNIER and NICOLI window-shopping at Walter's Electric,
49th and 3rd Avenue.

RUSSO looking quizzically, puzzled, from a doorway.

CHARNIER and NICOLI are engaged in a running conversation
that we cannot hear.  But what CHARNIER is saying is simply
that he wants to get a pack of cigarettes before they turn
back and stop for dinner.

RUSSO looking to DOYLE for a signal.

                                                           54.


EXT. A CIGAR STORE - DAY

DOYLE already beginning to feel the cold, rubbing his hands
together, at the front of the place CHARNIER and NICOLI have
entered, trying to figure it out as CHARNIER and NICOLI
emerge, CHARNIER ripping the cellophane off a pack of
cigarettes, and they turn back in DOYLE's direction.

DOYLE, face to face with CHARNIER and NICOLI.  Straining to
hear, he picks up a few words of French.  Without losing
stride he steps off the curb and cuts across the street,
moving south, away from them, as they come north.  But
halfway across the street, we pick up RUSSO coming in his
direction, sharp enough to pick up the tail where DOYLE had
to drop it.

EXT. RESTAURANT - DAY

Medium close view through window of ALAIN CHARNIER and
PIERRE NICOLI sitting at a table near the front windows of a
small restaurant.

EXT. STREET - DAY

A long shot of street zooming in on JIMMY DOYLE who is

the other, his shoulders hunched, occasionally cupping his
hands to his ears.

INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

A medium close shot of WAITER holding a bottle of Sainte
Emillion out for CHARNIER's inspection.  CHARNIER looks,

DOYLE's feet.  He's standing on one foot, the other raised
and he's squeezing it with a chapped hand, as if trying to
get circulation back into it.

Medium close shot of RUSSO standing in front of DOYLE while
DOYLE fishes a piece of pizza out of the bag and lets it
fold into his mouth, then licks his fingers.

                         RUSSO
            You want the red or the white?

                         DOYLE
            Pour it in your ear.

glancing toward CHARNIER and then the tray.

EXT. RESTAURANT - DAY

Close shot of RUSSO peering at the restaurant.  DOYLE's face
right behind him, peering over RUSSO's shoulder, trying to
drink coffee from a paper container and also moving slightly
against the cold and the pain of the shoes.

EXT. FIRST AVENUE - DAY (EXT. COPAIN)

Rear long view of CHARNIER and NICOLI on Madison in the
Forties strolling to a corner where NICOLI is splitting for
the Edison Hotel (West 46th Street) while CHARNIER goes on

a nod.  Hold on them as BUDDY RUSSO comes into view, moving
off after NICOLI.  DOYLE follow CHARNIER.

                                                           56.


Medium close shot of DOYLE leaning on elbow on the counter,
half-turned to keep an eye on the elevators.

                         DOYLE
            That guy just walked in.  What's
            his name?

Close on CLERK and DOYLE.

                         DESK CLERK
            I'm sorry, I don't know who you mean.

                         DOYLE
                   (showing badge)
            He got off on six.

                         DESK CLERK
            We have four rooms and six suites
            on six.  There's a man in almost
            every one of them.

Close of DOYLE.

                         DOYLE
            Little shorter than me.  Well-
            dressed.  About forty-five or fifty
            with salt-and-pepper hair, a beard.

Close of CLERK.  Thinks it over.

                         DESK CLERK
            There's nobody like that on six.

DOYLE AND CLERK

                         DESK CLERK
            Perhaps he's visiting a guest.

                         DOYLE
            No, I figure he stays here.  Where's
            your registration?

CLERK gets out registration log book, goes through list as
DOYLE waits.

                         DESK CLERK
            There may be two... no, three who
            could fit it.

                         DOYLE
            Names.

                                                           57.


                         DESK CLERK
            A Mr. Paul Ganapolos, he's here
            alone.

                         DOYLE
            Where from?

                         DESK CLERK
            Des Moines.

                         DOYLE
            What's he do?

                         DESK CLERK
            Businessman.  Owns a department
            store in Des Moines, I think.

DOYLE is taking down the information on a pad.

                         DESK CLERK
            Mr. and Mrs. Alain Charnier, would
            be another.  He's in shipping.

                         DOYLE
            Yeh?  Who else?

                         DESK CLERK
            And a Mr. Michael Lowenstein, I
            don't know what he does.

                         DOYLE
            This Charnier guy.  He's in shipping?

                         DESK CLERK
            I think so.  But they're in Room
            408.  On the fourth floor.

Close of DOYLE.

                         DOYLE
            Where's he from?

CLERK

                         DESK CLERK
            Marseilles.

DOYLE AND CLERK

                         DOYLE

                                                           58.


                         DESK CLERK
            That's in France.

                         DOYLE
            Yeah, I know.

EXT. WESTBURY HOTEL ON MADISON AVENUE - NIGHT

Medium close shot of DOYLE standing in another doorway, this
one in Madison Avenue, opposite and a little up the street
from the Westbury.  It is about 2 o'clock in the morning and
there's not much traffic.  DOYLE looks like a man almost too
tired to stand.  We hear a car pull up (off camera).

INT. RUSSO'S CAR - NIGHT

View from the front seat of a sedan of DOYLE falling into
the corner of the back seat.  RUSSO reaches across the seat
from the camera to hand DOYLE a brown paper container of
coffee.  He opens it between his knees and scalds his mouth
with it.  RUSSO hands over another gift, a pint of Canadian
Club.  DOYLE takes a big swig.

Rear close view of BILL MULDERIG at the wheel of the car,
looking at DOYLE in the rear-view mirror.

                         MULDERIG
            You about ready for a break?

A view of MULDERIG at the wheel, RUSSO twisted around in the
seat, looking back at DOYLE and putting the cap back on the
bottle.  When DOYLE isn't sipping at the coffee-whiskey,
he's looking out the window of the car at the entrance of
the hotel.  He looks beat.

                         DOYLE
            The guy's a frog -- I'm pretty sure.
            Also he made me.  Stayin' on four
            but went up to six -- cute.

                         RUSSO
            The other guy's a frog too.  Checked
            in at the Edison.  Had a hooker
            sent up.

                         MULDERIG
            Christ you should o' collared him
            right there.

                         DOYLE
            Who's on him?

                         RUSSO
            Phil Klein.

                                                           59.


                         DOYLE
            What about Sal?

RUSSO

                         RUSSO
            We put him to bed for the night.

MULDERIG

                         MULDERIG
            Why don't you do the same, Doyle?
            You look like shit.

DOYLE AND MULDERIG - INTERCUT

                         DOYLE
                   (to MULDERIG)
            Look.  My partner and I found this
            case and I don't want no Feds
            screwing it up.

                         MULDERIG
            Case?  So far I haven't seen a damn
            thing.

                         DOYLE
            Bill, keep shootin' your mouth off
            and I'll knock you into the middle
            of next week.

RUSSO, close.

                         RUSSO
            Jimmy, cool it.  Nothin's goin'
            down tonight.  Cop a few zzz's
            while you can.

Close shot, DOYLE.

INT. WEINSTOCK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Close shot of CHEMIST with a small lab layout spread in
front of him -- burner, test tubes, etc.  The MAN's wearing
an ordinary business suit and both the table and the
background indicate that this is not a lab, but somebody's
library or den -- and a fashionable one, with photos, a
signed picture of Lyndon Johnson, etc., on the panelled walls.

The CHEMIST is running a Thiele test on a small mound of
powder.  Heroin from CHARNIER's shipment.

Medium close shot of JOEL WEINSTOCK and SAL BOCA sitting
opposite the CHEMIST.

                                                           60.


SAL has a glass of beer in front of him, WEINSTOCK a brandy
snifter containing a splash of amber cognac.  Both are
interested; SAL quite nervously.

The CHEMIST immerses a capillary tube, a tiny instrument the
size of a needle into an open kilo of heroin.

He pours a small quantity of mineral oil into a burnmeister
test tube and preheats the oil over the open flame of a tiny
alcohol lamp.

He removes a 15-in thermometer from its leather case,
fastens the capillary tuve (now totally immersed in the
heroin) to the bulb of the thermometer with a rubber band.

He places the bulb, with capillary attached, into an open
rubber stop and inserts the entire apparatus into the
burnmeister tube, about three inches in.

With a small metal clamp he holds the rig over the lamp.

We watch closely with the CHEMIST, WEINSTOCK and BOCA as the
white heroin powder slowly, agonizingly dissolves into the
mineral oil and

The mercury rises slowly up the thermometer to 220° - 230°.

The faces of the three men are filled with wonder and
anxiety.  As the mercury continues to rise they become a
cheering section, rooting the hometeam home.

The longer it takes for the powder to dissolve, the purer
the heroin.  The mercury stops at 240°!

                         CHEMIST
            Absolutely dynamite!  89.5 proof!
            Best I've ever seen!  If the rest
            is like this, you'll be dealing for
            two years on this load.

Close on WEINSTOCK, relaxed, smoking a large cigar.

                         WEINSTOCK
            Retail is not my end of the business.
            Are you telling me it's worth the
            half million?

Medium close of the CHEMIST.

                         CHEMIST
            How many kilos?

                         SAL
            Sixty.

                                                           61.


                         CHEMIST
            Six kilos at eight big ones a
            kilo...
                   (he nods)
            I'd say it should be able to take a
            seven to one hit in the street.

                         SAL
            By the time it gets down to nickel
            bags it's at least thirty-two
            million!

Medium close of WEINSTOCK and BOCA.

                         WEINSTOCK
            Thank you, Howard.  Take what's
            left there with you and goodnight.

The CHEMIST packs his apparatus and leaves.

                         SAL
            I guess we got a deal, eh?

Medium close shot of WEINSTOCK alone, appraising BOCA.

                         WEINSTOCK
            We got a test.  A deal for half a
            million dollars, maybe.

SAL, whose cool is easily shattered.

                         SAL
            Joel, the man is in a hurry.  He
            wants the bread and he wants to go
            back to France.  He ain't gonna
            hang around and play games.  He's
            one o' the shrewdest cats I ever
            run across.

WEINSTOCK, close.

                         WEINSTOCK
            What am I, a shmuck?  What's the
            hurry?  He could see a couple of
            shows and visit the top of the
            Empire State Building.

INTERCUT SAL, WEINSTOCK

                         SAL
            Joel, don't jerk me.  I spent a lot
            o' time settin' this one up.

                                                           62.


                         WEINSTOCK
            So whatta you want a badge?  It's
            your first major league game Sal.
            One thing I learned, move calmly,
            move cautiously.  You'll never be
            sorry.

                         SAL
            I been damn careful up to now.

                         WEINSTOCK
            Which is why your phone lines are
            tapped and the Feds are crawlin'
            all over you like flies.

                         SAL
            I'm straight, Joel.  They haven't
            got shit on me.  Look, I'm tellin'
            you, he'll take the deal somewhere
            else.

WEINSTOCK

                         WEINSTOCK
            He could go someplace else with his
            sixty kilos of heroin and see how
            easy it is to pull together a half
            million cash.  He wouldn't find
            there was any hurry to do this kind
            of business.

SAL, a little desperate.

                         SAL
            Look, the stuff is here.  We could
            set up the switch in an hour.  I'm
            tellin' you, Mr. Weinstock, he'll
            split if we don't move.  This guy
            is everything they say he is.

WEINSTOCK taking SAL apart with his eyes over the cigar.

                         WEINSTOCK
            What about you, Sal?  Are you
            everything they say you are?

Close of SAL's worried face.

INT. DAN'S LUNCH - DAY

DOYLE is standing at an island counter in a coffee-doughnuts
joint.  The COUNTERMAN is paying no attention to him but is
instead emptying coffee from a large dispenser into a pot.

                         DOYLE
            You gonna wait on me or am I gonna
            sit here all day?

                         DOYLE
                   (off camera)
            C'mere... C'mere!

Medium close shot of DOYLE and the KID, DOYLE eating and
drinking.

                         DOYLE
            Can you stand a toss, Hector?

                         KID
            What you mean?

                         DOYLE
            You still dealin' shit?

                         KID
            Jesus, no, Doyle.  I'm clean.  I'm
            working twelve hours a day here.

Close shot of DOYLE talking around a mouthful of doughnut.

                         DOYLE
            When they going to make you chairman
            of the board?

Medium close shot of DOYLE and the KID.  DOYLE puts down the
coffee cup.  Waves the KID closer.  The KID moves closer,
DOYLE frisks him quickly, expertly, then rips up the kid's
jacket and takes a 12-inch toadsticker out of the kid's
waistband.

Close shot of DOYLE looking at the knife, snapping the
button and watching the blade flash out.

                         DOYLE
            You clean your fingernails with this.

Close shot of KID.

                         KID
            Rather be caught with it than
            without it.

                                                           65.


DOYLE, pushing button and letting the blade fall into closed
position.

                         DOYLE
            Yeah, I guess so.

DOYLE hands the knife back to the kid.  HECTOR goes back to
work.  DOYLE eats.

EXT. DAN'S LUNCH - DAY

DOYLE climbing back into his car, knees on the seat, reaching
over into the back.

Close shot over the rear seat of DOYLE picking up the straw
hat, which has been jammed into the corner by the contours
of the Hooker's tail.  He straightens it as much as possible
and throws it under the driver's seat.

EXT. MADISON AVENUE - DAY

Medium shot of DOYLE on foot popeyeing up Madison Avenue in
the vicinity of the Westbury.  As unobtrusively as possible,
he's looking for the tail that should be there covering
CHARNIER.  DOYLE is on the East side of the street, and the
Westbury is on the West.  He pokes his head into a couple of
doorways, checks the cars parked at the curb, looks up to a
couple of the mezzanine shops along the street.  He sees
PHIL KLEIN and ANOTHER AGENT talking together totally
oblivious to the front entrance.  MULDERIG in a cigar store
looks to his wristwatch, then goes inside the store.

Close shot of DOYLE frowning, puzzled.  There doesn't seem
to be anybody alert.  He looks over to the hotel.

Westbury Hotel entrance from DOYLE's Point of View.  CHARNIER
steps out of hotel entrance, turns south.  The two AGENTS
and MULDERIG have not seen his exit.

Close on DOYLE in a doorway.

CHARNIER, carrying an umbrella, strolling blithely down the
street, in DOYLE's direction but on the opposite side of the
street.  Zoom in on his face, reflecting no concern, no
problems, then zoom back to DOYLE's position.  Pan to the
hotel entrance as DOYLE looks for somebody else.  Where the
hell is CHARNIER's surveillance?

Very quickly, DOYLE's nervous glances.

CHARNIER close.

A long view of the street.

                                                           66.


CHARNIER moving along.

The hotel entrance.

Close shot of DOYLE going through the glancing movements,
his eyes showing CHARNIER getting farther and farther down
Madison Avenue.  But there's still nobody following him.

Medium close shot of DOYLE scrambling out of the doorway and
moving down the street after CHARNIER.

Rear view of CHARNIER stopping at a newsstand, buying a copy
of the Times.

DOYLE in a doorway, peering out and down the street.

Medium close front view of CHARNIER strolling along, glancing
at the headlines of the Times, an umbrella hooked over his
left forearm as he walks.

Close shot of CHARNIER's polished shoes, moving quickly down
subway entrance stairs.  Hold on the empty stairs.  Then
DOYLE's painful, scuffed shoes, follow.

EXT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - DAY

Close shot CHARNIER standing on the subway platform, looking
at the Times, glancing toward the tracks and the rumble of a
train in the distance.

Side rear view of CHARNIER close in the foreground, DOYLE
moving into view in the background, not looking toward
CHARNIER, keeping his face turned mostly away from the
Frenchman.

Long shot of the platform.  DOYLE right, CHARNIER left as
the train pulls in.  CHARNIER is folding up his paper to
board.  DOYLE is moving toward the train.

INT. TRAIN

CHARNIER getting on train toward camera.

                                                           67.


Medium shot of DOYLE moving quickly to phone booth against
the wall.

DOYLE close, barking into the phone.

                         DOYLE
            I'm sittin' on Frog One.

MULDERIG in phone booth at Westbury.

                         MULDERIG
            Yeah, we got the Westbury covered
            like a tent.

DOYLE

                         DOYLE
            The Westbury?  Balls.  I got him
            down at the subway at Times Square.
            What the hell's goin' on?  I make
            him coming right out of the hotel
            free as a bird.  Not a soul awake.

Close shot of CHARNIER strolling past the telephone booth,
DOYLE looking down.

                         DOYLE
            I don't care how many bartenders
            are sick.  I don't work in that
            joint.  What the hell kind of a
            union are you running down there?

Long view of CHARNIER and DOYLE about thirty feet apart on
the platform, a second train approaching.

INT. SUBWAY TRAIN

A close view of DOYLE just inside the doors of the car
sneaking a peek at the platform.  We can see that CHARNIER
is not there.  He's on the train.  Suddenly CHARNIER
reappears on the platform.  DOYLE steps off.

EXT. SUBWAY PLATFORM

Long view from DOYLE's vantage point of CHARNIER standing
with his back to the train, looking up like a man who can't
make up his mind, then turning to his left, away from DOYLE
and getting back on the train.

INT. SUBWAY TRAIN

View from interior of DOYLE car of JIMMY DOYLE nipping back
onto car.

                                                           68.


INT. TRAIN - CHARNIER'S CAR

Close view of subway doors hissing shut and an umbrella
being raised at the last moment by an off-camera hand
(CHARNIER's).  The doors jerk open in the safety spasm.
There is a blur of the a fabric moving across the camera,
blocking the view of the doors.  It is only a moment.  When
it clears, the doors are closed again, the umbrella is gone.
But we don't know what happened and the train isn't moving.

INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - DOYLE'S CAR

Rear close view of DOYLE peeking into the forward car to see
where CHARNIER is sitting.

INT. TRAIN - CHARNIER'S CAR

Quick, shocked close view of that car, revealing that
CHARNIER isn't there among the twenty passengers dozing or
moping in their seats.  There is a blurred flash as if
DOYLE's own eyes are spinning frantically back to the
windows of his own car.

EXT. SUBWAY PLATFORM

Medium shot of DOYLE jumping out of train, CHARNIER jumping
back on - train takes off.

INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - CHARNIER'S CAR

A close view of CHARNIER's face.  He is smiling directly at
DOYLE.  He gives him a little wave.

A view from CHARNIER's position of DOYLE chasing the train,
anger and hatred and frustration storming across his face.

EXT. HENRY HUDSON PARKWAY - MOSHOLU EXIT

A long view from the bottom of the steep embankments above
Harlem River Drive in Washington Heights.  Sprayed along the
face of the cliff is a disaster -- an overturned city bus
and a car with which it apparently collided.  The scene is
lighted with flares.  Police rescue WORKERS and FIREMEN are
scrambling up and down the face of the cliff.  They are
carrying BODIES out of the bus and the car, COPS pulling
them out through the windows, leading them on stretchers.
There are shouted orders and some moans and cries from the
wreckage.  In the foreground is LT. WALTER SIMONSON, involved
in the operation, but also involved in a hassle with DOYLE,
MULDERIG and RUSSO who are standing with him.  An officer
approaches SIMONSON with a set of heroin works.

                                                           69.


                         OFFICER
                   (to SIMONSON)
            This belonged to the kid who was
            drivin' the sports car.  17 years
            old.  His girlfriend OD'd in the
            car.  We found this set of works in
            her arm.

Medium close shot of DOYLE and SIMONSON.  DOYLE couldn't
care if Rome was burning on the hill; he's only interested
in his case.

                         DOYLE
                   (to MULDERIG)
            Where the hell was the surveillance?
            "Go to bed." That's all you could
            say.  You couldn't keep track of a
            bleeding elephant in a snowbank.

SIMONSON, eyes on the hill, glancing to DOYLE with irritation.

                         SIMONSON
            Jimmy, it doesn't matter anymore.
            If there was a deal it must have
            gone down by now.  We blew it!  We
            blew our cover and we blew the
            warrants --

                         MULDERIG
            Charnier and his wife checked out
            of the Westbury.  Nicoli checked
            out of the Edison --

                         RUSSO
            This fella Nicoli's got a record in
            France, Walter.  He's wanted for
            questioning in the murder of a
            French cop.

                         DOYLE
            I say we keep sittin' on Boca.

                         MULDERIG
            That's crazy.  You lost the Frog in
            the subway and you blew our cover.
            If they haven't moved already
            they're not gonna move now.

                         DOYLE
            Walter, I can make this case if the
            Feds will get the hell out of my way.

                                                           70.


                         MULDERIG
            With pleasure -- it's all yours.
            Walter, if anything develops outta
            this charade give me a call.

Medium shot of SIMONSON, DOYLE, MULDERIG and RUSSO.  Lights
flashing around them; stretchers going by with bodies.

                         RUSSO
                   (to MULDERIG)
            My ass.  The only reason you're in
            this is because you've got a big
            expense account for buying junk and
            you like to see your picture in the
            papers.

                         DOYLE
                   (to SIMONSON)
            This is my case.  Get these guys
            off my back and let me handle it.

SIMONSON

                         SIMONSON
            For chrissake, will you come off
            that "my case" bullshit.  This has
            been a whore's dream from the start.

DOYLE, close.

                         DOYLE
            The deal hasn't gone down yet
            Walter -- I know it, I can feel it.

Close shot of MULDERIG

                         MULDERIG
            The last time you were dead certain
            we ended up with a dead cop.

A fist, DOYLE's, comes from off-camera and connects with
MULDERIG's chin.  As his head flies back.

DOYLE and MULDERIG slugging and grappling with each other,
RUSSO leaping in to yank them apart.  SIMONSON grabbing
MULDERIG's arm and holding him back.

SIMONSON, close.

                         SIMONSON
                   (roaring)
            That's enough.  Get the hell out of
            here.

                                                           71.

                   (on way up hill,
                   turning back)
            Jimmy, you wasted two months - no
            collars are comin' in while you two
            been out jerkin' off.  Now go back
            to work, you're off Special
            Assignment.

EXT. LA GUARDIA AIRPORT - DAY

the shuttle line.

EXT. DEPT. OF COMMERCE, WASHINGTON, D.C. - DAY

CHARNIER and an UNDERSECRETARY on the steps of the building,
shaking hands.  Two other OFFICIALS are on hand and while we
don't hear their conversation, their manner is extremely
attentive to CHARNIER.

                         CHARNIER
            It has been highly informative and
            a personal pleasure to see you again.

                         UNDERSECRETARY
            I only hope we cut through to some
            meaningful proposals in the next
            month or so.  The pleasure was
            mine, Mr. Charnier.  When will we
            see you again?

                         CHARNIER
            Soon, probably in the Spring.

                                                           72.


Close shot of CHARNIER.

                         CHARNIER
            Goodbye.

                         UNDERSECRETARY
                   (off camera)
            Goodbye.  Good trip home.

EXT. WASHINGTON STREET - DAY

Medium long shot of CHARNIER walking across street,
diagonally toward the camera, removing the identification
card from his lapel.

Rear close shot of CHARNIER joining SAL BOCA on the sidewalk
and the two of them moving off together.

Close shot of SAL, somewhat nervous about trying to peddle
his problems to CHARNIER.

                         SAL
            Everything's smooth.  Beautiful.  I
            will need a few more days though,
            the boys think we oughta cool it
            for awhile -- make sure there's no
            heat.

                         CHARNIER
                   (manner outwardly pleasant)
            You must take me for an imbecile.
            Why do you think I asked you to
            meet me in Washington?  I haven't
            spent five minutes in New York City
            without the company of a gendarme.

                         SAL
            Look, I'll level with you -- I need
            a little more time -- I got to
            shift gears.

                         CHARNIER
            Are you having trouble raising the
            half million?

                         SAL
            Hell no -- my end is covered -- my
            associates just feel we ought to
            wait for a more opportune time to
            make the switch.

Stop, Cover.

                                                           73.


                         CHARNIER
            It has to be by the end of this week.

                         SAL
            Look, Mr. Charnier, you got to be
            reasonable.

                         CHARNIER
            It's your problem.

                         SAL
            It's yours too!

Full length shot of CHARNIER and BOCA, CHARNIER leaning over
to shake his hand.

                         CHARNIER
            So nice to have seen you again.

CHARNIER turns and walks off, leaving SAL looking after him
as we zoom back to a Point of View about a hundred yards
down the street.

Close of PHIL KLEIN, just watching.

INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

Close shot of MRS. CHARNIER, sitting by the window of two
seats on the shuttle, looking out and babbling at CHARNIER.
(DIALOGUE IN FRENCH).

                         MARIE
            Look, darling, they sell these at
            the Smithsonian.

She extracts a necklace and bracelet of shark's teeth from
an elegant alligator bag.

Camera moves back to take in CHARNIER looking from the Wall
Street Journal to the native craft bracelets.

                         CHARNIER
            Are you sure it is dead?

                         MARIE
            I'm going to put them on the cat.

                         CHARNIER
            That's a relief.

Close shot of CHARNIER, tenderly, lovingly.

                                                           74.


                         CHARNIER
            You did find something for yourself,
            of course.

MARIE, close.

                         MARIE
            Of course.  But I am not going to
            tell you what it is until we are
            back in Marseilles.

CHARNIER and MARIE.  He folds up the paper, smiling at her.

                         CHARNIER
            Excuse me a moment, darling.

CHARNIER's view of the plane interior, walking back toward
the rear of the cabin.  The seats are occupied by military-
business-government TYPES making the shuttle run.  Not every
seat is filled.  We come to an empty one on which someone
has deposited an attache case.  It is the seat next to
PIERRE NICOLI, whose hand reaches out to remove it and we
follow the arm to NICOLI's face.

Close shot of CHARNIER and NICOLI sitting. (DIALOGUE IN
FRENCH)

                         CHARNIER
            I'm afraid they've become a bit...
            over-cautious.  Our American friends.

                         NICOLI
            What happens to the schedule?

                         CHARNIER
            We must follow it.

                         NICOLI
            But will they?

CHARNIER shrugs.

                         CHARNIER
            I don't know.  Boca is scared.
            He's not strong enough.  He sees
            policemen in his soup.

                         NICOLI
            He is not wrong.

                         CHARNIER
            Mmmmm.  That bastard who followed

            Let me take him out.

Close of CHARNIER.

                         CHARNIER
            There'll be someone else.

                         NICOLI
            What difference does it make?
            We'll be out of the country Friday.

EXT. SIDEWALK OUTSIDE DOYLE'S APARTMENT BLDG. - DAY

A complex of buildings similar to Lefrak City.  A medium
close view of a LITTLE GIRL about to run DOYLE down with a
two-wheel bicycle.  Two shots ring out in quick succession
and tear up the concrete at a point where he would have been
walking a moment earlier.

DOYLE diving for the cover of a tree.  The rifle goes off a
third time and MOTHERS begin to scream on the benches of the
playground area.

                         DOYLE
                   (yelling)
            Everybody, down!  Get down on the
            ground!

DOYLE behind the tree, pulling his gun out of the ankle
holster.  He holds the gun ready and tries to look around.
Ping, another shot that drives him back.

Long panning view, DOYLE's view, from the ground, of all the
rooftops in the area.  A blank.  The background sound is
still screaming crying. "Call the police." "The man's got a
gun." "Help!  Help!" The view is still slow, careful under
the pressure of the panic.  There's another shot.

Long shot of rifle smoke rising from NICOLI's sniper position.

Exterior view of the concrete tunnels, DOYLE running from
them toward the building, dodging and ducking behind
playground equipment and benches as he does.  He's shouting
as he runs.

                         DOYLE
            Get down!  It's a sniper.  Get down!

Medium shot of DOYLE dashing into the lobby of his building
to a Spanish kid in the window of building.

Exterior shot of rooftop door opening slowly, DOYLE coming
through the opening, gun at the ready.

Panning shot of the rooftop, DOYLE's view, stopping for a
beat at the rifle and box of cartridges lying beside the
parapet, moving on.  The roof's empty.  DOYLE sees NICOLI
below, grabs rifle and cartridge.

DOYLE running to the parapet, looking over.

Shot of the street, traffic, elevated tracks in the distance.
Long searching look of the streets and the people.  The
view, which is DOYLE's, passes over one man in a dark suit,
stops and goes back.  Zap!  It's NICOLI walking quickly but
not in any panic toward the El.

DOYLE's face.  He runs to parapet, fires at NICOLI.  Misses.

DOYLE running across the roof and through the door.

DOYLE bursting out of the elevator at the bottom, through a
crowd of WOMEN and KIDS who scream as they did in the
playground.

Medium close view of DOYLE running as fast as he can.

                         DOYLE
            Stop that guy.  He's wanted by the
            police!

INT. TRAIN CAR - DAY

In one corner of the train is a transit policeman.  He's
observed Doyle shouting and gesturing at NICOLI who sits
nervously aware of the policeman's presence.  Long longs
between them.  Finally, the officer decides to approach
NICOLI.

NICOLI panics and runs.  The officer goes after him and
traps him against the door between cars.

INT. TOKEN BOOTH - DAY

Close shot of DOYLE with badge at token booth.

                         DOYLE

            Police!

                         DOYLE

            Police!  Emergency!

            Blind sonofabitch!

            next station!

                         MOTORMAN
            I got to stop.

                         NICOLI
            Touch the brake and I'll blow you
            in half.

                         MOTORMAN
            The signal lights are automatic.
            If I go through a red I'll be
            automatically braked.

The MOTORMAN pales, his hand goes to his left side in a
gesture of anxiety, possibly pain.

                                                           79.

the steps to the El.

EXT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - DAY

stopping.

INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - DAY

Medium close shot of CROWD on train pushing toward the
MOTORMAN's cab.  They are upset over the missed stop.  The
CONDUCTOR seems to be the most annoyed.

He's pushing hardest toward the camera to complain.

                         VOICES
            Didn't stop.
            Went right through there...
            Hey, man, that's my station...
            Where the hell's he going?
            Hey, stop the car...

Close shot of NICOLI's back, half in the MOTORMAN's cab, as
he faces the CROWD.  Now the cries turn to:

                         VOICES
            He's got a gun...
            The motorman's gone crazy...
            Oh my God!

                         NICOLI
            Get back.

                         CONDUCTOR
            Hey, you can't...

Side view of NICOLI, the MOTORMAN in the background the
CONDUCTOR leaping at NICOLI.  NICOLI burns him; one gut shot.
The car turns to pandemonium of screams.  The CONDUCTOR is
hurled back into the crowd by force of the blast.  The
MOTORMAN throws back his head in fright, and the beginning
of a coronary.

EXT/INT. DOYLE'S CAR - DAY

Close shot of DOYLE from back seat, twisting, turning the
car in a wild demonstration of pursuit driving around cars,
braking, roaring ahead.

                                                           80.


We move out through the windshield for a lurching, spinning,
twisting view of the tracks overhead, the street signs and
lights flashing by in a reeling montage of movement, the
train roaring above it all.

INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - DAY

Close side shot of NICOLI turning to cover the MOTORMAN, who
is clutching in pain, slumping toward the controls.

                   (gasping)
            I can't breathe.

NICOLI glances quickly to his left, out the window to the
next station.

Long, low view of the tracks, partially NICOLI's view.
There are red blinkers on the side of the tracks.  Red
lights up ahead.  That's the back of another train.  It has
stopped and we're hurtling toward it.

Wide shot of screaming pack of subway riders, fighting their
way back from NICOLI, succeeding only in turning themselves
into a tightly contained mob.  Now the words they cry are:

                         VOICES
            We'll crash.
            Won't somebody please help me.
            Murder
            He's a killer.
            Crash.  We'll crash!
            Stop.  Stop the train.

through the yellow signal light at the rear of the station.

EXT. CLOSE SHOT THE TRIP LOCK - DAY

As the onrushing car pulls equal to the red signal light at

NICOLI gets to his feet and forces open one of the doors.

EXT. 62ND STREET TRACKS - DAY

amazement of several onlookers.  He is dazed and disheveled,
no longer a hunter.

EXT. ENTRANCE TO THE 62ND STREET STATION - DAY

NICOLI staggers down the stairs to the street, unarmed.

DOYLE is waiting at the foot of the stairs.

NICOLI sees him, turns in desperation to run back up.

EXT. DOYLE'S CAR - NIGHT

Long view over the hood of DOYLE's car to the street.  We
can see the Lincoln.  The lights of a car appear on the left
and come down the street past the Lincoln, slowly, like a
man looking for a place to park.  We can make out, but just
barely with the help of the street lights, four people in
the car.

DOYLE in close profile, the foreground, picking up a corner
of the Lincoln in the background.  While we are looking in
silence, there is a glimmering flow in the far corner, the
beginning of approaching headlights again.  They grown
brighter and DOYLE's foreground profile turns to watch it
come.

                         DOYLE
                   (softly)
            Same car.

                         RUSSO
            Third time around.

RUSSO and MULDERIG straightening up, leaning close to window
to peer out.

Long view over the hood of DOYLE's car of the approaching
vehicle, which suddenly switches off its lights and turns on
its parking blinkers.  It comes abreast of the Lincoln and
stops.  The men get out and chase the Lincoln.

View through windshield at the four men.  DOYLE is now up
straight and at the wheel.  He's leaning forward, his hand
on the key of the car.  He glances back to MULDERIG.

                         DOYLE
                   (to car radio)
            Let's him 'em.

View of the hood.  All hell breaks loose, headlights,
including DOYLE's flash on and form a spotlight on the
Lincoln and the figures around it.  Frozen in the headlights,
confused, startled, and disbelieving are FIVE PUERTO RICANS
with a variety of auto-stripping tools in their hands: lug
wrenches, tire irons, pinch bars, monkey wrenches, etc.
DOYLE drives right up to them.  The camera leaps out of the
car with him and runs toward the men.  We hear voices
shouting.

                         VOICES
            Police!  Don't move... get you...
            hands up... you're under arrest...

                                                           85.


EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Close view of DOYLE holding his gun on one of the terrorized-
looking Puerto Ricans.  The KID's hands are rising
tentatively.  He's too scared to move.

                         DOYLE
            Up!  Up, you sonofabitch!

In the background, the scene is being duplicated by two or
three others.

Overhead view of this headlight and flashlight arena of
about 10 or 12 DETECTIVES forming small clusters, throwing
these guys up against cars, pulling their arms around behind
them and throwing cuffs on them while others rapidly frisk
them for weapons, taking away one pistol, a couple of knives.

MULDERIG and DOYLE looking at their MAN up against the
Lincoln as RUSSO finishes snapping handcuffs on him.

                         DOYLE
            Of all the goddam cars they had to
            pick to steal hubcaps.

Close shot of the front end of the Lincoln, upended on a
hoist attached to a police tow truck.  The area is less
brightly lighted by headlights now.  Some cars have departed
with the Puerto Rican AUTO STRIPPERS.  DOYLE's interest
focuses on the car.  We pick him up as we pan to him sitting
on the running board of the tow truck, talking with its
DRIVER, who is making a report on a clipboard.  MULDERIG and
RUSSO are standing nearby, talking to TWO PLAINCLOTHESMEN.

                         DOYLE
                   (looking up and around)
            A bunch of lousy little spic car
            thieves.

                         MULDERIG
            Nothing in there except a New York
            street map.

                         DOYLE
            Tumble it.  One end to the other.

RUSSO jotting in his note pad, then glancing up to the off-
camera DOYLE.

DOYLE, medium close, hands jamming into his pockets, staring
at the ground with RUSSO and MULDERIG.

INT. POLICE GARAGE - DAY

A montage as the Lincoln is being disassembled.  First it is
weighed.  We then see the MECHANIC drain the gas, pull apart
the transmission and check through the brake drums, rip out
the seats.

MECHANIC ducking out from under the car, moving toward off-
camera DOYLE.

                         MECHANIC
            Nobody's been under there with
            anything but a grease gun since if
            came off the line.

DOYLE's hand reaches out from off-camera and takes a
cigarette package out of the MECHANIC's pocket.

                         DOYLE
            I don't buy it.  The stuff is on
            this car.

                         MECHANIC
            Then you find it.  I can't.

            The car was lost sometime this
            evening.  First they send us to
            Pier One -- then they send us
            here --

                         DESK SERGEANT
            I don't understand why you had it
            parked on the waterfront.  You're
            staying at the Doral and you lose
            your car somewhere out by the
            Brooklyn Bridge.

                         LA VALLE
            In point of fact, M. Devereaux is

            French Television.  He left the car
            to look at some point of interest.

                         DEVEREAUX
                   (moving, excitable)
            We were told by the Police
            Commissioner's office that the car
            was brought to this garage.  I

                         DESK SERGEANT
            If you'll be patient, Mr. Devereaux.

                         DEVEREAUX
                   (moving)
            I have been patient enough.  There
            is no reason I should have to waste
            time with this red tape.

                         LA VALLE
            Mr. Devereaux is an extremely
            important guest of this country.
            He is working with the absolute
            cooperation and participation of
            your government.  Here are his
            credentials from the French
            Consulate.
                   (showing them)
            Unless you wish to see this episode
            portrayed in his film I suggest you
            locate his car immediately.

Police MECHANIC in background.

                         MECHANIC
            What are you looking for?  Is it as
            big as an orange or an elephant's
            ass?  I've been over every inch --
            top to bottom.  If you could give
            me a club -- to the size...

                         RUSSO
                   (doing rough figures
                   on a piece of scratch paper)
            What was the weight of the car when
            you got it, Irv?

                         MECHANIC
                   (consulting his notes)
            4,839 pounds.

                         RUSSO
                   (consulting Lincoln
                   Specification Book)
            You're sure?
                   (he does quick addition)
            The manufacturer's spec says it
            should weigh 4,719 pounds.  This
            one's carrying roughly 120 extra
            pounds somewhere.

He produces a copy of a ship's manifold.

                                                           88.


                         RUSSO
            When it was booked in at Marseilles
            it weighed the same.  120 pounds
            overweight.  Jimmy has to be right.

The THREE MEN turn again to stare at the Lincoln.  The
MECHANIC lowers the hoist, thoughtfully.

                         MECHANIC
            I ripped everything out except the
            Rocker panels.

                         DEVEREAUX
            What's that?

They look at each other for a long moment.

MECHANIC starts to undo the side Rocker pans.  JIMMY pulls
the pan off and sticks his arm into the enclosure.  Feeling
around inside he pulls out the first kilo-sized plastic
container as several others start tumbling out after.  BUDDY
and DOYLE are smiling at each other as they continue to pull
the bags out.  Several of the other MECHANICS in the garage
are gathered around the happy moment.  They repeat this
action on the other side of the car.

RUSSO enters garage sergeant's bullpen.  DEVEREAUX and LA
VALLE are still arguing with the SERGEANT.

                         RUSSO
            Got it for you, Randy -- it just
            came in from downtown.  Who's
            Devereaux?

                         LA VALLE
            This is M. Devereaux.

                         RUSSO
            I'm sorry, Mr. Devereaux, but we
            get reports on a couple hundred
            vehicles a night.  Sometimes it's a
            little tough to keep track.

                         DEVEREAUX
            You mean the car's here now?

                         RUSSO
            Yeah -- fine -- it's okay -- not
            even a scratch.  You're all set.
                   (handing DEVEREAUX keys)


RUSSO walking with DEVEREAUX and LA VALLE.

                                                           89.


                         RUSSO
            Someone stole it right off the
            street, huh?  You're gonna have to
            pay the tow away charge.

                         DEVEREAUX
            I was told these things happen in
            New York -- but one never expects it.

                         RUSSO
            Yeah.  Well, it's in perfect shape.
            You must lead a charming life.

            Henri...

Medium close shot of DEVEREAUX turning to face CHARNIER, who
has been waiting for him.

                         CHARNIER
            Did you pick up the car?

                         DEVEREAUX
            It is waiting for you in the garage.

                         CHARNIER
            Did they follow you?

                         DEVEREAUX
            I wasn't looking.

                         CHARNIER
            Henri... I need one more favor from
            you.  I know I am imposing...

                         DEVEREAUX
            My friend, I am not sure about what
            is going on -- but for me, I am
            finished.

                         CHARNIER
            Not quite -- you are in it whether
            you like it or not.  The police
            know you brought the car into the
            country.  This makes you an
            accomplice.

                                                           90.


                         DEVEREAUX
            An accomplice to what?!  What have
            you gotten me into, Alain?  You
            asked me to do you a favor -- and I
            did what you asked -- but you've
            taken advantage of me.  I have my
            reputation --

CHARNIER pulls DEVEREAUX further aside.

                         CHARNIER
            Calm down -- Henri!  You must trust
            me -- this is an extremely
            complicated situation to which
            there is a simple solution if you
            do exactly what I tell you.  It's
            worth more money to you.

                         DEVEREAUX
            Goodbye.

DEVEREAUX turns and walks into the crowded lobby leaving
ALAIN standing alone.

Medium close shot of the Lincoln.  The Rocker panels are
open and the junk is being unloaded.  CHARNIER is standing

suitcase, riffs the deck of bills with his fingers to make
sure it's money all the way through; puts it in a separate
stack that will go into the rocker panels of a nearby junk
car.  WEINSTOCK is standing next to the CHEMIST, with his
testing equipment.  The MECHANICS are under the Lincoln and

            I saw him -- I'm gonna get him.

EXT. THE BAR - DAY

Santa Claus (DOYLE) starts to ring his big Christmas bell,
above the singing.  The bell is a signal to DETECTIVE SECOND
GRADE BUDDY RUSSO.  At this moment RUSSO is in the clothes
of a hot dog vendor and is in fact working behind a hot dog
wagon.  At the ringing of DOYLE's bell he takes off his

and RUSSO try to get his arms and put him against the wall.
BLACK PUSHER writhes loose and we close in on a knife in his
hand, plunging rapidly into RUSSO'S left forearm.

                         RUSSO
            Son of a bitch!

The words are both warning and a grunt of pain.  As RUSSO
takes the blade and utters the words, we simultaneously go
to DOYLE crouching and snatching his .38 out of the right
ankle holster.

EXT. BED-STUY TENEMENT ALLEY - DAY

Close shot of DOYLE and the BLACK PUSHER, DOYLE pistol-

3-shot of BLACK PUSHER sitting between DOYLE and RUSSO.
DOYLE is at the wheel.  BLACK PUSHER is sitting on his
hands, wrists manacled behind him, his head down and dripping
blood onto the jacket and the canary-yellow turtleneck.  All
three are breathing hard.

                         DOYLE
            What's your name, asshole?

                         BLACK PUSHER
            Fuck you, Santa Claus!

DOYLE hits him across the face.

                         RUSSO
            Your name is Willie Craven.

BLACK PUSHER doesn't look up.

                         DOYLE
            Who's your connection, Willie?
            What's his name?

No response.

                         RUSSO
            Who killed the old Jew in the
            laundromat?

BLACK PUSHER's brow furrows, looks up just a little.

                         BLACK PUSHER
            I don't...

                         DOYLE
            Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?

                         BLACK PUSHER
            What?

                         DOYLE
            Did you ever pick your feet in
            Poughkeepsie?

                         BLACK PUSHER
            I don't know what you're talkin'
            about.

                         DOYLE
            Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?

                         BLACK PUSHER
            No... yeah...

                         DOYLE
            Did you ever sit on the edge of the
            bed, take off your socks and stick
            your fingers between your toes?

                         BLACK PUSHER
            Man, I'm clean.

                         DOYLE
            You made three sales to your
            roaches back there.  We had to
            chase you through all this shit and
            you tell me you're clean?

                                                            5.


                         RUSSO
            Who stuck up the laundromat?

                         DOYLE
            How about that time you were
            picking your feet in Poughkeepsie?

The BLACK PUSHER'S eyes go to RUSSO in panic, looking for
relief from the pressure of the inquisition.

                         RUSSO
                   (in pain)
            You better give me the guy who got
            the old Jew or you better give me
            something or you're just a memory
            in this town.

                         BLACK PUSHER
            That's a lot o' shit.  I didn't do
            nothin'.

The BLACK PUSHER's eyes are on DOYLE, frozen in confusion
and fear.

                         DOYLE
            You put a shiv in my partner.  Know
            what that means?  All winter I
            gotta listen to him gripe about his
            bowling scores.  Now I'm gonna bust
            your ass for those three bags -
            then I'm gonna nail you for pickin'
            your feet in Poughkeepsie.

EXT. HEADQUARTERS NARCOTICS BUREAU OF THE NYPD 12 OLD SLIP
AND SOUTH STREETS - NIGHT

DOYLE and RUSSO standing side by side on the front steps of
the old First Precinct on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.
RUSSO has his overcoat over his shoulders as a cape.  The
sleeve of his left arm is rolled up over a blood-stained
bandage on the left forearm.

                         DOYLE
            Havin' trouble?  You're a dumb
            guinea.

                         RUSSO
            How'd I know he had a knife.

                         DOYLE
            Never trust a nigger.

                         RUSSO
            He coulda been white.

                                                            6.


                         DOYLE
            Never trust anybody.  You goin' sick?

                         RUSSO
            Not a chance.

RUSSO nods in acceptance of the remark.  The easy, synical
rapport between them is obvious: they are partners in a
business where somebody is always getting hurt and pain is
part of the inventory.

                         DOYLE
            Let's popeye around the Chez for a
            half hour, catch the end of the
            show and a couple drinks.

                         RUSSO
            Some other time Jimmy, I'm beat.

DOYLE reaches into the right side pocket of BUDDY's suitcoat
for a cigarette and matches.  He lights up two in the pause,
sticks one in RUSSO's mouth.

                         DOYLE
            Come on -- one drink.  Whatta you
            say?

                         RUSSO
            Drink this.

                         DOYLE
            Whip it out.

INT. THE CLUB - NIGHT

THE TITLES COMMENCE

                    THE FRENCH CONNECTION

Titles over a close shot of a chorus line, with lots of tits
and ass and lean, long legs in a brassy blare of music.  We
zoom back to the area where DOYLE and RUSSO are beginning to
occupy a table.  RUSSO takes the seat on the right, eyes
immediately on all that ginch, while DOYLE standing, gives
their order.  We do not hear the dialogue but DOYLE asks
RUSSO what he wants BUDDY looks up and says "Cinzano." DOYLE
turns and says "Two of these." DOYLE slips into the chair
opposite RUSSO and the titles roll on.  Unlike RUSSO who is
concentrating on the girls, DOYLE is digging the room and
the people who occupy the tables in it, as if he is the sort
of man who cannot relax until he knows who is around him,
why they are there.

                                                            7.


INT. THE CLUB - NIGHT

A long view from DOYLE's position of the room, a quick
certain survey that stumbles twice; on laughter that seems
too raw and then over a flurry of activity by WAITERS and
CAPTAINS serving a table on the main floor.  DOYLE's
attention is apprehended by the noise and activity that
emanate from the same large table.

                         DOYLE
            I make at least two junk connections
            at that table in the corner.  The
            guy is the stripe combo, I know him
            too.

                         RUSSO
            Hey, I thought we come for a drink.

INT. THE CLUB - NIGHT

A long view of the table with DOYLE and RUSSO very close
foreground, left and right.  DOYLE is leaning on an elbow.

                         DOYLE
            Who is that guy?

                         RUSSO
            Policy man in Queens.

                         DOYLE
            What about the last of the big-time
            spenders.  You make him?

RUSSO's eyes come off the show.  It is a direct line from
DOYLE's gaze to the round, ruddy and arrogant face of SAL
BOCA, the apparent host of the table of EIGHT MEN AND WOMEN,
the Men in dinner jackets with ties tucked under the collars
of blue or white lace-trimmed shirts, the Women in a mixture
of pant suits and Catskills cocktail party dresses, their
hair coiffed towers.

                         RUSSO
            No, you?

                         DOYLE
            Hunh-uh.  Check the bread.  He
            spreads it like the Russians are in
            Jersey.

                         RUSSO
            He probably sells insurance.  Owns
            a chicken farm in Hackensack.

                                                            8.


Zoom in slowly on SAL as he deals tips and orders.  Through
DOYLE's eyes, we go from Guest to Guest at SAL's table,
taking apart their manners and styles as they talk and
laugh, lost in the show chatter.

INT. THE CLUB - NIGHT

DOYLE finishing his drink, still looking at the table.

                         DOYLE
            Dig who's just come over.  The
            creep on the end.

INT. THE CLUB - NIGHT

The camera pans down the table to dig the "creep on the end."

                         RUSSO (VO)
            Jewish Lucky from the Bronx... He
            don't look the same without a
            number across his chest.

INT. THE CLUB - NIGHT

DOYLE close in right profile, SAL's table in the far blurred
background.

                         DOYLE
            Whatta you say we wait and give him
            a tail?

                         RUSSO
            Give who a tail?

                         DOYLE
            The greaser with the blonde.

                         RUSSO
            What for -- you wanna play Hide the
            Salami with his old lady?

                         DOYLE
            Come on -- just for fun --

INT/EXT. DOYLE'S CAR - NIGHT

The view from the back seat of DOYLE's car.  DOYLE is at the
wheel, RUSSO packed uncomfortably into the corner at DOYLE's
right.  Seventy-five yards away on the other side of the
street the canopied entrance of the Club.  A Continental is
parked in front of the club.  The DRIVER leaning on a fender
talking with the DOORMAN.  DOYLE frisks his own pockets for
a cigarette, coming up with a collection of laundry slips,
crumpled notes, toothpicks and matches.

                                                            9.


One of the slips of paper catches his eye as he is going
through the ritual of the cigarette mooch, a slip bearing
the name of a girl.  His attention is really on the entrance
of the Club and both his conversation and the cigarette
business are detached and incidental to the art of waiting
through the stakeout.  He stuffs the cards back into his
pocket.

                         DOYLE
            Monica?  Who's Monica?

                         RUSSO
                   (handing him a cigarette)
            A and A, that's all you're
            interested in -- Arrests and Ass.

As soon as DOYLE has finished lighting the cigarette SAL and
his PARTY come bubbling out of the Club noisily, a little
drunkenly.  SAL waves to the attentive DOORMAN.

DOYLE close, leaning forward over the wheel to put his hand
on the ignition key.  He does not turn it.  He is waiting
for the cover of noise from the starting of SAL's car.
RUSSO is turning the opposite corner of the car into a bend,
his head back, arms across his chest.

                         DOYLE
            Cloudy, I'll lay odds he takes us
            to Little Italy.

DOYLE reaches under his seat for the straw surveillance
hat - throws it up to read ledge of car.

                         RUSSO
            I'm telling you, Popeye, he owns a
            bagel mine in the Bronx.

A long view of the Club entrance.  SAL and ANGIE, a well-
built "classy" blonde with good legs, get into their black
Mercury sedan.  The Mercury takes off towards First Avenue.
We hear DOYLE's car start and we move off after them on the
last blink of tail-lights at the corner.

EXT. BROADWAY - NIGHT

Cabs, Daily News and Times delivery trucks, bakery vans and
a few cruising cabs, one or two passenger cars and a coasting
green and black police cruiser -- this is the 4:30 a.m.
traffic through which DOYLE moves.

A rear-window view of SAL and ANGIE BOCA, in animated
conversation.  His head is turned toward her, his hand
raised in a gesture.  ANGIE is sitting in a corner with her
back to the door, in profile to the back window.

                                                           10.


Her blonde head bobbles with laughter over some remark SAL
has made.

A long overhead view of the two cars wheeling in and out of
the sparse traffic.

Close shot of the license plate on BOCA's car.

Close shot DOYLE staring at license plate, memorizing it.

EXT. RATNER'S - DAY

BOCA and ANGIE exit restaurant, get into their car and drive
off.  Hold for DOYLE's car as it passes through after them.

EXT. MULBERRY STREET - DAY

Side close view of SAL turning south into Mott Street
panning to pick up the Italian names on the candy stores,
funeral parlors, bars, grocery stores, social clubs.

A long view of SAL's car from the DOYLE-RUSSO auto, over the
shoulders of the two cops.  DOYLE is leaning on the wheel of
his car.  He's against the curb about 100 yards behind SAL.

Medium close view of SAL in the middle of Mott Street,
walking quickly toward the opposite side of the street,
hands in the pocket of his white raincoat.  He glances over
his shoulder in the direction of DOYLE's car.

Close of RUSSO who has come awake.  The smart-ass demeanor
has dropped away.  DOYLE turns to him and smiles.  This
district is the heart of every illegal activity in New York.

Close rear view of DOYLE and RUSSO ducking down to the level
of the dashboard, a reflex action.  He couldn't see them at
that distance, although SAL, lighted by his own headlights,
can be seen in the background walking around the cars,
across the sidewalk and stopped at a recessed doorway.

Medium close shot of SAL and partially visible FIGURE at the
doorway.  With another glance up the street, SAL takes
something out of his raincoat pocket and steps up and into
the doorway.

INT. DOYLE'S CAR - DAY

Close from the front of DOYLE and RUSSO low against the
dashboard.

                         DOYLE
            It's a drop!

DOYLE's face, close, light smile.

                                                           11.


Long view of SAL walking down the sidewalk quickly for about
a quarter of a block while the headlights of his car, with
ANGIE apparently driving, move up with him.  At another
doorway, he looks back and then steps inside.

EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY

Long view of SAL's Mercury moving over Brooklyn Bridge.

Close shot of the DOYLE-RUSSO car from RUSSO's side.  BUDDY
now interested, watching.

EXT. BROOKLYN - DAY

Overhead view of cars circling block, first Mercury turning
corner, then DOYLE's Ford.

Long shot of the Mercury pulling up beside line of parked
cars (as seen from DOYLE-RUSSO car) stopping and parking.
Hold on Mercury as SAL and ANGIE get out of it.  SAL locking
it up, and starting to walk toward a line of parked cars.

Close shot from rear seat of DOYLE and RUSSO glancing at
each other.

SAL and ANGIE stop in the street beside beat-up white Dodge.
Without a word they get in.  Hold as they get in, SAL starts
and they begin to drive out of the spot.

Close on DOYLE.

                         DOYLE
            It's startin' to cook, Cloudy, my
            man is cookin'...

A series of impressionist traveling shots of the white Dodge
and DOYLE's Ford moving through Brooklyn Streets, picking up
street signs of areas.

Medium close shot of the white Dodge pulling into the curb.
In near background, a candy-confectionery store.

INT. DOYLE'S CAR - DAY

Close shot of DOYLE and RUSSO in profile driving past the
candy store as SAL and ANGIE open door and go in.

Close shot of DOYLE and RUSSO parked.  DOYLE is looking in
the rear-view mirror while BUDDY is turned around on the
seat, looking out the rear window.

A long shot, from the DOYLE-RUSSO viewpoint of the candy
store.  The door is open, the street is deserted.  Lights
are going on in the little shop.

                                                           12.


Hold on the storefront as SAL appears, this time in a candy
store operator's smock over a white undershirt, baggy slacks.
He's carrying a stack of newspapers.  Zoom in on SAL stacking
the Sunday Times and the Daily News on the rack in front of
the store as ANGIE appears in the doorway.  She's blackhaired
now, the blonde wig gone, also wearing a grey cotton smock
over a plain skirt and sweater, holding a cup of coffee.  We
hold on them for a beat, then

                                            CUT TO:

DOYLE and RUSSO close just looking at each other.  The look
says everything about the freak case they have stumbled into.

EXT. QUAY MARSEILLE SHIPYARD

                         MARCEL
            Le Syndicat exigera un minimum de 12.

                         CHARNIER
            Quelle importance.  Ce qui compte
            pour moi c'est d'avoir un chantier

            le prendre avec nous.

                         CHARNIER
            Une erreur!  C'est génial.  C'est
            une vedette à la télévision.  Il
            peut aller partout sans être
            soupçonné... En plus il a besoin de
            fric.

                         NICOLI
            J'ai pas confiance en lui.

SURVEILLANCE MONTAGE OF SAL BOCA's activities.  From time to
time DOYLE and RUSSO are visible, but their dialogue is for
the most part VOICE OVER.

INT/EXT. BROOKLYN CANDY STORE - DAY

Various shots of SAL and ANGIE.  Several shots of DOYLE and
RUSSO in the CANDY STORE: reading magazines, having lunch
separately.  They are also seen in the LEATHER FACTORY

            Our friend's name is SALVATORE BOCA.
            They call him SAL.  He's a
            sweetheart.  He once was picked up
            on suspicion of armed robbery.
            Tried to hold up Tiffany's on Fifth
            Avenue!  In broad daylight!  Could
            have got two-and-a-half to five,
            but they wouldn't prosecute.  Also
            downtown they're sure he pulled off
            a contract on a guy named DeMarco.

RUSSO is at counter eating lunch with three others... ANGIE
serving.  She wears a sleeveless sweater; shows lots of tit.
RUSSO digs... she digs him.  A wise guy comes in, goes to
the back room.  SAL follows.

DOYLE and RUSSO in parked car.

                                                           20.


                         DOYLE
            I think we oughta burn him on
            suspicion.

                         RUSSO
            Suspicion of what?

                         DOYLE
            Makin' wine in the basement.
                   (pause)
            He looks like that wop stooge used
            to drive for the Fracisi brothers.

LOU joins them.  He and SAL leave together after each kisses
and embraces the old man.

                         RUSSO
            Lay off with that wop stuff, will
            you?

EXT. WEINSTOCK'S APT. BUILDING - DAY

In the East 80's.  SAL exits.

                         DOYLE
            That's the third time he come here
            this week.  You got anything on the
            building?

DOYLE and RUSSO in parked car.

                         RUSSO
            The building's clean.  I checked
            the tenant list -- Don Ameche, the
            actor lives there -- oh, and
            somebody else.  Do the name Joel
            Weinstock ring a bell?

TIME LAPSE

Late day.  WEINSTOCK leaving building, nodding to doorman.

                         DOYLE
            You're kiddin'

DOYLE and RUSSO in parked car.

                         RUSSO
            No sir -- this is where Joel lives.

                         DOYLE
            He was the bank on that shipment
            outta Mexico three years ago.

                                                           21.

            wife out for a change.

DOYLE and RUSSO in parked car.

INT. LEATHER FACTORY - DAY

Across street from Candy Store.  DOYLE and RUSSO at the
printing machine.

                         DOYLE
                   (at leather printing machine)
            Got a job for me when this is over,
            Mrs. Levene?

They have a view of the Candy Store across street.  Various
people go in and out.  Next to DOYLE, at a stamping machine,
is MRS. LEVENE, the factory owner.

                         MRS. LEVENE
            What are you fellows looking for?
            What do you want from that nice
            candy store?

                         DOYLE
            We have reason to believe it's a
            front for the biggest counterfeiting
            operation in the country.

                         MRS. LEVENE
            What?

                         DOYLE
            That's right.  They're trying to
            steal the formula for Hershey
            bars --

DOYLE continues his work at the print-out machine, while
observing the candy store.

We see SAL leaving the store.  He crosses to his car, near
the RUSSO car.  As he passes it, he sees RUSSO locked in
embrace with a lady in a babushka.  As SAL drives off, we
get a closer look at the "LADY" in the babushka: DETECTIVE
JAMES DOYLE.

                                                           22.


INT. RUSSO'S CAR ON TRIBORO BRIDGE CROSSING TO WARD'S ISLAND

                         DOYLE
            What the hell am I drivin' for?
            I'm a first grade Detective.
            You're a second grade guinea.

                         RUSSO
            I'm wounded.  Oh, oh.

SAL up ahead in the Mercury.

                         DOYLE
                   (at the wheel)
            What?

EXT. WARD'S ISLAND - BRIDGE

The Mercury crossing the bridge to the Island.

                         RUSSO
            He's goin' to Ward's Island.  We'll
            get spotted.  What the hell's he
            goin' there?

DOYLE-RUSSO car B.G.

                         DOYLE
            Maybe he's goin' to see his brother.

                         DOYLE
            Or could be another drop.  I guess
            he gets a free ride.

EXT. BROOKLYN STREET - DAY

A Brooklyn slum street on a morning in November.  It is
about 11 o'clock and relatively quiet.  A scattering of
tenement URCHINS give the street some sound and life.  There
are a couple of dark shops on the street and a bar, all
appearing to be closed.  We look down the street and pick up
DOYLE and RUSSO coming down it, walking very quickly.  They
are heading toward the bar.  A young man is coming out -
they grab him and throw him back.

INT. BAR ROOM - DAY

The Young Man is thrown in, followed by DOYLE and RUSSO.
There are about 20 or 30 PUETRO RICAN and BLACK MEN in the
joint, a couple of BLACK WOMEN.  They are in all manner of
dress.  Half of them are wearing shades.  The bar is noisy
with conversation, laughter and music.

                                                           23.


DOYLE and RUSSO standing in the doorway, DOYLE slightly to
the left, RUSSO a little behind him.  DOYLE's arms are at
his sides.  RUSSO's right hand is crossed over his belt,
under his jacket and on the butt of his .38, ready, waiting
to back his partner's play or respond to any move within the
bar.

DOYLE moving into the bar alone.  He pulls the plug out of
the Juke Box, plunging the room to silence.

                         DOYLE
            Hands on your heads.  Popeye's here!

Twenty men raise hands to their heads as one.  The raggle-
taggle swarm plays a kind of human chicken, refusing to move
until the last moment then stepping out of his way.  One of
the customers doesn't.

                         DOYLE
            What's my name?

                         1ST MAN
            Doyle.

                         DOYLE
            What?

                         1ST MAN
            Mr. Doyle.

                         DOYLE
            Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?

                         1ST MAN
            What?

DOYLE raises his left arm and pushes the MAN aside.  The
MAN's eyes go to RUSSO, off-camera at the door, and back to
DOYLE.  He doesn't resist; he gets in line with the rest of
them, a line formed about four or five feet from the bar,
running the length of it.

Close of DOYLE at the bar, holding an ashcan and skimming
the metal underrailing with one finger, knocking off the
magnetized key boxes into the ashcan.  He isn't even looking
at them.  His eyes are across the bar, staring down the
customers.

Close shot of the ashcan and the little metal boxes clinking
into it.

Close shot of DOYLE, the ashcan now on the bar, opening one
of the boxes, taking out the ten dollar bill, putting it on
the bar.

                                                           24.


Then, opening another, taking out the glassine deck of
heroin.  Then another, containing a glassine deck.  He
empties the glassine envelopes on the bar into a cocktail
mixer which he proceeds to shake.  The shaker is half-filled
with tomato juice.

DOYLE leaning over the bar toward the glaring crowd, pours
the mixture into the ashcan.

                         DOYLE
            Milk shake anyone?

He wiggles his finger.  It is a command for THREE MEN to
step forward.  The MEN do not move at first.

                         DOYLE
            Move ass when I tell you.

They move, shuffling, hesitatingly.  But they move -- TWO
BLACKS and A PUETRO RICAN.

                         DOYLE
            Put it on the bar.

Hands of the THREE MEN going into pockets.

Close of a miscellany of keys, coins, cigarettes going onto
the bar -- with two hypodermics, six or eight marijuana
cigarettes, a small plastic vial of barbiturates.

                         DOYLE
                   (collecting the works)
            All right, you three clowns step
            into those phone booths, you're
            goin' in.  Go on.  Stand in there
            till I'm ready for you.

The three men turn and enter the individual phone booths.
They stand, waiting, like contestants in the $64 Question.

                         DOYLE
            Everybody goes when the whistle
            blows.

RUSSO is with another man from whom he's just taken a set of
works.

                         RUSSO
            What's your story?

                         DANCER
            Gimme a break, Mr. Russo.  I'm in
            show business.

                                                           25.


                         RUSSO
            You're in show business.

                         DANCER
            S'right.

                         DOYLE
            What do you do in show business?

                         DANCER
            I'm a dancer.

                         RUSSO
            All right, get up on that bar and
            dance.

                         DANCER
            What?

                         RUSSO
            Get up on the bar and show me how
            you work.  If I like it you don't
            have to go in.

                         DANCER
            You're for real?

                         JERRY LEON
            Hey man, why don't you let the
            fella alone.

                         RUSSO
                   (a shout)
            Am I talkin' to you -

                         JERRY LEON
            No, but I'm talkin' to you.

                         RUSSO
            I'm tellin' you to shut up and
            stand over there.

                         RUSSO
                   (to Dancer)
            Get up there.

The man climbs up on the bar.

                         DANCER
            I got no music!

                         RUSSO
            Fake it.

                                                           26.


The man goes into a fast tap dance.  But he only gets in a
few steps --

                         DOYLE
            All right, that's enough, you're
            under arrest.

RUSSO pulls the man off the bar, sends him into one of the
phone booths.

DOYLE coming down the front of the bar.  He stops before
another man, who has just come out of the toilet.

                         DOYLE
            What about you?  Can you stand a
            toss?

                         2ND MAN
            I'm clean.

                         DOYLE
            You don't use shit?

                         2ND MAN
            No.
                   (he goes for his wallet)


                         DOYLE
            Did I say you could move that
            hand -- I'm not gonna get stuck am I?

                         2ND MAN
            No - no.

                         DOYLE
            Cause if I do.

DOYLE frisks the man.  Comes up with vial of pills and two
roaches.

                         DOYLE
            Wise guy, huh?  Let's see what else
            you got.
                   (to RUSSO)
            - Buddy!

He collars the man and shoves him towards the toilet.

RUSSO, eyes moving everywhere, hand on the gun.

                                                           27.


                         RUSSO
            If I see any shit on the floor,
            it's yours, so keep your eye on
            your neighbor.

Inside the toilet of the bar.  The MAN is up against the
wall.  DOYLE is only inches away.

The MAN is an AGENT and this is the only way DOYLE can get
immediate information from him without destroying the man's
cover.  Their conversation is in whispers.  And very fast.

                         DOYLE
            How's everything?

                         2ND MAN
            Everything is everything.

                         DOYLE
            How come there's nothing out there?
            That stuff is all milk.

                         2ND MAN
            There's nothing around.  Nobody's
            holding.

                         DOYLE
            I got a name - Sal Boca, Brooklyn.

                         2ND MAN
            Boca?

                         DOYLE
            B.O.C.A.

                         2ND MAN
            Doesn't register.

                         DOYLE
            Got a wife named Angie.

                         2ND MAN
            No, nothing.  There's only some talk.

                         DOYLE
            What?

                         2ND MAN
            Coming in this week, week after.
            Everybody going to get well.

                         DOYLE
            Who brings it?

                                                           28.


                         2ND MAN
            Who knows?

                         DOYLE
            Where do you want it?

                         2ND MAN
            This side.

Door of toilet.  There is a hell of a crash and slamming
behind it.  Door opens and DOYLE steps out over the crumpled
prostrate form of the INFORMER.  He has just decked the man
to continue the protection of the cover.  He pauses halfway
down the line as if he's speculating on beating up another
one because he didn't get any information.  But he decides
that would be futile too.

                         DOYLE
            I'm goin' check on this address in
            the Bronx, if you're bullshitting
            me, it's your ass.

                         RUSSO
            Tell everybody we'll be back in an
            hour.

                         DOYLE
                   (to all)
            We're goin' now!  Goodbye.

EXT. PASSENGER SHIP - DAY

Close shot of DEVEREAUX, New York harbor in the background,
being interviewed by television reporters on his arrival in
the U.S. abroad a passenger ship.  He is smiling, jovial,
charming.

                         REPORTER 1
            How long will you be here?

                         DEVEREAUX
            Not long enough.  Two... perhaps
            three... weeks at most.

Medium close shot of DEVEREAUX and THREE TV REPORTERS, as
they talk, a crane moves into action behind them and lifts
out of hold.  LA VALLE is with DEVEREAUX as Translator and
Interpreter.

                         GIRL TV REPORTER
            Why did you come by ship, Mr.
            Devereaux?

                                                           29.


                         DEVEREAUX
            The next several weeks will be very
            difficult and the middle of the
            ocean is the only place where the
            telephone isn't ringing all the time.

                         REPORTER
            What will be the viewpoint of your
            documentary.

                         DEVEREAUX
            To make a Frenchman feel what it is
            like to be a New Yorker.

                         LA VALLE
            That's enough now, ladies and
            gentlemen.  M. Devereaux is due at
            his hotel in half an hour.

Overhead the Lincoln comes down from the hold of the ship.

EXT. WEST SIDE DRIVE - DAY

A long view of the pier from the opposite (east) side of
West Street, beneath the steel trusses and girders of the
West Side Drive and through the forest of cars that are
parked there, the jam of traffic that develops around every
unloading vessel.  It is a view that takes in the front end
of the Lincoln inching off the pier.  HENRI DEVEREAUX at the
wheel, turns to his right.  We watch until the point of view
on the sidewalk.  ALAIN CHARNIER and PIERRE NICOLI are
standing there watching.  When the car (off-camera) turns
east on the way to the garage, NICOLI glances to CHARNIER.
CHARNIER does not look back.

EXT. DORAL HOTEL - LINCOLN PULLS IN - DAY

INT. POLICE OFFICE - NIGHT

Close shot of WALTER SIMONSON at desk in the large square
office he occupies as a Lieutenant of Detectives in charge
of the Manhattan Narcotics Bureau.  He is the immediate
superior of RUSSO and DOYLE, head of the 200-man narcotics
squad that polices Manhattan.

                         SIMONSON
                   (with coffee cup)
            All that is great -- but you guys
            work Bed-Stuy.  You're not supposed
            to be in Ridgewood.

DOYLE, RUSSO and SIMONSON

                                                           30.


                         DOYLE
            Detach us.  Let us have a shot at
            it, at least until we see if
            there's anything here or not.
            Everybody wants Weinstock, right?
            So maybe here's a lead.  We deserve
            it.

                         SIMONSON
            You couldn't burn a three-time
            loser with what you're bringing in
            here.  You know you stiffs could
            run yourselves an entrapment rap.
            The guy has done nothing -- Brooklyn
            is full of Candy Store guys with
            two cars who like to go to
            nightclubs.

                         RUSSO
            Put this little candy hustler
            together with Joel Weinstock and it
            could be we stumbled into a big
            score.

                         SIMONSON
                   (moves to window)
            Big score!  He's dealin' a few bags
            here and there on the side.

                         DOYLE
            Simonson, I wouldn't be infringing
            on your coffee break if I thought
            he was a nickel and dimer.

                         SIMONSON
            Your hunches have backfired before,
            Doyle.

DOYLE, close, no comment.

Back to SIMONSON.

                         SIMONSON
                   (moves back to stand
                   at desk)
            Jimmy, what the hell's happening
            with you lately?
                   (pause)
            You got more collars than any Narc
            in the bureau.  What was it.  Over
            100 last year?  Terrific.  But who?
                         (MORE)

                                                           31.


                         SIMONSON (CONT'D)
            You stop and shake down a bellboy
            because he's got three joints in
            his sock.  You hit a high school
            kid in short pants who looks like
            he's got a twitch.

RUSSO.  Getting it back on the track.

                         RUSSO
                   (moves in to desk)
            We got information that there's no
            shit in the street -- it's like a
            desert full of junkies with a big
            score coming in to make everybody
            well.

DOYLE

                         DOYLE
            This could be it, Walter.  This
            Candy Store guy, putting on a big
            show in a fancy nightclub with
            known connections all over him.
            Then on our own, after working the
            whole day and night, we tail him
            out to Brooklyn and sit on him for
            a week practically, and who do we
            come up with?  Joel Weinstock.
                   (he leans forward)
            You gotta let us have it.

THREE SHOT - RUSSO, DOYLE, SIMONSON

                         SIMONSON
                   (pause, he turns to RUSSO)
            You really believe all this crap?

                         RUSSO
            I go with my partner.

A pause.

                         SIMONSON
            What'll it take?

                         RUSSO
            First a wire.

                         DOYLE
            Two wires.  One on the store and
            one on his house.

                                                           32.


                         SIMONSON
            You know I have to get a court
            order for wiretaps.

                         RUSSO
            Try... okay?

                         DOYLE
            We know you can do it, Walter.

They start to leave.

Close on SIMONSON.

                         SIMONSON
            Popeye...

Close on DOYLE at the door.  RUSSO beside him.

Back to SIMONSON

                         SIMONSON
            You still pickin' your feet in
            Poughkeepsie?

           SAL (V.O.)                     RUSSO
  What's this crap.  I just          (He raps on table
  spoke to my wife and she           with a coffee cup.
  says you're raisin' me a           Doyle gets up.)
  halfa cent on the cups.        C'mere and lissen to your
                                 big connection.
           WHOLESALER                (DOYLE comes over)
           (V.O.)                He's fightin' with somebody
  Yeah, well you know I          about a halfa cent.

  long time ago.  We got a                DOYLE
  inflation period...            How we gonna keep Simonson
                                 from hearin' this?
           SAL (V.O.)
  I got your inflation.  I can            RUSSO
  get the same cups on Delancey  If he does, we'll be back in
  Street for what I been         Bed-Stuyvesant tomorrow.

           WHOLESALER
           (V.O.)
  C'mon Sal, I got my orders,
  too --

           SAL (V.O.)
  Well, if you can't do better
  than that, you can stick the
  cups.

EXT. AUTO GRAVEYARD (HUNTS POINT AND EAST RIVER) - DAY

HIGH ANGLE: Close shot of CHARNIER, MARIE and LA VALLE
walking slowly together toward the camera.  They are at the
auto graveyard and the scene of an auction of cars towed off
New York streets by the Police Department.  About twenty
other men are walking around, looking at the cars.

A POLICEMAN blows a whistle and the prospective car buyers
gather around the auction trailer in the b.g.

                         LA VALLE
            There are four auto graveyards like
            this one in the other boroughs,
            handling about a thousand vehicles
            a month.  Those that aren't claimed
            are auctioned here once a month.

                         MARIE
            Just for mistakes of parking?

                                                           34.


                         LA VALLE
            No.  Many are involved in crimes
            and confiscated... or just abandoned.
            This is, as you know, your prime
            source of scrap metal, M. Charnier.

                         MARIE
                   (off camera)
            Darling, may I have this one?

Medium close shot MARIE, standing next to an LTD.

                         MARIE
            It looks so lonesome here.

CHARNIER and LA VALLE approach her.

                         CHARNIER
            It would look even more lonesome in
            our garage.

INT. THE AUCTION TRAILER - DAY

Within the large trailer, about TWENTY MEN are seated at two
long benches to each side.  Some are standing to the rear.
At the front, an AUCTIONEER stands at a lectern.  To his
left sits a CLERK at a small table.  The AUCTIONEER wears a
sweater and hat.  The buyers are tough types, young and old.
All have inventory lists.  The atmosphere is informal.  The
CHARNIERS and LA VALLE enter the trailer at the back.

                         AUCTIONEER
            Every car sold today must be
            removed at the purchaser's own
            expense.  We have no keys or
            anything to start the vehicles with.
            You buy 'em as you see 'em and
            where you see 'em.  All right, the
            first car offered is Number 24398.
            A Plymouth sedan.  Do I hear
            fifteen dollars?

The bidding goes up to forty dollars.  A large BURLY MAN
wins the bid.  He goes up to the CLERK and accepts the bill
of sale.

                         AUCTIONEER
            We go to 24399 -- A Pontiac Station
            wagon.  Do I hear ten dollars?

                         LA VALLE
                   (aside to CHARNIER)
            Notice he will never mention the
            year of the car.

                                                           35.


                         AUCTIONEER
            I got a fifteen dollar bid going...
            Do I hear anymore...
            Eighteen... who'll say Eighteen?
            Twenty...
            Twenty-three...

EXT. WARD'S ISLAND (UNDER WEST ABUTMENT OF THE HELLGATE
BRIDGE)

Pick up CHARNIER, MARIE and MAURICE LAVALLE

As the camera plays over the bridge: (in French)

                         CHARNIER (V.O.)
            It's beautiful.

                         LA VALLE (V.O.)
            It was built in 1917 - and was one
            of the two heaviest bridges in the
            world.  The arch is still the
            largest in the world.

                         CHARNIER
            Who financed it?

                                                           37.


                         LA VALLE
            Two railroads as part of a
            connecting railway which provided
            passage from New England to the
            South.  It was actually the first
            railroad through New York City.

                         MARIE
            Why is it called Hellgate?

                         LA VALLE
            The river at this point is the most
            dangerous on the East Coast.  Years
            ago, hundreds of ships went down
            here.

                         CHARNIER
            If this bridge were in Europe, it
            would be on every tourist's sight-
            seeing list.

                         LA VALLE
            Most New Yorkers never notice it -
            most Americans have never heard of
            it.

                         CHARNIER
            Look how gracefully they conceived
            that arch.  Like a bowstring.  It
            was built from both ends.  With no
            support in the middle.  Beautiful.

                         LA VALLE
            Mmm.

                         MARIE
            Alain is the only man I know who
            can become as enthusiastic about a
            bridge as he can about a woman.

                         CHARNIER
            Not any woman, Marie.  Just one.

                         LA VALLE
            I'm afraid the rest of Ward's
            Island isn't nearly as romantic - a
            pollution plant, a hospital, a
            training school for garbage men and
            that area over there, where the old
            cars are kept, prior to being
            processed for shipment to, among
            other places, The Charnier Shipping
            Company, of Marseilles, France.

(NEAR CREMATORIUM)

                         MARIE
            What is that old building?

                         LA VALLE
            Oh, it's been abandoned for years.

                         MARIE
            What was it?

                         LA VALLE
            It was a crematorium.

                         MARIE
            For garbage?

                         LA VALLE

caught in an ecstasy of pain and pleasure.  The tempo of the
strokes rises.  Suddenly it reaches a crescendo and he
screams out in orgasm.

Close, full-length shot of a nude BLONDE GIRL, wearing only
black boots and silk panties.  She's walking away from the

whip.  We can hear NICOLI's heavy breathing until the girl
speaks as she moves toward a couch.

            You're Fifty Dollars short.

INT. MUTCHIE'S BAR - NIGHT

In Lower Manhattan.  There are SIX or EIGHT MATRONS still
there, stevedores and truck drivers.  Most of them are
clustered at the far end of the bar, where MUTCHIE, a gray-
haired gone-to-paunch Irishman with spectacles as thick as
pop-bottle bottoms stands behind the mahogany bar.  The
cluster of customers is involved in a typical New York
saloon argument.

DOYLE is ignoring the debate and watching the television.
He is approached by a small MAN in a long coat and baggy
suit with suspenders.  This is JESUS THE BOOSTER.

                         JESUS
            Hey, Bo.

                         DOYLE
            Hiya, Jesus.

                         JESUS
            Can you use a new suit for
            Christmans?

                         DOYLE
            Whatta you got?

JESUS reaches into his trousers and pulls out three suits
(jackets and pants).  They are of the latest style and
color, and still on hangers!

                         JESUS
            Whatta you?... a 44... 46?

DOYLE examines one of the jackets.

                                                           42.


                         DOYLE
            Where'd you get this fag shit?

                         JESUS
            This is what the tough guys are
            wearin'.  You know I only steal
            from the best.  It's Bonwit Teller.

                         DOYLE
            Pass.

                         JESUS
            Forty dollars -- was $250.

                         DOYLE
            Whyn't you get it dry cleaned and
            burned.

JESUS blends into the crowd and we pick up the dialogue of
MUTCHIE and his cronies, BAD EDDIE, LEE and PUGGY.

                         MUTCHIE
            A big man could alluz beat a little
            man.  That's why Wilt Chamberlain
            could murder Jim Brown if they ever
            fought.

                         BAD EDDIE
            No chance.  Brown'd kill him.

                         MUTCHIE
            Chamberlain's seven foot tall,
            right?  He's got a twelve-foot
            reach.  It's geophysics.  He's
            punchin' down on you with leverage.
            He cave your chest in.

                         BAD EDDIE
            Best I ever seen was The Rock.  He
            was the calmest and the meanest.
            Guys like Sugar'd be pukin' before
            a fight.  Jake LaMotta'd be pukin'.
            Marciano was calm like he was goin'
            to church.  What about the night he
            fought LaStarza?  He hit him so
            hard he broke the blood vessels in
            LaStarza's arms.  He was the
            strongest meanest bastard ever lived.

                         PUGGY
            Hey, Mutchie, give us another bullet.

MUTCHIE pours him a straight Scotch in a shotglass.

                                                           43.


                         MUTCHIE
            Blackjack Burns coulds been the
            greatest ever --

                         PUGGY
            -- He was a stone tanker.

                         MUTCHIE
            That's right, he couldn't fight
            legit.  One night at the Garden
            about 1950, '51 -- he fought either
            Jake LaMotta or Gus Lesnevich, I
            think it was -- he took one o'
            those cream puff punches in the
            sixth -- the laziest left you ever
            seen -- missed him entirely.  Down
            goes Blackjack without even workin'
            up a sweat and the whole Garden
            gets up in its feet and I swear to
            Christ, everybody starts singin'
            "Dance With Me Henry."

                         LEE
            I fought a guy in Cleveland once.
            I knew he was a dirty fighter so I
            stick a crowbar in my crotch.
            Right here.  Second round he gives
            me a shot -- Boom -- he breaks his
            hand, the fight's over.

                         PUGGY
            Fuck it, I like nitroglycerin,
            that's my game.

                         MUTCHIE
            What about you, Doyle?  Who's the
            best fighter you ever seen?

                         DOYLE
                   (a few drinks behind him)
            Willie Mays.

                         BAD EDDIE & LEE
            Willie Mays?!

                         DOYLE

            What ya doin' out so late?  Hidin'
            from the cops?

                         DOYLE
            I hear the health department is
            going to close this joint for
            selling dirty beer.  I come by to
            help you carry out your money.

                         MUTCHIE
            They'll close you down if they ever
            get a look at those busted-valise
            broads you run with.

                         DOYLE
            You want some eggs.

                         MUTCHIE

                   (looking around for bacon)
            Hey, Mutch!  You want bacon?

                         MUTCHIE
            Yeah!

DOYLE opens the door to the icebox.

                         MUTCHIE

            around.  Ya couldn't find a Puerto
            Rican in Spanish Harlem.

TIME LAPSE.  Almost morning.  Close on DOYLE and MUTCHIE
eating bacon and eggs.  MUTCHIE is standing behind the bar
as he eats, DOYLE is sitting in front of it.  They both have
a bottle of beer.

                                                           45.


                         MUTCHIE
            I got this little chick I'm tryin'
            to hit on.  She's about 20, 21... I
            take her to Jilly's last night and
            she's tellin' me about how she
            wants to settle down one day, get
            married... I says, "Hey, this is
            1971, baby, I'm just a dirty old
            man lookin' to score with some
            pussy."

                         DOYLE
            Strike out, eh?

                         MUTCHIE
            Yeah.  In the late innings.  Ya
            look like a night's sleep wouldn't
            kill ya.

                         DOYLE
            A piece of ass wouldn't kill me.

                         MUTCHIE
            When ya go back on?

                         DOYLE
            Morning.  Sometime.

                         MUTCHIE
            Whyn't ya stretch out on the pool
            table for a couple hours.  The kid
            comes in at six will wake ya.  A
            couple eggs and a beer is cheaper
            than keepin' a dog around the joint.

EXT. MUTCHIE'S BAR - DAY

Close of DOYLE going to his car.  He stops for a light.
DOYLE is red-eyed and in need of a shave.  He fidgets
through his pockets looking for a cigarette but doesn't find
one.  As he drives along a GIRL CYCLIST comes into view
alongside.

Our view is DOYLE's view of her long, lean tapered legs.  If
he looks further, and DOYLE always looks further, he will
see there is a bra-band sweater covering her well-formed
breasts.  The pendulous swing is there as she bends over the
handlebars.

Close front view of DOYLE looking back to the light, then
back to the legs.

Close outside view, the cyclist, of DOYLE leaning out the
window with his badge in his hand.

                                                           46.


                         DOYLE
            You got a pedaller's license?

                         GIRL
            What?

                         DOYLE
            You're under arrest.

INT. SIMONSON OFFICE - DAY

Medium close shot of RUSSO and SIMONSON.  PHIL KLEIN, a
federal narcotics agent, is reading aloud from an article in
the New York Daily News.  MULDERIG is listening and sipping
coffee.

Close shot of BILL MULDERIG, a Fed narcotics agent.

                         MULDERIG
            Whatta you got -- four more years,
            Walter?

Medium close of SIMONSON and RUSSO

                         SIMONSON
            Three.

Close shot of MULDERIG.

                         MULDERIG
            Christ, by the time you get out all
            this shit'll be legal.

Wide shot of room, taking in SIMONSON, RUSSO, MULDERIG and
PHIL KLEIN.  SIMONSON hands BUDDY a stack of warrants.

                         SIMONSON
                   (rises, to RUSSO)
            The judge gave you ten days on
            these.  Klein and Mulderig will be
            sitting in for the Federals.  Tell
            Doyle they'll make all the buys,
            and that they're to be kept informed
            of everything that goes down.

SIMONSON turns to MULDERIG.

                         SIMONSON
            You know Doyle, don't you Bill?

Close of MULDERIG.

                                                           47.


                         MULDERIG
                   (rises)
            Sure, I know Popeye.  The Master of
            undercover, whose brilliant idea of
            disguise is to limp into a room on
            his left foot and limp out on his
            right.  Whose brilliant hunches
            cost the death of a good officer --

Close of RUSSO

                         RUSSO
            If that's how you're coming in, why
            not stay home and save us all a lot
            of grief.

MULDERIG, close.

                         MULDERIG
            That's just my opinion.

RUSSO, close.

                         RUSSO
            Whyn't you shove it up your ass!

EXT. DOYLE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Long shot of RUSSO approaching housing project group of
buildings.  This is where DOYLE lives.

INT. HALLWAY TO DOYLE'S APARTMENT

RUSSO rings the bell.  No response.  He knocks.  Again
nothing.  He hears a shower working inside the apartment.

                         RUSSO
            Popeye.

No answer.

                         RUSSO
            Popeye.

                         DOYLE
                   (off, weakly)
            Yeah.

                         RUSSO
            It's Cloudy.  Open the door.

                         DOYLE
                   (off)
            I can't.

                                                           48.


                         RUSSO
            Why not?

                         DOYLE
                   (off)
            Let yourself in.

RUSSO reaches into his jacket pocket and gets a celluloid
card, his PBA card, which he slides into the door at the
lock.  He gives it a juggle and the lock is free but the
door moves grudgingly.

INT. DOYLE'S APARTMENT - DAY

The door to DOYLE's apartment, a close view from inside.
There's a bike propped against it and BUDDY RUSSO is trying
to push it open from the outside.

                         RUSSO
                   (behind door)
            What the hell you got holding the
            door?

The bike teeters and falls with a crash and RUSSO comes into
the room puzzled, exasperated.

INT. APARTMENT - RUSSO'S POV - DAY

DOYLE is anklecuffed to the bedpost at the foot of the bed.

                         RUSSO
            What happened to you?

                         DOYLE
                   (sleepy)
            The crazy kid handcuffed me to the
            bed.  With my own cuffs.

The shower goes off.  RUSSO puts the bike upright on its
stand and squeezes the horn, which makes a loud beep.

The BIKE GIRL appears in the bathroom door, wrapped in a
towel.

                         BIKE GIRL
            Oh!

RUSSO sees key on dresser - tosses it to DOYLE.  There are
clothes all over the place, the GIRL's cycling outfit,
DOYLE's pants and shoes and socks.  The decor is completely
impersonal.  RUSSO looks up.

                                                           49.


                         RUSSO
                   (looking at scrapbook
                   on dresser)
            You oughta get plastic covers for
            this stuff like I did - your
            scrapbook's a mess like everything
            else in your life.

RUSSO goes to chair.

                         DOYLE
            Gimme my pants.

RUSSO, who is half sitting on them, pulls the pants loose
and hands them to DOYLE.

                         DOYLE
            You got the warrant?

                         RUSSO
                   (sitting)
            We also got Bill Mulderig and Phil
            Klein.

Close on DOYLE, buttoning his pants.

                         DOYLE
            What do we need those pricks for?

Medium close on RUSSO picking around through the clothes,
coming up with a pair of panties.  He holds them out.

                         RUSSO
            Because by actual count our bureau
            has exactly nine hundred eighteen
            dollars and fifty-four cents to
            make buys and Mulderig's Feds can
            get all of Uncle Sam's money he
            wants by just asking.

DOYLE sitting on bed, strapping the holster on his ankle.
He checks his gun.

                         DOYLE
            Throw 'em in the bathroom, will you?
            How good are the warrants?

                         RUSSO
                   (on the move down
                   hall, at bathroom door)
            Sixty days.  Here.  Don't mention it.

                                                           50.


DOYLE is checking various items that go in his briefcase -
notebook, handcuffs, book of laws, field reports, pencils,
binoculars, candy bars, etc.

Medium close shot of RUSSO looking toward the bathroom door.

                         RUSSO
            Hi!

RUSSO looks back to DOYLE.  There is the sound of a kickstand
being kicked back in place, the door opening and the GIRL
leaving.

Medium close shot of DOYLE tying the shoes, wincing.  Looking
up to the departing GIRL.

                         RUSSO
            Drive carefully!

EXT/INT. RUSSO'S CAR - DAY

Close shot of BILL MULDERIG in back seat.  BUDDY is in
front, next to DOYLE at the wheel.

                         MULDERIG
            Strictly small potatoes.

We can see DOYLE working to keep up with the black Mercury
as they cross the Brooklyn Bridge in fairly heavy traffic.
The Mercury cuts around in and out, DOYLE plunges after him.

                         MULDERIG
            You really know how to pick 'em,
            Doyle.

RUSSO turns his head in anger.

                         MULDERIG
            Still wearing your gun on your ankle?

No answer.

                         MULDERIG
            Somebody told me the reason you did
            that was so's when you met a chick
            and rubbed against her she wouldn't
            know you were a cop.

No answer.

                         MULDERIG
            I said that was bullshit.  It must
            be some kind of fast-draw gimmick
            or something.

                                                           51.


                         RUSSO
            Knock it off, Bill.

                         MULDERIG
            He's gettin' too far ahead.  You're
            gonna lose him.

DOYLE cuts into the next lane to a lot of horn-blowing and
comes to a dead, screeching stop.  DOYLE sits up sharply
erect in the seat, craning to see where SAL is going.  He
throws open the door and hurls himself out.

EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY

Rear medium close shot of DOYLE climbing up on the side of
the car to look ahead, then jumping down and running off.

DOYLE running as hard as he can.

Medium close side shot of SAL turning off the bridge onto
the FDR Drive, moving quickly and smoothly uptown.

DOYLE running to a stop, and staring ahead.  Breathing hard,
horns are blowing on the bridge and they drown out the words
as he curses, "Dirty Sonofabitch."

INT. RUSSO'S CAR - DAY

RUSSO is on the blower.

                         RUSSO
            Phil -- it's Cloudy -- we lost
            him --

Static comes over the two-way radio.

EXT. BOCA'S CAR COMES OFF RAMP, PAN TO

INT. KLEIN'S CAR - DAY

KLEIN is parked on Pearl Street below the Brooklyn Bridge.

                         RUSSO (V.O.)
            He just got off the Bridge - He's
            all yours if you can find him.
            Sonofabitch!

KLEIN starts his car.

EXT. A PARKING GARAGE IN THE EAST 40'S - DAY

SAL emerges from the garage and heads toward Madison Avenue.
He passes a man looking in a store window, PHIL KLEIN.
KLEIN follows him.

                                                           52.


EXT. A STREET IN THE EAST 40'S - DAY

SAL stops abruptly at the corner and turns around.  KLEIN is
forced to pass him and cross the street.

SAL crosses the street to his left, at a right angle to KLEIN.

EXT. MADISON AVENUE - LATE DAY

SAL moving north on Madison Avenue.  He is walking in a
triangular trap of foot surveillance.  We begin to learn
this when we fall back twenty feet behind SAL and pick up
the figure of JIMMY DOYLE, moving at exactly the same pace.
While he keeps looking forward after SAL, he also looks
regularly to the left, across to the West side of Madison
where we quickly zoom in on the figure of BILL MULDERIG, who
is on an even line opposite SAL and moving almost precisely
in step with the subject of their surveillance.  MULDERIG
keeps an eye on SAL but is also glancing north ahead of SAL
to BUDDY RUSSO, who is 20 or 30 feet ahead of SAL, thus
forming the triangle of the A-B-C tail.

SAL bobbing along.

DOYLE following.

MULDERIG keeping pace.

RUSSO up front.

SAL suddenly turning East at the Northeast corner of 46th
Street, the block occupied by the Roosevelt Hotel.

MULDERIG yanking at his right ear.

RUSSO spinning around, hurrying back toward the corner.

DOYLE turning East at the Southeast corner of 46th Street.

RUSSO coming around the corner looking to DOYLE.

DOYLE indicating the Roosevelt entrance with his chin while
MULDERIG comes up to join DOYLE.

RUSSO moving quickly into the Roosevelt entrance on 46th
Street between Madison and Vanderbilt.

INT. ROOSEVELT LOBBY - DAY

Roosevelt lobby stairs with ALAIN CHARNIER, PIERRE NICOLI,
SAL greeting.

                         CHARNIER
            Excuse me.

                                                           53.


                         RUSSO
                   (he is moving through
                   the jam they form on
                   the stairs)
            Excuse me.

We move into the lobby of the Roosevelt and then spin around
quickly, to watch CHARNIER, NICOLI and SAL moving upstairs
and out the door.

EXT. DAY

A distant view from the Northeast corner of 46th Street and
Madison Avenue of the Roosevelt Hotel marquee and the three
men under it, CHARNIER, NICOLI and SAL.  They are in animated
conversation.

DOYLE and MULDERIG on the point-of-view corner across
Madison, MULDERIG with his back to the camera, DOYLE talking
and watching over Mulderig's shoulder.

Close shot DOYLE's face, eyes bright with excitement.

Long view of CHARNIER, NICOLI and SAL under the marquee from
DOYLE's view, zooming in on CHARNIER, who continues to talk,
look up, then look back to SAL.

                         DOYLE
            You take Sal.  I'll stick with the
            beard if they split.

EXT. MADISON AVENUE - DAY

Rear view of ALAIN CHARNIER and PIERRE NICOLI strolling
slowly down Madison Avenue in the Forties.

An overhead view of the pair, CHARNIER and NICOLI, including
DOYLE 20 or 30 yards behind, RUSSO across the street, even
with him.

CHARNIER and NICOLI window-shopping at Walter's Electric,
49th and 3rd Avenue.

RUSSO looking quizzically, puzzled, from a doorway.

CHARNIER and NICOLI are engaged in a running conversation
that we cannot hear.  But what CHARNIER is saying is simply
that he wants to get a pack of cigarettes before they turn
back and stop for dinner.

RUSSO looking to DOYLE for a signal.

                                                           54.


EXT. A CIGAR STORE - DAY

DOYLE already beginning to feel the cold, rubbing his hands
together, at the front of the place CHARNIER and NICOLI have
entered, trying to figure it out as CHARNIER and NICOLI
emerge, CHARNIER ripping the cellophane off a pack of
cigarettes, and they turn back in DOYLE's direction.

DOYLE, face to face with CHARNIER and NICOLI.  Straining to
hear, he picks up a few words of French.  Without losing
stride he steps off the curb and cuts across the street,
moving south, away from them, as they come north.  But
halfway across the street, we pick up RUSSO coming in his
direction, sharp enough to pick up the tail where DOYLE had
to drop it.

EXT. RESTAURANT - DAY

Medium close view through window of ALAIN CHARNIER and
PIERRE NICOLI sitting at a table near the front windows of a
small restaurant.

EXT. STREET - DAY

A long shot of street zooming in on JIMMY DOYLE who is
freezing his ass off in the shadows of a doorway across the
street from the restaurant.  He is dancing from one foot to
the other, his shoulders hunched, occasionally cupping his
hands to his ears.

INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

A medium close shot of WAITER holding a bottle of Sainte
Emillion out for CHARNIER's inspection.  CHARNIER looks,
frowns, shakes head negatively.

DOYLE's feet.  He's standing on one foot, the other raised
and he's squeezing it with a chapped hand, as if trying to
get circulation back into it.

INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

Medium close shot of NICOLI watching the WAITER scoop coq au
vin onto his plate.

Close shot of CHARNIER taking a large forkful of food into
his mouth, chewing and nodding at NICOLI.

Medium close shot of RUSSO standing in front of DOYLE while
DOYLE fishes a piece of pizza out of the bag and lets it
fold into his mouth, then licks his fingers.

                         RUSSO
            You want the red or the white?

                         DOYLE
            Pour it in your ear.

EXT. RESTAURANT - DAY

Medium close view of CHARNIER through the window of the
restaurant, sipping expresso.

INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

Close shot of the pastry tray, rows of Napoleons, strawberry
and peach tarts, a frothing-frenzied rum cake, etc.

NICOLI close, looking like he's about to have an orgasm,
glancing toward CHARNIER and then the tray.

EXT. RESTAURANT - DAY

Close shot of RUSSO peering at the restaurant.  DOYLE's face
right behind him, peering over RUSSO's shoulder, trying to
drink coffee from a paper container and also moving slightly
against the cold and the pain of the shoes.

EXT. FIRST AVENUE - DAY (EXT. COPAIN)

Rear long view of CHARNIER and NICOLI on Madison in the
Forties strolling to a corner where NICOLI is splitting for
the Edison Hotel (West 46th Street) while CHARNIER goes on
to the Westbury on upper Madison.  They part with a wave and
a nod.  Hold on them as BUDDY RUSSO comes into view, moving
off after NICOLI.  DOYLE follow CHARNIER.

Medium close shot of DOYLE leaning on elbow on the counter,
half-turned to keep an eye on the elevators.

                         DOYLE
            That guy just walked in.  What's
            his name?

Close on CLERK and DOYLE.

                         DESK CLERK
            I'm sorry, I don't know who you mean.

                         DOYLE
                   (showing badge)
            He got off on six.

                         DESK CLERK
            We have four rooms and six suites
            on six.  There's a man in almost
            every one of them.

Close of DOYLE.

                         DOYLE
            Little shorter than me.  Well-
            dressed.  About forty-five or fifty
            with salt-and-pepper hair, a beard.

Close of CLERK.  Thinks it over.

                         DESK CLERK
            There's nobody like that on six.

DOYLE AND CLERK

                         DESK CLERK
            Perhaps he's visiting a guest.

                         DOYLE
            No, I figure he stays here.  Where's
            your registration?

CLERK gets out registration log book, goes through list as
DOYLE waits.

                         DESK CLERK
            There may be two... no, three who
            could fit it.

                         DOYLE
            Names.

                         DESK CLERK
            A Mr. Paul Ganapolos, he's here
            alone.

                         DOYLE
            Where from?

                         DESK CLERK
            Des Moines.

                         DOYLE
            What's he do?

                         DESK CLERK
            Businessman.  Owns a department
            store in Des Moines, I think.

DOYLE is taking down the information on a pad.

                         DESK CLERK
            Mr. and Mrs. Alain Charnier, would
            be another.  He's in shipping.

                         DOYLE
            Yeh?  Who else?

                         DESK CLERK
            And a Mr. Michael Lowenstein, I
            don't know what he does.

                         DOYLE
            This Charnier guy.  He's in shipping?

                         DESK CLERK
            I think so.  But they're in Room
            408.  On the fourth floor.

Close of DOYLE.

                         DOYLE

                         DESK CLERK
            That's in France.

                         DOYLE
            Yeah, I know.

EXT. WESTBURY HOTEL ON MADISON AVENUE - NIGHT

Medium close shot of DOYLE standing in another doorway, this
one in Madison Avenue, opposite and a little up the street
from the Westbury.  It is about 2 o'clock in the morning and
there's not much traffic.  DOYLE looks like a man almost too
tired to stand.  We hear a car pull up (off camera).

INT. RUSSO'S CAR - NIGHT

View from the front seat of a sedan of DOYLE falling into
the corner of the back seat.  RUSSO reaches across the seat
from the camera to hand DOYLE a brown paper container of
coffee.  He opens it between his knees and scalds his mouth
with it.  RUSSO hands over another gift, a pint of Canadian
Club.  DOYLE takes a big swig.

Rear close view of BILL MULDERIG at the wheel of the car,
looking at DOYLE in the rear-view mirror.

                         MULDERIG
            You about ready for a break?

A view of MULDERIG at the wheel, RUSSO twisted around in the
seat, looking back at DOYLE and putting the cap back on the
bottle.  When DOYLE isn't sipping at the coffee-whiskey,
he's looking out the window of the car at the entrance of
the hotel.  He looks beat.

                         DOYLE
            The guy's a frog -- I'm pretty sure.
            Also he made me.  Stayin' on four
            but went up to six -- cute.

                         RUSSO
            The other guy's a frog too.  Checked
            in at the Edison.  Had a hooker
            sent up.

                         MULDERIG
            Christ you should o' collared him
            right there.

                         DOYLE
            Who's on him?

                         RUSSO
            Phil Klein.

                                                           59.

            What about Sal?

RUSSO

                         RUSSO
            We put him to bed for the night.

MULDERIG

                         MULDERIG
            Why don't you do the same, Doyle?
            You look like shit.

DOYLE AND MULDERIG - INTERCUT

                         DOYLE
                   (to MULDERIG)
            Look.  My partner and I found this
            case and I don't want no Feds
            screwing it up.

                         MULDERIG
            Case?  So far I haven't seen a damn
            thing.

                         DOYLE
            Bill, keep shootin' your mouth off
            and I'll knock you into the middle
            of next week.

RUSSO, close.

                         RUSSO
            Jimmy, cool it.  Nothin's goin'
            down tonight.  Cop a few zzz's
            while you can.

Close shot, DOYLE.

INT. WEINSTOCK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Close shot of CHEMIST with a small lab layout spread in
front of him -- burner, test tubes, etc.  The MAN's wearing
an ordinary business suit and both the table and the
background indicate that this is not a lab, but somebody's
library or den -- and a fashionable one, with photos, a
signed picture of Lyndon Johnson, etc., on the panelled walls.

The CHEMIST is running a Thiele test on a small mound of
powder.  Heroin from CHARNIER's shipment.

Medium close shot of JOEL WEINSTOCK and SAL BOCA sitting
opposite the CHEMIST.

                                                           60.


SAL has a glass of beer in front of him, WEINSTOCK a brandy
snifter containing a splash of amber cognac.  Both are
interested; SAL quite nervously.

The CHEMIST immerses a capillary tube, a tiny instrument the
size of a needle into an open kilo of heroin.

He pours a small quantity of mineral oil into a burnmeister
test tube and preheats the oil over the open flame of a tiny
alcohol lamp.

He removes a 15-in thermometer from its leather case,
fastens the capillary tuve (now totally immersed in the
heroin) to the bulb of the thermometer with a rubber band.

He places the bulb, with capillary attached, into an open
rubber stop and inserts the entire apparatus into the
burnmeister tube, about three inches in.

With a small metal clamp he holds the rig over the lamp.

We watch closely with the CHEMIST, WEINSTOCK and BOCA as the
white heroin powder slowly, agonizingly dissolves into the
mineral oil and

The mercury rises slowly up the thermometer to 220° - 230°.

The faces of the three men are filled with wonder and
anxiety.  As the mercury continues to rise they become a
cheering section, rooting the hometeam home.

The longer it takes for the powder to dissolve, the purer
the heroin.  The mercury stops at 240°!

                         CHEMIST
            Absolutely dynamite!  89.5 proof!
            Best I've ever seen!  If the rest
            is like this, you'll be dealing for
            two years on this load.

Close on WEINSTOCK, relaxed, smoking a large cigar.

                         WEINSTOCK
            Retail is not my end of the business.
            Are you telling me it's worth the
            half million?

Medium close of the CHEMIST.

                         CHEMIST
            How many kilos?

                         SAL
            Sixty.

                                                           61.


                         CHEMIST
            Six kilos at eight big ones a
            kilo...
                   (he nods)
            I'd say it should be able to take a
            seven to one hit in the street.

                         SAL
            By the time it gets down to nickel
            bags it's at least thirty-two
            million!

Medium close of WEINSTOCK and BOCA.

                         WEINSTOCK
            Thank you, Howard.  Take what's
            left there with you and goodnight.

The CHEMIST packs his apparatus and leaves.

                         SAL
            I guess we got a deal, eh?

Medium close shot of WEINSTOCK alone, appraising BOCA.

                         WEINSTOCK
            We got a test.  A deal for half a
            million dollars, maybe.

SAL, whose cool is easily shattered.

                         SAL
            Joel, the man is in a hurry.  He
            wants the bread and he wants to go
            back to France.  He ain't gonna
            hang around and play games.  He's
            one o' the shrewdest cats I ever
            run across.

WEINSTOCK, close.

                         WEINSTOCK
            What am I, a shmuck?  What's the
            hurry?  He could see a couple of
            shows and visit the top of the
            Empire State Building.

INTERCUT SAL, WEINSTOCK

                         SAL
            Joel, don't jerk me.  I spent a lot
            o' time settin' this one up.

                                                           62.


                         WEINSTOCK
            So whatta you want a badge?  It's
            your first major league game Sal.
            One thing I learned, move calmly,
            move cautiously.  You'll never be
            sorry.

                         SAL
            I been damn careful up to now.

                         WEINSTOCK
            Which is why your phone lines are
            tapped and the Feds are crawlin'
            all over you like flies.

                         SAL
            I'm straight, Joel.  They haven't
            got shit on me.  Look, I'm tellin'
            you, he'll take the deal somewhere
            else.

WEINSTOCK

                         WEINSTOCK
            He could go someplace else with his
            sixty kilos of heroin and see how
            easy it is to pull together a half
            million cash.  He wouldn't find
            there was any hurry to do this kind
            of business.

SAL, a little desperate.

                         SAL
            Look, the stuff is here.  We could
            set up the switch in an hour.  I'm
            tellin' you, Mr. Weinstock, he'll
            split if we don't move.  This guy
            is everything they say he is.

WEINSTOCK taking SAL apart with his eyes over the cigar.

                         WEINSTOCK
            What about you, Sal?  Are you
            everything they say you are?

Close of SAL's worried face.

INT. DAN'S LUNCH - DAY

DOYLE is standing at an island counter in a coffee-doughnuts
joint.  The COUNTERMAN is paying no attention to him but is
instead emptying coffee from a large dispenser into a pot.

                         DOYLE
            You gonna wait on me or am I gonna
            sit here all day?

The COUNTERMAN responds quickly to DOYLE's voice.

of the Hooker's tail.  He straightens it as much as possible
and throws it under the driver's seat.

EXT. MADISON AVENUE - DAY

Medium shot of DOYLE on foot popeyeing up Madison Avenue in
the vicinity of the Westbury.  As unobtrusively as possible,
he's looking for the tail that should be there covering
CHARNIER.  DOYLE is on the East side of the street, and the
Westbury is on the West.  He pokes his head into a couple of
doorways, checks the cars parked at the curb, looks up to a
couple of the mezzanine shops along the street.  He sees
PHIL KLEIN and ANOTHER AGENT talking together totally
oblivious to the front entrance.  MULDERIG in a cigar store
looks to his wristwatch, then goes inside the store.

Close shot of DOYLE frowning, puzzled.  There doesn't seem
to be anybody alert.  He looks over to the hotel.

Westbury Hotel entrance from DOYLE's Point of View.  CHARNIER
steps out of hotel entrance, turns south.  The two AGENTS
and MULDERIG have not seen his exit.

Close on DOYLE in a doorway.

CHARNIER, carrying an umbrella, strolling blithely down the
street, in DOYLE's direction but on the opposite side of the
street.  Zoom in on his face, reflecting no concern, no
problems, then zoom back to DOYLE's position.  Pan to the
hotel entrance as DOYLE looks for somebody else.  Where the
hell is CHARNIER's surveillance?

Very quickly, DOYLE's nervous glances.

CHARNIER close.

Medium shot of DOYLE moving quickly to phone booth against
the wall.

DOYLE close, barking into the phone.

                         DOYLE
            I'm sittin' on Frog One.

MULDERIG in phone booth at Westbury.

                         MULDERIG
            Yeah, we got the Westbury covered
            like a tent.

DOYLE

                         DOYLE
            The Westbury?  Balls.  I got him
            down at the subway at Times Square.
            What the hell's goin' on?  I make
            him coming right out of the hotel
            free as a bird.  Not a soul awake.

Close shot of CHARNIER strolling past the telephone booth,
DOYLE looking down.

                         DOYLE
            I don't care how many bartenders
            are sick.  I don't work in that
            joint.  What the hell kind of a
            union are you running down there?

Long view of CHARNIER and DOYLE about thirty feet apart on
the platform, a second train approaching.

INT. SUBWAY TRAIN

A close view of DOYLE just inside the doors of the car
sneaking a peek at the platform.  We can see that CHARNIER
is not there.  He's on the train.  Suddenly CHARNIER
reappears on the platform.  DOYLE steps off.

EXT. SUBWAY PLATFORM

Long view from DOYLE's vantage point of CHARNIER standing
with his back to the train, looking up like a man who can't
make up his mind, then turning to his left, away from DOYLE
and getting back on the train.

INT. SUBWAY TRAIN

View from interior of DOYLE car of JIMMY DOYLE nipping back
onto car.

                                                           68.


INT. TRAIN - CHARNIER'S CAR

Close view of subway doors hissing shut and an umbrella
being raised at the last moment by an off-camera hand
(CHARNIER's).  The doors jerk open in the safety spasm.
There is a blur of the a fabric moving across the camera,
blocking the view of the doors.  It is only a moment.  When
it clears, the doors are closed again, the umbrella is gone.
But we don't know what happened and the train isn't moving.

INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - DOYLE'S CAR

Rear close view of DOYLE peeking into the forward car to see
where CHARNIER is sitting.

INT. TRAIN - CHARNIER'S CAR

Quick, shocked close view of that car, revealing that
CHARNIER isn't there among the twenty passengers dozing or
moping in their seats.  There is a blurred flash as if
DOYLE's own eyes are spinning frantically back to the
windows of his own car.

EXT. SUBWAY PLATFORM

Medium shot of DOYLE jumping out of train, CHARNIER jumping
back on - train takes off.

INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - CHARNIER'S CAR

A close view of CHARNIER's face.  He is smiling directly at
DOYLE.  He gives him a little wave.

A view from CHARNIER's position of DOYLE chasing the train,
anger and hatred and frustration storming across his face.

EXT. HENRY HUDSON PARKWAY - MOSHOLU EXIT

A long view from the bottom of the steep embankments above
Harlem River Drive in Washington Heights.  Sprayed along the
face of the cliff is a disaster -- an overturned city bus
and a car with which it apparently collided.  The scene is
lighted with flares.  Police rescue WORKERS and FIREMEN are
scrambling up and down the face of the cliff.  They are
carrying BODIES out of the bus and the car, COPS pulling
them out through the windows, leading them on stretchers.
There are shouted orders and some moans and cries from the
wreckage.  In the foreground is LT. WALTER SIMONSON, involved
in the operation, but also involved in a hassle with DOYLE,
MULDERIG and RUSSO who are standing with him.  An officer
approaches SIMONSON with a set of heroin works.

                                                           69.


                         OFFICER
                   (to SIMONSON)
            This belonged to the kid who was
            drivin' the sports car.  17 years
            old.  His girlfriend OD'd in the
            car.  We found this set of works in
            her arm.

Medium close shot of DOYLE and SIMONSON.  DOYLE couldn't
care if Rome was burning on the hill; he's only interested
in his case.

                         DOYLE
                   (to MULDERIG)
            Where the hell was the surveillance?
            "Go to bed." That's all you could
            say.  You couldn't keep track of a
            bleeding elephant in a snowbank.

SIMONSON, eyes on the hill, glancing to DOYLE with irritation.

                         SIMONSON
            Jimmy, it doesn't matter anymore.
            If there was a deal it must have
            gone down by now.  We blew it!  We
            blew our cover and we blew the
            warrants --

                         MULDERIG
            Charnier and his wife checked out
            of the Westbury.  Nicoli checked
            out of the Edison --

                         RUSSO
            This fella Nicoli's got a record in
            France, Walter.  He's wanted for
            questioning in the murder of a
            French cop.

                         DOYLE
            I say we keep sittin' on Boca.

                         MULDERIG
            That's crazy.  You lost the Frog in
            the subway and you blew our cover.
            If they haven't moved already
            they're not gonna move now.

                         DOYLE
            Walter, I can make this case if the
            Feds will get the hell out of my way.

                                                           70.


                         MULDERIG
            With pleasure -- it's all yours.
            Walter, if anything develops outta
            this charade give me a call.

Medium shot of SIMONSON, DOYLE, MULDERIG and RUSSO.  Lights
flashing around them; stretchers going by with bodies.

                         RUSSO
                   (to MULDERIG)
            My ass.  The only reason you're in
            this is because you've got a big
            expense account for buying junk and
            you like to see your picture in the
            papers.

                         DOYLE
                   (to SIMONSON)
            This is my case.  Get these guys
            off my back and let me handle it.

SIMONSON

                         SIMONSON
            For chrissake, will you come off
            that "my case" bullshit.  This has
            been a whore's dream from the start.

DOYLE, close.

                         DOYLE
            The deal hasn't gone down yet
            Walter -- I know it, I can feel it.

Close shot of MULDERIG

                         MULDERIG
            The last time you were dead certain
            we ended up with a dead cop.

A fist, DOYLE's, comes from off-camera and connects with
MULDERIG's chin.  As his head flies back.

DOYLE and MULDERIG slugging and grappling with each other,
RUSSO leaping in to yank them apart.  SIMONSON grabbing
MULDERIG's arm and holding him back.

SIMONSON, close.

                         SIMONSON
                   (roaring)
            That's enough.  Get the hell out of
            here.

                                                           71.

                   (on way up hill,
                   turning back)
            Jimmy, you wasted two months - no
            collars are comin' in while you two
            been out jerkin' off.  Now go back

the shuttle line.

EXT. DEPT. OF COMMERCE, WASHINGTON, D.C. - DAY

CHARNIER and an UNDERSECRETARY on the steps of the building,
shaking hands.  Two other OFFICIALS are on hand and while we
don't hear their conversation, their manner is extremely
attentive to CHARNIER.

                         CHARNIER
            It has been highly informative and
            a personal pleasure to see you again.

                         UNDERSECRETARY
            I only hope we cut through to some
            meaningful proposals in the next
            month or so.  The pleasure was
            mine, Mr. Charnier.  When will we
            see you again?

                         CHARNIER
            Soon, probably in the Spring.

                                                           72.


Close shot of CHARNIER.

                         CHARNIER
            Goodbye.

                         UNDERSECRETARY
                   (off camera)
            Goodbye.  Good trip home.

EXT. WASHINGTON STREET - DAY

card from his lapel.

Rear close shot of CHARNIER joining SAL BOCA on the sidewalk
and the two of them moving off together.

Close shot of SAL, somewhat nervous about trying to peddle
his problems to CHARNIER.

                         SAL
            Everything's smooth.  Beautiful.  I
            will need a few more days though,
            the boys think we oughta cool it
            for awhile -- make sure there's no
            heat.

                         CHARNIER
                   (manner outwardly pleasant)
            You must take me for an imbecile.
            Why do you think I asked you to
            meet me in Washington?  I haven't
            spent five minutes in New York City
            without the company of a gendarme.

                         SAL
            Look, I'll level with you -- I need
            a little more time -- I got to
            shift gears.

                         CHARNIER
            Are you having trouble raising the
            half million?

                         SAL
            Hell no -- my end is covered -- my
            associates just feel we ought to
            wait for a more opportune time to
            make the switch.

Stop, Cover.

                                                           73.


                         CHARNIER
            It has to be by the end of this week.

                         SAL
            Look, Mr. Charnier, you got to be
            reasonable.

                         CHARNIER
            It's your problem.

                         SAL
            It's yours too!

Full length shot of CHARNIER and BOCA, CHARNIER leaning over
to shake his hand.

                         CHARNIER
            So nice to have seen you again.

CHARNIER turns and walks off, leaving SAL looking after him
as we zoom back to a Point of View about a hundred yards
down the street.

Close of PHIL KLEIN, just watching.

INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

Close shot of MRS. CHARNIER, sitting by the window of two
seats on the shuttle, looking out and babbling at CHARNIER.
(DIALOGUE IN FRENCH).

                         MARIE
            Look, darling, they sell these at
            the Smithsonian.

She extracts a necklace and bracelet of shark's teeth from
an elegant alligator bag.

Camera moves back to take in CHARNIER looking from the Wall
Street Journal to the native craft bracelets.

                         CHARNIER
            Are you sure it is dead?

                         MARIE
            I'm going to put them on the cat.

                         CHARNIER
            That's a relief.

Close shot of CHARNIER, tenderly, lovingly.

                                                           74.


                         CHARNIER
            You did find something for yourself,
            of course.

MARIE, close.

                         MARIE
            Of course.  But I am not going to
            tell you what it is until we are
            back in Marseilles.

CHARNIER and MARIE.  He folds up the paper, smiling at her.

                         CHARNIER
            Excuse me a moment, darling.

CHARNIER's view of the plane interior, walking back toward
the rear of the cabin.  The seats are occupied by military-
business-government TYPES making the shuttle run.  Not every
seat is filled.  We come to an empty one on which someone
has deposited an attache case.  It is the seat next to
PIERRE NICOLI, whose hand reaches out to remove it and we
follow the arm to NICOLI's face.

Close shot of CHARNIER and NICOLI sitting. (DIALOGUE IN
FRENCH)

                         CHARNIER
            I'm afraid they've become a bit...
            over-cautious.  Our American friends.

                         NICOLI
            What happens to the schedule?

                         CHARNIER
            We must follow it.

                         NICOLI
            But will they?

CHARNIER shrugs.

                         CHARNIER
            I don't know.  Boca is scared.
            He's not strong enough.  He sees
            policemen in his soup.

                         NICOLI
            He is not wrong.

                         CHARNIER
            Mmmmm.  That bastard who followed
            me on the subway, he's the eager one.

                                                           75.


                         NICOLI
            Let me take him out.

Close of CHARNIER.

                         CHARNIER
            There'll be someone else.

                         NICOLI
            What difference does it make?
            We'll be out of the country Friday.

Close shot of CHARNIER alone.

EXT. SIDEWALK OUTSIDE DOYLE'S APARTMENT BLDG. - DAY

A complex of buildings similar to Lefrak City.  A medium
close view of a LITTLE GIRL about to run DOYLE down with a
two-wheel bicycle.  Two shots ring out in quick succession
and tear up the concrete at a point where he would have been
walking a moment earlier.

DOYLE diving for the cover of a tree.  The rifle goes off a
third time and MOTHERS begin to scream on the benches of the
playground area.

                         DOYLE
                   (yelling)
            Everybody, down!  Get down on the
            ground!

DOYLE behind the tree, pulling his gun out of the ankle
holster.  He holds the gun ready and tries to look around.
Ping, another shot that drives him back.

Long panning view, DOYLE's view, from the ground, of all the
rooftops in the area.  A blank.  The background sound is
still screaming crying. "Call the police." "The man's got a
gun." "Help!  Help!" The view is still slow, careful under
the pressure of the panic.  There's another shot.

Long shot of rifle smoke rising from NICOLI's sniper position.

Exterior view of the concrete tunnels, DOYLE running from
them toward the building, dodging and ducking behind
playground equipment and benches as he does.  He's shouting
as he runs.

            Get down!  It's a sniper.  Get down!

below, grabs rifle and cartridge.

DOYLE running to the parapet, looking over.

Shot of the street, traffic, elevated tracks in the distance.
Long searching look of the streets and the people.  The
view, which is DOYLE's, passes over one man in a dark suit,
stops and goes back.  Zap!  It's NICOLI walking quickly but
not in any panic toward the El.

DOYLE's face.  He runs to parapet, fires at NICOLI.  Misses.

DOYLE running across the roof and through the door.

DOYLE bursting out of the elevator at the bottom, through a
crowd of WOMEN and KIDS who scream as they did in the
playground.

Medium close view of DOYLE running as fast as he can.

right in front of DOYLE.

                         DOYLE
            Stop that guy.  He's wanted by the
            police!

Side medium close shot of DOYLE turning and plunging back
through the doorway of platform exit.

INT. TRAIN CAR - DAY

In one corner of the train is a transit policeman.  He's
observed Doyle shouting and gesturing at NICOLI who sits
nervously aware of the policeman's presence.  Long longs
between them.  Finally, the officer decides to approach
NICOLI.

NICOLI panics and runs.  The officer goes after him and
traps him against the door between cars.

INT. TOKEN BOOTH - DAY

Close shot of DOYLE with badge at token booth.

                         DOYLE

a driver to stop.  DOYLE moving so hard he falls against the
hood of the car then dashes around to the door and jerks it
open.

                         DOYLE
            Police!

Medium close shot of DOYLE dragging MIDDLE-AGED MALE DRIVER
out from behind the wheel as he shouts.

                         DRIVER
            What the hell?

                         DOYLE
                   (diving behind the wheel)
            Police!  Emergency!

                                                           78.


DOYLE has a pistol in his hand.  The man falls back
sputtering.  DOYLE jams car into gear and it roars off.

INT. SUBWAY TRAIN CAR - DAY

NICOLI pounds on the door of the Motorman's cab with his gun.

After a long moment - the door cracks open.  Close shot
NICOLI pushing his way into the cab of the subway MOTORMAN,
sixtyish, worn and frail looking.

MOTORMAN looks down.  He follows the glance to NICOLI's .45.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Side close view of DOYLE screeching to a stop to avoid
plunging into a panel truck.  DOYLE sticks his head out the
window to look up at the tracks as the DRIVER of the truck
screams.

                         TRUCK DRIVER
            Blind sonofabitch!

Overhead view of the tracks, train roaring along them.
DOYLE's view.

INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - DAY

The tracks racing by from the view of the train.  We're
approaching a station.

INT. MOTORMAN'S CABIN - DAY

NICOLI's close view of the MOTORMAN, the gun on the man.

                         NICOLI
            Don't stop!  Continue on to the
            next station!

                         MOTORMAN
            I got to stop.

                         NICOLI
            Touch the brake and I'll blow you
            in half.

                         MOTORMAN
            The signal lights are automatic.
            If I go through a red I'll be
            automatically braked.

The MOTORMAN pales, his hand goes to his left side in a
gesture of anxiety, possibly pain.

                                                           79.


EXT. SUBWAY ENTRANCE - DAY

which he leaves hanging open.  He races around the car for
the steps to the El.

EXT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - DAY

Side view of train roaring through the station without
stopping.

INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - DAY

Medium close shot of CROWD on train pushing toward the
MOTORMAN's cab.  They are upset over the missed stop.  The
CONDUCTOR seems to be the most annoyed.

He's pushing hardest toward the camera to complain.

                         VOICES
            Didn't stop.
            Went right through there...
            Hey, man, that's my station...
            Where the hell's he going?
            Hey, stop the car...

Close shot of NICOLI's back, half in the MOTORMAN's cab, as
he faces the CROWD.  Now the cries turn to:

                         VOICES
            He's got a gun...
            The motorman's gone crazy...
            Oh my God!

                         NICOLI
            Get back.

                         CONDUCTOR
            Hey, you can't...

Side view of NICOLI, the MOTORMAN in the background the
CONDUCTOR leaping at NICOLI.  NICOLI burns him; one gut shot.
The car turns to pandemonium of screams.  The CONDUCTOR is
hurled back into the crowd by force of the blast.  The
MOTORMAN throws back his head in fright, and the beginning
of a coronary.

EXT/INT. DOYLE'S CAR - DAY

Close shot of DOYLE from back seat, twisting, turning the
car in a wild demonstration of pursuit driving around cars,
braking, roaring ahead.

                                                           80.


We move out through the windshield for a lurching, spinning,
twisting view of the tracks overhead, the street signs and
lights flashing by in a reeling montage of movement, the
train roaring above it all.

INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - DAY

Close side shot of NICOLI turning to cover the MOTORMAN, who
is clutching in pain, slumping toward the controls.

                         MOTORMAN
                   (gasping)
            I can't breathe.

NICOLI glances quickly to his left, out the window to the
next station.

Long, low view of the tracks, partially NICOLI's view.
There are red blinkers on the side of the tracks.  Red
lights up ahead.  That's the back of another train.  It has
stopped and we're hurtling toward it.

Wide shot of screaming pack of subway riders, fighting their
way back from NICOLI, succeeding only in turning themselves
into a tightly contained mob.  Now the words they cry are:

                         VOICES
            We'll crash.
            Won't somebody please help me.
            Murder
            He's a killer.
            Crash.  We'll crash!
            Stop.  Stop the train.

EXT. DOYLE'S CAR - DAY

an oncoming group of cars.

Long, low view of the train from DOYLE's position.

through the yellow signal light at the rear of the station.

EXT. CLOSE SHOT THE TRIP LOCK - DAY

As the onrushing car pulls equal to the red signal light at
the front of the station, the tiny trip lock on the track
springs up, activating the safety brake.  The trains avoid
collision by a few feet as the front car screeches to a halt.

INT. THE ONRUSHING TRAIN - DAY

The passengers are thrown violently to the ground.

NICOLI gets to his feet and forces open one of the doors.

EXT. 62ND STREET TRACKS - DAY

NICOLI makes his way out of the train and runs along the
tracks for a few yards, narrowly avoiding the third rail.
He climbs onto the station platform, to the shock and
amazement of several onlookers.  He is dazed and disheveled,
no longer a hunter.

EXT. ENTRANCE TO THE 62ND STREET STATION - DAY

NICOLI staggers down the stairs to the street, unarmed.

DOYLE is waiting at the foot of the stairs.

NICOLI sees him, turns in desperation to run back up.

                                                           82.


DOYLE has his .38 drawn.  He fires three shots into NICOLI's

                         RUSSO
            Hey, Mac, have you seen...?

There's a tense pause as BOCA looks at RUSSO.

Close shot of BOCA.

                         SAL
            Yeh.  He's over getting my car.

Medium close shot of GARAGE ATTENDANT holding the door of
the Lincoln open for SAL, shutting it and taking the ticket
from the windshield.  As BOCA puts car in gear and drives
off, we pan to BUDDY RUSSO standing there watching.  The
ATTENDANT walks up.

                                                           83.

EXT. DOYLE'S CAR - NIGHT

Long view over the hood of DOYLE's car to the street.  We
can see the Lincoln.  The lights of a car appear on the left
and come down the street past the Lincoln, slowly, like a
man looking for a place to park.  We can make out, but just
barely with the help of the street lights, four people in
the car.

DOYLE in close profile, the foreground, picking up a corner
of the Lincoln in the background.  While we are looking in
silence, there is a glimmering flow in the far corner, the
beginning of approaching headlights again.  They grown
brighter and DOYLE's foreground profile turns to watch it
come.

                         DOYLE
                   (softly)
            Same car.

                         RUSSO
            Third time around.

RUSSO and MULDERIG straightening up, leaning close to window
to peer out.

Long view over the hood of DOYLE's car of the approaching
vehicle, which suddenly switches off its lights and turns on
its parking blinkers.  It comes abreast of the Lincoln and
stops.  The men get out and chase the Lincoln.

View through windshield at the four men.  DOYLE is now up
straight and at the wheel.  He's leaning forward, his hand
on the key of the car.  He glances back to MULDERIG.

                         DOYLE
                   (to car radio)
            Let's him 'em.

View of the hood.  All hell breaks loose, headlights,
including DOYLE's flash on and form a spotlight on the
Lincoln and the figures around it.  Frozen in the headlights,
confused, startled, and disbelieving are FIVE PUERTO RICANS
with a variety of auto-stripping tools in their hands: lug
wrenches, tire irons, pinch bars, monkey wrenches, etc.
DOYLE drives right up to them.  The camera leaps out of the
car with him and runs toward the men.  We hear voices
shouting.

                         VOICES
            Police!  Don't move... get you...
            hands up... you're under arrest...

                                                           85.


EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Close view of DOYLE holding his gun on one of the terrorized-
looking Puerto Ricans.  The KID's hands are rising
tentatively.  He's too scared to move.

                         DOYLE
            Up!  Up, you sonofabitch!

In the background, the scene is being duplicated by two or
three others.

Overhead view of this headlight and flashlight arena of
about 10 or 12 DETECTIVES forming small clusters, throwing
these guys up against cars, pulling their arms around behind
them and throwing cuffs on them while others rapidly frisk
them for weapons, taking away one pistol, a couple of knives.

MULDERIG and DOYLE looking at their MAN up against the
Lincoln as RUSSO finishes snapping handcuffs on him.

                         DOYLE
            Of all the goddam cars they had to
            pick to steal hubcaps.

Close shot of the front end of the Lincoln, upended on a
hoist attached to a police tow truck.  The area is less
brightly lighted by headlights now.  Some cars have departed
with the Puerto Rican AUTO STRIPPERS.  DOYLE's interest
focuses on the car.  We pick him up as we pan to him sitting
on the running board of the tow truck, talking with its
DRIVER, who is making a report on a clipboard.  MULDERIG and
RUSSO are standing nearby, talking to TWO PLAINCLOTHESMEN.

                         DOYLE
                   (looking up and around)
            A bunch of lousy little spic car
            thieves.

                         MULDERIG
            Nothing in there except a New York
            street map.

                         DOYLE
            Tumble it.  One end to the other.

RUSSO jotting in his note pad, then glancing up to the off-
camera DOYLE.

DOYLE, medium close, hands jamming into his pockets, staring
at the ground with RUSSO and MULDERIG.

                                                           86.


INT. POLICE GARAGE - DAY

A montage as the Lincoln is being disassembled.  First it is
weighed.  We then see the MECHANIC drain the gas, pull apart
the transmission and check through the brake drums, rip out
the seats.

MECHANIC ducking out from under the car, moving toward off-
camera DOYLE.

                         MECHANIC
            Nobody's been under there with
            anything but a grease gun since if
            came off the line.

DOYLE's hand reaches out from off-camera and takes a
cigarette package out of the MECHANIC's pocket.

                         DOYLE
            I don't buy it.  The stuff is on
            this car.

                         MECHANIC
            Then you find it.  I can't.

INT. POLICE SERGEANT'S OFFICE AT GARAGE - DAY

Shot of DEVEREAUX and LA VALLE.

                         LA VALLE
            The car was lost sometime this
            evening.  First they send us to
            Pier One -- then they send us
            here --

                         DESK SERGEANT
            I don't understand why you had it
            parked on the waterfront.  You're
            staying at the Doral and you lose
            your car somewhere out by the
            Brooklyn Bridge.

                         LA VALLE
            In point of fact, M. Devereaux is
            scouting locations for a film for
            French Television.  He left the car
            to look at some point of interest.

                         DEVEREAUX
                   (moving, excitable)
            We were told by the Police
            Commissioner's office that the car
            was brought to this garage.  I
            demand its immediate return.

                                                           87.


                         DESK SERGEANT
            If you'll be patient, Mr. Devereaux.

                         DEVEREAUX
                   (moving)
            I have been patient enough.  There
            is no reason I should have to waste
            time with this red tape.

                         LA VALLE
            Mr. Devereaux is an extremely
            important guest of this country.
            He is working with the absolute
            cooperation and participation of
            your government.  Here are his
            credentials from the French
            Consulate.
                   (showing them)
            Unless you wish to see this episode
            portrayed in his film I suggest you
            locate his car immediately.

Police MECHANIC in background.

                         MECHANIC
            What are you looking for?  Is it as
            big as an orange or an elephant's
            ass?  I've been over every inch --
            top to bottom.  If you could give
            me a club -- to the size...

                         RUSSO
                   (doing rough figures
                   on a piece of scratch paper)
            What was the weight of the car when
            you got it, Irv?

                         MECHANIC
                   (consulting his notes)
            4,839 pounds.

                         RUSSO
                   (consulting Lincoln
                   Specification Book)
            You're sure?
                   (he does quick addition)
            The manufacturer's spec says it
            should weigh 4,719 pounds.  This
            one's carrying roughly 120 extra
            pounds somewhere.

He produces a copy of a ship's manifold.

                                                           88.


                         RUSSO
            When it was booked in at Marseilles
            it weighed the same.  120 pounds
            overweight.  Jimmy has to be right.

The THREE MEN turn again to stare at the Lincoln.  The
MECHANIC lowers the hoist, thoughtfully.

                         MECHANIC
            I ripped everything out except the
            Rocker panels.

                         DEVEREAUX
            What's that?

They look at each other for a long moment.

MECHANIC starts to undo the side Rocker pans.  JIMMY pulls
the pan off and sticks his arm into the enclosure.  Feeling
around inside he pulls out the first kilo-sized plastic
container as several others start tumbling out after.  BUDDY
and DOYLE are smiling at each other as they continue to pull
the bags out.  Several of the other MECHANICS in the garage
are gathered around the happy moment.  They repeat this
action on the other side of the car.

RUSSO enters garage sergeant's bullpen.  DEVEREAUX and LA
VALLE are still arguing with the SERGEANT.

                         RUSSO
            Got it for you, Randy -- it just
            came in from downtown.  Who's
            Devereaux?

                         LA VALLE
            This is M. Devereaux.

                         RUSSO
            I'm sorry, Mr. Devereaux, but we
            get reports on a couple hundred
            vehicles a night.  Sometimes it's a
            little tough to keep track.

                         DEVEREAUX
            You mean the car's here now?

                         RUSSO
            Yeah -- fine -- it's okay -- not
            even a scratch.  You're all set.
                   (handing DEVEREAUX keys)


RUSSO walking with DEVEREAUX and LA VALLE.

                                                           89.


                         RUSSO
            Someone stole it right off the
            street, huh?  You're gonna have to
            pay the tow away charge.

                         DEVEREAUX
            I was told these things happen in
            New York -- but one never expects it.

                         RUSSO
            Yeah.  Well, it's in perfect shape.
            You must lead a charming life.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DORAL - DAY

Medium close shot of DEVEREAUX striding through the lobby
toward the camera. (DIALOGUE IN FRENCH)

                         CHARNIER
            Henri...

Medium close shot of DEVEREAUX turning to face CHARNIER, who
has been waiting for him.

                         CHARNIER
            Did you pick up the car?

                         DEVEREAUX
            It is waiting for you in the garage.

                         CHARNIER
            Did they follow you?

                         DEVEREAUX
            I wasn't looking.

                         CHARNIER
            Henri... I need one more favor from
            you.  I know I am imposing...

                         DEVEREAUX
            My friend, I am not sure about what
            is going on -- but for me, I am
            finished.

                         CHARNIER
            Not quite -- you are in it whether
            you like it or not.  The police
            know you brought the car into the
            country.  This makes you an
            accomplice.

                                                           90.


                         DEVEREAUX
            An accomplice to what?!  What have
            you gotten me into, Alain?  You
            asked me to do you a favor -- and I
            did what you asked -- but you've
            taken advantage of me.  I have my
            reputation --

CHARNIER pulls DEVEREAUX further aside.

                         CHARNIER
            Calm down -- Henri!  You must trust
            me -- this is an extremely
            complicated situation to which
            there is a simple solution if you
            do exactly what I tell you.  It's
            worth more money to you.

                         DEVEREAUX
            Goodbye.

DEVEREAUX turns and walks into the crowded lobby leaving
ALAIN standing alone.

INT. GARAGE - DAY

Medium close shot of the Lincoln.  The Rocker panels are
open and the junk is being unloaded.  CHARNIER is standing
by two suitcases of cash.  He takes a bundle out of the
suitcase, riffs the deck of bills with his fingers to make
sure it's money all the way through; puts it in a separate
stack that will go into the rocker panels of a nearby junk
car.  WEINSTOCK is standing next to the CHEMIST, with his
testing equipment.  The MECHANICS are under the Lincoln and
passing out the kilos of heroin, BOCA is helping them.  The
kilos are concealed in the floor boards of the old garage.

CHARNIER hesitates.  Then runs into the darkness of the
Crematorium.

EXT. CREMATORIUM - DAY

After a chase around the graveyard RUSSO burns SAL who dies
among the wrecked cars.

WEINSTOCK and the CHEMIST emerge from the cars.  Hands in
the air.  They give up without a struggle.

                         RUSSO

            He's gone, Jimmy.  Bill is dead.

DOYLE full figure, close.  A long pause -- and then --

                         DOYLE
            The sonofabitch is in here somewhere.
            I saw him -- I'm gonna get him.

DOYLE exits down the corridor.  The others staring after him.

EXT. CREMATORIUM

Within the building no one is visible.  Overhead, the
Hellgate Bridge, sounds of New York, jets, auto traffic, and
an approaching Penn Central train.

FROZEN RIVER

    FADE IN:


1   EXT. INTERNATIONAL SEAWAY BRIDGE - DAY                      1

    A sign reads "Bridge to Canada."

    A steep 1940's era customs bridge arches over the St.
    Lawrence River.

    Cars and trucks line up in different lanes. Customs
    officials inspect and question impatient drivers.

    Beyond them a smaller sign: "THANK YOU FOR VISITING
    MASSENA NEW YORK, IT WORKS, for business, for family, for
    you".


2   EXT. BELOW THE BRIDGE - DAY                                 2

    The river stretches for miles in either direction,
    frozen, and still with trees on either side.


3   EXT. RAY'S TRAILER YARD, MASSENA NEW YORK - DAY             3

    RAY EDDY, 38, a bit worn for her years, with a long red
    ponytail, wearing an old bathrobe, sits in the passenger
    seat of her RED PLYMOUTH HORIZON with the door open,
    smoking a cigarette, thinking. Her breath is visible in
    the cold morning air.

    Her bare feet rest on the cold ground.

    Her 1970's rusted out TRAILER HOME SITS in front of her
    on CINDER BLOCKS AT A SLIGHT TILT. Beside it, a small
    SHED and behind it the CONCRETE FOUNDATION FOR A HOUSE.

    Around her, the yard is littered with junk: a rusted ski
    lift chair, the front end of a Plymouth Duster and a
    SMILING DUCK Kiddie Ride.

    Beyond the yard, flat, winterbare land.

    After a moment, a lanky boy of 15, her son, TROY, JR.,
    leans out the trailer door.

                            T.J.
               We're out of Capt'n Crunch.

    His breath is visible in the cold.

                             RAY
               Just give him toast.

                                                         2.


                       T.J.
          We got no butter, we got no jelly.

Ray is out of ideas. He expects her to move, but she
stays still. He looks around the yard.

                       T.J. (CONT'D)
          What are you doing?

                       RAY
          Listening for the trucks.

                       T.J.
          Are they really coming?

                         RAY
          Yeah.

                         T.J.
          Where's dad?

She is silent.

                       T.J. (CONT'D)
                 (says it slow)
          Where's dad?

She looks at him.

                       RAY
          I don't know how he found it, T.J.

                         T.J.
          Found what?

Ray takes a drag off her cigarette. T.J. walks over to
the car.

                         T.J. (CONT'D)
          The money?

                       RAY
          I locked it in my glove compartment.

T.J. looks in at the OPEN AND EMPTY GLOVE COMPARTMENT.

                       T.J.
          That was stupid.

                       RAY
          Yeah, I see that now, but the trucks were
          coming before the bank opened.

                                                      3.


                       T.J.
          Did you tell him you had it?

                       RAY
          Duh? No, I guess he just sniffed it out.

                       T.J.
          Jesus Christ! The glove compartment!?
          That's the stupidest place you could have
          put it.

                       RAY
          He hasn't bought a scratch card in almost
          thirty two months. I thought it would be
          okay!

                       T.J.
          Did he leave anything?

She shakes her head.

                       T.J. (CONT'D)
          What are you gonna do?

                       RAY
          Nothing.

                       T.J.
          You could look for him?

                       RAY
          He could be anywhere.

                       T.J.
          We should look for him.

                       RAY
          Where?

                       T.J.
          The Rez,

                       RAY
          With more than four thousand dollars,
          he's probably in Atlantic City by now.

                       T.J.
          So let's go, let's find him before he
          blows it all.



                       (CONT'D)

                                                             4.


                           RAY
              I can't.

                           T.J.
              What do you mean?

                           RAY
              I just can't do it anymore.

                           T.J.
              But he'll lose it all.

                           RAY
              T.J., we can't make him stop.

                           T.J.
              He stole our money. Call the Troopers.

                           RAY
              It's not stealing if you take it from
              your family. Anyway, he made some of it,
              too.

                           T.J.
              So you're just gonna sit there?

                           RAY
              I'm sorry.

    In the distance the RUMBLE OF TRUCKS. Ray hears it. It
    gets louder.

                           T.J.
              Another Christmas in the tin crapper.

    T.J. goes into the shed and slams the door.

    Ray throws down her cigarette and goes into the trailer.



4   INT. RAY'S TRAILER - DAY                                      4

    She looks around the cramped trailer at the oversized
    RENTAWORLD furniture including a big screen TV.

    An enlarged wall photograph of the family catches her
    eye. In it, her husband, TROY, SR., 40, wearing a forced
    smile, his long, shaggy hair combed flat for the picture.

    Ray hurries down the hall to her bedroom and takes off
    her bathrobe -- she has several tatoos -- and slides into
    a pair or jeans and a t-shirt.

                                                              5.


    A sleepy-eyed, toe-headed boy, RICKY, 5, walks in,
    shirtless in pajama bottoms, eyes shining.

                            RICKY
              Is it here?

    Ray stops what she's doing when she sees him and kneels
    down.

                           RAY
              Hey, little sleepy head.

                           RICKY
              Is it here yet? `Cause I'm ready.

    He drags a suitcase full of plastic dinosaurs around the
    corner.

    The RUMBLE OUTSIDE GROWS LOUDER. Ricky BOLTS out of the
    bedroom and down the hall to the trailer door.

                            RAY
              Wait a sec-

    He bursts into the yard where:


5   EXT. RAY'S TRAILER - DAY                                       5

    A PICK-UP TRUCK DRAPED WITH A "WIDE LOAD" banner leads
    TWO SEMIS hauling halves of a DOUBLE WIDE MOBILE HOME
    wrapped in plastic, rippling in the wind.

    Ricky stops at the massive sight, twisting at his fly,
    trying not to pee himself.

    T.J. comes out of the shed.

    The Doubles come to a stop and idle in the yard.

    GUY VERSAILLES, pot-bellied, in a green velour running
    suit, squeezes out of his truck. On the door: "MASSENA
    MODULAR AND MOBILE HOMES, NEW AND RECONDITIONED."

    Ricky grabs a rope hanging off one of the doubles and
    tries to climb the side of it. The TRUCK DRIVER looks
    down from his cab.

                           T.J.
                     (to Ricky)
              Get down.

    Ray peeks out the kitchen curtain.

                                                       6.


After a moment she comes out of the trailer, with a
pasted-on smile.

                       RAY
          We're all ready for ya'.

She points to the new concrete foundation. He consults a
clipboard.

                       VERSAILLES
          We'll need the balloon payment to unload.

T.J. looks at Ray.

                       RAY
          We have it, it's just that they called
          Troy from Titus last night. That's where
          Troy works. The ski place? And anyway-

                       VERSAILLES
          Have you got the $4,372 dollars or not?

                       RAY
          It was some emergency with the lifts. So
          he took off without thinking with the
          money. Completely forgot you were coming.
          So as soon as he gets back-

                       VERSAILLES
          When's he gonna be back?

                       RAY
          As soon as he can get here, I'll just run
          it down to you.

T.J. could crawl out of his skin.

                       VERSAILLES
                 (ironic smile)
          This is the second time you've dragged me
          out here. If you don't come up with it by
          Christmas, you've lost your fifteen
          hundred dollar deposit.

He walks toward his car. She follows him.


                       RAY
          Look, Mr. Versales, I have a good job at
          ALL FOR A DOLLAR. They're probably gonna
          make me a manager after Christmas so I
          can handle the payments if you just leave
          the house-

                                                         7.


He gets in the car.

                       VERSAILLES
          Call me when you have the balloon
          payment.

He makes a circle in the air with his hand and the semi's
rev their engines and grind into reverse.

                       RAY
          I'll call you...

Her voice is DROWNED OUT by REVVING engines.

Ricky rushes to her.

                       RICKY
          Wait, where are they going?

She takes his face in her hands.

                       RAY
          Listen to me. We'll get them back.

                       RICKY
          But why are they leaving?

                       RAY
          Ricky, I'll get them back. I promise,
          honey.

                       RICKY
          That's our house!

He BREAKS AWAY from her and RUNS down the road chasing
after the semis. Ray chases after Ricky until he runs out
of steam and stops, panting.

She catches up to him and tries to hug him. He pushes her
away. She gets down on her knees and takes his face in
her hands.

                       RAY
          We're gonna get it back.

She picks him up and walks back to the trailer. Ricky
looks out mournfully at the trailers disappearing down
the road.

                       RAY (CONT'D)
                 (to T.J.)
          You better hurry or you're going to miss
          the bus. Let's get your clothes on,
          Ricky.

                                                           8.


    T.J. just stares at her.

                           T.J.
              I can get a job you know.

                           RAY
              You're 15, T.J.

                           T.J.
              They won't ask any questions.

                           RAY
              You're finishing school.

                           T.J.
              Come on, you don't think we can live on
              what you make at All for a Dollar do you?

                           RAY
              You're going to school.

    She goes inside.   T.J. follows.

                           T.J.
              I bet I could make more than you do.

    She ignores him.


6   INT. RAY'S TRAILER - DAY                                    6

    Ray helps Ricky into his clothes and puts his backpack on
    his back.

                           RICKY
              Where's daddy?

    Ray and T.J. look at each other.

                           RAY
              He'll be back.

                           T.J.
              Aren't we even gonna look for him?

                           RAY
              No! I'm going to work and you're going to
              school.

                            T.J.
              That's it?

                                                       9.


                       RAY
          The only thing that changed is that your
          dad started gambling again. Everything
          else is the same.

                       RICKY
          Where did he go?

                       RAY
          He had to take a business trip.

T.J. rolls his eyes.

                       T.J.
          Aren't you even gonna look for him?

                       RAY
          And miss a day of work? No. Not again.
          We just have to live our lives. Now go
          get your backpack.

T.J. stares, sullen.

                       RAY (CONT'D)
          Go on!

                       RICKY
          When is daddy coming home?

                       RAY
          I don't know, Ricky.

                       T.J.
          I can't believe you're not even gonna
          look for him.

                       RAY
          Where? Where do I look? (He can't answer)

                       T.J.
          The reservation.

                       RAY
          I told you, he could be in Atlantic City
          by now.

She helps Ricky get his backpack on and gives him a kiss.

                       T.J.
                 (shakes his head)
          The glove compartment. That's so stupid.

                       RAY
          You're going to school.

                                                             10.


    He follows Ricky out the door to catch the school bus
    rolling up out front.

    Suddenly, Ray remembers:

                            RAY (CONT'D)
              Wait, wait.

    They turn around. She digs in her pockets.

                           RAY (CONT'D)
              Here. Lunch money.

    They take it and keep running for the bus.

    Ray looks after them and reaches for her cigarettes. She
    takes out her second to last one. She lights it and takes
    out her mascara.

    She tries to put it on the bathroom mirror, but her tears
    keep getting in the way.

                                                      CUT TO:


7   INT. ALL FOR A DOLLAR STORE - DAY                              7

    RAY stacks shelves with a knock-off version of plastic
    "My Little Pony" in a messy aisle of boxes.

    MATT, 22, her boss, bone thin with bad skin walks by.

                            RAY
                     (soft)
              Matt. Could I talk to you?

    He looks at her.

                           RAY (CONT'D)
              I need to come on full-time.

    Matt blinks with a blank expression then:

                           MATT
              I see you as a short timer.

                           RAY
              What is that?

                           MATT
              A short timer. Not here for long, not
              really committed.

    Ray follows him to the stock room.

                                                             11.


                           RAY
              When I started you said it would be six
              months before I could come on full-time.
              And that was two years ago.

    He opens a can of RED BULL and takes a sip.

                           MATT
              It's my opinion.

                           RAY
              Well, I mean, you know, I do show up.
              Pat's late everyday. She's late now.
              She's always late.


    He stares blankly at her. She can think of nothing else
    to say. He walks out.

    Ray resumes unpacking ponies.

    A moment later PAT, 22, rushes in, looking sorry. As Pat
    hangs up her coat, Ray glimpses a tatoo just above her
    low riding pants with the words "How You Doin'?".

    Ray takes the last of her cigarettes out of the pack and
    heads out the back door.

                           RAY (CONT'D)
              See ya' tomorrow.


8   INT./EXT HORIZON,   ROUTE 37 - DAY                             8

    Ray drives down a two-lane highway. It is empty flat land
    but for a few trailer homes and barns.

    She passes a lonely sign: "BRIDGE TO CANADA."

    Up ahead another sign: "AKWESASNE LAND OF THE MOHAWK."

    From the car, the Reservation consists of shabby houses
    with no siding, tax-free gas stations and dive bars with
    homemade signs. Ray slows a little to check out the
    parking lots scanning for her husband's car.

    Up ahead she sees a sign: "WOLF MART TAX FREE GAS AND
    CIGARETTES.

9   EXT. WOLF MART GAS STATION - DAY                               9

    Ray pulls in to the combo gas station, restaurant and
    mini mart.

                                                      12.


A MOHAWK TEENAGER wearing a bandana RUNS out to the CAR
without a coat, rubbing his hands together to ward off
the cold.

                        MOHAWK TEENAGER
          Fill it up?

She rolls down the window, digging for change under the
seat of her car. She counts it out.

                       RAY
          Just three...uh, no...two seventy one,
          two, three, four.

                       MOHAWK TEENAGER
          Two seventy four.

He nods and goes to the pump. She finds a wadded up five
dollar bill.

                       RAY
                 (yells out window)
          Make that seven seventy four.

She spots a sign for "TRAILWAYS" bus in the window.

                       RAY (CONT'D)
          Did you see a Blue Acclaim come in here
          last night?

                       MOHAWK TEENAGER
          Blue Acclaim...no, but I only worked
          until 9 PM. You can ask inside.

Ray glances inside at the mostly empty restaurant but for
a few older Mohawk women.

                       RAY
          No, that's okay.

                       MOHAWK TEENAGER
          Did you want to support our Mosquito
          Lacrosse League. It teaches basic
          Lacrosse skills to the kids three to
          five.

Ray shakes her head.

                       MOHAWK TEENAGER (CONT'D)
          Thanks, anyway. Have a good day.

                                                              13.


10   INT./EXT. ROUTE 37 INDIAN RESERVATION - DAY                 10

     Ray continues down the highway through the reservation.

     She comes to a huge warehouse, the "MOHAWK BINGO PALACE."

     She glances over at the sea of cars surrounding it. At
     the end of a row she spots it: a BLUE ACCLAIM.

     Ray abruptly turns in.


11   EXT. MOHAWK BINGO PALACE PARKING LOT - DAY                  11

     Ray pulls up alongside the Acclaim and recognizes it by
     the "EASY DOES IT" bumper sticker.

     She gets out and looks inside. There is a small plastic T-
     Rex on the floor of the backseat.

     She leans against the car for a moment.

                            RAY
               Thank you. Oh God, thank you, thank you
               thank you...

     After a moment Ray looks up at the Bingo Palace and heads
     for the entrance.

                            RAY (CONT'D)
               You son of a bitch!


12   INT. BINGO PALACE ENTRANCE -   DAY                          12

     A SHORT, CHUBBY MOHAWK TICKET TAKER in her 60s, with
     piercing blue eyes and missing teeth sits perched on a
     metal chair beside a velvet rope.

                            TICKET TAKER
               Sunrise session is almost over. Next
               session starts at 10:30.

                            RAY
               I just need to look inside.

     Ray starts to walks toward the door and the ticket taker
     sticks out her foot.

                            TICKER TAKER
               It's $5 dollars for admission.

                                                              14.


                            RAY
               I don't want to play, I just need to look
               around for a second.

                            TICKET TAKER
               I'm gonna need the five.

                            RAY
               I'll stand right here at the door. I
               won't even go inside. I just need to see
               if my husband's in there.

                            TICKET TAKER
               You still gotta pay admission.

                            RAY
               He's gambling away the money for our
               house.

                            TICKET TAKER
               What does he look like?

                            RAY
               Long brown hair. Tall. Skinny. Ponytail.

                            TICKET TAKER
               He's not in there.

                            RAY
               Can I just look?

                            TICKET TAKER
               I told you, lady, he's not in there.

     Ray walks away. The ticket taker watches her.


13   EXT. MOHAWK BINGO PALACE, PARKING LOT - DAY                13

     Ray walks out of the front entrance back across the
     parking lot toward the Horizon through rows of cars...

     Across the parking lot, LILA LITTLEWOLF, 20, a Mohawk
     girl with long black hair bursts out of the "Employees
     Entrance" and hurries across the parking lot pulling off
     her scratch card apron as she walks.

     Ray catches sight of her, but before Ray reaches the
     Horizon, Lila reaches the ACCLAIM, GETS IN IT AND BACKS
     OUT.

                            RAY
               Hey!

                                                              15.


     But Lila drives off.

     Ray JUMPS back in the Horizon and TAKES OFF AFTER HER.


14   EXT. RESERVATION ROADS - DAY                                14

     Ray follows the Acclaim down Route 37 and catches sight
     of it turning off on a dirt road.

     Ray makes the corner just in time to catch sight of the
     Acclaim bouncing off on a path through the woods.

     Ray follows it through the woods to a clearing: the
     Acclaim stops in front of a rusted out BUBBLE CAMPER.

     Lila gets out. Ray pulls up behind her and rolls down her
     window.

                            RAY
               That's my car.

     Lila SPINS around.

                            LILA
               Huh?

                            RAY
                      (points to the Acclaim)
               What are you doing with my car?

     Lila fingers the keys in her hand.

                            LILA
               That? I found it.

                            RAY
               You stole it.

                             LILA
               The keys were in it.

                            RAY
               So you just took it...?

     Lila goes in the bubble camper and shuts the door behind
     her.

     Ray gets out of the Horizon and walks up to the camper
     door and takes out her cell phone.

                            RAY (CONT'D)
               We'll just see what the troopers say
               about that.

                                                             16.


                            LILA (O.S.)
                      (From inside camper)
               Go ahead, they got no jurisdiction here.
               This is Mohawk territory.

     Ray stops dialing closes up her phone, then goes to her
     car and takes the gun and goes back to the camper.

                            RAY
                      (knocks with the gun)
               You can cut the bullshit and give me my
               keys now.

     There is no reponse. Ray waits for a moment and then:

                            RAY (CONT'D)
                      (low voice)
               Troy, are you in there?

     There is no response.

                            RAY (CONT'D)
               If you're in there you better come out.


15   INT. LILA'S CAMPER - DAY                                    15

     Lila sits on an army cot in the dingy camper next to a
     lamp on the floor. Her clothes are scattered among empty
     Pringles cans.

                            RAY (O.S.)
                      (tentative, controlled)
               Troy? Versales says as long as we get the
               money in by Christmas we won't lose the
               deposit. (pause) I think we need to talk
               about this, so come on out.(Pause) Troy?
               Troy?


16   EXT. LILA'S CAMPER - DAY                                    16

     Ray aims the gun and FIRES into the camper door.


17   INT. LILA'S CAMPER - DAY                                    17

     The shock of the blast throws Lila off the cot. She looks
     at the SMOKING HOLE.

                            RAY (O.S.)
               I'm not kidding, honey, come on out.

                                                              17.


18   EXT. LILA'S CAMPER - DAY                                   18

     Keeping behind the door for cover, Lila opens it. Ray
     looks inside: there is no sign of Troy.

                               LILA
                         (from behind the door)
                  The Tribal police don't like people
                  shooting holes in other people's houses.

     Ray looks at her.

                               RAY
                  This is New York State so quit the
                  bullshit and give me my damn keys!

     Lila throws the keys out the door. Ray picks them up off
     the ground. Lila shuts the door with her foot.


19   EXT. LILA'S CAMPER - DAY                                   19

     Ray gets in the Horizon and pulls it in behind the
     Acclaim then digs in the trunk, pulling out a rope.

     She ties one end to the Acclaim's back fender and the
     other to the Horizon's front fender.

     Lila watches out the camper window.

     Ray gets in the Acclaim and starts it up slowly TOWING
     the Horizon a few feet before the rope SNAPS.

     Ray gets out and looks at the broken rope. She begins
     digging in the trunk for more rope.

     Lila opens the camper door and looks at the bullet hole.

                               LILA
                  This camper belongs to my brother in law.
                  He won't like this.

                               RAY
                         (over her shoulder)
                  Then you should quit stealing cars.

                               LILA
                  I thought it was abandoned, the guy
                  driving it got on a bus.

     Ray stops.

                               RAY
                  Did you see where the bus was headed?

                                                         18.


                       LILA
          New York or Buffalo, I'm not sure.

Ray RE-TIES the tow line with the remaining rope.

This time the Horizon goes an inch or two before the rope
SNAPS. Ray gets out.

                         RAY
                   (under her breath)
          Shit!

Ray RIFLES through the trunk for more rope.

"Home on the Range" plays on the cell phone in Ray's back
pocket.


Lila touches the bullet hole in the camper and listens to
Ray's conversation from the doorway.

Ray puts the phone back in her pocket and takes an old
belt of her husbands and tries to attach the fenders of
the cars.

Ray gets back in the Acclaim and tries TOWING the Horizon
once again.

This time the right side of the front fender SNAPS OFF
and droops to one side.

Ray gets out and looks at Lila.

                       RAY (CONT'D)
          I'm not leaving this here.

                       LILA
                 (points at the Acclaim)
          I got a friend who might buy that.

                       RAY
          It's not for sale.

                       LILA
          He'll pay more than it's worth.

Ray ignores her.

                       LILA (CONT'D)
          Maybe two thousand.

                         RAY
          Why's that?

                                                           19.


                            LILA
               He's always looking for cars with button-
               release trunks.

     Ray thinks about it.

                            LILA (CONT'D)
               He don't need papers or anything.

                            RAY
               Does he use them to rob banks or
               something?

     Lila shrugs.

                            LILA
               All I know is he pays good for a car like
               this.

                            RAY
               Where does he live?

                            LILA
               Through the woods. Not far.

                            RAY
               What's in it for you?

                            LILA
               He'll give me something for finding it.

                             RAY
               If you try anything, I'm not afraid to
               use this.

                            LILA
               Yeah.


20   INT. ACCLAIM IN RESERVATION WOODS - DAY                 20

     Ray drives with one hand and holds the gun with the
     other. It is pointed at Lila in the passenger seat.

                            LILA
               Turn up there.

                            RAY
               Where?

                            LILA
               Where that stump is.

                                                           20.


     Ray makes the turn with one hand and the car bounces
     through an overgrown path in the woods. Ray reaches the
     stump.

                             RAY
                      (nervous)
               There's no road.

                            LILA
               There's a path.

     Ray hesitates.

                            LILA (CONT'D)
               It's not far.

     Ray turns and drives into deeper woods. The gun jiggles
     around in Ray's hand as they bounce along between the
     trees.

     Lila tries to ignore it.


21   EXT. ACCLAIM AT BOAT RAMP - DAY                            21

     The car emerges from the woods at a BOAT RAMP leading to
     a mile-wide section of the FROZEN ST. LAWRENCE RIVER.


22   INT. ACCLAIM AT BOAT RAMP - DAY                            22

     Ray looks out at the ice. Tire tracks make a path across
     the snow-covered surface between carefully set out CUT
     EVERGREEN TREES.

                            LILA
               Not too fast. There's ruts.

                            RAY
               I'm not crossing that!

                            LILA
               Don't worry they already put out the
               Christmas trees. There's no black ice.

                            RAY
               That's Canada.

                            LILA
               No, it's Mohawk land. The Rez is on both
               sides of the river.

                            RAY
               What about the border patrol?

                                                              21.


                            LILA
               There's no border.

                            RAY
               I'm still not crossing that.

                            LILA
               Don't worry, it'll hold a Plymouth. I've
               seen semis cross it.

     Ray looks at Lila suspiciously.

                            LILA (CONT'D)
               The only other way is the Cornwall bridge
               and they won't let you take that. (points
               at the gun).

     Suddenly, A TRUCK driven by a MOHAWK TEENAGER ROARS out
     of the woods and SWERVES around the Acclaim FISHTAILING
     then SPEEDING out across the ice.

                            LILA (CONT'D)
               They plow it and everything.

     Cautiously, Ray lets off the brake and rolls down the
     boat ramp towards the smooth surface of the river.

                            RAY
                      (under her breath)
               This is so fuckin' stupid.

                            LILA
               Not too fast, there are ruts.



23   EXT. ACCLAIM ON FROZEN RIVER - DAY                          23

     The Acclaim moves across the smooth surface of the river.


24   INT. ACCLAIM ON FROZEN RIVER - DAY                          24

     Ray stares straight ahead clutching the wheel, barely
     breathing. Lila glances at the gun in Ray's hand, then
     out at the river, unfazed.

     They reach the midpoint of the river and pass it
     silently.

                            LILA
               You gotta pick up some speed to get up
               the bank.

                                                              22.


     Ray speeds up. The Acclaim bounces up the steep bank.

                               LILA (CONT'D)
                  It's just on the other side of those
                  trees.


25   EXT./INT. ACCLAIM AT JIMMY'S GARAGE LOT- DAY               25

     Ray and Lila pull into a used-car lot surrounded by a
     chain link fence. There is no sign of life. Ray stops.

                                LILA
                  Honk the horn.

     Ray honks.

     Suddenly, from under a gutted truck, A HUGE BLACK DOG,
     part wolf, SPRINGS onto the hood of the Acclaim.

     Ray is pinned against her seat at the sight of the dog.
     Lila GRABS the gun out of her hand and points it at Ray.

                               LILA (CONT'D)
                  Just keep your mouth shut.

     Ray stares at the snarling dog.

                               LILA (CONT'D)
                  Just keep it shut. Okay?

     Ray nods never taking her eyes off the dog.

     Lila honks the horn again and keeps the gun low and out
     of sight.

     Out of the garage comes JIMMY, 33, a stocky Mohawk,
     eating a sandwich.

     Jimmy looks suspiciously at Ray before he sees Lila.

     Thunder growls.

                               JIMMY
                  Thunder! SHUT UP!.

     The dog GROWLS ferociously at Ray.

                               JIMMY (CONT'D)
                  Get back under there!

     Thunder jumps off the hood and disappears back under the
     trunk.

                                                             23.


     Jimmy walks around to the passenger side of the car. Lila
     rolls down her window.

                             LILA
               Hi, Jimmy.

     Jimmy glances at Ray.

                            JIMMY
               He don't like whites, Lila.


                             LILA
               Sorry.

                            JIMMY
               And your late.

                             LILA
               Sorry.

                            JIMMY
               I shouldn't even be dealing with you.

                            LILA
               I know. Sorry.

     He hands her a paper bag.

     Jimmy goes back to the garage and opens the door. TWO
     YOUNG CHINESE MEN in cheap jogging suits follow him out,
     looking around.


26   INT. ACCLAIM JIMMY'S GARAGE LOT - DAY                       26

     Lila hands the paper bag to Ray and points the gun at
     her, keeping it low and out of sight.

                             LILA
               Count it.

                            RAY
               What's going on here?

                            LILA
               Just count it.

     Ray opens the bag. It's full of cash. All fifties and
     hundreds. Ray counts it.

                            LILA (CONT'D)
               How much is there?

                                                         24.


                       RAY
          Twelve hundred.

Lila opens the glove compartment and presses the trunk
release.

Jimmy motions to the Chinese men to get in the trunk.
Jimmy shuts it.

He taps twice on the hood of the car and walks back to
the garage.

                       LILA
                 (to Ray)
          Let's go.

                       RAY
          Wait, who the fuck are they?

                       LILA
          Just back up.

                       RAY
          I'm not moving until those people get out
          of my trunk.

                       LILA
          I'll give you half. Now let's go.

Jimmy turns around, sees the two women arguing and gets
suspicious.

                       LILA (CONT'D)
          Let's go!

                       RAY
          I'm not taking them over the border.
          That's a crime.

                       LILA
          There's no border here. This is free
          trade between nations.

                       RAY
          This isn't a nation.

Lila jams the gun into Ray's side.

                       LILA
                 (under her breath)
          Let's go.

Jimmy starts back toward the car. Ray puts the car in
REVERSE and backs up.

                                                              25.


27   EXT. ACCLAIM ON FROZEN RIVER - DAY                         27

     The Acclaim drives down the bank onto the frozen river
     and starts across.


28   INT. ACCLAIM ON FROZEN RIVER - DAY                         28

     Ray drives. Lila sits angled toward Ray with the gun
     trained on her.

                            LILA
               Why'd your husband leave you?

                            RAY
               Fuck you.

                            LILA
               Maybe he wanted a younger women.

     Ray stares out at the ice.

                            LILA (CONT'D)
               That's what usually happens.

     Ray says nothing.

                            LILA (CONT'D)
               I never have to worry about that. My
               husband is dead. Went down in the river
               on a run. They never found him. Probably
               tangled in river weeds.

     She gives Ray a spooky look.

                            LILA (CONT'D)
               You better slow down there are ruts out
               here. You could get stuck in one.

     Ray speeds up and roars up the boat ramp off the ice
     skidding a little.


29   EXT. ACCLAIM IN RESERVATION WOODS - DAY                    29

     Ray and Lila bounce through the woods with Lila holding
     the gun, this time.

     They come to a dirt road then to an intersection with
     State Route 37.

     A SIGN READS: "YOU ARE LEAVING AKWESASNE, LAND OF THE
     MOHAWK".

                                                             26.


30   INT. ACCLAIM ON ROUTE 37 - DAY                             30

     Ray slows down at the sign.

                               LILA
               Keep going.

                            RAY
               What if the troopers stop us.

                            LILA
               They won't stop you. You're white.

     Ray keeps going.


31   EXT. ROUTE 37, THE RESERVATION LINE - DAY                  31

     Just beyond the Reservation line, partly hidden behind a
     barn, a NEW YORK STATE TROOPER VEHICLE sits parked.


32   EXT. BOB'S MOTEL, MASSENA, NEW YORK - DAY                  32

     Ray pulls into a 1950s strip motel. A Pakistani man, the
     DEALER, looks out from the motel office.


33   INT. ACCLAIM AT BOB'S MOTEL - DAY                          33

     Ray sees the Dealer hurrying towards them.

                            LILA
               Pull around back then wait for him to
               come to the window.

     Lila keeps the gun low.

     The Dealer approaches cautiously.

                            LILA (CONT'D)
               Roll down your window.

     He walks up slowly and hands her a brown paper bag.

                               LILA (CONT'D)
               Count it.

     Ray opens the bag and counts out the cash, as before.

                            RAY
               Twelve hundred.

                                                             27.


     Lila takes the cash from Ray and pops the trunk release.
     The two Chinese men hurry out. The Dealer ushers them
     into a Garage.

                                 LILA
                  Let's go.


34   INT. ACCLAIM ON ROUTE 37 - DAY                             34

     Ray and Lila return down Route 37 past the sign
     "AKWESASNE, LAND OF THE MOHAWK"

     Lila keeps the gun on Ray.

                               LILA
                  Turn down there.

     Ray looks at the dirt road leading into the woods.

                                 LILA (CONT'D)
                  Stop here.

     Ray stops.

                               LILA (CONT'D)
                  Now open the door.

     Ray hesitates. Lila jams the gun in her side.

                               LILA (CONT'D)
                  Open the door.

     Ray opens the door.

                                 LILA (CONT'D)
                  Now get out.

     Ray doesn't move.

                               RAY
                  You can't have my car.

                                 LILA
                  Get out.

                               RAY
                  You can't have my car.

     Lila tries to push Ray out the driver's door with her
     feet.

     Ray clings to the steering wheel.

                                                              28.


                            RAY (CONT'D)
               No!

     Suddenly, Ray grabs Lila by the hair and pulls her head
     down to the car seat. Lila hits Ray in the head with the
     gun.

                            RAY (CONT'D)
                      (gasps)
               Fuckin' bitch!

     Bleeding and holding Lila's hair, Ray pries the gun out
     of Lila's hand. Lila grabs the sack of money, jumps out
     of the passenger side of the car and takes off into the
     woods.

     Ray chases her, but Lila is faster and gets ahead, then
     disappears into the woods. Ray stops, panting, and wipes
     the blood from her forehead.

                            RAY (CONT'D)
                      (calls after her)
               Little bitch!

     Ray stares after her for a long moment then gets back in
     the Acclaim.


35   EXT. RAY'S TRAILER YARD - DAY                              35

     Ray drives up in the Acclaim.

     T.J., wearing PROTECTIVE GOGGLES, works on the broken
     Duck Kiddie ride with a BLOW TORCH. He doesn't notice
     Ray.

     Ray covers over the cut with her hair and gets out and
     walks up behind him and taps him on the shoulder. He
     jumps and cuts the flame.

                            RAY
               I told you not to use that thing when I'm
               not here.

                            T.J.
               If I get it working I can sell it.

     She looks at the rusted pieces of it.

                            RAY
               I don't care. Don't use that thing when
               I'm not here!

                                                      29.


                       T.J.
          Rentaworld called. They're coming to get
          the TV if you don't pay by four tomorrow.

He notices the car.

                        T.J. (CONT'D)
          Did you find him?

                      RAY
          No.

                       T.J.
          Where was the car?

                       RAY
          At the bus stop on the Rez.

                       T.J.
          I bet he went to Atlantic City.

                       RAY
          You don't know that.

                       T.J.
          Yeah, but you could figure it out. Just
          find out what buses came through last-

                       RAY
          And then what? Chase him across the
          country. Miss work. No.

                       T.J.
          What happened to your face?

                      RAY
          Nothin'.

                       T.J.
          What, did you get in a fight with
          somebody?

                       RAY
          It was no big deal.

                       T.J.
          You got in a fight, for real?

                       RAY
          Some Indian chick tried to steal your
          Dad's car.

                                                            30.


                            T.J.
               No way. I say we go back there and kick
               some Mohawk ass.

                            RAY
               It doesn't matter.

                            T.J.
               Where's your car?

                             RAY
               I'll get it tomorrow.

                            T.J.
               You left it on the rez? That's so stupid.

                            RAY
               I didn't have a tow rope.

                            T.J.
               I still say we go back there and kick
               some Mohawk ass.

                            RAY
               Forget it T.J. Did you and Ricky eat?

                            T.J.
               That would be kinda miraculous since
               there's no food in the house.

                            RAY
               There's food.

                            T.J.
               Popcorn and Tang.

     Ray goes towards the trailer.



36   EXT. MOHAWK USED CAR LOT - NIGHT                         36

     Lila walks in off the road. MIKE, the owner, plays a
     handheld video game.

     She looks around the lot.

                            MIKE
                      (In Mohawk)
               Hi, Lila

                             LILA
                       (In Mohawk)
               Mike.

                                                         31.


She glances at a row of beat used cars.

                       MIKE
          How's life at the Bingo Palace.

                       LILA
          Good. How's business?

                       MIKE
          Oh, you know, okay.

She eyes a Malibu.

                       LILA
          How much for that one?

                       MIKE
          Come on, Lila.

                       LILA
          What?! I've been saving up.

                       MIKE
          You know what.

                       LILA
          Does Bernie Littlewolf run your whole
          life?

                       MIKE
          No, but he said not to sell you a car.

                       LILA
          I gotta walk down 37 with the semis
          kickin' up snow and mud in my hair just
          to get to the work.

                       MIKE
          For you, all I got are two Chevettes,a
          Horizon and a Civic.

                       LILA
          I don't like Chevettes.

                       MIKE
          I figured.

She holds out a wad of cash.

                       LILA
          I'll give you a thousand for the Malibu.

On the windshield of the Malibu in huge white letters:
$750.

                                                           32.


                            MIKE
               Nothing with a trunk.

                            LILA
               That thing has been sittin' here for six
               months.

                            MIKE
               I don't want Bernie in my face. Okay?

                            LILA
               He doesn't have to know.

     Mike rolls his eyes.


37   INT. RAY'S TRAILER - DAY                                37

     Ray wakes up with Ricky staring at her.


                            RICKY
               Mommy, I was thinking. What's gonna
               happen to the tin crapper when we get our
               new house?

                            RAY
                      (half asleep)
               They're gonna flatten it out and send it
               to China.

                            RICKY
               Then what?

                            RAY
               They're gonna melt it down and make
               little toys out if it.

                            RICKY
               Then what?

                            RAY
               They'll send them back here so I can sell
               them at All for a Dollar.

                            RICKY
               And you can buy me some?

                            RAY
               That's right.

                            RICKY
               Yes!

                                                           33.


38   INT. RAY'S TRAILER, KITCHEN - DAY                          38

     Ray puts out a breakfast spread of Microwave popcorn and
     tang.

                            T.J.
               I'm not eatin' that again for dinner.

                            RAY
               We just have to make it to my paycheck on
               Friday.

                            T.J.
               What about Rentacenter?

     She searches through the couch cushions.

                            RAY
               What about them?

                            T.J.
               They said they're coming to get the
               furniture if they don't get a payment by
               4 o'clock.

                            RAY
               You told me that already.

     She finds change and hands it to him.

                            RAY (CONT'D)
               Here, lunch money.

     She gives the rest to Ricky.

                            T.J.
               Look I don't see why you won't just let
               me get a job with Mitch.

                            RAY
                      (to T.J.)
               Who's Mitch.

                            T.J.
               He's got like this whole business he
               runs.

                            RAY
               He sells pot to kids?

                            T.J.
               No, it's computers. He works on
               computers.

                                                              34.


                            RAY
               You're fifteen, it's not gonna happen so
               forget it.

                            T.J.
               That's so stupid. We're gonna lose the TV
               while I'm sitting in some Christmas
               assembly when I could be-

                            RAY
               Your job is looking after your brother.
               Who's gonna take care of him?

                            T.J.
                      (going out the door)
               I still say we should go back to the rez,
               get the Horizon and kick some serious
               butt.

     T.J. goes out the door behind Ricky and slams it in Ray's
     face.

     Ray slips into her jeans and goes to the bathroom mirror
     to put on her mascara. She cakes it on trying to ignore
     the cut over her eye but keeps looking at it. Finally she
     stops and stares at herself.

                                                          CUT TO:



39   EXT. LILA'S CAMPER - DAY                                    39

     Ray pulls up in front of the camper and stops.

     The Horizon is still there and all is quiet.

     Ray gets out holding the gun and a long rope goes to the
     bumper and begins to tie it to the other bumper, looking
     over her shoulder every once in while at the camper.

     Once she has tied the cars together she gets back into
     the Acclaim, but instead of driving off, she just sits
     there.

     After a moment, she gets out with the gun and walks up to
     the camper.

     The bullet hole in the door has a sock stuffed in it.

                            RAY
                      (low tone)
               I want my part.

                                                             35.


40   INT. LILA'S CAMPER - DAY                                    40

     Lila is asleep next to a rattling propane heater.

                            RAY (O.S.)
                      (knocks with the gun)
               You hear me!

     Lila's eyes pop open but she stays perfectly still. Ray
     shakes the door handle.

                            RAY (CONT'D)
               I want my part.

     Lila sits up on her cot and puts on her jacket.


                            RAY (CONT'D)
               I want my part.

                            LILA
               I'll give you the money if you give me
               the car.

                            RAY
               No way.

                            LILA
               The money's gone.

                            RAY
               Then I wanna get some more of those
               Chinese.

     The door opens. Ray steps back holding the gun. They look
     at each other.

                            LILA
               It's gonna cost me to get that hole
               fixed. I froze last night.

     Ray holds up her hair revealing the cut over her eye.

                            RAY
               I just need enough for the balloon
               payment on my doublewide then I'm out of
               this. I'm no criminal.

                            LILA
               It's not a crime.

                            RAY
               You people can call it what you want to.
               I just want my double.

                                                              36.


     They stand staring at each other for a long moment, then
     Ray walks over and unties the rope around the bumpers of
     the Acclaim and the Horizon.

                             LILA
               I don't usually work with whites.

                            RAY
               Suit yourself.

     Ray gets in the driver's side of the Acclaim and starts
     it. After a moment, Lila gets in the passenger side.


41   EXT. ACCLAIM ON FROZEN RIVER - DAY                         41

     Ray and Lila drive across the smooth surface of the
     river. Ray smokes with one hand and holds the gun with
     the other.


                             LILA
               How many bedrooms?

                            RAY
               Three. I got kids.

                            LILA
               How old?

                            RAY
               Five and Fifteen.

                            LILA
               I got a boy. Almost one.

     Ray looks at her.

                            LILA (CONT'D)
               He lives with my mother-in-law. (after a
               moment) She stole him from me.

                            RAY
               Stole him?

                            LILA
               Yeah. Right out of the hospital.

                             RAY
               Stole him?

                                                           37.


                            LILA
               Tribal police don't get involved in stuff
               like that.


     Lila looks out across the river at dusk with no
     expression. The ice looks clean and still.

     Ray picks up speed to climb the river bank.


42   EXT. JIMMY'S GARAGE - DAY                                   42

     Ray and Lila drive up in the Acclaim. Thunder SPRINGS out
     again, caught by his CHAIN just short of the car. Ray
     flinches but keeps hold of the gun.

     Jimmy walks out to meet them. Lila rolls down her window.

                             JIMMY
               Bernie was askin' if I'd seen you. I told
               him no.

                             LILA
               Thanks.

                            JIMMY
               I don't want any trouble with him, Lila.

                            LILA
               Don't worry about it.

     Jimmy's cell phone rings.

                            JIMMY
               This guy's been calling all morning. He's
               got two up at the Old Casino.

                             LILA
               Okay.

     Jimmy takes the call.


43   INT. ACCLAIM AT JIMMY'S GARAGE - DAY                        43

     Lila rolls up the window.

                            RAY
               What's going on?

                            LILA
               We gotta pick them up.

                                                             38.


                              RAY
                        (hesitates)
               Where?

                              LILA
               Not far.

                            RAY
               Where's that?

                            LILA
               An old casino through the woods. They
               used to have gambling there in the
               bootlegger days.




44   EXT. CORNWALL ISLAND WOODS, OLD CASINO -    NIGHT           44

     Ray and Lila bounce through the woods to a collapsed
     building. An old BLACK SUV pulls up from the opposite
     direction, FACING THEM.

     Two MIDDLE-AGED CHINESE MEN, get out of the back. One
     carries an envelope. At the sight of Ray and Lila, he
     stops and says something to the other one.

     Both turn around and head back to the SUV.

     The DRIVER JACQUES BRUNO, a large Quebecois man, wearing
     a full-length fur coat gets out. They argue. He pulls out
     a LONG PISTOL and motions the men to the Acclaim.

                            RAY
               What the hell is he doing?

     Ray reaches for her gun.

                            LILA
               Keep that thing down.

     Bruno walks towards the Acclaim.

                            LILA (CONT'D)
               Roll down the window and see what he
               wants.

                            RAY
               What the hell is going on here?

                            LILA
               Just roll it down.

                                                            39.


     Bruno stands at Ray's window.

     Ray slides the gun under her leg and rolls down the
     window. Bruno hands her a Tim Horton's bag. She takes it.

                            BRUNO
                      (Quebec-French accent)
               D'ey don't like de women driver.

     He hands Ray the envelope of cash.

                            LILA
               Count it.

     Ray nervously COUNTS the money as the Chinese men shiver
     outside.

                            RAY
               Twelve hundred.

     Lila pops the trunk. Bruno and the Chinese men disappear
     around the back of the Acclaim. They hear the trunk
     SHUT.

     Bruno comes back to Ray's window and taps on it.

     Ray looks at Lila.

                            LILA
               Open it.

     Ray rolls down the window again.

                            BRUNO
               D'is will keep d'em from running.

     He hands her men's shoes and dirty socks.

     Ray takes the belongings and ROLLS up the window and
     drives away.


45   INT. ACCLAIM ON FROZEN RIVER -   DAY                        45

     Ray drives across the river. The socks and shoes are
     between them.

                            RAY
               Why would they want to run?

                            LILA
               To get away from the snakeheads.

                                                           40.


                              RAY
               What's that?

                            LILA
               The snakeheads pay to get them here and
               then they gotta work off what they owe .

                            RAY
               How much does it cost?

                            LILA
               Forty, fifty thousand. Depends where
               they're coming from.

                              RAY
               To get here?

                            LILA
               Sometimes they gotta work for years to
               pay it off.

                            RAY
                      (disbelief)
               To get here? No fuckin' way.

     She gets a whiff of the socks.

                            RAY (CONT'D)
               God those are ripe.

     She throws them into the backseat.

                            LILA
               They always stink.


     Two more cars are seen coming toward them on the river.
     They swerve wide to avoid the Acclaim.

     She speeds up to make it up the boat launch.


46   INT. RAY'S TRAILER, KITCHEN - DAY                           46

     Ricky watches cartoons on the big screen TV. T.J. flips
     through the telephone book to the back section: AKWESASNE
     and scans columns of names mostly either "BONAPARTE"
     "LITTLEWOLF" or "THREERIVERS". He chooses a name and
     dials the number.

                            T.J.
               -Hello (in a grown-up voice) Is this Mrs.
               Irene ThreeRivers?
               -Mrs. Bonaparte, I have good news.
                            (MORE)

                                                              41.

                             T.J. (CONT'D)
                -I'm the business manager of Mr. E.F.
                ThreeRivers and I have been authorized to
                inform you that you have inherited money.
                -Are you still there?
                -Wait, I don't WANT any money, I want to
                GIVE you money.
                -That's right. You have inherited money
                from his computer fortune.
                -He was the second richest man next to
                Bill Gates.
                -He left you Twenty-six thousand seven
                hundred and fifty dollars.(pause)
                -TWENTY-SIX THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND
                FIFTY DOLLARS!
                -Oh no, you have no obligation
                whatsoever, Mrs. ThreeRivers, just a
                small processing fee of 29.00 dollars
                will authorize me to send out your first
                payment of thirteen-thousand three
                hundred and seventy five dollars.
                -You can put it on any major credit card.
                (pause) Of course, you can always refuse
                the money.
                -Sure, I can hold.

     T.J. holds his pen poised to write and looks at Ricky
     watching TV, then at the clock. It reads 3:40 PM.


47   EXT.   ACCLAIM ON ROUTE 37 - DAY                            47

     The Acclaim emerges from a dirt road onto State Route 37.

     Up ahead a sign reads: "YOU ARE NOW LEAVING AKWESASNE,
     LAND OF THE MOHAWK". The Acclaim drives past.


48   EXT. ROUTE 37, THE RESERVATION LINE - DAY                   48

     Sitting in his New York State Trooper Vehicle, partly
     hidden behind a billboard, TROOPER MIKE NAPOLI, mid 40s,
     olive-skinned, watches the Acclaim drive by without
     expression.


49   INT. ACCLAIM ON ROUTE 37 - DAY                              49

     Ray notices the vehicle.

                             RAY
                Are they always there?

                                                            42.


                            LILA
               Yeah, but they can't stop you unless you
               give them a reason.

                            RAY
               Have you ever gotten caught?

                            LILA
               Once.

                            RAY
               What happened?

                            LILA
               They gave me the choice of paying a fine
               or spending three months in jail.

                            RAY
               What did you do?

                            LILA
               I paid the fine. I made the money back in
               two nights of smuggling. But back then it
               was cigarettes and everybody did it. Some
               of the troopers were into it, too.

                            RAY
               Smuggling?

                            LILA
               Yeah. But when they lowered the tax on
               cigarettes in Canada most people got out
               of it and the rest switched over to
               Chinese.


50   EXT. BOB'S MOTEL - NIGHT                                 50

     The Acclaim pulls around back. The Pakistani Dealer
     approaches the car and hands Ray a paper bag full of
     cash.


51   INT. ACCLAIM AT BOB'S MOTEL - NIGHT                      51

     Ray takes the money.

                            LILA
               Count it.

                            RAY
               Right, I know.

                                                              43.


                            LILA
               Well, be sure it's right. I don't wanna
               get stiffed.

                            RAY
               Then why don't you count it?

                            LILA
               I got bad eyes.


     She counts it and nods at Lila. Lila POPS the trunk and
     the barefoot Chinese men get out. Ray and Lila look at
     them, they look back, blank and ungrateful.

     Ray rolls down the window and tosses out their shoes and
     socks.

                            RAY
               You're welcome.

     Ray swerves back out onto Route 37.


52   EXT. ROUTE 37 INDIAN RESERVATION - SAME                    52

     They continue down the road to the reservation line.
     After they pass the sign: YOU ARE ENTERING THE LAND OF
     THE MOHAWK, Ray pulls over and stops.

     Ray takes the money and consolidates it into one paper
     bag.

                            LILA
               What about mine?

                            RAY
               We're even now.


     They stare at each other for a second or two, but Ray
     does not take out the gun. Lila reaches for the door
     handle

     Lila gets out. Ray drives away.



53   EXT. RAY'S TRAILER YARD - DAY                              53

     The kitchen clock reads 3:55.

                                                              44.


     A RENTAWORLD truck is parked outside. Two large
     RENTAWORLD MEN sit in it. T.J. sees them from inside the
     trailer. He comes outside.

     He walks up to the trunk. One of the men rolls down the
     window.

                            T.J.
               My mom told me to give you her credit
               card number.

                            RENTACENTER MAN
                      (weary)
               We only take cash or money orders.

                            T.J.
               Well, my Mom might be late.

                            RENTACENTER MAN
               She's got three minutes.

     T.J. goes back inside.


54   INT. RAY'S TRAILER - DAY                                   54

     Ricky is glued to a cartoon. T.J. watches him, checking
     out the window every few seconds for Ray.

     A long moment passes with only the sounds from the
     cartoon.


55   EXT. RAY'S TRAILER YARD - DAY                              55

     The RENTAWORLD men get out of the car and start toward
     the trailer.

     From down the road the Acclaim comes roaring along,
     kicking up dust.

     Ray swerves in and jumps out and runs up to the men.

                            RAY
               It's okay. I got it right here. (she
               waves a wad of fifties and twenties). Two
               fifty five, right?

     The men nod, relieved. Ray counts out the money.

     Ricky bursts out the door and runs towards Ray.

                              RICKY
               Mommy!

                                                           45.


     She catches him in her arms and hugs him. T.J. stands at
     the trailer door, watching as the men drive away.

                            RAY
                      (to Ricky)
               Who wants to go the Price Chopper and get
               some Cap'n Crunch?

                             RICKY
               I DO!

                            RAY
               Wanna to go to the Price Chopper?

     T.J. walks out, looking at the money suspiciously.

                            T.J.
               Where'd you get that?

                            RAY
                      (a beat)
               Matt made me an assistant manager.

                             T.J.
               No way.

                            RAY
               Is that so hard to believe?

                            T.J.
               It's been like two years.

                            RAY
               Exactly, and that's why he gave me a
               bonus.

     He isn't convinced.

                            RAY (CONT'D)
               Do you wanna go to the Price Chopper or
               not?

     T.J. gets in the car.


56   EXT. HOUSE ON POINT - NIGHT                                 56

     Near the river, smoke curls from the chimney of a modest
     house.

     Lila perches in a tree nearby with a can of Pringles
     potato chips dropping every other one on the ground below
     where a huge WHITE DOG, part wolf, takes his share.

                                                              46.


     From the tree Lila looks inside the window of the house
     where:

     A baby boy, "LITTLE JAKE," about a year old, bangs his
     spoon on his high chair tray then throws it down.

     EVELYN LITTLEWOLF, 48, a tall thin Mohawk woman with long
     hair pulled back, picks it up and gives it back to him.

     He throws it again. She knows the game. She gives it
     back, but the third time she holds it just out of his
     reach and laughs at him. He bangs his fists on the tray.

     Lila drinks in the sight.

     Abruptly, the DOOR OPENS and EVELYN leans out.

                            EVELYN
               Chance! Chance, get in here before you
               freeze your ass off.

     The White Dog looks up at Lila who shakes the Pringles
     can upside down to show it's empty.

     Chance goes inside. The door SHUTS behind him.

     Lila stuffs a wad of cash in the can and jumps down from
     the tree. She leaves it near the front door and hurries
     into the woods.

                                                        CUT TO:


57   INT. T.J. AND RICKY'S BEDROOM -   NIGHT                     57

     Ray tucks Ricky into the bottom bunk. The wind whines in
     the loose siding. Ray stuffs a blanket around the window
     to block the draft.


58   INT. RAY'S TRAILER, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                     58

     Ray walks through the kitchen now full of groceries and
     opens a can of Adirondack Cola. The remains of two
     Hungry Man dinners sit on the table.

     She sits down in the living room. T.J. watches the local
     weather.

                                                      47.


                       WEATHER MAN (O.S.)
          Temps will dip tonight and tomorrow.
          Expect a Clipper from Northern Ontario to
          bring 8 to 12 inches of snow and winds
          gusting 25-45 miles an hour making it
          feel like minus 30. Area farmers are
          advised to bring in livestock. More on
          this after a message.

A blaring TV commercial for the "HOT WHEELS TECH TRAX AIR
STUNT CHALLENGE SET" comes on.

                       T.J.
          That's what he wants.

                       RAY
          What?

He points at the TV.

                       T.J.
          For Christmas.

                       RAY
          What is it, again?

                       T.J.
                 (recites it quick)
          Hot Wheels Tech Trax Air Stunt Challenge
          Set.

                       RAY
          -Hot Wheels Tech Trax, what?

                       T.J.
          Air-Stunt-Challenge-Set.

                       RAY
          I got something even better than that.

                       T.J.
          What?

                       RAY
          The double wide. But don't mention it to
          Ricky, just in case.

                       T.J.
          Yeah, "just in case."

                       RAY
          This time is for real.

                                            48.


             T.J.
Is that why you bought Calgon Bath Stuff?

             RAY
Yes it is. We're getting a tub, T.J. It's
gonna happen.

               T.J.
Yeah, right.

             RAY
If you keep that attitude I'll never let
you use it.

             T.J.
Be afraid. Be very afraid. (a moment)
What about Dad?

             RAY
What about him?

             T.J.
What are you gonna do?

             RAY
Why, did he call broke yet?

             T.J.
No, but maybe he would call if you
weren't so bitter.

             RAY
Oh, here we go again with Saint Dad.

             T.J.
That's what I mean. You're always on him.
"Where's your paycheck, do you need a
meeting, give me your receipts."

             RAY
He's an addict, T.J.

              T.J.
You're still bitter.

             RAY
You gotta help Ricky get the tree up
tomorrow after school okay?

             T.J.
Where are you going?

             RAY
Christmas shopping.

                                                           49.


59   INT. RAY'S TRAILER, BEDROOM -   NIGHT                       59

     Ray lays down her bed and checks her cell phone for new
     messages: a little zero blinks at her.

     She listens to her own cell phone message,

                            RAY'S VOICE
               Hi, it's me. leave a message, and maybe
               I'll call ya back.

     It is harsh. She erases it and tries again.

                            RAY
                      (fake cheerful)
               Hi....it's me...leave a message and I'll
               call ya' back.

     She plays it back. It sounds fake. She tries again.

                            RAY (CONT'D)
                      (less cheerful, forced)
               Hey, leave me a message and I'll call ya'
               back. (under her breath) You son of a
               bitch.

     She plays it back. "You son of a..." was recorded.

     She tries again.

                            RAY (CONT'D)
               Hi, it's me. I can't take the call right
               now, but if it's you, Troy, please at
               least tell me you are alive, because the
               boys are worried about you.

     She brings up OLD MESSAGES on her cell phone and listens
     to one.

                            TROY (O.S.)
               Hey, I just got done here. I made two
               hours overtime fixing one of the snow-
               making machines. Pretty cool, huh? I'll
               be home late. I'm gonna catch that
               meeting at 7:30. Love you, bye.

     Ray stares across the room at a pile of Troy's dirty
     flannel shirts. She gets up and picks up the pile to move
     it to the closet, but feels something hard. From a shirt
     pocket she pulls out a stack of used scratch cards.

     She throws the shirts in the closet and reaches for her
     cigarettes.

                                                            50.


     She takes out a glossy picture of her double wide dream
     home, "The Commodore" a gleaming pre-fab structure with
     a landscaped yard and a family with paid-for smiles.

     After a moment she takes the wad of cash out of her
     pocket and begins making stacks of fifties and twenties.


60   EXT. LILA'S CAMPER -   DAY                                  60

     The camper is buried in snow. A shiny SUV pulls up out
     front. BERNIE LITTLEWOLF, 35, burly, well-dressed, Mohawk
     man gets out.

     He yells across the yard

                            BERNIE
               Lila. Get up. I got a job for you!


61   INT. LILA'S CAMPER -   DAY                                  61

     Lila is sound asleep on her cot under three blankets next
     to the propane heater.

     Bernie's snow balls THUMP against the side of the camper.

                            BERNIE (O.S.)
               Lila! Get up.

     Lila opens her eyes and looks out the window, squinting
     at the snow glare.

                            BERNIE (CONT'D)
               They got two people out sick today, so if
               you get down there you got the job.

                             LILA
               Huh?

                               BERNIE
               Get dressed, I got coffee. Let's go!

     He holds up a paper cup.

     She slips on her jeans with a sweatshirt...


62   EXT. LILA'S CAMPER -   DAY                                  62

     Lila forces the door open against the heavy snow and
     steps outside.

                                                          51.


                              LILA
               Where is it?

                            BERNIE
               Get in, I'll tell you on the way.

     She grabs her coat and trudges across the yard.


63   INT. BERNIE'S SUV -    DAY                             63

     Bernie hands her a paper cup of coffee.

                            BERNIE
               Rita said you quit.

                            LILA
               She fired me.

                            BERNIE
               That's not what she said.

                            LILA
               Well, she should have. I can't see to
               count the money. I told you that. I come
               up short half the time.

                            BERNIE
               Then get some glasses.

                            LILA
               They make me carsick.

                            BERNIE
               Gimme a break.

     She sips the coffee.

                            LILA
               So where are we going?

                            BERNIE
               The Tribal Council needs someone to
               answer phones.

                              LILA
               No way!

     She reaches for the door handle.

                            BERNIE
               Why not? You can answer a phone, can't
               you?

                                                             52.


                            LILA
               Not there! Not with them.

     She starts to get out. He notices the Horizon, buried
     under the snow, near the camper.

                            BERNIE
                      (suspicious)
               What's that?

                              LILA
               I bought it.

                              BERNIE
               From who?

                            LILA
               Some white lady.

     He says nothing. Taps his thumbs on the steering wheel,
     suspicious. A long moment passes.

                              LILA (CONT'D)
               What?

                            BERNIE
               What do you need a car for?

                            LILA
               To get to work. So I don't have to walk
               in the breakdown lane. Last week I almost
               got hit by the plow.

                            BERNIE
               You'll live. And you know what I'm
               talking about.

                            LILA
               It doesn't have a trunk.

     He stares at straight ahead.

                            LILA (CONT'D)
               All right, all right! I'll go.



64   INT. ALL FOR A DOLLAR STORE -     DAY                       64

     Ray rings up a counter full of merchandise for a heavyset
     CUSTOMER in her 20s.

                            RAY
               That's $87.50.

                                                              53.


     The customer hands her a credit card.

     Ray processes the credit card. It is declined.

                            RAY (CONT'D)
               Sorry. Didn't go through.

     The customer looks up with exaggerated annoyance.

                            RAY (CONT'D)
                      (in a low voice)
               I can try to put it though again.

     The customer grabs her purse from the basket, and walks
     out the door, leaving the merchandise.

                            CUSTOMER
                      (yells back at Ray)
               You got a problem with your machine,
               lady!

     Ray moves the merchandise aside for the next customer.
     It is Trooper Napoli.

     Ray is startled to see him. He puts down some shaving
     cream and a diet Pepsi.

                            RAY
                      (rings him up)
               That'll be three seventy six.

     He digs in his pocket.

                              TROOPER
               I got exact.

     He counts it out. She hands him his bag and watches him
     walk out.



65   INT. MOHAWK TRIBAL COUNCIL, RECEPTION AREA - DAY           65

     Mohawk paintings and a huge wolf carved out of wood
     decorate the waiting area.

     Nearby is an office marked "GRAND CHIEF"

     A MOHAWK WOMAN walks by the desk and recognizes Lila,
     then looks away, quickly.

     A tall, middle-aged woman, GRAND CHIEF ROSALIE comes out
     of the office and walks up to Lila.

                                                              54.


                            ROSALIE
               Do I have any messages?

     Lila hands her a stack. She takes them and walks away,
     then stops.

                            ROSALIE (CONT'D)
               I can't read this.

     She holds the message out to Lila. Lila tries to read it,
     squinting.

                             LILA
               I think it's a "T.".

                            ROSALIE
               No, I can't read any of it.

                            LILA
               I told Bernie I couldn't see.

     Lila grabs her jean jacket.

                            LILA (CONT'D)
               Nevermind. I'll go.

     She walks out.


66   INT. ACCLAIM AT BUBBLE CAMPER - NIGHT                       66

     Ray pulls up in heavy snow. Lila gets in with a gallon of
     windshield wiper fluid.

                            LILA
               We gotta get extra fluid.

                            RAY
               I gotta get back before KMART closes.

                            LILA
               What for?

                            RAY
               I got nothing for under the tree.


67   INT. WOLF MART GAS STATION RESTAURANT - NIGHT               67

     Ray fills the car with gas.

                                                              55.


     Lila goes inside to get some Pringles. Looking into the
     small restaurant she sees Evelyn Littlewolf, her mother -
     in-law and Little Jake sitting at a table with Grand
     Chief Rosalie.

     She stops dead in her tracks at the sight. They do not
     see her.

     Slowly, she walks up to the table.

     Little Jake notices her first.

     ANGLE: Through the window Ray catches sight of Lila
     standing at the table perfectly still.

     The other women glance up at her then turn away. No one
     speaks.

     Lila walks off with Little Jake still watching her.




68   EXT. FROZEN RIVER - NIGHT                                   68

     Ray and Lila drive across the smooth river surface. Snow
     falls steadily. The windshield wipers SNAP back and
     forth.

     They barely avoid the oncoming headlights of another
     smuggler's car crossing the ice.

                            RAY
               Don't you people even take Christmas Eve
               off?

                            LILA
               Mohawks don't celebrate Christmas.

                            RAY
               You could fool me the way they were all
               lined up at All for a Dollar today.

                            LILA
               Those are Christians. The converted.

                            RAY
               From what?

                            LILA
               From the Longhouse ways.

                                                             56.


                             RAY
                That's awful not to have Santa Claus--
                for the kids, I mean.


69   EXT. RAY'S TRAILER - DAY                                    69

     T.J. dumps the contents of a box containing the pieces of
     an artificial Christmas tree. Branches cover the floor.
     The boys begin putting it together like a puzzle.

     The TV is on. A commercial for the HOT WHEELS TECH TRACK
     AIR STUNT CHALLENGE SET comes on.

     Ricky trains in on it, flinching and jerking his body
     with sound effects at the sight of the flying Hot Wheels
     cars and the booming voice of the announcer.

                             RICKY
                Daddy is gettin' me that for Christmas.

                             T.J.
                What about Santa Claus?

                             RICKY
                He's bringing the new house.



70   INT.   ACCLAIM JIMMY'S GARAGE LOT - NIGHT                   70

     Ray and Lila drive up. Jimmy runs out with his jacket
     pulled over his head. He sees Lila and signals to the
     garage.

     Two figures start toward the car. As they get closer, Ray
     sees a man and a woman. Both Pakistani.

                             RAY
                Wait. They're not Chinese.

                             LILA
                They're "Pakis."

                             RAY
                What does that mean?

                             LILA
                They're from Pakistan.

                             RAY
                Well where's that?

                                                      57.


                       LILA
          I don't know. What difference does it
          make?

                       RAY
          A big difference.

The Pakistani couple stand outside the car, shivering and
holding out the cash. The man carries a heavy duffle bag.

Ray rolls down the car window. The man holds out money to
Ray but she doesn't take it.

                       LILA
          If we wait much longer we won't be able
          to get back across the river.

                       RAY
          Look, I'm not driving just anybody across
          the border.

                       LILA
          Do you want the money or not?

                       RAY
          I wanna know what's in the bag.

Ray looks out the car window and points to the bag
speaking loudly.

                       RAY (CONT'D)
          What's in there?

The man looks at the woman.

                       LILA
          They don't understand you.

                       RAY
          Well, if they want to come over here so
          bad, they ought'a take the time to learn
          English.

Lila pops open the trunk.

                       RAY (CONT'D)
          Just hold on a second.

Ray gets out.

                                                              58.


71   EXT.   ACCLAIM, JIMMY'S GARAGE LOT - NIGHT                  71

     The Pakistani woman crawls into the trunk and the man
     picks up the duffle bag to put it in but Ray takes hold
     of it.

                             RAY
                I'll take that.

     Ray motions him into the trunk and shuts it. Then she
     opens the bag and starts to rifle through it but Lila
     stops her.

                              Lila
                What are you doing?! Just count the money
                and let's go.

     Ray looks down at the bag. Nothing is visible but
     clothes.

                             LILA
                If we keeps snowing like this we won't be
                able to get across the river.

                             RAY
                I just hope these aren't the ones that
                blow up themselves and everybody with
                them.

     Ray zips the bag up and Lila helps her slide it in the
     backseat.


72   INT. ACCLAIM AT JIMMY'S GARAGE LOT - NIGHT                  72

     Ray and Lila get back in the car. Ray starts to count the
     money. Lila takes it back.

                             LILA
                We don't have time.


73   EXT. ACCLAIM ON FROZEN RIVER - NIGHT                        73

     The Acclaim creeps along in heavy snow.


74   INT. ACCLAIM ON FROZEN RIVER - SAME                         74

     Lila struggles to count the money by the light of the
     glove compartment.

                             LILA
                Is that a two or a five?

                                                         59.


                       RAY
                 (glances down)
          A five.

Ray creeps along straining to see out the windshield. The
windshield fluid peters out.

                         RAY (CONT'D)
          Shit!

Lila looks up. Outside is a wall of white.

                       LILA
          You gotta stop so I can fill up the wiper
          fluid.

                       RAY
          I'm not stoppin'.

                       LILA
          It's a hundred feet deep out here if we
          get on black ice

Ray sticks her head out the window but the snow and the
wind are too strong. She stops.

Lila gets out with the wiper fluid. Ray pops the hood.

Ray looks in the backseat at the duffel bag. She
hesitates a moment then reaches into the back and opens
the back passenger door and slides the bag out of the
car.

Lila gets back inside.

                       LILA (CONT'D)
          What are you doing?

                       RAY
          Nuclear power, poison gas,...you can't
          tell what they might have in there. I'm
          not gonna be responsible for that.

Ray tries the windshield wipers. Fluid clears the
windshield.

Ray dials her cell phone with one hand.

                       RAY (CONT'D)
          -Hi, I'm gonna be a little late.(pause)
          -I have to work. Is Ricky asleep?
          -Put him on. (pause)
          -Ricky listen to me, he's not coming
          until you go to sleep. (pause)
                       (MORE)

                                                              60.

                            RAY (CONT'D)
               -No. Not yet. He's still flyin' over
               Canada okay? He's not even done with
               Canada yet, so he's not coming until you
               get to sleep. Now put your brother on.
               -I'll be home in a little while, okay?
               -No, I haven't got it,yet. What's it
               called again?
               -Hot Wheels Tech Trax Air Stunt whatever,
               right, right, I'll get it if I can!
               -I can't promise T.J.
               -There are more important things to get
               for Christmas this year. Be home in a
               little while. Okay, bye.

                            RAY (CONT'D)
                      (to Lila)
               You'd think a new house would be enough.

     Ray guns it up the boat launch to the shore.


75   INT. RAY'S TRAILER -   NIGHT                               75

     In the living room, the artificial Christmas tree is up.
     The TV is on and Ricky is untangling a ball of red
     Christmas lights.

                            T.J.
                      (dials the phone)
               -Hi, is Mitch there? (a long pause)

     The microwave dings. Holding the phone, T.J. takes out
     two Hungry Man dinners and sets them on the table.

                            T.J. (CONT'D)
               -Hi Mitch. It's T.J. No, T.J. from
               school. Yeah, man. Right. Uh, I was
               wondering if you still needed those
               numbers we were talking about `cause I
               got one.
               -How much?
               -Cool, but the thing is I don't really
               have any wheels at the moment.
               -On Moira road off 37.
               -Yeah, but there's one more thing...(he
               whispers into the phone inaudibly)...no
               the air stunt challenge set.
               -Yeah, exactly. Yeah, man. Thanks a lot.
               Bye.

     He hangs up and puts the dinners on the table.

                                                              61.


                            T.J. (CONT'D)
                      (to Ricky)
               Ricky, time to eat.

     T.J. turns around. Ricky has wrapped himself in Christmas
     lights from head to toe, by slowly revolving while
     holding the strings.

                            RICKY
               Hey T.J., watch this!

     He plugs in the lights and they turn on.

                            T.J.
               Yeah, that's pretty cool. But it's gonna
               hurt when you sit down.

     Ricky giggles.

                            T.J. (CONT'D)
               Now unwrap yourself, it's dinner time.


76   EXT. BOB'S MOTEL -   NIGHT                                  76

     Ray and Lila drive to the back of Bob's. The Dealer
     hurries out to meet them.


77   INT. ACCLAIM AT BOB'S MOTEL - NIGHT                         77

     He hands Ray a wad of cash. She counts it, then nods to
     Lila who pops the trunk.


78   EXT. ACCLAIM AT BOB'S MOTEL -   NIGHT                       78

     The Pakistani man and woman hurry out of the trunk,
     looking around, and rush to the passenger door of the
     Acclaim, speaking frantically to each other.

     The Dealer tries to hustle them to the garage, but they
     won't be moved.

     Ray starts to back out, but the Dealer knocks on their
     window. Ray rolls it down.

                            DEALER
                      (heavy accent)
               They say there's a bag.

                            RAY
               It was too heavy. We had to unload it.

                                                            62.


     The Dealer tells the woman in Urdu. She becomes
     HYSTERICAL. She grabs Ray through the window and the
     dealer pulls her off.

                            RAY (CONT'D)
               What's the matter with her!?

                            DEALER
               She had something in the bag.

     The woman continues screaming in Urdu.

                            RAY
               What is she saying!?

     He speaks to her in Urdu.

                            DEALER
               She says her baby. Her baby was in the
               bag.

     The Dealer and the man hurry the wailing Pakistani woman
     into the garage.



79   INT. ACCLAIM ON ROUTE 37 -    NIGHT                        79

     Lila and Ray pull back onto Route 37 and drive along in
     stunned silence.

                             RAY
               It didn't feel like there was anything in
               that bag.

                            LILA
               We gotta go back.

                             RAY
               I can't believe they put their baby in a
               duffle bag.

                            LILA
               I can't believe you left it out there.

                            RAY
               If you'd let me search it I would never
               have taken it-

                            LILA
               We gotta go back.

                            RAY
               I know! I know that.

                                                              63.


     Ray speeds along.



80   INT. ROUTE 37, THE RESERVATION LINE - NIGHT                 80

     Partly hidden, behind a barn, Trooper Mike Napoli watches
     the cars pass on Route 37, leaving the Reservation. The
     Acclaim passes.


81   INT. RAY'S TRAILER - NIGHT                                  81

     The trailer is aglow in Christmas lights. Ricky has
     fallen asleep on the couch.

     A car horn blows outside. T.J. runs outside.


82   EXT. RAY'S TRAILER - SAME                                   82

     A beat up car is there. Inside a teenager, MITCH, a few
     years older than T.J., hands him out a Hot Wheels Tech
     Track Air Stunt Challenge Set.

                            MITCH
               That's what you wanted, right?

                            T.J.
               Close enough.

     T.J. gives Mitch a piece of paper with a list of names
     and credit card numbers including that of Irene
     ThreeRivers.

                            MITCH
               Thanks Man, Have a Merry One.

     T.J turns to go back inside. He sees SMOKE RISING through
     the cracks in the siding and goes to the back.

     BLACK SMOKE POURS from under the trailer where old
     insulation is smoldering. T.J. runs to the shed, takes a
     fire extinguisher and sprays under the trailer. Steam
     rises. The fire appears to be out.


83   INT. RAY'S TRAILER   - NIGHT                                83

     T.J. comes back in. Smoke filters up though the cracks in
     the linoleum floor. He covers Ricky with extra blankets
     and opens the windows.

                                                             64.


84   EXT. FROZEN RIVER - NIGHT                                   84

     Ray and Lila drive down the boat launch to the river. The
     storm has stopped and the river is an endless white
     surface.


85   INT. ACCLAIM ON FROZEN RIVER - NIGHT                        85

     Ray and Lila creep along.

                            LILA
               Look, there. Tracks.

                              RAY
                        (squints)
               Where?

                              LILA
               Up there.

     Ray speeds up. Faint tire tracks appear in the distance.

                            LILA (CONT'D)
               Slow down, I don't want to run over it.
               Stop. I think it was here.

     Ray stops the car. Lila gets out. Ray puts her jacket
     over her head and follows.

     Ray's cell phone plays "Old MacDonald" on the seat of the
     Acclaim.


86   INT. RAY'S TRAILER - NIGHT                                  86

     Wearing his coat in the trailer, with the windows and
     door open, T.J. dials the phone. He gets Ray's cell
     phone.

                            RAY'S VOICE
                      (faintly heard though the
                       phone)
               Hi, it's me. I can't take the call right
               now, but if it's you, Troy, please at
               least tell me you're alive, because the
               boys are worried about you.

     He doesn't leave a message.

     Ricky snores on the couch covered in a pile of blankets.

                                                             65.


87   EXT. FROZEN RIVER - NIGHT                                   87

     Lila runs ahead. Ray struggles to keep Lila in sight.

     Ray comes up behind Lila, rifling through THE UNZIPPED
     DUFFEL BAG. She suddenly jumps back at the sight of the
     tiny face of an infant, wrapped in blankets, eyes closed,
     lips blue.

                              LILA
               It's dead.

     Ray looks at the baby. Instinctively, she swoops down and
     gathers it up.

     Ray heads for the car.

                              RAY
               Come on!

     Lila follows her.


88   INT. ACCLAIM ON FROZEN RIVER - NIGHT                        88

     Ray gets in the car and sets the bundle down on the seat,
     unwraps it from layers of swaddling and begins taking off
     it's clothes. It is a boy.

     She tries to resuscitate him, but there is no response.

                              LILA
               It's dead.

     Ray keeps giving it air. There is no response but she
     keeps at it. Then, between breaths:

                            RAY
               Tap the bottom of his feet.

                              LILA
               Why?

                            RAY
               That's what they did to get Ricky
               breathing when he was born.

     Ray puts the baby on Lila's lap. She pulls away.

                            LILA
               I don't want to touch it.

                            RAY
               Well, I can't hold it and drive.

                                                              66.


     Ray cranks the heater and aims the vents at the baby.
     Lila stares down at the baby in her lap, not touching it.

                            LILA
               I don't think it matters.

                            RAY
               At least put him next to your body. That
               will warm him up.

                            LILA
               But it's too late.

                            RAY
               Just do it! We can't give it back to her
               cold.


89   INT. RAY'S TRAILER - NIGHT                                  89

     T.J. closes the windows and puts a package of microwave
     popcorn in the microwave and turns it on. He watches it
     begin to smoke, then pops open the microwave and takes
     the smoking bag from room to room to hide the smell of
     burnt insulation with burnt popcorn.


90   EXT. ROUTE 37, THE RESERVATION LINE - NIGHT                 90

     Ray pulls out onto Route 37 and passes the reservation
     line: "You are now leaving the land of the Mohawk"

     Trooper Napoli watches the Acclaim pass again. This time
     he pulls out behind it.


91   INT. ACCLAIM ON ROUTE 37 - NIGHT                            91

     Ray notices the cruiser following her.

                            RAY
               Shit!

     Lila looks back.

                            LILA
               Calm down.

     Lila quickly pulls the baby near and wraps him inside her
     coat hiding him from sight.

     The DOME LIGHTS START FLASHING.

                                                             67.


                            RAY
               Oh shit. What do I do?

                            LILA
               Calm down. Just pull over.

                            RAY
               What if he saw us go by before. To Bob's.

                            LILA
               He's got no reason to stop us, unless you
               give him one, so keep your mouth shut.

                            RAY
               What if he searches the car. What do we
               say about-

                            LILA
               He won't, just remember you're white.

     Ray pushes the blankets onto the floor and kicks them
     under the seat.


92   EXT. ACCLAIM ON ROUTE 37 - NIGHT                            92

     Ray pulls into the breakdown lane and the trooper pulls
     in behind her.


93   INT. ACCLAIM ON ROUTE 37 - NIGHT                            93

     In Ray's rear view mirror, Trooper Napoli gets out of the
     cruiser. He puts on his hat and walks toward the car.

     Ray rolls down her window.

                             TROOPER NAPOLI
               License and registration?

     Ray hands them over. He examines them, then leans down to
     the window.

                            TROOPER NAPOLI (CONT'D)
               Could you step out of the vehicle, ma'am.

                            RAY
                      (fakely nice)
               I wasn't speeding, was I?

                            TROOPER NAPOLI
               Just step out of the car.

                                                           68.


                            RAY
               Did I do something?

                            TROOPER NAPOLI
                      (suspicious)
               Ma'am I'm just directing you to step out
               of the vehicle?

                              RAY
               Okay.

     She gets out of the car reluctantly. He looks in at Lila,
     she keeps her head down.

                            TROOPER NAPOLI
               Step around to the back of the vehicle.

     He follows Ray to the back of the Acclaim.


94   EXT. ACCLAIM ON ROUTE 37, BREAKDOWN LANE - NIGHT            94

     He points at the trunk. Ray stares at it, afraid to
     speak.

                              TROOPER NAPOLI
               See that.

     Ray stares at the back of the car, afraid to speak.

                            TROOPER NAPOLI (CONT'D)
               Your left rear parking light is not
               illuminated.

     Ray notices the light.

                            RAY
               Oh, I didn't know.

     He takes out his pad and pen.

                             TROOPER NAPOLI (CONT'D)
               I'm gonna give you a provisional
               citation. Get this repaired in the next
               48 hours and you'll have no problem.

                              RAY (CONT'D)
               Thanks.

                             TROOPER NAPOLI
                      (he looks into the car)
               Who's your friend?

                                                              69.


                            RAY
               She looks after my kids when I have to
               work late.

     Ray gets back in the car. He shuts the door behind her
     and gives Lila a friendly nod.

                             TROOPER NAPOLI
               Have an enjoyable Holiday.

                            RAY
               Yeah, you, too.

     She rolls up her window.


95   INT. ACCLAIM ON ROUTE 37, BREAKDOWN LANE - NIGHT            95

     In her rear view, Ray watches him get in his vehicle, u-
     turn and drive out of sight in the opposite direction.

                             LILA
                      (nervous)
               What did he want?

                            RAY
               Just a blown out tail light.

                            LILA
               That's it?

                            RAY
               Yeah.


96   INT. RAY'S TRAILER - NIGHT                                  96

     T.J. looks at the clock. It's after midnight. He leads
     Ricky, half asleep into his room and tucks him in bed.
     Then he takes out the Hot Wheels Box and puts it under
     the tree.


97   INT./EXT. ACCLAIM AT BOB'S MOTEL - NIGHT                    97

     Ray and Lila pull in to the motel but there is no sign of
     life.

     Ray gathers up the blankets. Lila sits motionless.

                            RAY
               We gotta take it in.

     Lila sits absolutely still.

                                                              70.


                               RAY (CONT'D)
               What is it?

                               LILA
               It's moving.

                            RAY
               What? Are you sure?

     Lila slowly takes the baby from inside her jacket.   His
     eyes open. He blinks. Ray and Lila stare at him.

                            LILA
               Hello little baby.

     The baby looks back at them.

                            RAY
               He was just cold.

     Ray and Lila wrap him up in the blankets and get out with
     Lila carrying the bundle and walk into the motel office.


98   INT. BOB'S MOTEL - SAME                                     98

     Ray and Lila look around the shabby motel office circa
     1950s with a few threadbare chairs. No one is at the
     front desk.

     Ray ventures behind the desk and knocks on a small door.
     She carefully opens it to a small office with a desk,
     cluttered with papers and, beyond it, another door. Ray
     knocks and opens it to:

     A living room hung with heavy red Pakistani fabrics and
     lights. The dealer and the Pakistani man study a map of
     New York State spread out on the table.

     Behind them the Pakistani woman sits on the couch.

     Ray comes in, followed by Lila carrying the baby.

                            RAY
               We found him.

     The Pakistani woman looks up, sees the bundle and hurries
     across the room to Lila. Lila holds out the baby with a
     little smile and the Pakistani woman snatches it out of
     her arms.

     The Pakistani women pulls back the blanket and sees the
     baby -- alive. She sinks to her knees letting out a
     wail.

                                                               71.


      Lila's eyes fill with tears. Ray chokes back her own.

                             RAY (CONT'D)
                       (to Lila)
                Come on. Let's go.

      Lila follows Ray out, looking over her shoulder at the
      baby.


99    INT. ACCLAIM ON ROUTE 37 -      NIGHT                      99

      Lila and Ray drive away.

                               LILA
                He was dead.

                             RAY
                He was just cold.

                               LILA
                He was dead.

                             RAY
                Okay, whatever, you brought him back to
                life.

                             LILA
                That was the Great Spirit, not me.

                             RAY
                All I know is Kmart is closed and I got
                nothing for under the tree.

      Lila looks at Ray.

                               RAY (CONT'D)
                What?

      Lila says nothing.


                             RAY (CONT'D)
                Look, I don't have time for that. I can't
                get deep about every little thing. I just
                have to keep on going. I only need one
                more run to have enough for my double.



100   INT. ACCLAIM AT LILA'S CAMPER -     NIGHT                  100

      Ray and Lila pull up in front of Lila's camper and stop.
      Ray divides the money.

                                                             72.


                               RAY
                Here.

      Lila takes the money and starts to get out.

                             RAY (CONT'D)
                Merry Christmas or whatever.

                               LILA
                Yeah.


      Lila gets out and goes inside.


101   EXT. RAY'S TRAILER - NIGHT                              101

      Ray drives up. The trailer is covered in Christmas
      lights.


102   INT. RAY'S TRAILER, KITCHEN - NIGHT                     102

      Ray comes in. The box containing the Hot Wheels Tech
      Track Air Stunt Challenge set is under the tree.

                               RAY
                What's that?

                               T.J.
                Hot Wheels.

      She is suspicious.

                             RAY
                Where'd you get it?

                             T.J.
                I called a friend.

                             RAY
                Mitch? Is that the friend you called?
                It's probably stolen, you know.

                               T.J.
                No, its not.

                             RAY
                Well, I don't want you hanging around
                him. That kid is bad news.

                             T.J.
                It's not like you were gonna get it.

                                                            73.


                             RAY
                Look , Mister, I got more important
                things to worry about than toys. I'm
                trying to get our doublewide.

                             T.J.
                Oh, yeah. I forgot.

                             RAY
                Hey, you can lose the attitude. Anyway,
                Kmart was closed by the time I got off
                work.

      He gives her a sideways glance.

                             RAY (CONT'D)
                What's that smell?

                             T.J.
                Popcorn.

                             RAY
                I told you to be careful with the
                microwave, didn't I?

                             T.J.
                Sorry.


103   INT./EXT. LILA'S CAMPER - NIGHT                            103

      A heavy THUD as something hits the side of Lila's camper.

                             LILA
                Bernie!

      She opens the door, but no one is there. At her feet she
      sees a Pringles can. In it: the cash she left at her
      mother-in-law's house for her son.

      She looks towards the woods but there is no sign of
      anyone. She shuts the door.

      Inside she digs through an old box of junk and pulls out
      a 2 foot long oval shaped wooden board, an infant board,
      and a blanket. She wraps her pillow in the blanket around
      the board in the Mohawk tradition and picks it up.

      She tries it on her back, then leans it against the wall,
      then hangs it on a hook on the wall.

                                                              74.


104   INT. RAY'S TRAILER, KITCHEN - DAY                         104

      Christmas Morning. Ray stands at the stove in her
      bathrobe making pancakes. T.J. helps Ricky set up his new
      Hot Wheels Set.

      A Knock at the door.

      Another knock.

                               RICKY
                Daddy?

      Ricky runs to the door and opens it, then backs away.
      Trooper Napoli is there.

                             TROOPER NAPOLI
                Is there a Ray Eddy here?

      Ray comes to the door.

                               RAY
                Yes.

                             TROOPER NAPOLI
                Can I speak to you outside for a minute.

                             RAY
                I haven't gotten the light fixed-

                             TROOPER NAPOLI
                It's not about that. I just have a few
                questions.

                               RAY
                Sure.


105   EXT. RAY'S TRAILER YARD - DAY                             105

      Ray slips on her boots, grabs her jacket around her and
      steps outside the trailer door.


                             TROOPER NAPOLI
                This is about the woman who was with you.

                               RAY
                Yes.

                             TROOPER NAPOLI
                How long have you known her?

                                                      75.


                       RAY
          Not too long. She looks after my kids.

                       TROOPER NAPOLI
          She's a smuggler.

                        RAY
          Really?

                        TROOPER NAPOLI
          Yes.

                       RAY
          Wow. That's a shock.

                       TROOPER NAPOLI
          Yes, well, there is that element on the
          Reservation I'm sure you know.

                       RAY
          Yeah, I've heard about it but I didn't
          know she was involved.

                       TROOPER NAPOLI
          How did you happen to meet her?

                        RAY
          Uh, I think there was a sign for a baby
          sitter at the Wolf Mart. That's where I
          get my gas.

                       TROOPER NAPOLI
          I just thought you should be aware of
          that. She's known to have smuggled
          illegal immigrants into the country.

                        RAY
          Oh my God.

He nods his head.

                       TROOPER NAPOLI
          If I were you I'd find a new baby sitter.
          You don't want her around young kids.

                        RAY
          Absolutely.

He eyes the side of the trailer where smoke stained
siding is visible.

                       TROOPER NAPOLI
          Well, you have an enjoyable Holiday.

                                                               76.


                             RAY
                Thanks. You, too.

      Ray stands and watches the trooper drive away. She feels
      in the pocket of her bathrobe for her cigarettes and
      fumbles to light one, sucking on it, unaware of the cold.

      When she turns around she looks at the trailer and
      notices the smoke-stained siding on one end of it.


106   INT. RAY'S TRAILER - DAY                                  106

      T.J. listens at the door. Ricky looks up.

                             RICKY
                Why is the police man here?

                                T.J.
                Shh.

      From outside the door:

                             RAY (O.S.)
                T.J. could you come out here for a
                minute.

      T.J. goes outside.


107   EXT. TRAILER YARD - DAY                                   107

      Ray stands staring at T.J. at the trailer's burnt end.

                              T.J.
                What did he want? Did something happen to
                Dad?

                                RAY
                No.

                             T.J.
                Then what did he want?

      She points to the blackened siding on the trailer.

                             RAY
                Did you have a fire last night?

                             T.J.
                The pipes froze so I fixed `um.

                             RAY
                You fixed um?

                                                      77.


                         T.J.
          Yeah.

                       RAY
          Did you happen to use the blow torch?

She walks around back and looks underneath the trailer: a
mass of charred and melted insulation.

                       RAY (CONT'D)
          Look at this. We can't live here anymore!

                       T.J.
          It's just a tin crapper.

                       RAY
          No, it was our house.

                       T.J.
          So, we're gettin' a new one, right?

                       RAY
          Jesus, you could have killed yourself and
          your brother.

She grabs the blowtorch and slams it to the ground, but
it is indestructible.

                       T.J.
          It's not yours, he gave it to me.

She goes to the car, takes out her gun then puts the blow
torch on the ground and aims at it -- but T.J. grabs it.

                         RAY
          Put it down.

                         T.J.
          No!

                         RAY
          Put it down.

                       T.J.
          Are you gonna shoot me now, too?

                       RAY
          Put that thing down!

He ignites the blow torch to spite her.

                       T.J.
          Maybe he didn't like gettin' shot in his
          own house. Maybe that's why he left.

                                                         78.


                       RAY
          That was an accident.

                       T.J.
          Some accident you shot him in the foot.

                       RAY
          He spent the food money on scratch cards,
          T.J.

                       T.J.
          So, he'd done it before.

He aims it at her. She walks towards him. He increases
the flame.

                       RAY
          Gimme that thing.

She tries to grab it out of his hand, but he is too
strong.

                       RAY (CONT'D)
          T.J. come on now.

                       T.J.
          You can't have it. It's mine.

His eyes fill with tears, but his face stays tight.

She grabs at it again, but he jerks it away. She pauses
and stares at him.

                       RAY
          He was clean for 23 months.

They look at one another.

                       RAY (CONT'D)
                 (chokes back tears)
          I didn't know how else to keep us
          together. I mean...he's a good dad when
          he's not gamblin'.

He cuts off the blow torch.

                       T.J.
          Yeah, awesome dad. Robs us and takes off
          a week before Christmas.

She walks up to him and wipes a tear from the side of his
face. He shakes it off.

                                                               79.


      They stand in the cold air for a long moment their breath
      visible. She touches his hair.

                               RAY
                I know.


                                                           CUT TO:


108   EXT. BUBBLE CAMPER - NIGHT                                 108

      Ray drives up in the Acclaim. Lila and the Horizon are
      gone.

      Ray gets out and looks around but there is no sign of
      her.


109   EXT. PARKING LOT, MOHAWK BINGO PALACE -                    109

      Ray slowly cruises the lot looking for the Horizon.

      She spots it in the distance behind the Bingo palace next
      to a dumpster.

      Ray parks and goes inside.


110   EXT. MOHAWK BINGO PALACE ENTRANCE - NIGHT                  110

      The short chubby toothless Mohawk ticket taker perched on
      a metal stool beside a velvet rope.

      Ray sees her and begins to dig in her jeans for a five.
      The ticket taker looks her up and down, expressionless.

      Ray hands over the money. The ticket taker just looks at
      her.

                             TICKET TAKER
                The game's over. They're verifying the
                last winner.

                             RAY
                That's okay. I still wanna buy a ticket.

                             TICKET TAKER
                I can't sell you one.

                               RAY
                I got money.

                                                               80.


                             TICKET TAKER
                Sorry.

                             RAY
                I just want to buy some scratch cards.

                             TICKET TAKER
                Go to Wolf Mart, they sell `um there.


      Ray walks away. The ticket taker watches her.


111   EXT. MOHAWK BINGO PALACE, PARKING LOT -    DAY             111

      Ray slumps down in the driver's seat of the Acclaim
      waiting for Lila to come out. She is parked a few cars
      away from the Horizon.

      Other bingo players come out and get in cars surrounding
      Ray.

      Mohawks employees, including Lila come out of the
      "Employees Entrance". She starts toward Horizon. She
      wears new glasses.

      Catching sight of Ray in the Acclaim, she abruptly turns
      and starts walking in the opposite direction.

      Ray pulls out and drives over following her in the
      Acclaim.

                             LILA
                I quit smuggling.

                             RAY
                       (rolls down the window)
                T.J. set the trailer on fire.

      Lila keeps walking. Ray drives along beside her.

                             RAY (CONT'D)
                He didn't mean to, but the pipes froze
                and he got that damn torch out -- which I
                told him not to do touch when I wasn't
                there -- and he tried to thaw them out-

                             LILA
                I got glasses and now I can see up close.

                             RAY
                There's a hole in my bedroom floor. We
                gotta move.

                                                      81.


Lila keeps walking.

                        RAY (CONT'D)
          I just need one more run to get the
          double.

Lila keeps walking.

                       RAY (CONT'D)
          Look you can have the Acclaim. Okay?

Lila keeps walking.

                       LILA
          I don't want it.

                       RAY
          What is it then?!

Lila keeps walking.

                         RAY (CONT'D)
          Are you still mad about that baby? `Cause
          it wasn't all my fault, ya' know. I mean
          who puts their kid in a duffle bag?

Lila keeps walking. Ray follows trying to figure her out.

                       RAY (CONT'D)
          You're gonna need a lot of money to take
          care of a one year old baby.

                       LILA
          I got enough.

                       RAY
          Yeah, but you gotta get him first.

Lila stops dead in her tracks and looks at Ray.

                       RAY (CONT'D)
          I'll help you. You can even borrow my
          gun.


Lila looks around to see if anyone is watching and gets
in the Acclaim with Ray.

ANGLE FROM BINGO PALACE ENTRANCE: The Ticket Taker
watches the Acclaim drive away.

                                                              82.


112   EXT. ACCLAIM, VERSAILLES MOBILE HOME LOT - NIGHT           112

      Ray and Lila pull up outside the model double wide home.


113   INT. ACCLAIM. VERSAILLES MOBILE HOME LOT - SAME            113

      Ray and Lila look at it.


                             RAY
                You should see the inside.

                             LILA
                How many bedrooms?

                             RAY
                Three. And it's got a jacuzzi tub in the
                master bathroom.

                             LILA
                Wall to wall carpet?

                             RAY
                Oh yeah. But the best thing is the
                insulation. The pipes can never freeze.

      Ray gets out.

                             RAY (CONT'D)
                I'll be back.

      She disappears into the Office.

      Lila looks at the house.


114   INT. OFFICE, VERSAILLES MOBILE HOME LOT - NIGHT            114

      Ray comes in on Guy Versailles giving a young couple the
      hard sell.

                             VERSAILLES
                ...what I think you'll find with the
                Commodore -- and you'll be the judge --
                is that the vinyl wall covering is
                perfect for small children. There is
                never a need to repaint or even touch up-

                             RAY
                I wanna schedule a delivery.

      Versailles looks up, annoyed. He plasters on a smile.

                                                               83.


                              VERSAILLES
                        (to the couple)
                 Give me just a second.

      He tries to take Ray aside.

                              VERSAILLES (CONT'D)
                 What do you want?

      She pulls a huge wad of cash from her jacket pocket.

                              VERSAILLES (CONT'D)
                 Is this all of it?

                              RAY
                 It's three thousand but I want it
                 delivered tomorrow.

                              VERSAILLES
                 I told you all or nothing.

      She holds out the cash. The couple tries not to watch.

                              RAY
                 Take it as a deposit. All you have to do
                 is show up. If I don't have the rest you
                 keep it.

                              VERSAILLES
                 Can't argue with that. You'll have to
                 sign something, though.

      He takes out a contract and writes in the deposit amount
      as thirteen hundred seventy two dollars owing.

      Ray signs the paper.

                                                            CUT TO:


115   INT.   ACCLAIM ON FROZEN RIVER - NIGHT                     115

      Ray drives down the boat launch and starts across. The
      sky is clear and the moon shines down on the white river
      surface.

      Downstream patches of the river have thawed and water
      flows is visible.

      There is only the sound of the wheels on the smooth ice
      surface.


                                                            CUT TO:

                                                             84.


116   EXT. JIMMY'S GARAGE, RIVER'S EDGE -   NIGHT                116

      Jimmy's is dark. Ray and Lila sit a minute. Then:

                             LILA
                Blow the horn.

      Ray honks the horn.

      A light comes on. Jimmy runs outside in a t-shirt. Lila
      rolls down the window.

                             JIMMY
                Heat wave!

                             LILA
                You got a run for us, Jimmy?

                             JIMMY
                       (shakes his head)
                It's pretty slow after Christmas. Unless
                you wanna to go off the Rez, there's a
                guy up in Montreal who's usually got
                heads.

                             LILA
                How far?

                             JIMMY
                Twenty miles or so. But...you gotta watch
                out for the Mounties and the Surete.
                and...this guy deals in ya' know girls.


117   EXT./INT. ACCLAIM, QUEBEC HIGHWAY     -   SAME             117

      Ray and Lila drive down a Quebec highway. The road signs
      are in French.

      The skyline of Montreal is an orange glow in the far
      distance.

                             RAY
                Have you ever been there?

                             LILA
                A few times. Have you?

                             RAY
                No, Troy didn't like to travel. He liked
                to work in his shed, mostly.

                                                               85.


      Ray and Lila drive down a commercial strip of shopping
      centers, fast food joints and strip clubs, with French
      names.

                             LILA
                Up there. That's it.

                             RAY
                Can't miss that.

118   EXT. LE CLUB SUPER SEXE - SAME                             118

      Ray pulls in at a giant neon silhouette of a naked woman.

      They drive around back and get out. THROBBING DISCO music
      is heard from inside a door marked "Prive."


119   INT. CLUB SUPER SEXE - NIGHT                               119

      They walk in. The place is mostly empty. There is a
      scantily dressed BARTENDER and JACQUES BRUNO sitting at
      the bar.

                                BARTENDER
                Oui?

                                LILA
                Bruno.

      She points to Bruno. Lila and Ray approach him. He is on
      his cell phone speaking in French.

      He looks them over, then closes up his telephone.

                             BRUNO
                       (French accent)
                You looking for a job.

                             LILA
                No, Jimmy called-

                             BRUNO
                Oh yeah, Jimmy. Okay.

      He calls over the Bartender. She comes over. He points to
      Ray and Lila.

      She walks over to them.

                             BARTENDER
                       (softly)
                Put your hands up.

                                                            86.


      Ray and Lila put up their hands. The Bartender pat frisks
      them for body wires. When she is finished:

                                 BRUNO
                   Okay we go.

      He picks up his full-length fur coat.

                                 BRUNO (CONT'D)
                   D'is way.

      They follow him out the back of the club. The Bartender
      follows.


120   EXT. PARKING LOT, CLUB SUPER SEXE - SAME                   120

      They wait.

                                BRUNO
                   D'at your car?

      He points to the Acclaim parked a few feet away. They
      nod. He walks out to a shed and unlocks the door. Two
      very young CHINESE GIRLS, sickly and pale, wearing jean
      jackets look vacantly out.

      Bruno signals them to get out.

                                BRUNO (CONT'D)
                   Open the trunk.

                                LILA
                   We need to get paid, first.

                                 BRUNO
                   Oh, yes.

      He pulls a wad of cash from inside his coat and hands it
      to Lila. She counts it out.

                                LILA
                   You only got six hundred here.

                                BRUNO
                   You get the rest at drop off.

                                LILA
                   It's six hundred apiece.

      The girls stand shivering by the trunk.

                                                        87.


                       BRUNO
          That's the deal I make with Jimmy, now
          you want to change?

Lila and Ray look at each other.

                       LILA
          It's twelve hundred.

                       BRUNO
          You want to make a problem?

Bruno glances at the Bartender watching from the back
door of the club.

                       BRUNO (CONT'D)
                 (annoyed by Ray)
          ...because you're not making a problem
          for me. And you're making a problem for
          them. Let me show you something.

He approaches the two girls.

He grabs one of the girls by the hair, kicks her in the
back of the knees forcing her to the ground.

Lila looks at Ray. The girl tries to get on her feet, but
each time she does he kicks her in the back of the knees
again.

                       LILA
                 (to Ray)
          Let's just go.

Held up by her hair, the girl slides around helplessly.
Lila winces at the sight. Ray stares at Bruno.

                       RAY
          Okay. We'll take them.

Lila looks at Ray.

Bruno drops the girl who scrambles to her feet.

                       LILA
          Let's go.

                       RAY
          Just open the trunk.

Lila leans into the passenger side of the Acclaim and
pops the trunk. Bruno looks at Ray:

                                                         88.


                       BRUNO
          You must be the brains of the operation.

He motions the girls into the trunk and shuts it after
them.

Lila get in the passenger side and Bruno starts for the
back door of the club.

Ray pulls her gun out of her jacket and aims it at Bruno.

                         RAY
          Turn around!

Bruno stops and turns around.

                       RAY (CONT'D)
          I want the rest.

He opens his fur coat.

                        BRUNO
                 (cool)
          I don't have any more.

In the shiny coat lining only the handle of a long pistol
is visible.

                       RAY
                 (to the Bartender)
           Go get it.

Bruno looks around and nods at the bartender. The
bartender panics not knowing what to do and begins
speaking in French to Bruno.

Ray shoots at the pavement beside Bruno.

                       BRUNO
                 (to the bartender)
          Give it to her.

The Bartender disappears into the club. Ray waits with
the gun on Bruno.

                       LILA
                 (from inside the Acclaim)
          Let's get out of here. I'll give you the
          rest of the money.

                       RAY
          No. But thanks.

                                                         89.


                       LILA
          You're gonna get us all killed.

A moment later the Bartender comes back, shaking and
holding cash.

                       RAY
          Put it there.

She indicates the trunk.

                       BRUNO
                 (to the bartender)
          You aren't so smart as you look.


Ray grabs the money and still pointing at Bruno, backs
into the car.

Bruno reaches for his pistol and aims at them as the
Acclaim squeals away.

Bruno FIRES shattering the driver's side window, grazing
Ray's head.

Ray falls back, dazed for a moment. Lila steers. Then Ray
takes the wheel as they swerve out onto the main road.

                         RAY
          He shot me.

Ray wipes the blood from her forehead.

                       LILA
          You should'a just taken the money from
          me?

                       RAY
                 (blood streams down her face)
          I'm tired of people stealing from me.    Is
          it all there?

                       LILA
          We gotta get outta here, first.

                       RAY
          Just COUNT IT and make sure it's all
          there!

Ray hands her the wad of money. Lila struggles to put on
her glasses and counts out the money.

                         RAY (CONT'D)
          Is it there?

                                                              90.


                             LILA
                It's all there.

                               RAY
                Good.

                             LILA
                Slow down a little. We gotta keep it
                under the speed limit.

      Ray smiles and wipes away the blood.

      They drive a short distance. Ray checks the rear-view
      mirror.

                             LILA (CONT'D)
                We gotta get off this road.

      Lila looks in the rear view. Headlights appear behing
      them.

      Ray speeds up approaching an intersection: the sign reads
      "ARRET"

                               LILA (CONT'D)
                Slow down!

                               RAY
                I can't.

      Lila looks back in the rear view mirror. The headlights
      are gaining on them.

      She SPEEDS through it.

      A local SURETE DE QUEBEC police cruiser parked out of
      sight TAKES OFF after her, LIGHTS FLASHING.


121   INT. ACCLAIM ON QUEBEC ROADS - NIGHT                       121

                             LILA
                We gotta get off this road!


122   EXT. ACCLAIM ON DIRT ROAD - NIGHT                          122

      Ray swerves off the main road to a DIRT ROAD. The Québec
      police follow.

      Ray swerves off the road and across a field into the
      WOODS and kills the HEADLIGHTS.

      The Quebec Cruiser CHASES them.

                                                               91.


123   INT. ACCLAIM ON DIRT ROAD       - NIGHT                   123

      Ray speeds down the road.

                             RAY
                How much farther to the reservation?

                             LILA
                Just up at the tree line.

      Ray speeds towards it, but the Quebec cruiser still
      pursues them.

                             RAY
                What the hell? We're on the reservation.

                             LILA
                They can't arrest us but if they catch us
                they'll take the money.

                                RAY
                Shit!

      Ray bounces into the woods through the trees.


124   EXT. ACCLAIM ON RIVER BANK - NIGHT                        124

      The Acclaim emerges from the woods at the edge of the
      river. The International Seaway Bridge looms above the
      ice surface of the river.


125   INT. ACCLAIM ON RIVER BANK - NIGHT                        125

      Behind them the flashing lights close in.

                             LILA
                That ice is black out here.

                             RAY
                Will it hold us?

                             LILA
                I don't know.

      Ray looks at her for a moment then drives toward the ice.


126   EXT. RIVER BANK - NIGHT                                   126

      Behind them, the Quebec cruiser BRAKES at the edge of the
      river.

                                                               92.


      The Québec officer GETS OUT TO WATCH the Acclaim drive
      out across the ice. He radios to:


127   EXT. INTERNATIONAL SEAWAY BRIDGE - NIGHT                   127

      A BORDER GUARD picks up the phone. He nods, then hangs up
      and makes a call to...


128   INT. NEW YORK STATE CRUISER - NIGHT                        128

      Trooper Napoli hears the call on the police radio.

                             DISPATCHER
                ...the Quebec Surete in pursuit of a
                vehicle with New York State plates,
                identified as a blue Plymouth Acclaim and
                the suspects are two women, suspected to
                be carrying illegals...

      He recognizes the car and u-turns.


129   INT. ACCLAIM ON FROZEN RIVER - NIGHT                       129

      Ray and Lila hold their breath as they cross the river.
      They make it over the midpoint and Ray accelerates toward
      the shore.

      Two hundred feet from the bank, the BACK RIGHT TIRE HITS
      A CRACK in the ice. The TIRE DROPS and the UNDER BELLY of
      the car SCRAPES THE ICE. SPARKS FLY.

      The RIGHT REAR END of the car DROPS DOWN and the FRONT
      LEFT TIRE LIFTS off the ice. The car TEETERS BACK AND
      FORTH.

      Ray and Lila sit perfectly still.

                             LILA
                We gotta crawl out the window.

      Lila rolls down her window. The car shifts. The wad of
      cash SLIDES toward the edge of the dashboard. Ray grabs
      it.

      Lila pops the trunk. The two Chinese girls scramble out.
      The four begin RUNNING FOR THE SHORE.

      ANGLE FROM THE UNDER THE BRIDGE:

      Trooper Napoli watches the action on the ice.

                                                               93.


130   EXT. ACCLAIM ON FROZEN RIVER - NIGHT                       130

      The CAR SINKS DEEPER INTO THE WATER on one side.


131   EXT. FROZEN RIVER - NIGHT                                  131

      Ray, Lila and the Chinese girls keep running, slipping
      and sliding, falling. Lila and Ray stop and go back to
      help one of the Chinese girls who keeps falling.

      When they get to the shore, they climb up the bank and
      collapse on the snow, gasping.

      ANGLE: Trooper Napoli gets in his cruiser and heads down
      the bank toward the women, lights flashing.


132   EXT. RIVER BANK - NIGHT                                    132

      Two headlights are seen in the distance coming toward
      them. A PICKUP TRUCK approaches along the shore.

      Jimmy drives it. He gets out, gathers Ray, Lila and the
      two Chinese girls into the back of the truck and drives
      away.

      Ray looks back as the Acclaim SLIPS THROUGH THE ICE AND
      DISAPPEARS.

      Trooper Napoli reaches the scene, too late. No one is
      there.


133   INT. VILLAGE BAKERY - NIGHT                                133

      A small house on the river's edge with a hand painted
      sign:"Bakery" Jimmy drives up. He helps Ray, Lila and the
      Chinese girls to the door.

      The Ticket Taker, "VELMA" opens the door, wearing an
      apron.

                                JIMMY
                Hi Mom.

                             VELMA
                Jimmy, I told you not to bring no more
                half frozen people in here off the river.

                             JIMMY
                       (ignores her)
                We just need to borrow your oven, Mom.

                                                             94.


      He leads them, wet and freezing, to the bakery kitchen.
      As they go by Velma and Ray recognize each other.


134   INT. VILLAGE BAKERY, KITCHEN - NIGHT                      134

      An industrial oven sits beside an old couch. Lila, Ray
      and the teenage girls stand near it shivering.

      Velma looks them over, frowning and shakes her head.


                              VELMA
                I don't see how I can get any baking
                done. I'm supposed to be baking 200
                doughnuts for pee wee Lacrosse and now I
                have people bleeding and dripping all
                over my kitchen.

      She opens a closet filled with Indian medicine plants and
      takes out several kinds.

                              VELMA (CONT'D)
                       (to Ray)
                Sit down, I can't reach up that high.

      Ray sits down. Velma reaches up and dabs Ray's grazed and
      bleeding forehead.

                             VELMA (CONT'D)
                       (to Ray)
                Looks like somebody tried to blow your
                brains out.

      Ray winces in pain.

                             VELMA (CONT'D)
                Get outta here, Jimmy. They gotta strip
                down. (to girls) Gimme those jackets.

      Velma motions to the Chinese girls to take off their
      coats. They stare at her shivering.

      She gently goes to one of the girls and helps her out of
      her jean jacket. Under it she wears a short sleeved shirt
      showing her bruised arms.

      Velma sees the bruises.

                             VELMA (CONT'D)
                Somebody's been beatin' up on you.

      Lila and Ray see the girl's black and blue arms.

                                                             95.


      Velma hangs the girl's jacket on the big oven to dry and
      gives her an old blanket to keep warm.

      Then Velma turns to Lila.

                               VELMA (CONT'D)
                You, too.



135   INT. MOHAWK TRIBAL POLICE STATION - NIGHT                  135

      MOHAWK CHIEF OF POLICE, BILLY THREE RIVERS, a stressed-
      looking man in his 40's talks on the phone.

                             THREE RIVERS
                -Good, good Mike. What can I do for you? -
                -You say non-native smugglers?
                -A white woman? On the Rez?
                -I'll look into it and give you a call
                back. Sure thing. (pause)
                -I'll take your request to the Tribal
                Council and give you a call back.
                -No problem, Mike. You bet.


136   INT. MOHAWK TRIBAL COUNCIL - NIGHT                         136

      Billy Three Rivers sits down at a long conference table.
      A middle-aged Mohawk woman, "BARBARA" sits behind a name
      plate reading "CHIEF". At the end of the table Bernie
      sits behind another name plate: "SUB-CHIEF."

      Rosalie comes in wearing her coat over her bathrobe and
      takes her place behind the "GRAND CHIEF" name plate.

                               THREE RIVERS
                Hi, Rosalie.

                               ROSALIE
                         (puts on her glasses)
                Billy.

                             THREE RIVERS
                We have a situation with a couple
                smugglers. They got chased by the Quebec
                police and crossed the river but their
                car went in and now the troopers know
                they're on the Rez.

                               ROSALIE
                Who is it?

                                                      96.


                       THREE RIVERS
          Lila Littlewolf and some white woman.

                       ROSALIE
          What do the troopers want?

                       THREE RIVERS
          A surrender of the two illegals and the
          Non-Native smuggler. They need an example
          here.

                       ROSALIE
          Do you know where they are?

                       THREE RIVERS
          Probably over at Velma's.

                       ROSALIE
                 (to the other Chiefs)
          What do you think?

                       BARBARA
          Turn them in.

                       ROSALIE
          What about Lila Littlewolf?

                       BERNIE
          We got our own court system.

                       ROSALIE
          We don't charge people with smuggling.

                       BARBARA
          Maybe we should.

                       BERNIE
          If we did, we'd have to arrest half the
          people on the Rez.

Rosalie and Barbara shoot him an ANGRY STARE. He shrugs.

                       BARBARA
          We can expel her.

                       BERNIE
          You can't start throwin' Mohawks off the
          Rez, Rosalie. There's only, what, six
          thousand of us as it is.

                       ROSALIE
          She makes the Mohawk people look bad.

                                                              97.


                             BERNIE
                But she has a Mohawk son.

                             ROSALIE
                She cost us a Mohawk son.

                             BERNIE
                Jake was a big boy. He knew what he was
                doin'

                              ROSALIE
                She'll never be anything but a smuggler.

                             BERNIE
                We've had smuggling on the Rez since Al
                Capone.

                             ROSALIE
                Then we'll take a vote.


137   EXT. ROUTE 37, THE RESERVATION LINE - NIGHT               137

      Two New York State Cruisers block the road, lights
      flashing.


138   INT. VILLAGE BAKERY, KITCHEN - NIGHT                      138

      The bell on the bakery door RINGS. Billy Three Rivers
      walks in looking very official. Jimmy opens the door.

                             JIMMY
                Hi, Billy.

      He comes in and Velma walks in from the kitchen closing
      the door behind her.

                             THREE RIVERS
                Velma, seen any smugglers tonight?

      Velma says nothing.

                             JIMMY
                Come on, Billy, you never bothered with
                smugglers before.

                             THREE RIVERS
                Rosalie is worried people are gonna think
                the Mohawks let in terrorists. Plus, I
                got the Troopers on my back. They want
                the illegals and they say there's some
                white lady with them too. Is that true,
                Jimmy?

                                                            98.


      Jimmy looks away.

                             THREE RIVERS (CONT'D)
                You got white women doing it now? Jesus.
                (after a moment) Well, if you see any,
                let me know.

      Three Rivers leaves.


139   INT. VILLAGE BAKERY, KITCHEN - NIGHT                      139

      Lila and Ray LISTEN from the kitchen. Ray eyes the back
      door.

      Ray grabs her jacket off the oven and takes half the cash
      out of the pocket and hands it to Lila.

                              RAY
                I gotta go.

      Lila takes the money. The Chinese girls look on confused.
      One gets up and grabs her jacket, but Ray motions her
      back.

                             RAY (CONT'D)
                No. You stay here.

      Ray hurries to the back door, opens it, but Bernie
      Littlewolf is there. At the sight of him, Ray backs up.

      He walks in.

                              BERNIE
                Hi, Lila.

                              LILA
                Hi Bernie.

                             BERNIE
                You're in a lot of trouble.

      Lila looks at him, unfazed.

                             BERNIE (CONT'D)
                The council voted to expel you.

                              LILA
                Expel me?

                             BERNIE
                For five years. You can appeal, but
                you'll never be able to change Rosalie's
                mind.

                                                      99.


                       LILA
          They can't do that.

                       BERNIE
          They'll make your life miserable if you
          try to stay.

                       LILA
          They've already done that.

                       BERNIE
          Believe me, it could get even worse.

                       RAY
          I thought this was all legal on the
          reservation.

Bernie ignores her.

                       RAY (CONT'D)
                 (to Lila)
          Look, I gotta get home.

She moves for the door, but Bernie blocks her.

                       BERNIE
          If she leaves, they'll turn you in Lila.
          The troopers want somebody.

                       RAY
          But, she's a Mohawk.

                       BERNIE
          The Chiefs want her out, so there's
          nothing standing between her and the
          troopers.

                       RAY
          Listen, my kids got no one but me.

                       BERNIE
          If you leave she won't see her son again.

Ray and Bernie stare at each other.

                        LILA
          Let her go.

                       BERNIE
          Lila, you're giving up on him and he's
          only one year old.

                                                             100.


                             LILA
                       (to Ray)
                Just go.

      Ray goes to the door, but turns around...

                             RAY
                At least you got family to take care of
                him, ya' know?


140   EXT. RESERVATION WOODS - NIGHT                           140

      Ray shuts the door behind her and starts toward the
      river. She turns and runs along the bank...a long
      way...then slows down. Breathing hard, she stops. Snow
      melts on her face. A long moment passes.

      The sound of the river ice pushing against the bank
      releases a long, deep moan all around her.


141   INT. VILLAGE BAKERY, KITCHEN -NIGHT                      141

      Lila and Bernie sit on the old sofa by the big oven.

                             LILA
                He might be better off.

                             BERNIE
                Jake wouldn't agree with that.

                             LILA
                It was all for a new crib. I wanted the
                baby to have a pretty new crib, not some
                handmedown. And he wouldn't let me go
                alone. (laughs) I was too fat to get
                behind the steering wheel.

                             BERNIE
                He wanted to keep you and little Jake
                safe.

      The back door opens. Ray is there.

                             RAY
                It's just a few months, right?

      Bernie and Lila turn around. Ray walks in.

                             RAY (CONT'D)
                I got baby stuff in the shed.

                                                             101.


      She takes the folded double-wide contract out of her
      pocket and holds it out to Lila.

                             RAY (CONT'D)
                Get a good used single wide with
                insulation. Insulation is the key thing.
                Versailles will give you a hard time, but
                that will leave enough for you and the
                boys to live on for a couple of months.
                Ricky's allergic to penicillin.(a moment)
                And you can't feed `em Pringles all the
                time. Okay?

      Lila isn't sure.

                             RAY (CONT'D)
                Okay?

      Lila nods her head.

                             RAY (CONT'D)
                But you gotta get there quick, before the
                police, `cause T.J. will get scared. I
                don't want him to get scared, you know.

      Ray chokes back her own tears.

                             LILA
                Okay.

      Lila takes the contract from Ray.

                             RAY
                And don't let him jerk you around.
                Versailles, I mean. (to Bernie) Go with
                her. Okay?

      Bernie nods.

                             BERNIE
                Sure.


142   INT. RAY'S TRAILER - NIGHT                               142

      T.J. and Ricky eat supper to the glow of the TV in the
      background.


                             RICKY
                Can I have more corn?

      T.J. dumps his own corn onto Ricky's plate.

                                                             102.


143   EXT. ROUTE 37, THE RESERVATION LINE - NIGHT                143

      Flashing dome lights of New York State troopers are seen
      just beyond the sign "YOU ARE NOW LEAVING THE LAND OF THE
      MOHAWK." Trooper Napoli waits in his cruiser with other
      vehicles.

      Billy drives Ray and the Chinese girls slowly toward them
      in the Mohawk Tribal Police Cruiser.

      Billy stops and the three get out of the car, handcuffed.


144   EXT. HOUSE ON POINT - NIGHT                                144

      Bernie waits in the car. Lila walks to the front door.
      Thunder looks up from beside the front step.

                             LILA
                       (shows her empty hands)
                Sorry, Thunder, I got nothing for you.

      She knocks.

      Evelyn opens the door. Seeing Lila she tries to close it,
      but Lila WEDGES herself inside.


145   INT. HOUSE ON POINT - NIGHT                                145

      Evelyn tires to push her out, but Lila walks in the
      house.

                             EVELYN
                What do you want?

      Lila walks up to the Little Jake sitting in his high
      chair, his face covered in carrots.

      She reaches out to touch him, but Evelyn pushes her hand
      away.

                             LILA
                I need his coat.

      Lila picks up the baby, and looks around.


                             LILA (CONT'D)
                Where's his coat?

                             EVELYN
                You can't have him.

                                                             103.


      She grabs Lila's arm, but Lila shakes her arm free and
      wraps Little Jake in her own jacket.

                             LILA
                Say goodbye to your Dudah.

      Evelyn stands in front of the door, blocking Lila. Lila
      stops and they stand for a moment looking at each other.
      There is anger and sadness. Evelyn moves aside.

      Lila walks out with the baby.


146   EXT. HOUSE ON POINT - NIGHT                                146

      Bernie stands by the car holding a CAR SEAT.

                             BERNIE
                She's gonna kill me for taking this out
                of her car.

147   INT. NEW YORK STATE TROOPER CRUISER - NIGHT                147

      Ray sits in the backseat. The two Chinese girls beside
      her.

                             RAY
                How long is it for me. You know if I
                confess?

                             TROOPER NAPOLI
                As long as they're not on a watch list.
                Four months.

      He glances around at them.

                             TROOPER NAPOLI (CONT'D)
                I don't think you have much to worry
                about judging from the look of them,
                probably brought here to work in the sex
                trade.

      Ray looks at the two girls.

                             RAY
                Will they get sent back?

                             TROOPER NAPOLI
                Not necessarily. They can apply for
                asylum.

                                                           104.


                             RAY
                Can I have a cigarette?

      He lights one for her. She takes it, shaking.

                             TROOPER NAPOLI
                Is there somebody I can call for you? To
                take care of your children.

                               RAY
                I got somebody.

      He looks back at her.

                              TROOPER NAPOLI
                A relative.

                              RAY
                A friend.

      Trooper Napoli looks at her.


                             RAY (CONT'D)
                But I need to call my kid.



148   INT RAY'S TRAILER - NIGHT                                148

      The phone rings. T.J. picks it up.

                             T.J. (O.S.)
                Hello. Hi, Mom.

      She hears his voice and can't speak.

                             T.J. (CONT'D)
                -Mom are you there? What's wrong?
                -What kinda trouble?
                -What did you do?
                -A smuggler!? Holy shit!
                -Are you in jail?
                -But are you're going to jail!?

      There is a long silence. He wipes a tear away with his
      sleeve.

      Ricky plays with his Hot Wheels on the floor.

                             T.J. (CONT'D)
                -Yeah, okay. What does that mean? But
                why? I can take care of him, I do it all
                the time. But I don't see why we need-?

                             T.J. (CONT'D)
                -Who? (pause) A baby? No way.
                -Yeah I know where the stuff is. It's in
                the shed, but that's so stupid!.


      A KNOCK at the door. T.J. looks at it, unsure what to do.

                             T.J. (CONT'D)
                       (holding phone)
                -Yeah, I'm here. Somebody's at the door.

      He walks to it and opens it holding the phone. Lila is
      standing there holding Little Jake, wrapped in her jean
      jacket.

      T.J. and Lila look at each other.   She walks in.

                              T.J. (CONT'D)
                -Okay. Bye.

      He hangs up.

      Little Jake sees Ricky playing with the Hot Wheels Set
      and reaches to get down.

      Lila puts him on the floor. He crawls toward the
      Christmas tree and the Hot Wheels set.

                             T.J. (CONT'D)
                       (to Ricky )
                You're gonna have to get the little
                pieces up high -- or he'll eat them.


149   INT. NEW YORK STATE TROOPER CRUISER - NIGHT               149

      Ray rides in the back of the Cruiser. They pass by
      trailer homes decorated for Christmas.


150   EXT. ROUTE 37 - DAY                                       150

      A Semi ROARS down the road with "WIDE LOAD" banner
      hauling a single wide mobile home through the bright
      morning light, plastic covering rippling in the wind.


151   EXT. RAY'S TRAILER - DAY                                  151

      Using the blow torch, T.J. works on the smiling duck
      Kiddie ride.

                                                              106.


      Ricky plays with Little Jake, dressed in a snow suit.
      Lila comes outside with a plate of peanut butter
      sandwiches, badly made.

      T.J. signals Ricky who brings Little Jake over and puts
      him on the Kiddie ride. Ricky holds him on the seat and
      T.J. flips a switch. The ride JERKS a few times then
      starts to move back and fourth. Little Jake smiles.

      Behind T.J. a Mohawk Tribal Police Cruiser drives up.

      Billy Two Rivers gets out and walks up to T.J.

      He speaks sternly to T.J., pointing at the cruiser where
      an elderly and frail Mohawk women in her eighties, Mrs.
      ThreeRivers, looks out the window.

      T.J. walks over to the cruiser. She rolls down the
      window. He says something to her, looking at the ground
      as he speaks.

      Ricky and Lila holding Little Jake look on.

      Billy Two Rivers drives away.

      SUDDENLY T.J. and Ricky LOOK UP. A RUMBLE is heard in the
      distance. From down the road the SEMI is seen
      APPROACHING...

      T.J. smiles and Ricky watches not sure whether to believe
      it or not. He takes T.J.'s hand.

      Her cell phone RINGS. She doesn't move.

      The message cuts off with a "BEEP."

      ClOSE ON: the cell phone screen. "12 NEW MESSAGES"
      changes to "13 NEW MESSAGES."


153   EXT. INTERNATIONAL SEAWAY BRIDGE - DAY                     153

      A sign reads "Bridge to Canada."

      A steep 1940's era customs bridge arches over the St.
      Lawrence River.

      Cars and trucks line up in different lanes. Customs
      officials man booths at the center of the bridge,
      inspecting and questioning impatient drivers.

      Beyond them, a smaller sign: "THANK YOU FOR VISITING
      MASSENA NEW YORK, IT WORKS, for business, for family, for
      you".

      frozen and still with trees on either side.

               Motel has passed its prime. A few beat up cars are parked 
               outside rooms. We CRANE DOWN to ROOM SEVEN. Curtains closed, 
               but someone is holding it open a crack, looking out. We PUSH 
               in CLOSE TO THE WINDOW and the EYE looking over the parking 
               lot. Then the curtain closes.

               Peeling flowered wallpaper, ultra-cheap furniture. The man 
               moving away from the window is RODRIGUEZ. He is slender, 
               sports a thin mustache, hair slicked straight back. He's in 
               his late thirties. Slightly nervous.

               Another man sits on the couch, looking at a magazine. He is 
               forty, solidly built. His name is FRANK DIVINCI.

                         Says here they got slips in Honolulu. 
                         325 a month. Utilities included. 
                         That's not bad.

               Rodriguez sits down.

                                     DIVINCI
                         But I gotta get at least a forty 
                         footer. It'll handle rough water 
                         better and I'll need the room if I'm 
                         gonna live on it.

               Rodriguez stands up, moves back to the window. Divinci looks 
               up.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         I don't know how you do it.

                                     DIVINCI
                         What?

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         How you can think about Hawaii now?

                                     DIVINCI
                         My heart's in Hawaii.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         You never been there. How can your 
                         heart be there.

                                     DIVINCI
                         You're tellin' me there's no place 
                         you'd rather be other than here?

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         No, I'm saying I just don't know how 
                         you can think about Hawaii right 
                         now.

                                     DIVINCI
                         If I was in Hawaii right now, I 
                         wouldn't be thinking about here. See 
                         the difference?

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         No.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Look, I'm not in Hawaii, I'm here. 
                         But I don't want to be here, I want 
                         to be in Hawaii. I can't be in Hawaii, 
                         therefore I think about it so as to 
                         not get depressed about being here.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         But I'm here, I know I'm here, I 
                         don't like being here, but I can't 
                         be anyplace else because I look around 
                         and I see all this shit. How do you 
                         get around that?! That's what I'm 
                         asking.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Focus.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         Focus.

               Divinci nods. Rodriguez looks at his watch.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         It's time. No more Hawaii, okay? 
                         Focus on this.

                                     DIVINCI
                              (smiles)
                         Aloha.

               Rodriguez shakes his head, exasperated, and exits.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                              (to himself)
                         Aloha my ass.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. DARK STREET - NIGHT

               Poor side of town. A few old cars parked on the street. Some 
               buildings vacant. A LATE MODEL WHITE CADILLAC cruises past. 
               We HEAR LOUD RAP MUSIC.

               INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT

               LIONEL HUDD drives. Hudd is thirty. African American. The 
               MUSIC is loud. His clothes lean to African roots. A WOMAN 
               sits next to the passenger window. Her name is CYNTHIA WEBB. 
               Cynthia is thirty-five, dressed in short provocative skirt, 
               tight top. A little too much make-up. She's lead a hard life.

               She glances at Hudd. Hudd glances at her, looks down at her 
               skirt hiked up on her leg.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         Left at the corner.

               Hudd's eyes linger on her thighs for a moment, then he turns 
               his attention back to driving, tapping along with the heavy 
               bass.

               EXT. PRINCE MOTEL - NIGHT

               The Cadillac pulls into the parking lot. Parks in front of 
               room SEVEN. Hudd gets out, looks around. Cynthia gets out, 
               leads him to SEVEN. Knocks.

               The curtains pull back. Divinci looks at Hudd and Cynthia. 
               She nods to him. The door unlocks and opens.

               Cynthia enters. Hudd looks around again. Then follows.

               INT. MOTEL ROOM SEVEN - NIGHT

               Divinci waits at the door. He and Hudd eye each other as 
               Hudd enters the room. Divinci looks out, making sure no one 
               has followed, then shuts the door.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Hope you don't mind me checkin' you 
                         for weapons.

                                     HUDD
                         Hell yes I mind.

               Divinci hesitates. This could break the deal.

                                     HUDD
                         I just don't want no man handlin' 
                         me.

               Hudd looks at Cynthia. The suggestion is taken.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Okay. Check him.

               Hudd spreads his legs, lifts his arms. Cynthia would rather 
               not have the job, but there's no choice.

                                     HUDD
                         Lotta good hidin' places on this 
                         body. Check good.

               Cynthia runs her hands over Hudd, checking pockets, pants, 
               sleeves. Finally coming to his crotch. Hudd smiles.

                                     HUDD
                         Careful. It's loaded.

               Cynthia has heard it all before. She's not squeamish in the 
               least and she gives him a good going over.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         He's got nothin'.

               She smiles back at Hudd. Then moves away, sits on the couch 
               and seductively crosses her legs.

               Divinci, satisfied, pulls a PLASTIC BAG packed tight with 
               COCAINE out of his pocket, tosses it to Hudd.

               Hudd sits on the couch, opens the bag, sticks his finger in 
               and tastes the contents. But never takes his eyes off Divinci.

                                     HUDD
                         Not bad, not bad. Any more where 
                         this came from?

                                     DIVINCI
                         Maybe.

                                     HUDD
                         Then maybe we talk again.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Maybe.

               Hudd stands, unzips his pants. Reaches in to grab his cock, 
               but instead, pulls out a stack of MONEY. Inch thick.

                                     HUDD
                         Told you there was a lotta good hidin' 
                         places on this body.

               Hudd hands the money to Divinci and pockets the plastic bag. 
               Then crosses to the door. Glances back at Cynthia.

                                     HUDD
                         Bet you gotta lotta nice hidin' 
                         places, too.

               Then Hudd smiles and exits.

               EXT. PRINCE MOTEL - NIGHT

               Hudd gets into his Cadillac, pulls out of the motel parking 
               lot.

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               Deserted. No one on the street this late. Several of the 
               buildings are boarded up.

               INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT

               Hudd drives. No music this time. His attitude has changed. 
               More serious. LIGHTS in the REAR VIEW MIRROR. Coming up fast. 
               Hudd watches as the car pulls around to pass.

               He glances at the CAR as it pulls past him, but all we SEE 
               is the FLASH OF A BLAST FROM A GUN. Front WINDOW EXPLODING.

               THE CADILLAC

               swerves into a parked car. The OTHER CAR -- a BUICK REGAL -- 
               screeches to a stop next to it. ONE MAN gets out. Moving 
               quickly to the Cadillac. It's dark, difficult to see. He 
               carries a SMITH AND WESSON .44. Opens the door. He's wearing 
               PLASTIC GLOVES.

               Hudd is dead, slumped against the passenger door. The man 
               reaches in, turns off the engine, grabs the plastic bag of 
               cocaine. And now we see it's Divinci.

               INT. BUICK REGAL - NIGHT

               Rodriguez is the driver. Anxious. Engine running.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         Come on! Hurry up!

               Divinci dashes back to the Buick, hops in. Rodriguez floors 
               it.

               THE BUICK

               tears off down the dark street.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

               Not a great part of the city. Apartment buildings line both 
               sides of the street. An alley runs between two of the 
               buildings. A TAXI pulls up in front. HEADLIGHTS SHINING on a 
               MAN passed out in the street.

               Cynthia exits the taxi. The taxi pulls away. She glances at 
               the man passed out in the street.

               His clothes are ragged. He's filthy. His face covered in 
               beard and greasy dirty hair. Hard to tell how old he is. 
               Maybe forty. Maybe eighty. Who knows? His hand clutches a 
               bottle in a bag.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         Hey, Joe, wake up. Get outa the street 
                         before you get run over. Joe, wake 
                         up!

               She nudges him with her foot. The man groans, rolls back. 
               Dead drunk.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         You're in the street, Joe. Get outa 
                         the street.

               The man, JOE, is silent for a moment, then he starts to crawl -- 
               toward the middle of the street.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         Other way, Joe.

               Joe turns his crawl toward the curb. Cynthia watches him for 
               a moment. He is truly pathetic.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         Forget it, Joe. Maybe you're better 
                         off right there. I don't think you'd 
                         even feel it.

               Cynthia enters the building next to the alley.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CYNTHIA - INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

               asleep. The room is dark. We HEAR a door open and close. 
               Cynthia wakes.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         Who is it?

               Divinci crosses to the bed.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Got your money.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         Put it on the table.

               She closes her eyes, trying to go back to sleep.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Tired?

                                     CYNTHIA
                         Yes.

                                     DIVINCI
                         I'm not.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         Take a sleeping pill. There's some 
                         in my purse.

                                     DIVINCI
                         You want your money?

               Cynthia's eyes open and she looks up at Divinci. He's smiling, 
               holding up FIVE ONE HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         I already worked for that.

               Divinci unzips his pants.

                                     DIVINCI
                         This is a bonus.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         For who?

               Divinci smiles. Cynthia snatches the money. Divinci starts 
               to undress.

                                     DIVINCI
                         This ain't my fault. This is a failure 
                         of our educational system. If you 
                         hadn't fallen through the cracks and 
                         dropped outa school, you wouldn't be 
                         here now.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         So what's your excuse?

                                     DIVINCI
                         I'm in love.

               Cynthia just stares at him for a long beat. Then she unbuckles 
               Divinci's pants.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               KEY - INSERTED INTO DOOR LOCK - NIGHT

               A door is pushed open. Rodriguez enters his one bedroom 
               apartment. Starts to shut the door when TWO MEN appear from 
               the shadows. The first is short, well dressed. His name is 
               VIC. The second is large, heavy-set, shaved head. His name 
               is CUTLESS SUPREME. Cutless Supreme is not a man to be messed 
               with.

                                     VIC
                         Keepin' some late hours.

               Rodriguez looks at Cutless Supreme.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         What the hell you doin'? What're my 
                         neighbors gonna think?

                                     VIC
                         I apologize. I understand your 
                         concerns. But you must understand 
                         that, unlike a bank, I cannot rely 
                         on a late fee as sufficient 
                         encouragement to repay one's debts. 
                         I am forced to employ the likes of 
                         Mr. Cutless Supreme, whom I might 
                         add, contributes significantly to my 
                         overhead. I am the real loser here. 
                         And I am concerned about your 
                         sincerity in repaying the twenty-
                         seven thousand, nine hundred forty-
                         two dollar gambling debt that is one 
                         week past due. What can you do to 
                         reassure me of your good intentions?

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         I can make your life fuckin' miserable 
                         that's what I can do.

                                     VIC
                         Look at me. Do I have a wife and 
                         three kids? Do I have a good job at 
                         IBM? Am I a handsome guy? No, no and 
                         no. I loan money at excessively high 
                         interest rates to pricks like you 
                         who can't control their urges to 
                         lose big money playing cards and 
                         then I am forced to stay up all night 
                         trying to convince them that I have 
                         needs, too. The point of which is, I 
                         already have a fuckin' miserable 
                         life. So don't threaten me you lousy 
                         bag of cat shit.

               Rodriguez steps toward Vic, but Cutless Supreme slides in 
               between them. Rodriguez isn't going to win this one.

                                     VIC
                         All I'm askin' is that you be 
                         responsible. Is that unreasonable?

               Rodriguez backs off, hesitates as he runs over his options. 
               There aren't any. He reaches into his pocket, pulls out some 
               of his night's earnings.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         Four thousand is all I got.

                                     VIC
                         I am proportionally reassured. You 
                         purchased yourself an extension.

               Vic takes the money, heads for the street. Rodriguez watches 
               Vic walk away. Cutless Supreme watches Rodriguez.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         Cutless Supreme, what kind of fuckin' 
                         idiot name is that?

                                     CUTLESS SUPREME
                         It was the car my daddy stole to 
                         take my momma to the hospital, but 
                         the cops stopped him and shot him 
                         dead in an alley before he could 
                         explain. I was born in the back seat.

               Rodriguez glares at Cutless Supreme, then he shuts the door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CREDIT SEQUENCE - BLACK AND WHITE MONTAGE

               CRIME SCENE PHOTOGRAPHS -- Dead drug dealers lying where 
               they were shot. Overlapping CLOSE-UPS of EVIDENCE TAGS and 
               SHELVING filled with EVIDENCE from hundreds of crime scenes. 
               And CLOSE-SHOTS of CRIME SCENES -- chalk outlines -- bullet 
               shells - bloody foot prints. And finally CRIME SCENE TAPE. 
               The BLACK AND WHITE fades back into COLOR --

               YELLOW CRIME SCENE TAPE

               surrounding the CADILLAC. We PULL BACK, revealing COPS 
               controlling the area. It's early morning. A FEW PEOPLE have 
               stopped to watch. But this is not a high traffic area.

               ANOTHER CAR pulls up. Unmarked. Two men get out. We FOLLOW 
               BEHIND THEM as they approach the Cadillac and PATROLMAN 
               MAHONEY, who knows them.

                                     PATROLMAN MAHONEY
                         Another day, another body. Where you 
                         wanna start?

                                     FIRST MAN
                         A hit?

                                     PATROLMAN MAHONEY
                         Looks like. Could be gang related.

               And now we SEE THE TWO MEN from the unmarked car. It's DIVINCI 
               and RODRIGUEZ. Suit and ties. They act like they own the 
               area. And they do.

                                     PATROLMAN MAHONEY
                         Happened sometime last night, early 
                         morning, two, three o'clock. African-
                         American male, looks like in his 
                         thirties. But even that's a guess. 
                         Half his head is on the upholstery.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         Any witnesses?

                                     PATROLMAN MAHONEY
                         Oh, sure, hundreds.

               INT. CADILLAC - DAY

               The bloody scene is untouched. Hudd's body is where it fell, 
               on the seat. Dried blood everywhere. Divinci looks in.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Fuckin' Animals.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

               EVIDENCE ROOM. Behind a locked fenced in area. A DESK OFFICER 
               checks in and out all evidence. He is twenty-eight, wears 
               glasses, very clean cut. TWO DETECTIVES are checking in 
               evidence as Divinci walks in.

                                     FIRST DETECTIVE
                         ...three shotgun shells, twelve gauge.

               The Desk Officer checks in the evidence.

                                     DESK OFFICER
                         Three shotgun shells, twelve gauge.

               The two detectives wave hellos to Divinci as he approaches.

                                     SECOND DETECTIVE (SGT. GARDNER)
                         Heard you got a gang related. Lucky 
                         guy, Divinci. You get all the pretty 
                         ones.

                                     DIVINCI
                         One less drug store on the street.

                                     DESK OFFICER
                         And the world is a safer place.

               The Desk Officer buzzes Divinci through the door. Divinci 
               crosses to the --

               EVIDENCE STORAGE ROOM

               -- filled with shelves. Stacked with evidence from on-going 
               investigations. And the shelves are full of guns, knives, 
               bloody gloves, masks, shoes, etc.

               Divinci looks around, then removes the PACKAGE OF COCAINE 
               and the .44 from his pockets and places them back on one of 
               the shelves. CASE NUMBER C-549087. One thing about the .44 
               which we can see now -- a BLACK STAIN on the metal of the 
               handle.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HOMICIDE SQUAD ROOM - DAY

               Desks, phones, computers, typewriters and HOMICIDE DETECTIVES. 
               Some witnesses being interviewed. Rodriguez is on the phone 
               at his desk. He's in the middle of an interview as he fills 
               out one of the many forms that complicate his life.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                              (into phone)
                         -- a green car... you know what 
                         make... Maybe a Ford, uh-huh. You 
                         didn't see the license, did you?

               Divinci comes back to his desk, next to Rodriguez. Rodriguez 
               looks up. Divinci gives him a confident smile and brushes 
               his hands together -- clean hands.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                              (into phone)
                         Yeah, no, I understand, it was dark... 
                         Uh-huh.

               Divinci sits at his desk. He pulls an ADVERTISEMENT for a 42 
               FOOT SPORT FISHING BOAT out of his desk. He holds it up to 
               Rodriguez, points to the boat.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Wanna go for a ride?

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                              (into phone)
                         You think you could describe the 
                         driver?
                              (covers phone; to 
                              Divinci)
                         You bought it?

                                     DIVINCI
                         As of last night, I've got the down. 
                         Just picture me under swayin' palms 
                         with a Mai Tai.

               We can HEAR someone describing a felon over the phone, but 
               Rodriguez isn't listening. He's looking at the boat.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                              (into phone)
                         Uh-huh.
                              (covers phone)
                         You're gonna buy it, no shit. When?

                                     DIVINCI
                         Just a phone call away.

               Divinci picks up the phone, starts to dial.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         That's really great, man.

               Divinci smiles. Rodriguez suddenly realizes the person on 
               the other end of the phone has stopped talking.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                              (back to phone)
                         Uh-huh, okay... how tall was he?

               A heavy set man in his fifties approaches -- CAPTAIN 
               HENDERSON.

                                     CAPT. HENDERSON
                         You got primary on the drug related 
                         this morning on 27th.

                                     DIVINCI
                         I'm workin' it up now.

                                     CAPT. HENDERSON
                         Who's your second?
                              (Divinci points at 
                              Rodriguez)
                         In my office. Both of you.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Why?

                                     CAPT. HENDERSON
                         Now.

               Captain Henderson doesn't wait for a response. He heads for 
               the office -- an inner office of glass and wood.

               Divinci looks at Rodriguez, who is suddenly a little nervous. 
               We can HEAR the PERSON OVER THE PHONE that he's talking to, 
               but he's no longer interested and hangs up on them.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         What the hell --

               Divinci motions "keep calm."

               INT. CAPTAIN HENDERSON'S OFFICE - DAY

               Henderson is hanging up his coat as Divinci and Rodriguez 
               enter. They aren't the only ones in the office. RICHARD SIMMS, 
               thirty-two, trim, short cut hair, suit, is waiting.

                                     CAPT. HENDERSON
                         Detectives Divinci and Rodriguez, 
                         this is Richard Simms. He's with the 
                         D.E.A. He wants to ask you some 
                         questions about your case.

                                     DIVINCI
                         What's the occasion?

                                     SIMMS
                         You get an i.d. on the victim?

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         We're waitin' for prints.

               Divinci pulls out his note pad.

                                     DIVINCI

                         If you got all this, what d'you want 
                         from us?

                                     SIMMS
                         ...The man in the car is Lionel Hudd.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                              (a little incensed)
                         How d'you know that?
                              (to Henderson)
                         What's goin' on here?

                                     SIMMS
                         Hudd was DEA, undercover.

               Rodriguez and Divinci take the news like a sledgehammer. On 
               their frozen expressions we HEAR --

                                     SIMMS (O.S.)
                         He was workin' a case on syndicate 
                         distribution of drugs on the south 
                         side. But every dealer we tagged 
                         kept getting killed. He finally got 
                         a lead on a girl -- Hudd was a friend 
                         of mine... I'm gonna nail the 
                         sonuvabitch who killed him.

               A long beat on Rodriguez and Divinci, then --

                                     DIVINCI
                         We'll do everything we can to help.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE UNMARKED POLICE CAR - EXT. STREET - DAY

               screeching around a corner and up a drive into a VACANT LOT. 
               The car skids to a stop and Rodriguez gets out of the driver's 
               side, slamming the door and storming off. He's out of his 
               mind.

               Divinci gets out quickly, follows him. Rodriguez is so fired 
               up and scared he can't stop moving.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         SHIT, FUCK, SHIT, JESUS CHRIST!

                                     DIVINCI
                         Calm down!

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         WE'RE DEAD, WE'RE FUCKING DEAD!

                                     DIVINCI
                         SHUT UP!

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         FUCK, FUCK, FUCK!

               Divinci catches Rodriguez, tries to stop him from flailing 
               about.

                                     DIVINCI
                         STOP IT! YOU HEAR ME, RIGHT NOW, 
                         STOP IT!

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         GOD, GOD, THIS IS REALLY FUCKIN' OUT 
                         OF CONTROL!

               Rodriguez tries to push Divinci away, but Divinci holds on. 
               They struggle --

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         LET GO OF ME!

               -- pushing, shoving, falling to the dirt. Divinci jumps on 
               top of him, pulling his pistol and shoving it into Rodriguez 
               mouth.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Shut up and listen to me!

               Rodriguez glares up at Divinci.

                                     DIVINCI
                         They could be watchin' us right now 
                         you asshole. So fuckin' shape up! 
                         You got it?!
                              (nothing from Rodriguez)
                         I want you to nod!

               It takes Rodriguez a moment, but he nods. Divinci pulls his 
               gun out of Rodriguez' mouth, gets off him and holsters his 
               pistol. Rodriguez is scared to death, not of Divinci, of the 
               mess they're in. He just lies in the dirt.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Get the fuck up!

               Rodriguez starts to get to his feet. Divinci grabs him, yanks 
               him up. Pushes him to the car.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Get in the car!

               They move back to the car. Rodriguez gets back into the 
               driver's seat. Divinci moves around to the passenger side. 
               Gets in, slams the door shut.

               INT. UNMARKED CAR - DAY

               They sit silently in the car for a moment in the middle of 
               the vacant lot. Breathing hard. Dirty. After a beat --

                                     DIVINCI
                         There's no fuckin' reason to panic.

               Rodriguez turns slowly and looks at Divinci incredulously.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         No fuckin' reason to panic? Did you 
                         say no fuckin' reason to panic!

                                     DIVINCI
                         Stop being an idiot! We're the cops 
                         on the case. It's our case. We are 
                         going to find the fuckin' killers.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         WE'RE THE FUCKIN' KILLERS!

                                     DIVINCI
                         Since when does that matter?!

               Rodriguez stares at Divinci for a beat, then we --

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. UNMARKED CAR - PARKED - DAY

               Rodriguez and Divinci are sitting on the car, each with a 
               beer and sharing a bottle of whiskey.

                                     DIVINCI
                         All they want is someone to go down 
                         for the crime, right? Do we care who 
                         goes down for the crime? Fuck no. As 
                         long as someone goes down for the 
                         crime. It's a slot that's gotta be 
                         filled.

               Rodriguez is calmer, but still something bothers him --

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         We killed a cop, doesn't that bother 
                         you?

                                     DIVINCI
                         Of course it bothers me. What d'you 
                         want me to do, turn myself in? Well 
                         I'm not. That's the risk we take 
                         everyday, somebody might pop us, 
                         especially undercover like that. So 
                         he got popped. It happens.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         Not by other cops!

                                     DIVINCI
                         I patted him down! He wasn't wearin' 
                         a wire, he had no badge, no gun, how 
                         was I supposed to know?!

               A moment of silence, then --

                                     DIVINCI
                         Look, I feel just as bad as you do, 
                         but we gotta start thinkin' about us 
                         here. The important thing is we don't 
                         lose control of the case. We can 
                         never lose control of the case. 
                         Whatever evidence there is goes 
                         through us. We lay down the trail. 
                         Make it nice and logical. We're the 
                         teachers and two and two can add up 
                         to five if it's our classroom.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         What're you talkin' about, are you 
                         sayin' we stick somebody with this?

                                     DIVINCI
                         Evidence points wherever we want it 
                         to point. Shit, we can provide so 
                         much evidence, even the asshole we 
                         pick will think he fuckin' killed 
                         him.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         You got some asshole in mind?

                                     DIVINCI
                         Just don't worry. We'll find a killer. 
                         There's lots of 'em out there.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. STREET - DAY

               THREE AFRICAN AMERICAN YOUTHS, all in their twenties, are 
               hanging on a street corner. Talking. Normal street traffic. 
               They give a long hard look to an ATTRACTIVE AFRICAN AMERICAN 
               WOMAN who walks past. A little chatter.

               The UNMARKED CAR suddenly screeches to the curb. The black 
               youths scatter quickly as Divinci jumps out and goes after 
               the tallest of the three. His name is JAMES. Rodriguez guns 
               the car and gives chase on wheels.

               James darts across traffic. Divinci running hard after him.

               Rodriguez spins the car in a u-turn. Racing after them.

               EXT. ALLEY - SAME TIME

               James darts down the alley. Narrow, dark, lined with trash 
               bins. Divinci turns into the alley, but he isn't going to 
               catch him.

               James is almost to the end when the car turns into the alley, 
               skidding to a stop. Rodriguez jumps out, gun leveled at James.

               No where for him to go. He slows down. Rodriguez moves in 
               from his front, Divinci runs up from behind. James is 
               disgusted.

                                     JAMES
                         What the hell'd I do now?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. POLICE STATION - EVIDENCE STORAGE ROOM - DAY

               Divinci removes the PACKAGE OF COCAINE and the .44 from the 
               shelf. CASE NUMBER C-549087.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE .44 - INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

               SLIDING across a table to James, who stops it with his right 
               hand. Divinci and Rodriguez are across from him.

                                     JAMES
                         Ain't my gun.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Never is, is it.

                                     JAMES
                         That ain't my fuckin' gun.

               He shoves the gun back. Divinci stops it with his arm, careful 
               not to touch it.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Got your fuckin' prints on it.

               James quickly realizes what they've done. He lunges for the 
               gun, but Divinci picks it up quickly with a pencil through 
               the trigger guard. James glares at them with murderous intent.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         Where were you Friday night?

                                     JAMES
                         Friday night... last Friday night?

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         Where were you?

                                     JAMES
                         Whatever you think I did went down 
                         last Friday night?

                                     DIVINCI
                         Better have a good alibi, James, or 
                         it's good ali bye-bye.

               A beat, then James smiles.

                                     JAMES
                         I was in jail you assholes. Check it 
                         out.
                              (starts to laugh)
                         All night. What a couple a dickheads!

               Rodriguez and Divinci are silent.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DOOR - INT. APARTMENT - DAY

               KICKED IN on a grungy small apartment. Divinci and Rodriguez 
               burst in, guns drawn. Scaring the shit out of an HISPANIC 
               MAN (CORTEZ) and his half-naked GIRLFRIEND as they watch 
               television.

                                     DIVINCI AND RODRIGUEZ
                         NOBODY MOVE! HANDS IN THE AIR! NOW! 
                         MOVE IT!

               CUT BACK TO:

               THE .44 - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

               SLIDING across the table back to Rodriguez and Divinci. Cortez 
               sits across from them. Wearing white t-shirt, baggy pants. 
               Tattoos on his arms.

                                     CORTEZ
                         Ain't my gun.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                              (smiles)
                         Got your prints on it.

                                     CORTEZ
                              (stands; angry)
                         You fuck, I ain't never seen that 
                         gun before!

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         Where were you last Friday night?

                                     CORTEZ
                         Fuck you. I wanna talk to a lawyer!

               Just want they wanted to hear. No alibi.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         Lawyer's not gonna help you, Cortez. 
                         All the evidence we got points right 
                         to you.

               Cortez stares at them for a moment, then --

                                     CORTEZ
                         Did you say last Friday night?

               Cortez smiles and pulls up his shirt, revealing a long scar 
               across his stomach.

                                     CORTEZ
                         Intensive Care, you pindejo fuckin' 
                         gutter shits. And Thursday night, 
                         and Saturday, too. I just fucking 
                         got out this morning.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               MAN - EXT. ALLEY - DAY

               SLAMMING INTO A WALL, hitting hard, falling back to the dirty 
               garbage covered alley. He's about twenty-seven, thin, blond 
               hair tied in a pony tail. He wears a flannel shirt, jeans, 
               boots. He doesn't want to fight. His name is DAVE.

                                     DAVE
                         Alright, alright, alright... shit. I 
                         ain't gonna fight you.

               He looks up at Divinci and Rodriguez moving toward him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

               Dave is behind the desk handling the .44 with no apparent 
               problem.

                                     DAVE
                         Ain't my gun.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         That's what they all say.

                                     DAVE
                         Wish it was. No better gun than Smitty 
                         and Wes .44 mag with serial numbers 
                         filed off.
                              (opens cylinder)
                         Got any bullets?

               Divinci walks around, holds out his hand for the gun.

                                     DAVE
                         Who did I kill?

                                     DIVINCI
                         Where were you last Friday night?

                                     DAVE
                         You mean, what's my alibi right?

               Dave spits on the gun, wipes off his prints with his shirt.

                                     DAVE
                         I was breakin' and entering. Jewelry 
                         store on seventh and Front, about 
                         nine o'clock. Not even close to your 
                         jurisdiction. I got the rocks to 
                         prove it.

               He drops the gun, clean of prints onto the table.

                                     DAVE
                         Sorry I can't help ya. But one to 
                         five is better than ten to life.

               Divinci and Rodriguez stare at Dave. They are not happy.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               MUG SHOTS - INT. HOMICIDE SQUAD ROOM - DAY

               in plastic pages. A BINDER full of criminal portraits. Divinci 
               is going through one book. Rodriguez searches another.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Montrose LaJolla...

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         We pulled him in last year for knifing 
                         that dealer on 32nd.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Yeah. Almost killed him, remember? 
                         He'd be good.
                              (calls out to ANOTHER 
                              DETECTIVE)
                         Anybody seen Montrose LaJolla?

                                     ANOTHER DETECTIVE
                         He's dead. His life partner killed 
                         him in a Domestic D about a month 
                         ago.

               Rodriguez suddenly slams his book shut.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         Shit!

               Divinci looks at him. Rodriguez is angry, tense. Divinci 
               gives him a look telling him this is not the time and place 
               for a discussion on this topic.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Take it easy.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         This isn't gonna work!

               Divinci leans toward Rodriguez.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Nobody said it was gonna be easy. 
                         But let's not advertise our despair... 
                         Okay?

               The PHONE RINGS. Divinci picks it up.

                                     DIVINCI
                              (into phone)

               INT. CAPT. HENDERSON'S OFFICE - DAY

               Captain Henderson is sitting behind his desk. Divinci and 
               Rodriguez are in front of him. Rodriguez is trying to hide 
               his nervousness. Divinci is absolutely cool.

                                     DIVINCI
                         This is our case! Not the goddamn 
                         DEA's!

                                     CAPT. HENDERSON
                         It's been three days.

                                     DIVINCI
                         We're not fuckin' magicians! What 
                         the hell is three days?! This is a 
                         goddamn murder case! It takes a little 
                         bit of goddamn time!

                                     CAPT. HENDERSON
                         When a Federal Undercover Officer 
                         goes down, it's never a fuckin' murder 
                         case! I don't like the DEA on my ass 
                         any better than you like 'em on yours. 
                         But this is personal for them and 
                         they want answers. Forget your other 
                         cases and get something, anything 
                         that I can give to them. The last 
                         thing I want is the goddamn F.B.I. 
                         on my back, too.

               Divinci and Rodriguez are quiet for a beat, then --

                                     DIVINCI
                         We've got a couple leads. We need a 
                         little more time.

                                     CAPT. HENDERSON
                         I can't hold 'em off much longer.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         This is no fuckin' way to run an 
                         investigation.

                                     CAPT. HENDERSON
                         Let me tell you both something, if 
                         you don't solve this quick, they're 
                         gonna start askin' why? And they'll 
                         be lookin' to blame somebody in this 
                         department. So my advise to you is, 
                         get something fuckin' fast or turn 
                         over what you've got and get outa 
                         the way.

               Rodriguez and Divinci are quiet for a moment, then --

                                     DIVINCI
                         How much time we got?

                                     CAPT. HENDERSON
                         A couple days. The funeral's this 
                         afternoon.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         What funeral?

                                     CAPT. HENDERSON
                         For Agent Hudd. Simms wants you there.

                                     DIVINCI
                         What for? We didn't know him.

                                     CAPT. HENDERSON
                         How the hell do I know?! It's DEA, 
                         it's their thing. You're the cops on 
                         the case, I suppose they want you to 
                         know what a great guy Hudd was so 
                         you'll work all that harder to find 
                         his killer. Just go. It'll reassure 
                         'em how much you care and keep 'em 
                         off my ass.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. CEMETERY - GRAVE SITE - LATE AFTERNOON

               MOURNERS gathered around the grave site. WIFE in tears. MOTHER 
               in tears. The men trying their best to hold up. Beyond the 
               family, DEA AGENTS. Simms among them. A show of support and 
               solidarity. A REVEREND delivering --

                                     REVEREND
                         -- and it is too easy to say that he 
                         was a good man in his job because he 
                         gave more than most. And it's too 
                         easy to say that he was a good man 
                         in his community because he gave 
                         more than others. And it's too easy 
                         to say he was a good man at home 
                         with his family because he was always 
                         there when they needed him. Special 
                         Agent Lionel Hudd was not just a 
                         good man, he was an extraordinary 
                         man. And his death shall not be in 
                         vain.

               CAMERA FINDS Divinci and Rodriguez at the back. Rodriguez 
               looks nervous. Divinci notices. Their conversation is quiet.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Don't Humpty Dumpty on me.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         What's that mean?

                                     DIVINCI
                         Your cracks are startin' to show.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                              (covering)
                         Bullshit.

               Divinci sees Simms approaching from the side.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Get your balance. Here comes the 
                         King.

               Rodriguez glances toward Simms as he walks up. The 
               conversation is quiet. Not wanting to disturb the ceremony.

                                     SIMMS
                         Glad you came... Anything break?

               Divinci glances at Rodriguez.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Nothin' to brag about. But we've got 
                         a couple new leads we're followin'.

                                     SIMMS
                         ...Look, normally we'd be all over 
                         this, but your Captain seems to think 
                         you can do the job. It's your 
                         territory. I guess you know it better 
                         than anybody. And that can be worth 
                         a lot. But you understand... we won't 
                         wait forever.

               Divinci is pissed. He doesn't like Simms.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Just outa curiosity... What happened 
                         to his backup? You guys use backup 
                         on undercover don't you?

                                     SIMMS
                         It was a new lead. Hudd was afraid 
                         backup would blow his cover. He was 
                         supposed to check in ten minutes 
                         after the deal went down. He never 
                         checked in.

                         We want this one as bad as you do. A 
                         cop's a cop. We're in this together, 
                         right?

               Simms stares at Rodriguez and Divinci for a moment, then he 
               returns his attention to the ceremony.

                                     SIMMS
                         That's why I asked you to come here. 
                         Just so you knew that.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. HOT DOG VENDOR STREET - DUSK

               Rodriguez and Divinci walk down the street, hot dogs in hand, 
               returning to their car parked curbside.

                                     DIVINCI
                         He didn't have backup. You believe 
                         that?! Jesus what a dick.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         I don't think we should criticize 
                         that particular decision of his.

                                     DIVINCI
                         I don't care what the reasons are, 
                         you don't play Lone Fuckin' Ranger 
                         on a drug buy. You're just askin' 
                         for it. That's all I'm sayin'.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         I don't trust those bastards. They're 
                         not waitin' for us. That's bullshit. 
                         They're runnin' their own 
                         investigation. I know it!

                                     DIVINCI
                         Let 'em. The gun, the coke came from 
                         evidence. The car came from impound. 
                         So what's to find?

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         That's what I'm afraid of. There's 
                         nothing for them to find. We were 
                         too good.

                                     DIVINCI
                         So what're you worried about?

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         Nobody is that fuckin' good.

               Divinci looks at Rodriguez, then smiles.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Except us.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               STRIPPER - INT. STRIP JOINT - NIGHT

               bumping and grinding her way through her performance. We 
               don't see her face yet. Just her body. G-string and skin 
               tight tank top. LOUD MUSIC. MEN in the audience appreciative. 
               The room is smoky. LIGHTS swirl over the stage. The tank top 
               comes off. WHISTLES and CHEERS. And now we see the dancer -- 
               it's CYNTHIA.

               INT. HALLWAY - BACK STAGE - NIGHT

               Cynthia moves down the hall in her g-string and high heels. 
               She enters the dressing room.

               INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

               Divinci is sitting in the only chair in the cramped little 
               room. He's going through her purse. Cynthia stops when she 
               sees him, then shuts the door.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         I think this is breaking and entering, 
                         isn't it?

                                     DIVINCI
                         I work homicide, I don't deal with 
                         that shit.

                                     CYNTHIA

                         have on file?

                                     DIVINCI
                         Yeah. You surprise me sometimes. 
                         Here I think you're just a hard case 
                         and I discover you've got a heart of 
                         gold.

                         You're an organ donor. That's really 
                         nice. The only problem is, they'll 
                         never use your best parts.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         I'll make sure you get them.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Hey, don't get me wrong. I was just 
                         surprised that we had something in 
                         common... Besides what we have in 
                         common.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         Do everybody a favor, if you're gonna 
                         donate your heart, make sure it goes 
                         to science. Most people want one 
                         that beats.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Cynthia... pretty name. What do the 
                         first three letters spell?

                                     CYNTHIA
                         Don't get so clever. It's out of 
                         character.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CYNTHIA'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Divinci and Cynthia are lying in bed. Divinci has his arm 
               around her, but he's staring at the ceiling.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         What's so interesting up there?

                                     DIVINCI
                         Nothing.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         Then why's it got all your attention?

                                     DIVINCI
                         I'm thinkin', that's all.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         About us?

                                     DIVINCI
                         No.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         Good.

               Divinci looks at Cynthia.

                                     DIVINCI
                         What if I was thinkin' about us?

                                     CYNTHIA
                         Don't waste your time.

                                     DIVINCI
                         What if I was?

                                     CYNTHIA
                         Where's it gonna get us?

                                     DIVINCI
                         Maybe I got plans.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         I don't wanna hear 'em. Plans just 
                         make you think somethin's gonna get 
                         better. I'm fine now. I don't need 
                         to get screwed up waitin' for 
                         something good to happen.

                                     DIVINCI
                         I just want you to know, love is 
                         important to me.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         Me, too.

                                     DIVINCI
                         But more important is loyalty. Nothing 
                         is more important than that. Not 
                         love, not anything. Because loyalty 
                         is about respect. You can talk about 
                         love all you want, but without respect 
                         it's empty. I mean the first thing 
                         that goes in a marriage is respect. 
                         And once it's gone, forget the love. 
                         So I am telling you, I am loyal to 
                         you. Like I'm loyal to my partner. 
                         We are closer than blood. And I trust 
                         him with my life.

               Cynthia didn't really expect this from Divinci. She's 
               actually, despite herself, a little touched.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         Why're you telling me this?

                                     DIVINCI
                         When you asked if I was thinkin' 
                         about us and I said I wasn't, I just 
                         want you to know that I do.

               A beat, then --

                                     CYNTHIA
                         Just don't ask me to marry you.

                                     DIVINCI
                              (smiles)
                         Why aren't more women like you?

               Divinci leans in and they kiss.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. CYNTHIA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Divinci exits the building. Starts to cross the street to 
               his car parked on the opposite side when he HEARS SOMETHING 
               BEHIND him. He turns, instantly reaching for his pistol.

               A drunk staggers out of the alley -- looks like he has a gun 
               in his hand.

               Divinci instinctively raises his gun to shoot when --

               THE LIGHT -- catches the object in the drunk's hand -- a 
               BROWN BOTTLE, the neck sticking ahead like the barrel of a 
               gun.

                                     DIVINCI
                              (lowers gun)
                         You fuckin' idiot.

               The drunk stops when he hears the voice. Looks through his 
               matted greasy hair that cascades in front of his eyes. Now 
               we recognize Joe.

               Divinci turns away, disgusted. Opens his car door, then stops. 
               Caught in a thought. He turns back and looks at Joe again.

               EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

               Joe stumbles back into the DARKNESS OF THE ALLEY. Lies down 
               next to a trash bin. LIGHTS suddenly illuminate Joe. Joe 
               squints as a CAR moves right up to him. Joe shields the light 
               with an arm.

               We HEAR the DOOR OPEN and CLOSE, then Divinci bends down 
               into the LIGHT. He is wearing a BASEBALL CAP backwards on 
               his head. And GLOVES on his hands. He reaches inside Joe's 
               JACKET POCKET.

                                     DIVINCI
                         What've we got here?

               He pulls out the Smith and Wesson .44. Divinci looks at Joe.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Where were you last Friday night?

               Confused, Joe looks up at Divinci through matted hair.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CAR - DRIVING - NIGHT (EARLY MORNING)

               Divinci drives. Joe up front. In an alcoholic daze.

                                     DIVINCI'S VOICE
                         What's your name?

               Joe looks at Divinci. Having trouble focusing.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Your name, what's your name?

                                     WILLIAM
                         ...Joe...

                                     DIVINCI
                         Where'd you get the gun, Joe?

               Joe looks down at his hands -- he's holding the .44.

                                     DIVINCI
                         It was in your pocket, Joe, your 
                         coat pocket. You must keep it for 
                         protection, right?

                                     WILLIAM
                         I don't know.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Sure you do, Joe. Everybody needs 
                         protection. Especially a guy like 
                         you lives on the street, right?

               Joe just stares at the gun.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Put it back in your pocket, Joe. You 
                         don't have to worry about me, I'm 
                         not gonna hurt you.

               Joe puts the gun into his jacket pocket.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. STREET - EARLY MORNING

               The LOCATION of HUDD'S MURDER. The street is empty. Quiet. 
               Divinci stops his car next to where Hudd died.

               INT. DIVINCI'S CAR - EARLY MORNING

               Joe is asleep, leaning against the window. Divinci reaches 
               across and yanks him.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Wake up, Joe! I want you to look at 
                         something. Out the window, Joe. Look 
                         out the window.

               Joe's eyes open. Divinci forces his head to the window.

                                     DIVINCI
                         This is where it happened, Joe. I 
                         want you to remember it. This is 
                         where you killed him

               Joe tries to turn to Divinci, but Divinci holds his head.

                                     DIVINCI
                         You remember it now? How you shot 
                         him through the head? You remember 
                         it?

                                     WILLIAM
                         I... don't...

                                     DIVINCI
                              (lets go of Joe)
                         You will.

               Divinci slams his foot down on the accelerator and --

               THE CAR

               -- tears off down the street.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               RODRIGUEZ - INT. BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

               asleep. Alone in a double bed. The PHONE RINGS. Rodriguez 
               startles awake. Catches the phone on the second ring.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         Who the hell is this?

               INTERCUT WITH DIVINCI - INT. MOTEL ROOM - EARLY MORNING

               Divinci on the phone in the f.g. Joe is passed out on the 
               bed in the b.g. The room is dark.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Is that any way to answer the phone?

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         Divinci, shit! It's quarter to six.

                                     DIVINCI
                         I know what time it is, I'm not the 
                         one in bed. I need the photos of the 
                         scene.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         Now?

                                     DIVINCI
                         I got a suspect. But he can't remember 
                         all the details. He needs a little 
                         help. And I thought, since you're my 
                         partner, you might jump at the 
                         opportunity to lend me a fuckin' 
                         hand.

               Rodriguez sits up in bed.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         He doesn't remember last Friday?

                                     DIVINCI
                         He doesn't remember a lotta Fridays. 
                         Bring the shots and pick up a fifth 
                         of Vodka.
                              (glances at Joe)
                         Make it two.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               JOE - INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

               asleep on the bed.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Time to get up, Joe.

               Divinci slaps him. Joe's eyes open.

                                     DIVINCI
                         I want you to look at something.

               The room is still dark. Curtains drawn. We now see Rodriguez. 
               He's wearing a black sock cap and gloves. He hands Divinci 
               POLICE PHOTOGRAPHS of the car, the street, the victim -- the 
               murder scene. Divinci pulls Joe into a sitting position.

                                     DIVINCI
                         There's the guy and the street and 
                         the car. You remember how you shot 
                         him.

               Joe stares at the photographs and starts to shake his head.

                                     DIVINCI
                         You don't remember? That's not what 
                         you told me last night.

               Joe is confused.

                                     DIVINCI
                         If you remember you can have a drink.

               Joe looks at the bottle Rodriguez holds out to him.

                                     DIVINCI
                         But you gotta remember how you saw 
                         him driving toward you and you were 
                         in the street and you were afraid he 
                         was going to hit you so you had to 
                         shoot to protect yourself. You 
                         remember now don't you?

               Joe stares at the photographs for a moment, then nods.

                                     DIVINCI
                         And where's your gun, Joe, where do 
                         you keep your gun?

               Joe thinks a moment, then reaches into his coat pocket and 
               pulls out the .44. Divinci hands Joe the bottle and Joe 
               drinks. We PUSH IN on the BOTTLE OF VODKA as the liquid drains 
               away and we CLOSE IN TIGHT until we can SEE LIONEL HUDD'S 
               FACE as we --

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               CLOSE UP - THE PHOTOGRAPHS

               Hudd dead. Blood on the windows. The street. Joe is drunk 
               again. In a haze. Starts to lift the bottle. Rodriguez pulls 
               it away. Rodriguez and Divinci always stay behind Joe.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         Why'd you kill him?

                                     WILLIAM
                         I... don't know...

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         It was your gun.

                                     WILLIAM
                         ...I don't have a gun.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Yes you do. In your pocket.

                                     WILLIAM
                         ...I'm tired.

                                     DIVINCI
                         I know, Joe, it's tough to remember 
                         things you don't wanna remember. 
                         What about your last name, Joe. You 
                         got a last name?

               Joe looks up as if trying to remember. Or trying not to.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         Come on, Joe, everybody's got a last 
                         name.

                                     WILLIAM
                         I don't remember.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         Don't fuck with us, Joe. We're trying 
                         to help you. What's your last goddamn 
                         name?

               Joe shakes his head.

                                     WILLIAM
                         I don't know.

               Rodriguez suddenly smacks Joe on the side of the head when 
               he tries to look back. Joe is surprised by the blow. Divinci 
               pushes Rodriguez back. Shakes his head telling him to back 
               off.

                                     DIVINCI
                              (to Joe; friendly)
                         Come on, we're all tired here, Joe. 
                         Just give us your last name.

                                     WILLIAM
                         I don't remember.

                                     DIVINCI
                         ...Okay, fine, what's in a name? But 
                         you remember the gun, right, in your 
                         pocket.

               Joe nods.

                                     DIVINCI
                         And you remember that you told me 
                         you thought he was going to hit you, 
                         right? That's why you shot...

                                     WILLIAM
                         ...Yeah.

               Divinci looks at Rodriguez. Rodriguez nods.

                                     DIVINCI
                         How'd it happen, Joe, tell me how it 
                         happened.
                              (prompting)
                         You saw him driving toward you --

                                     WILLIAM
                         -- I saw him driving toward me --

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CAR - NIGHT - LIONEL HUDD

               driving. The night that he was shot. He looks ahead into the 
               darkness of the street. Suddenly he SEES --

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               A MAN standing in the street ahead of him.

               HUDD - INT. CAR - NIGHT

               smiles and turns toward the man in the street.

               A .44

               is pulled from a jacket pocket, lifted toward the APPROACHING 
               CAR. The gun is in the hands of Joe. He is scared. The 
               HEADLIGHTS COMING RIGHT AT HIM. He aims and FIRES the gun.

               THE FRONT WINDOW

               SHATTERS. And the car swerves to the curb.

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               Joe watches from the street, then looks at the .44 in his 
               hand.

               BACK INSIDE THE MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Rodriguez leans into Joe who is now sitting on the edge of 
               the bed, looking down at the .44 in his hand.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         Then what did you do?

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               Joe is in the street again. He doesn't know what he did.

               BACK INSIDE THE MOTEL ROOM

               Divinci leans close to Joe from behind now.

                                     DIVINCI
                         You ran.

               And now Joe can imagine it. We PUSH INTO JOE'S EYES.

               BACK TO THE STREET

               as Joe turns and runs. As fast as he can away from the death. 
               He looks back over his shoulder, scared.

                                     JOE'S VOICE
                         I didn't mean to...

               BACK INSIDE THE MOTEL ROOM

               Joe is staring at the gun. Divinci and Rodriguez watch him.

                                     WILLIAM
                         He was going to hit me... I was 
                         scared... he was going to hit me.

               Rodriguez looks at Divinci.

                                     DIVINCI
                         That's why you shot him.

                                     WILLIAM
                         That's why I...

               JOE - BACK ON THE STREET - NIGHT

               AIMS the gun again at the APPROACHING CAR.

                                     JOE'S VOICE
                         ...shot him.

               And we HEAR the GUN SHOT AGAIN, shattering the silence as we --

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE SMOKING .44 - INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY

               held by Joe's hand, which is held by Divinci's gloved hand. 
               Divinci has held Joe's finger on the trigger and pulled it.

               The gunshot is deadened in the old building. Joe is lying in 
               the back seat of a car, passed out, with Divinci holding the 
               .44 in his hand. The back door is open. The engine is running.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Helluva nice shot, Joe.

               Divinci pulls the 44. out of Joe's hand, then shuts the door, 
               gets into the front. The car pulls away, exiting the 
               warehouse.

               HAND - INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - POLICE STATION - DAY

               signing a name at the bottom of a paper -- Joe. Beneath it 
               is the type written name: JOE DOE. We PULL BACK and see it's 
               Joe signing a typewritten page as Divinci and Rodriguez watch. 
               Joe is a mess. When he finishes he pushes the paper away and 
               puts his head down on the table. Divinci picks up the paper 
               and we --

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. CYNTHIA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

               A small yellow Toyota with a bashed up left fender pulls to 
               the curb. Cynthia gets out lugging her purse and a bag of 
               groceries. We HEAR ANOTHER CAR DOOR SHUT. She turns. Divinci 
               is walking across the street from his car toward her.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         It's the middle of the day.

               Divinci gives her a look as he takes the grocery bag from 
               her.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Just talk.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         Since when?

               Divinci leads the way into the apartment building.

               INT. CYNTHIA'S APARTMENT - DAY

               Cynthia opens the door, pulls the key out of the lock as 
               Divinci enters behind her with the groceries.

                                     DIVINCI
                         I need you to do something.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         Good, I need the money.

               She shuts the door. Divinci deposits the bag on the table. 
               Cynthia picks it up, moves into the kitchen.

                                     DIVINCI
                         This isn't a deal. Where you goin'?

                                     CYNTHIA
                         I got perishables, okay?

               Cynthia enters the kitchen and Divinci follows. Cynthia starts 
               unloading the groceries, putting the milk, eggs, etc. into 
               the refrigerator.

                                     DIVINCI
                         The guy we did the last deal with is 
                         dead.

               Cynthia turns suddenly.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         What?

                                     DIVINCI
                         Somebody popped him that night, 
                         probably when he tried to unload the 
                         stuff. I don't know.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         Jesus, does anybody --

                                     DIVINCI
                         -- Don't worry, there's no connection. 
                         We got the guy who did it.

               Cynthia breathes a sigh of relief.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         You scared the hell outa me.

                                     DIVINCI
                         We just need you to do one thing.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         ...What?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

               Divinci and Rodriguez are moving down a hallway with Cynthia. 
               She's nervous. Wants very much not to be here.

                                     DIVINCI
                         He'll be third from the left. Don't 
                         fuck up. Third from the left.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         What'm I supposed to say?

                                     DIVINCI
                         Just look at 'em and then look at 
                         the man the third from the left and 
                         say, It's him.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         And I'll say, Are you sure?

                                     DIVINCI
                         And you say, Absolutely. No question.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         This is all I need to do right?

                                     DIVINCI
                         We have a signed confession. You 
                         i.d. him, he's goin' straight into 
                         the can.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         Okay, okay. But this is it. I'm not 
                         doin' anything more than this.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Hey, it's a done deal.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. POLICE LINEUP ROOM - DAY

               ROWS of seats face a small platform. The LINEUP WALL is 
               striped with horizontal lines with HEIGHT NUMBERS. The 
               brightly lighted lineup is separated from the gallery, which 
               is in the dark.

               UNIFORMED GUARDS are on hand to make sure there is no 
               discussion, verbal or otherwise, between accused and witness. 
               SIX MEN file onto the platform. All shady characters.

                                     A VOICE
                         Stop and face front.

               The six men obey. A couple keep their heads down. The others 
               squint from the bright lights.

                                     THE VOICE
                         Lift your heads, look straight.

               Heads are lifted. Eyes front. But we only recognize one of 
               them, standing third from the left. It's Joe.

               Divinci, Rodriguez and Cynthia are in the gallery.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Take your time. Try and remember his 
                         face.

               Cynthia counts three from the left and... wait a minute. She 
               looks more closely. Just to be sure. Rodriguez and Divinci 
               watch her. She's obviously putting on a good show. Then she 
               turns to Divinci, sitting next to her and whispers --

                                     CYNTHIA
                         I know him.

               Divinci is caught a little of guard -- he didn't expect a 
               private conversation, nor does he want one for fear of it 
               looking like he's coaching her.

                                     DIVINCI
                         If you can identify the man --

                                     CYNTHIA
                              (whisper)
                         I know him.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Just tell us which one.

               Cynthia, frustrated, gives Divinci a look.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         No. I fucking know him.

               Divinci still isn't sure what's gotten into her. Rodriguez 
               looks over, a little annoyed.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         What's the problem?

                                     DIVINCI
                         There's no problem!
                              (to Cynthia; pointedly)
                         Do you see him up there?!

                                     CYNTHIA
                              (aside)
                         You don't understand.

               Divinci is losing his patience. He doesn't want to blow the 
               whole thing now, not in front of guards and police personnel. 
               The Guards are beginning to wonder what the hell's going on. 
               So are the MEN in the line.

                                     ONE OF THE MEN
                         Hey, come on, do it or don't!

                                     THE VOICE
                         No talking.

               Divinci leans in close to her. We can HEAR GRUMBLING from 
               the men on the platform.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Pick the asshole out!

               Cynthia starts to protest again, but she suddenly feels 
               Divinci's hand grip her arm. He's had enough. Cynthia gets 
               the message. And while keeping her eyes locked on Divinci 
               she says --

                                     CYNTHIA
                         Third man from the left.

               JOE

               squints against the harsh light, trying to see into the room, 
               as if he recognized the voice.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HALLWAY - POLICE STATION - OUTSIDE THE LINEUP ROOM - 
               DAY

               Rodriguez, Divinci and Cynthia move briskly down the hall. 
               None happy about what just happened. The conversation is 
               strained.

                                     DIVINCI
                         You mind telling me what that was 
                         all about?!

                                     CYNTHIA
                         I know him. He hangs around my 
                         building. He lives in the alley or 
                         something.

               Rodriguez looks at Divinci. Is this a problem?

                                     DIVINCI
                         You don't think people that hang 
                         around your neighborhood can kill 
                         somebody. Well let me tell you 
                         something. You don't live in a great 
                         fuckin' neighborhood.

               Divinci pulls a paper from his pocket.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Just sign the goddamn paper.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         What paper?

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         You picked a man out of a lineup, 
                         you have to sign that you did that 
                         so they don't think we made it up.

               Cynthia just stares at Rodriguez for a beat, then --

                                     CYNTHIA
                         Now why the hell would they think 
                         something like that?

                                     DIVINCI
                         Sign it.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         You said all I had to do was pick 
                         him out.

                                     DIVINCI
                         This is part of it. Just sign it and 
                         you're done.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         How come you're so sure it was him?

               Rodriguez rolls his eyes.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         Jesus Christ!

                                     DIVINCI
                         He confessed.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         Bullshit.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         We got it in writing.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         He didn't do it.

                                     DIVINCI
                         How the hell d'you know that? Were 
                         you with him at the time?! You have 
                         a good goddamn alibi for him?!

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         Maybe she was blowing him!

                                     CYNTHIA
                         Better him than you.

               Rodriguez grabs her arm and pushes her against the wall. 
               Divinci looks around quickly to see who's watching.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Take it easy.

               Rodriguez angrily throws up his hands and glares at Divinci.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         Fine, I got nothin' at stake here.

               Divinci gives him a look, then leans right up next to Cynthia.

                                     DIVINCI
                         This is what they call an open and 
                         shut case. He did the kill and he's 
                         going down. Don't make the mistake 
                         of thinking you know the right thing 
                         to do.

               Divinci holds out the paper. Cynthia hesitates a beat, then 
               takes it and signs her name.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CELL DOOR - INT. JAIL - DAY

               closing on Joe who is standing in the small CELL, facing the 
               wall, his back to us. The door is locked and we --

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EVIDENCE ROOM - DAY

               as the .44 is placed on a shelf. But this time it's tagged 
               with a different number. M5114000.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         Doe?

               Simms looks across at Rodriguez and Divinci. Capt. Henderson 
               and TWO OTHER DEA AGENTS (HOOPER and SARKASIAN) are also 
               present. The DEA are in suits and ties.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         He wouldn't give us his last name.

                                     SIMMS
                         He signed a confession but he wouldn't 
                         give you his last name?

                                     DIVINCI
                         He said he couldn't remember it.
                              (points to his head)
                         He's a head case.

                                     AGENT HOOPER
                         You run prints?

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         No priors.

                                     AGENT SARKASIAN
                         Ballistics match?

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         We're waiting. But a forty-four was 
                         used in commission. He had a forty-
                         four on him.

                                     AGENT HOOPER
                         It went down pretty quick.

                                     DIVINCI
                         It's our street.

                                     CAPT. HENDERSON
                         I think they did a helluva job.

               Suddenly Simms slams his hand down on the desk.

                                     SIMMS
                         Goddammit!

               Everyone turns to Simms. He's angry. Rodriguez is uneasy.

                                     SIMMS
                         Some goddamn piece a shit blows him 
                         away for NOTHING!

               The intensity of Simms anger quiets everybody. A beat as 
               Simms regains his composure.

                                     SIMMS
                         I'm sorry. Hudd was too good for 
                         this to happen... I just didn't think 
                         he'd go down this way.

               Simms crosses the room to Divinci and Rodriguez.

                                     SIMMS
                         Good work. Thanks.

               He shakes their hands. Then exits. Hooper and Sarkasian follow 
               their boss out the door. Rodriguez, Divinci and Henderson 
               exchange a look.

                                     CAPT. HENDERSON
                         Do me a favor. Make sure this one 
                         sticks. I don't want the D.E.Assholes 
                         back in here.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               HEADLIGHTS (B&W)

               coming right at us. Closer and closer. Filling the screen.

               FLAMES BURST (COLOR)

               from the barrel of a .44 in SLOW MOTION -- a FIREBALL. The 
               GUNSHOT is deafening, like thunder.

               GLASS

               SHATTERS in SLOW MOTION.

               JOE

               covers his face with his hands to protect himself from the 
               glass. But there is no glass. Joe is sweating, detoxing. 
               Wild eyed. He looks through his fingers, but there is no 
               street, no dead man. Just the BARS of his CELL.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               GLASS OF WHISKEY - INT. CYNTHIA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               golden liquid caressing the ice. A hand lifts the glass to 
               red lips. The liquid disappears. Cynthia lowers the glass, 
               staring at it.

                                     DIVINCI'S VOICE (FILTERED)
                         Cynthia... pretty name. What do the 
                         first three letters spell?

               Cynthia suddenly hurls the glass across the room.

               THE GLASS - SLOW MOTIONS

               shatters against the wall. And bits of glass, edges sharp 
               tumble through space like ice.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. POLICE JAIL - CELLBLOCK HALLWAY - DAY

               A GUARD leads a MAN in a dark suit and striped tie down the 
               corridor. He carries a briefcase. Short hair and a beard and 
               wire-rimmed glasses. His name is ELLIOT GOFF.

                                     GUARD
                         Word is he killed a DEA undercover...
                              (no response)
                         Word is he shot him in the face...
                              (no response)
                         Word is he signed a confession.

                                     ELLIOT
                         Word is everyone's entitled to a 
                         defense... no matter how guilty they 
                         are.

               They stop at the cell block door. The guard unlocks the door. 
               INSIDE THE CELL we can see Joe on the floor in fetal position. 
               Shaking from lack of alcohol.

                                     ELLIOT
                         Oh shit.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. INFIRMARY - DAY

               Elliot waits in the hall. Fingers impatiently drumming his 
               briefcase. The door opens and a DOCTOR exits the room.

                                     DOCTOR
                         He's detoxing. I gave him something 
                         to help him through it.

                                     ELLIOT
                         Can I talk to him?

               The doctor nods, opens the door. Elliot enters.

               INT. INFIRMARY - DAY

               Basic first aid station. Joe is on a table. Eyes closed. 
               Elliot walks up. Doctor behind him.

                                     ELLIOT
                         Joe, can you hear me?

               Joe's eyes open.

                                     ELLIOT
                         I'm Elliot Goff. I'm your attorney... 
                         Do you understand what I'm saying?

               Joe's eyes close. Leaving Elliot in the dark.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SMALL COURTROOM - DAY

               Court is in session. Old metropolitan courthouse. The 
               PROSECUTOR and his TEAM are at one table. The DEFENSE ATTORNEY 
               and his CLIENT are at the other.

               The Prosecutor is a woman. Her name is HELEN EDEN. She is 
               thirty-nine. She wears a business suit. RICHARD STEIN is her 
               second in command. Richard is thirty-three.

               The DEFENSE ATTORNEY is fifty and a little on the portly 
               side. His name is JOHN OBLINGER.

               But it's the DEFENDANT that really attracts our attention. 
               His name is CLYDE D. DUNNER. He's done his best to look like 
               a law abiding citizen, but no matter what kind of clothes he 
               wears or how he slicks down his long hair or trims his 
               mustache, this sonuvabitch looks like he'd kill for a nickel. 
               He's on trial for murder. In the first. What a surprise.

               We are in the midst of opening statements. And Helen is 
               keeping the JURY riveted. The presiding Judge is a WOMAN, 
               JUDGE WEINBERG.

                                     HELEN
                         -- when the defendant, Clyde Dunner, 
                         entered the house of George and Carol 
                         Beaman on Friday night, a .44 caliber 
                         pistol in his hand. He entered the 
                         house with one thing in mind. To 
                         kill George and Carol, the people he 
                         blamed for the break up of his 
                         marriage to Carol's sister, Paula.

               The defendant is hardly listening. His attention is on TWO 
               MEN SITTING BEHIND the prosecution table. And he turns to 
               glare at them. The two men are DETECTIVES RODRIGUEZ and 
               DIVINCI.

               Clyde glares at them as if he'd like to get up right now, 
               walk over to them and cut off their heads. Actually, that's 
               what he's thinking. He mouths "You die."

               Divinci mouths back. "Fuck you, prick, asshole, dickhead." 
               Then he smiles. Clyde boils.

                                     HELEN
                         George and Carol were watching a 
                         movie when he entered the living 
                         room and opened fire. George was 
                         killed instantly, hit in the face. 
                         Carol died later of three bullet 
                         wounds to her chest.

               John Oblinger, his attorney, catches Clyde's murderous look 
               and instructs him, with a point of his hand, to pay attention 
               to Helen. Clyde reluctantly turns his gaze from Divinci.

                                     HELEN
                         Then the defendant, in his effort to 
                         cover up the crime, doused them with 
                         lighter fluid and set the house on 
                         fire... Carol was still alive.

               A YOUNG MAN, looking very upset, enters the courtroom, shows 
               i.d. to a GUARD, then makes his way down the aisle. He tries 
               his best to be quiet, not to interrupt Helen's statement.

                                     HELEN
                         Ladies and gentlemen of the jury we 
                         will prove to you, beyond any 
                         reasonable doubt, that the defendant, 
                         Clyde David Dunner, is guilty of two 
                         counts of murder in the first degree.

               Helen looks at the jury for a beat, then returns to her table.

                                     JUDGE WEINBERG
                         The defense may now proceed.

               John Oblinger stands to present his side of the case. But 
               our attention stays with Helen as she approaches the table 
               to find her team in an upset. Their conversation is a tense 
               whisper.

                                     RICHARD STEIN
                         -- Jesus Christ!

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         -- I don't know where?

                                     RICHARD STEIN
                         Are you sure?

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         They looked all over --

                                     HELEN
                         What's wrong?

                                     RICHARD STEIN
                         They can't find the murder weapon.

                                     HELEN
                         What're you talking about?

                                     RICHARD STEIN
                         Dunner's .44. They can't find the 
                         goddamn gun!

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         They lost it or something. Misplaced 
                         it, I don't know. They can't find it 
                         anywhere.

                                     HELEN
                              (no whisper this time)
                         What?!

               A pause in the court. The judge taps his gavel in anger as 
               we --

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Rodriguez, Divinci, Richard Stein, the young man and Helen. 
               Helen is furious.

                                     HELEN
                         -- I don't have a goddamn case without 
                         the goddamn gun. His fingerprints, 
                         the ballistics, everything! I have 
                         to have the fucking gun or he's gonna 
                         walk. That murdering piece of filth 
                         will go free without the .44. How 
                         could they lose it?!

               Rodriguez and Divinci exchange a look.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         The Dunner gun, you used the fucking

                         This is not my fuck up! Our shooting 
                         was supposed to be gang-related and 
                         unsolved! Only because we tagged a 
                         goddamn undercover cop do we need 
                         the fucking .44 for evidence! 
                         Otherwise, we never woulda needed 
                         it. So don't point your finger at

                         supposed to explain how the same gun 
                         was used in two murder cases by two 
                         different killers when it was supposed 
                         to be in police custody?!

                                     DIVINCI
                         We don't explain it. It's not our 
                         fault they lost the evidence. 
                         Ballistics are already complete in 
                         Dunner's case. All we need is another 
                         gun.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               as it opens, revealing a DOZEN different HANDGUNS.

                                     THE GUN SELLER
                         All my merchandise is in top 
                         condition. Untraceable. The best 
                         money can buy.

               A BLACK MAN in a three piece suit, picks up the .44 with a 
               GLOVED HAND. His accent is British.

                                     THE GUN SELLER
                         It's got good knock down, but it's 
                         slow. Unless you have a preference 
                         for revolvers, I suggest a nine 
                         millimeter auto. They are more 
                         expensive, but what they cost in 
                         money, they save in time.

               Rodriguez and Divinci look down at the gun.

                                     DIVINCI
                         The .44.

               The gun seller eyes them for a moment.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         What?

                                     THE GUN SELLER
                         You look like police.

               Divinci and Rodriguez stare at the gun seller. Then he smiles.

                                     THE GUN SELLER
                         No offense.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. JAIL - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

               Elliot is waiting, sitting at a table, staring at papers in 
               his open briefcase. Door opens and a GUARD leads Joe into 
               the room. Joe looks better, for the first time. His hair is 
               combed. And he's clean. He wears jail blues. But he is a 
               little gaunt. And tired. Elliot stands. The guard shuts the 
               door, leaving them alone.

                                     ELLIOT
                         Joe, I'm Elliot, we met the other... 
                         well, you weren't in very good shape. 
                         You look much better.

               Joe just stares at Elliot.

                                     ELLIOT
                         Have a chair. We need to talk.

                                     WILLIAM
                         About what I did.

                                     ELLIOT
                         Yes.

               Joe crosses to the table and takes a chair opposite Elliot.

                                     ELLIOT
                         Joe, before we get into what happened 
                         that night, I'd like to check a couple 
                         of things first.
                              (looks at papers)
                         Joe is your first name, I assume 
                         Joseph?

                                     WILLIAM
                         Okay.

               Okay? Not the answer Elliot was looking for.

                                     ELLIOT
                         What about Doe? Is that what you 
                         told the officers your last name 
                         was?

                                     WILLIAM
                         I don't think so.

                                     ELLIOT
                         What did you tell them your last 
                         name was?

                                     WILLIAM
                         I don't remember.

                                     ELLIOT
                         Well, is Doe your last name?

                                     WILLIAM
                         I'm not sure.

               Elliot stares at Joe. This is going to be a little more 
               difficult than he thought.

                                     ELLIOT
                         Do you know what your last name is?

                                     WILLIAM
                         I don't remember.

                                     ELLIOT
                         Joe, I'm your attorney, I'm here to 
                         help you. It doesn't matter if you 
                         give the court your last name or 
                         not, they will still put you on trial. 
                         Do you understand?

                                     WILLIAM
                         Yes.

                                     ELLIOT
                         So there's no reason to try and hide 
                         your identity.
                              (Joe nods)
                         What is your last name?

                                     WILLIAM
                         I would tell you if I could remember.

                                     ELLIOT
                         Joe Smith, Joe Jones, Joe DiMaggio...

               Elliot hopes he can trigger a response. Joe tries hard.

                                     WILLIAM
                         ...I don't think so.

                                     ELLIOT
                         Okay. Look, we'll move on. You 
                         understand the charges against you. 
                         They're serious. And if you are found 
                         guilty, you could go to prison for a 
                         very long time.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Maybe I should.

                                     ELLIOT
                         What?

                                     WILLIAM
                         Go to prison. I killed him. I didn't 
                         mean to. But he was going to hit me.

                                     ELLIOT
                         Yes, I know, I read your confession. 
                         Joe, if you really felt your life 
                         was in danger, we might be able to 
                         use self-defense as our argument. 
                         But before we get into that... Do 
                         you have any family, Joe? Any friends?

                                     WILLIAM
                         I don't think so.

                                     ELLIOT
                         Joe... do you know what a psychiatrist 
                         is?

                                     WILLIAM
                         Yes.

                                     ELLIOT
                         Have you ever seen a psychiatrist?

                                     WILLIAM
                         ...I'm not sure.

                                     ELLIOT
                         Joe, you don't remember much about 
                         yourself.

                                     WILLIAM
                         No.

                                     ELLIOT
                         ...but you remember the night you 
                         shot the man in the car.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Yes.

                                     ELLIOT
                         Why?

                                     WILLIAM
                         ...because... I can... I'm sorry, 
                         I'm not much help.

               Elliot stares at Joe, then looks down at the blank page in 
               front of him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SMALL COURTROOM - DAY

               The trial of Clyde D. Dunner in progress. Prosecution team 
               at their table. Defense team at their table. JUDGE WEINBERG 
               at the bench. Divinci on the stand. Clyde glaring at him. 
               And Jury listening to Helen on the floor, prosecuting with 
               vigor.

                                     HELEN
                         -- and when you approached the suspect 
                         in his apartment, did you identify 
                         yourself as a police officer?

                                     DIVINCI
                         Yes.

                                     HELEN
                         Did the suspect respond?

                                     DIVINCI
                         Yes, he did?

                                     HELEN
                         In what way?

                                     DIVINCI
                         He started shooting through the door.

                                     HELEN
                         The Defendant fired six times, until 
                         his gun was empty. We would like to 
                         show you the weapon he used.

               Helen crosses to the prosecution table, picks up the .44. 
               She holds it up for the jury to see.

                                     HELEN
                         And we would like to enter it into 
                         court records. It was the same Smith 
                         and Wesson revolver he used to 
                         viciously murder George and Carol 
                         Beaman.

               The .44 is duly entered into the records.

               CLYDE

               glances at "his" .44 as it passes into the BAILIFF'S HANDS. 
               It's a .44 all right.

                                     HELEN
                         The prosecution would like to call 
                         Mr. Steven J. Allen to the stand.

                         Steven J. Allen.

               STEVEN J. ALLEN, a short balding bespectacled man in his 
               fifties, crosses to the witness box where he is sworn in, 
               then sits.

                                     HELEN
                         Mr. Allen, would tell the court what 
                         you do.

                                     STEVEN J. ALLEN
                         I am a lab technician for the police 
                         department. One of my duties is to 
                         examine weapons used in violent 
                         crimes.

               Clyde's attention is on Helen's LEGS. He's bored by the 
               proceedings, but something suddenly strikes him. He looks at --

               THE .44 SMITH AND WESSON

               -- on the evidence table. There is no BLACK STAIN on the 
               handle.

                                     STEVEN J. ALLEN
                         I tested the defendant's revolver 
                         and matched the bullets fired to the 
                         bullets removed from the deceased.

                                     CLYDE
                         That ain't my gun.

               All attention turns to Clyde. His attorney, the judge, the 
               jury, Helen, everybody is surprised by the sudden statement.

                                     JUDGE WEINBERG
                         I must remind the defendant that he 
                         is not to speak out when --

                                     CLYDE
                         That ain't my gun!

               The Judge taps her gavel. John Oblinger puts a hand on Clyde's 
               arm. Clyde pulls it away. And now things happen very fast.

                                     CLYDE
                         THAT AIN'T MY FUCKIN' GUN!

               And Clyde is moving toward the gun. And the Bailiff and GUARDS 
               are moving toward Clyde. And Helen is moving out of the way. 
               And the Judge is standing, banging her gavel. And the jury 
               is scared.

                                     CLYDE
                         YOU'RE TRYIN' TO FUCKIN' FRAME ME!

               Clyde grabs for the gun as the bailiff and guards grab for 
               Clyde. Clyde turns and decks the bailiff and all hell breaks 
               lose.

                                     CLYDE

               Door slams open. Rodriguez and Divinci enter. Rodriguez 
               quickly checks all the stalls as Divinci closes the door. 
               They are alone. When Rodriguez finishes with the stalls --

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         We gotta put the right gun back.

                                     DIVINCI
                         We can't put the right gun back! 
                         Without that gun, they won't convict 
                         Joe.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         Without that gun they won't convict 
                         Clyde!

                                     DIVINCI
                         I'm not worried about Clyde, I'm 
                         worried about us!

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         Look, Joe's never goin' to trial, 
                         right. He signed a goddamn confession! 
                         Like you said, this one is open and 
                         shut. Clyde's the one we gotta worry 
                         about. We can't let him go back on 
                         the street! He's a fuckin' psychopath. 
                         He'll kill somebody again.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Shit. How the hell did that piece of 
                         puke know it wasn't his fuckin' gun?! 
                         I don't think he knows his own fuckin' 
                         mother, but he knows his fuckin' 
                         gun!

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         I don't think that's important right 
                         now.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               The harried Desk Officer is filling out his usual paper work 
               when Divinci and Rodriguez approach. Divinci knocks on the 
               door. The desk officer looks up. He's had a tough day.

                                     DESK OFFICER
                         Sorry, Divinci, can't do it.

                         What d'you mean you can't do it? I 
                         gotta check something.

               INT. SMALL COURTROOM - DAY

               Joe's preliminary trial. Joe is seated at the defense table 
               with Elliot. ANOTHER JUDGE, JUDGE HAROLD PINE, is behind the 
               bench. No jury. This is a preliminary hearing to determine 
               if there's enough evidence for Joe to stand trail. Elliot is 
               shuffling papers in preparation for his opening.

               And at the prosecution table is a very tired Helen. She looks 
               completely pissed off and worn out. In no mood for anything 
               to go wrong.

                                     JUDGE HAROLD PINE
                         Whenever you're ready.

               Elliot stands.

                                     ELLIOT
                         We would like to plead not guilty to 
                         the charge of murder at this time 
                         for reason of Insanity.

               Helen gives Elliot a look. She doesn't need this.

                                     WILLIAM
                         But I did it.

               Elliot turns to Joe.

                                     ELLIOT
                         Yes, Joe. Let me handle this.

                                     WILLIAM
                         But I signed the confession.

                                     ELLIOT
                         Yes, Joe. Don't worry about it. I'm 
                         the attorney.

                                     HELEN
                         Your honor, can we have a moment?

                                     JUDGE HAROLD PINE
                         Council may approach the bench.

               Helen and Elliot cross to the bench.

                                     HELEN
                         Your honor, my colleague's client 
                         admits to the killing. I don't see 
                         any reason to go through a trial 
                         when it's obvious he would like to 
                         plead guilty.

                                     ELLIOT
                         I don't agree.

                                     HELEN
                         If he wants to plead guilty, you 
                         have to let him plead guilty.

                                     ELLIOT
                         Not if he's not of sound mind.

                                     HELEN
                         Come on, Elliot!

                                     ELLIOT
                         I think he's crazy. I know you think 
                         he's just putting it on, that's D.A. 
                         standard procedure, but I don't think 
                         he is. So, your honor, I'm standing 
                         by the not guilty because I believe 
                         he's incapable of making that 
                         judgment.

                                     JUDGE HAROLD PINE
                         Have you had a psychiatrist look at 
                         him?

                                     ELLIOT
                         Yes, your honor.
                              (hands him papers)
                         I think you'll see that my diagnosis 
                         is not without warrant.

               The judge hesitates, then looks at Joe. Joe is staring at 
               him.

                                     JUDGE HAROLD PINE
                         I'll review the findings and make my 
                         decision tomorrow.

                                     ELLIOT
                         Thank you, your honor.
                              (to Helen)
                         Besides, I hear there's a good chance 
                         of beating the charges for lack of 
                         evidence.

               Helen's look turns icy.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Dark, smoky. Not a place for the health-conscious. Rodriguez 
               and Divinci at a corner booth. Both with scotch and waters.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Nobody can connect us to the evidence 
                         thing... we're clean there.

               Rodriguez is quiet.

                                     DIVINCI
                         The most important one is this DEA 
                         mess anyway. Once that's finished, 
                         we're completely in the clear.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         You know we can't do it anymore.

                                     DIVINCI
                         ...yeah, I guess.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         No, we're through. That's it.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Good while it lasted though. A hundred 
                         grand apiece. Not bad for a few nights 
                         work.

               Divinci lifts his glass in a toast to himself, drinks.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         I just wanna get through this.

                                     DIVINCI
                         We're gonna get through it. No 
                         evidence problems on this one.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         I hope not... I don't know, Frank, 
                         lately I been thinkin'... maybe what 
                         we did wasn't such a good idea.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Hey, we took out a few scumbags, 
                         that's it. Nobody's ever gonna miss 
                         those shitheels. They were all pieces 
                         of garbage. Not one of 'em had a 
                         sheet less than a mile long. Drugs, 
                         extortion, assault. They were all 
                         fuckin' guilty as hell and still on 
                         the street, you know that.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         Except the cop.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Yeah, except the cop. That's part of 
                         the job. Could just as easily have 
                         happened to you or me.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         But we're cops, you know? We fucked 
                         up.

                                     DIVINCI
                         We fucked up once. Once outa ten. 
                         That's not bad.
                              (a beat)
                         I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry. He was 
                         in the wrong place at the wrong time, 
                         what can I say. I'm not goin' down 
                         for it.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         I know.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Look, if we got paid a decent salary 
                         we wouldn't be tempted by this, right? 
                         And what happens when we retire? You 
                         think our pension's gonna take care 
                         of us? Shit no. We are on our own. I 
                         mean all I want in life is a goddamn 
                         fishing boat, a beach, a couple drinks 
                         and some Hawaiian fuckin' music. 
                         That ain't much for twenty years 
                         putting murdering assholes behind 
                         bars. I mean, the dealers, the pimps, 
                         the killers, they got no rules. We 
                         got all the fuckin' rules. It ain't 
                         fair. That's all I'm sayin', it ain't 
                         fair... For awhile, we made it fair.

               Rodriguez downs his scotch.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Quit thinkin' you're a bad guy. You're 
                         not a fuckin' bad guy. You made one 
                         mistake. Let it go.

               Rodriguez nods. A WAITRESS comes to the table. Rodriguez 
               orders another. The Waitress leaves. Rodriguez hesitates a 
               moment, then --

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         Do you think we're corrupt?

                                     DIVINCI
                         Hey, I never took a fuckin' bribe in 
                         my life.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         Me either.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Nobody ever bought me.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         I know.

                                     DIVINCI
                         No fuckin' way. Even the thought 
                         makes me sick. And what we did has 
                         nothing to do with being corrupt. 
                         It's two completely different things. 
                         Don't get 'em confused.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         I guess you're right.

                                     DIVINCI
                         I'm telling you. It's nothin' to do 
                         with corrupt.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         I'm worried, that's all.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Hey, you gotta worry a little. It's 
                         natural. Just don't lose your sense 
                         of humor.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         My sense of humor, right.

                                     DIVINCI
                         The problem with people is, nobody 
                         gives a shit about makin' the world 
                         a better place. You and me, I don't 
                         care what anybody says, we made the 
                         world a better place. No matter what 
                         happens. There are ten less drug 
                         dealin' assholes on the street today 
                         because of us. They're not plea 
                         bargainin' their way back onto the 
                         street, they're not clogging up the 
                         courts, and they're not costing the 
                         tax payers a fuckin' penny because 
                         they're not in prison. They were 
                         garbage. And there's nothin' wrong 
                         with takin' out the garbage.

               Divinci downs his scotch. Rodriguez nods, then --

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         So, you think you'll get back with 
                         Caroline?

                                     DIVINCI
                         Shit. Nothin' I ever do is good 
                         enough, you know?

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         Never is, never was, never will be.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Guess I gotta make the effort. It's 
                         gonna cost me if I don't.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         Tell me about it. You know how much 
                         I got left.

                                     DIVINCI
                         You're gonna think I'm an idiot, 
                         but... I like Cynthia. There's no 
                         bullshit with her. I just fuckin' 
                         like her.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         I think you just like fuckin' her.

               Rodriguez smiles. Divinci looks at him for a beat, then --

                                     DIVINCI
                         Yeah, that, too.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               COP GUNNED DOWN BY UNDERCOVER KILLER. We PAN AROUND to 
               Cynthia, sitting in her kitchen, staring at the photograph.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         What the hell, Joe, at least you 
                         won't get run over.

               She folds up the paper and throws it in the trash can.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SMALL COURTROOM - DAY

               The Dunner trial. The JURY is back. Helen, Judge Weinberg, 
               Clyde D. Dunner (who now sports a couple bandages to his 
               head), his attorney John Oblinger -- they're all waiting for 
               the verdict.

                                     JUDGE WEINBERG
                         The defendant will stand and face 
                         the jury.

               Clyde stands.

                                     JUDGE
                         What is your verdict?

                                     JURY FOREMAN
                         We find the defendant, Clyde David 
                         Dunner, not guilty.

               Helen closes her eyes in defeat. Clyde smiles.

                                     CLYDE
                         Fuckin' A!

               INT. HOMICIDE DIVISION - DAY

               Divinci is on the phone.

                                     DIVINCI
                         -- when was the last time you saw 
                         him? -- Uh-huh -- And you haven't 
                         seen him since then?

               Rodriguez suddenly strides up. He looks panicked.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         We gotta talk.

                                     DIVINCI
                              (into phone)
                         Just a second.
                              (covers phone)
                         Calm down. I heard. Clyde walked.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         No!
                              (leans in close)
                         They're takin' Joe to trial.

               Divinci stares at Rodriguez for a beat, the reality of his 
               statement taking a moment to fully slam home.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         They found him mentally unable to 
                         plead so his attorney pleaded not 
                         guilty by reason of insanity.

                                     DIVINCI
                         You gotta be kiddin' me.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         Yeah, that's me, I love to make people 
                         laugh. You hear the one about the 
                         two cops who popped the undercover 
                         DEA?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. STRIP JOINT - NIGHT

               Cynthia on stage, in the middle of her routine. Hoots and 
               whistles from the all MALE CROWD. But she's not really into 
               her performance tonight. She pulls off the last of her 
               clothing to APPLAUSE and CHEERS.

               INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

               Cynthia enters. An ASIAN MAN in sweat shirt and jeans is 
               sitting in the room.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         Who the hell're you and what the 
                         fuck are you doing in here?!
                              (calls down hall)
                         HEY, BOB, I GOT AN ASSHOLE IN THE 
                         DRESSING ROOM.
                              (to the man)
                         I suggest you get out before Bob 
                         gets here. He doesn't like assholes.

                                     ASIAN MAN
                         You're Cynthia Webb.

                                     CYNTHIA
                              (calls down hall)
                         BOB!

               The Asian Man stands.

                                     ASIAN MAN
                         But you are Cynthia Webb the famous 
                         dancer, yes?

                                     CYNTHIA
                         Yeah, yeah, nice try, get out.

               The man moves toward her, pulling a PAPER from his pocket. 
               He hands it to her.

                                     ASIAN MAN
                         I liked your show very much.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         What the hell's this?!

               He exits. No answer. Cynthia stares at the paper --

                                     CYNTHIA
                         A subpoena?! For what?! I didn't do 
                         anything!

               But the man is gone. BOB, a HUGE BOUNCER, tears past, giving 
               chase.

                                     CYNTHIA
                              (staring at paper)
                         Oh shit... oh shit. He served me! He 
                         fuckin' served me!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Dark, quiet. PHONE RINGS. A hand picks up the phone.

                                     MAN'S VOICE
                         Hello.

                         Detective Divinci?

                                     DIVINCI
                         Yeah.

                                     ANOTHER MAN'S VOICE
                         This is Sergeant Gardner down at the 
                         station.

               INTERCUT WITH SERGEANT - INT. HOMICIDE DIVISION - NIGHT

               The station is alive with activity. Even at this early hour. 
               HOOKERS, PIMPS, PUSHERS, DRUNK DRIVERS. Some being booked, 
               some being released, some being obnoxious.

                                     SERGEANT GARDNER
                         Sorry to call so late, but I got a 
                         hysterical woman here says she needs 
                         to talk to you about a murder.

               Divinci turns on the light revealing a WOMAN in bed with 
               him. He picks up his watch, looks at the time.

                                     SERGEANT GARDNER
                         I told her I couldn't call you at 
                         home, but she said that it was very 
                         important. A matter of, you know, 
                         life and death.

                                     DIVINCI
                         What's her name?

                                     SERGEANT GARDNER
                         Cynthia.

               Divinci perks up at the name.

               And now we SEE Cynthia in the POLICE STATION trying not to 
               look as freaked out as she feels. But she's not holding 
               together well.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Tell her to wait, I'll be right down.

               Divinci hangs up. Starts to dress. The woman groans.

                                     WOMAN
                         What the hell're you doing?

                                     DIVINCI
                         I gotta go down to the station.

                                     WOMAN
                         Now? What time is it?

                                     DIVINCI
                         Go back to sleep.

                                     WOMAN
                         Frank, this is no way to repair our 
                         marriage, you know?

               She pulls the covers over her head. Divinci pulls on his 
               pants.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. POLICE STATION - 3:38 A.M.

               Divinci pushes into the room. Sees Cynthia sitting on the 
               bench, looking nervous as hell. Smoking, tapping her foot, 
               looking around. Just this side of a wreck.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Hey!

               Cynthia sees him and is immediately on her feet, moving to 
               him.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         Frank, I can't do this. He came to 
                         the club. You gotta --

                                     DIVINCI
                         Not here!

               He takes her arm, leads her out of the station.

               INT. POLICE STATION PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

               Divinci leads Cynthia out of the station to his car.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         I thought you said all I had to do 
                         was pick him out?! That's what you 
                         said, that's all I had to do. I did 
                         what you said. But that was supposed 
                         to be all.

                                     DIVINCI
                         SHUT UP!

               He opens the driver's door, pushes her in. Gets in behind 
               her.

               INT. UNMARKED CAR - NIGHT

               Cynthia is a bundle of nerves. Divinci slams the door. Cynthia 
               is startled by the suddenness of his anger.

                                     DIVINCI
                         What're you talkin' about?

               Cynthia opens her purse and pulls out the subpoena.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         They want me in court.

               Divinci glances at the papers.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         You promised me I wasn't gonna have 
                         to do anything! What the hell is 
                         goin' on?!

               This is yet another glitch that Divinci hadn't counted on.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         I can't do this, Frank. I can't go 
                         into court. I'm gettin' outa here!

                                     DIVINCI
                         You are not getting outa here!

                                     CYNTHIA
                         Well I can't go to court! THAT'S NOT 
                         WHAT YOU SAID I'D HAVE TO DO!

                                     DIVINCI
                         WELL THIS WASN'T SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN! 
                         NOW JUST FUCKIN' CALM DOWN FOR A 
                         SECOND AND LET ME THINK!

               Cynthia glares at him, then turns away, takes a drag and 
               blows out the smoke.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         Fine. Think away.

               Divinci hesitates as ANOTHER CAR pulls out. Then turns to 
               her.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Look, you're a witness, that's all. 
                         You got nothin' to worry about. You 
                         saw something happen --

                                     CYNTHIA
                         -- What?! What did I see?!

                                     DIVINCI
                         I will tell you everything you gotta 
                         know. You understand? Everything. 
                         You will know exactly what to say.

               Cynthia looks at Divinci, unsure. Divinci gives her a 
               confident smile. Look, it's another stage, that's all. Just 
               like dancin'.

               THE UNMARKED CAR

               pulls quickly out of the PARKING GARAGE.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. JAIL - MEETING ROOM - DAY

               Elliot is waiting. The guard opens the door and Joe enters. 
               Joe is looking better. Getting him off booze has helped 
               immensely.

                                     ELLIOT
                         Hi, Joe. You're looking much better.

                                     WILLIAM
                         I guess jail's been good for me.

               Elliot nods, motions for Joe to take a chair.

                                     ELLIOT
                         Trial date's been set for Thursday.

                                     WILLIAM
                         I've been thinking about what I did... 
                         and I don't think it's right that I 
                         try getting off.

                                     ELLIOT
                         Excuse me?

                                     WILLIAM
                         I want to plead guilty. I killed a 
                         man and I should be punished.

                                     ELLIOT
                         ...I'm a little surprised.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Why?

                                     ELLIOT
                         Nobody ever wants to be punished for 
                         what they've done. It's just a new 
                         concept. But I still think our defense 
                         is reasonable. I don't believe, under 
                         the condition you were in, that you 
                         were responsible for your actions.

                                     WILLIAM
                         But why was I carrying a gun? I had 
                         no right to carry a gun.

                                     ELLIOT
                         If you hadn't been carrying the gun, 
                         you might be dead.

                                     WILLIAM
                         And he might be alive.

                                     ELLIOT
                         I understand... Can I think about 
                         this?

                                     WILLIAM
                         No. I've made up my mind.

               Elliot stares at Joe for a beat, then we --

                                                                    CUT TO:

               YELLOW CRIME SCENE TAPE - EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

               TWO MURDER VICTIMS lying in the street. POLICE OFFICERS have 
               the area under control. A few CURIOUS PEOPLE have stopped to 
               watch. An UNMARKED CAR pulls up. Stops.

               INT. UNMARKED CAR - DAY

               Parked. Rodriguez behind the wheel. Divinci next to him.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         What if she takes off?

                                     DIVINCI
                         Then we got no goddamn witness puts 
                         him at the scene.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         And what happens if she testifies 
                         and nobody fuckin' believes her?

                                     DIVINCI
                         Perjury, maybe. But that's a fifty 
                         fifty. They might believe her.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         Shit, Frank, she's a goddamn stripper 
                         for Chrissake, who's gonna believe 
                         her. I don't believe her when she's 
                         telling the truth!

               An OFFICER walks to the car and knocks on the window. Divinci 
               rolls it down.

                                     DIVINCI
                         What?

                                     OFFICER
                         Ahh, we got two bodies out here and 
                         three more in the house.

                                     DIVINCI
                         So?

                                     OFFICER
                         I was just wondering if you were 
                         gonna be the primary on this one, 
                         that's all.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Yeah, yeah, we're comin'. Just give 
                         us some room.

               Divinci rolls the window back up. The officer backs off.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         She could blow the whole thing. She 
                         could tie us in and that would be 
                         it. We'd be fuckin' fried.

                                     DIVINCI
                         If it looks like she's gonna crumble 
                         we'll take steps.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         What steps?

               Divinci looks at Rodriguez.

                                     DIVINCI
                         One more chalk outline more or less 
                         in this city who's gonna know?

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         Oh shit, Frank.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Hey, hey, you think I like this?!

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         We just can't go around killin' 
                         everybody!

                                     DIVINCI
                         Just a second. Look around. Whatta 
                         we got here? Two stiffs on the street, 
                         shot to shit, three more inside. 
                         That's five chalk lines in one night 
                         in one deal in one neighborhood in 
                         one city. Let me fill you in on some 
                         statistics, we're not killin' 
                         everybody.
                              (a beat, then --)
                         Look, this is strictly last resort. 
                         Okay? But let's not kid ourselves. 
                         If push comes to shove, somebody has 
                         to go down. If you got another 
                         candidate, I'm willin' to listen.

               Rodriguez is silent. Divinci opens the door. Rodriguez watches 
               him, then he follows. To the scene of another crime.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CYNTHIA'S APARTMENT - DAY

               Cynthia is in the kitchen, making herself a peanut butter 
               and jelly sandwich as she watches Sally Jesse Raphael 
               interview yet another moron on television. The phone rings. 
               She takes a bite of the sandwich as she picks up and mumbles --

                                     CYNTHIA
                         Hello.

               INTERCUT WITH INT. OFFICE - D.A.'S DEPARTMENT - DAY

               Richard Stein, the attorney, is on the phone. His office is 
               cluttered with the myriad of case files he's forced to juggle.

                                     RICHARD STEIN
                         Cynthia Webb?

                                     CYNTHIA
                              (swallows)
                         ...yeah.

                                     RICHARD STEIN
                         I'm Richard Stein with the District 
                         Attorney's office. You're a witness 
                         in a case we're handling and I'd 
                         like to talk to you as soon as 
                         possible.

               Cynthia puts down the sandwich, her appetite suddenly gone.

                                     RICHARD STEIN
                         Ms Webb?

                                     CYNTHIA
                         Yeah.

                                     RICHARD STEIN
                         Any chance we could get together 
                         today?

                                     CYNTHIA
                              (nervous)
                         I'm ah... pretty busy.

                                     RICHARD STEIN
                         It won't take long. Will you be home 
                         about two?
                              (no answer)
                         Ms Webb?

                                     CYNTHIA
                         Yeah, okay... two.

                                     RICHARD STEIN
                         Good. Let me make sure I've got your 
                         correct address.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SUITCASE - INT. CYNTHIA'S BEDROOM - DAY

               as clothes are stuffed into it. The suitcase is slammed shut. 
               And Cynthia heads for the door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MANSION - DAY

               A BLACK CONVERTIBLE MERCEDES pulls into the circular, gated 
               drive of the large two story home on immense manicured 
               grounds. A BMW is parked in front of the FOUR CAR GARAGE. It 
               is being waxed by car care specialists. The Mercedes stops 
               and a MAN gets out. He has gray hair and expensive clothes. 
               He carries a briefcase and heads for the front door. His 
               name is ARTHUR BAYLOR.

               EXT. MANSION - PATIO - DAY

               A BUTLER shows Arthur to the patio where another MAN, NATHAN 
               MCCALL, is seated behind a table, reviewing documents. McCall 
               is fifty-five, wears glasses.

                                     BUTLER
                         Mr. Baylor is here.

               McCall looks up, smiles.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Arthur.

               Arthur crosses. The two men shake hands.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Nathan. How are you?

                                     WILLIAM
                         Good, Arthur, thanks. Would you like 
                         some coffee, juice.

                                     ARTHUR
                         No, I'm fine.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Well, this is all a bit of a mystery. 
                         You certainly got my attention with 
                         your phone call. What's this all 
                         about?

               Arthur removes a NEWSPAPER from his briefcase. Opens it. 
               Revealing the PHOTOGRAPH OF JOE and the headline: UNDERCOVER 
               COP GUNNED DOWN BY UNDERCOVER KILLER. McCall looks at the 
               paper.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Is there something you want me to 
                         see?

               Arthur points at the photograph. McCall looks. A beat, then --

                                     WILLIAM
                         Oh my God.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BUS STATION - DAY

               Cynthia boards a greyhound. Getting the hell out of Dodge.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CYNTHIA'S APARTMENT - DAY

               We HEAR a key in the lock. The door opens and Divinci enters. 
               He looks around.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Cynthia.

               He moves into the bedroom. Sees clothes strewn around and a 
               half empty closet.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Shit!

               He heads back into the living room. Pulls open the door and 
               almost runs into Richard Stein who was just about to knock.

                                     DIVINCI
                              (startled)
                         Jesus!

               Richard Stein is just as startled and it takes him a moment 
               to recognize --

                                     RICHARD STEIN
                         Divinci?

               Divinci is caught off guard.

                                     RICHARD STEIN
                         Richard Stein, D.A.'s office.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Oh, yeah, sorry. I didn't expect -- 
                         what're you doing here?

                                     RICHARD STEIN
                         I have to talk with Cynthia Webb. A 
                         witness in -- well, wait, aren't you 
                         and Detective Rodriguez on this one?

                                     DIVINCI
                              (vamping)
                         Yeah, yeah, that's why I'm here. I 
                         wanted to go over some of the details.

                                     RICHARD STEIN
                         Me, too. Is she there?

                                     DIVINCI
                         No.

                                     RICHARD STEIN
                         I was supposed to meet her at two.
                              (looks at watch)
                         Do you know her?

                                     DIVINCI
                         What d'you mean?

                                     RICHARD STEIN
                         Well, I just mean, if she's not 
                         here... you were...
                              (a little awkward)
                         ...inside.

                                     DIVINCI
                              (forces a smile)
                         Oh, yeah, the legal thing. Well, 
                         she's a witness in a murder case. 
                         And when they don't answer a knock 
                         and the door's open, it's my 
                         experience, you know. I like to make 
                         sure there's no dead bodies layin' 
                         around.
                              (pulls door shut)
                         Don't tell on me.

                                     RICHARD STEIN
                         No, no, of course not... Well, maybe 
                         I should wait. She might be stuck in 
                         traffic or something.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Yeah. If she shows up, let me know. 
                         I'd like to talk to her, too.

                                     RICHARD STEIN
                         Of course.

               Divinci looks at Stein for a beat, then smiles and --

                                     DIVINCI
                         See you in court.

                                     RICHARD STEIN
                         Right.

               Divinci heads down the walkway. Richard Stein watches him 
               for a moment, then looks at the closed door, then at his 
               watch.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ELLIOT'S OFFICE - DAY

               Elliot's office is a cramped space in the PUBLIC DEFENDERS 
               FLOOR of the CRIMINAL COURTS BUILDING. A buzz of activity 
               outside. The staff is overworked, underpaid and 
               underappreciated. Elliot is reviewing legal documents. Knock 
               on the door.

                                     ELLIOT
                         Yeah.

               The door opens and Arthur Baylor enters.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Elliot Goff?

               Elliot looks up and suddenly recognizes --

                                     ELLIOT
                         Arthur Baylor?

                                     ARTHUR
                         Yes.

               Elliot is stunned and flattered. He stands quickly.

                                     ELLIOT
                         Arthur Baylor, oh my God. I ahh, 
                         would you ahh... are you here to see 
                         me?

                                     ARTHUR
                         Yes.

               Arthur shuts the door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. JAIL - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

               Door opens. Joe is lead into the room by the JAIL GUARD. Joe 
               looks even better now. His stay in jail has broken his 
               dependency on alcohol. His hair is clean and combed. And 
               he's not as depressed. He stops upon seeing Elliot and Arthur 
               at the table. Both men stand. The guard shuts the door. Arthur 
               looks at Joe for a moment, then says --

                                     ARTHUR
                         William.

               Joe stares at Arthur as if fighting a lost memory, then --

                                     WILLIAM
                         ...yes.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DISTRICT ATTORNEY - HELEN'S OFFICE - DAY

                                     HELEN
                         What are you telling me?!

               Richard Stein is facing a not very happy Helen. She is seated 
               behind her desk stacked high with case files.

                                     HELEN
                         She missed the appointment? She forget 
                         you were coming? What?!

                                     RICHARD STEIN
                         If you want my best guess, I'd say 
                         she split.

                                     HELEN
                         She split, our witness split... Can't 
                         we keep our evidence and witnesses 
                         from disappearing around here? I 
                         mean what do I have to do, lock them 
                         in the trunk of my car? What the 
                         fuck is going on?! I want that bitch 
                         back here and on the stand or in 
                         jail!

               Richard Stein nods quickly.

                                     RICHARD STEIN
                         I'll get her.

               And he exits fast. He doesn't like it when his boss is pissed. 
               And right now his boss is really pissed.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BAIL BOND OFFICE - DAY

               A seedy side street near the courthouse and jail. The unmarked 
               car pulls up and Divinci gets out.

               INT. BAIL BOND OFFICE - DAY

               The interior is sparse. Several FRAMED FIGHT POSTERS on the 
               walls. All with MANNY LADREW, a young tough fighter in the 
               featherweight division, in his best pose, explaining where 
               and when the next bout will be -- but all these posters are 
               at least fifteen years old.

               Two desks. One for the secretary, who is on vacation, and 
               the other for MANNY LADREW, the ex-pugilist. He's put on 
               some pounds in the intervening years, plus an added thin 
               mustache. Manny is on the phone --

                                     MANNY
                         -- yeah, uh-huh.
                              (takes notes)
                         Why you think he'd go there?

               Divinci enters.

                                     DIVINCI
                         We need to talk.

                                     MANNY
                              (covers phone)
                         Just a second.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Not just a second, now!

               Manny glares at Divinci. He doesn't like Divinci, never has, 
               never will. But he's a cop. Cop's you have to make room for.

                                     MANNY
                              (into phone)
                         I'll call you back.
                              (hangs up)
                         What d'you want, Divinci?

               Divinci pulls some papers out of his pocket, hands them to 
               Manny.

                                     DIVINCI
                         I got a witness who took off. I gotta 
                         get her back. I don't got a lotta 
                         time.

                                     MANNY
                         You're the fuckin' police. What're 
                         you comin' to me for?!

                                     DIVINCI
                         Don't ask fuckin' questions, you 
                         just find her!

               Manny, annoyed, looks at the papers -- photo of Cynthia 
               included.

                         Where've I seen her before?

                                     DIVINCI
                         She dances.

                                     MANNY
                         Yeah, right, okay. So what'd she 
                         take off for?

                                     DIVINCI
                         I said --

                                     MANNY
                         -- I know what you fuckin' said, but 
                         you want me to find her I gotta know 
                         why the fuck she took off! So I know 
                         where not to look! Okay?!

                                     DIVINCI
                         ...she's supposed to testify. She 
                         got scared, thinks somebody might 
                         kill her, so she's hidin'. That's 
                         why I want you to find her. If 
                         somebody is tryin' to pop her, I 
                         don't want anyone knowin' where she 
                         is. Manny eyes Divinci. He doesn't 
                         believe anything anybody tells him. 
                         Especially in his business.

                                     MANNY
                         How long I got?

                                     DIVINCI
                         Two days.

                                     MANNY
                         Shit, two fuckin' days!

                                     DIVINCI
                         Find her, puss head.

               Divinci glares at Manny, then exits. Manny watches him leave.

                                     MANNY
                         Sure, Detective. Always like to help

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LARGE COURTROOM - DAY

               Joe (William) is lead into the courtroom by GUARDS. Takes 
               his place at the DEFENSE TABLE which includes Elliot and TWO 
               YOUNG ATTORNEYS. The PROSECUTION TABLE, which includes Richard 
               Stein and Helen is going over last minute minutia.

               PEOPLE are taking seats in the gallery. But another attorney 
               joins the Defense table. It's Arthur Baylor. And Richard 
               Stein double-takes when he sees him.

               AT THE PROSECUTION TABLE

                                     RICHARD STEIN
                              (to Helen)
                         Isn't that Arthur Baylor?

               Helen turns.

                                     HELEN
                         Yes.

               They watch Arthur shake hands with everyone - Elliot, the 
               two young attorneys and Joe.

                                     RICHARD STEIN
                         What's he doing here?

               Arthur takes a seat at the defense table and glances across 
               at Helen and Richard and nods. Helen and Richard are stunned.

                                     HELEN
                         What the hell?

                         flag and recognize the principles 
                         for which it stands. The Criminal 
                         Court, Department G is now in session. 
                         The Honorable Harold W. Pine 
                         presiding.

               Everyone rises as JUDGE HAROLD PINE enters. In black robe. 
               Taking his place behind the bench. He sits.

                                     BAILIFF
                         Please be seated and come to order.

               Everyone sits. And even Judge Harold Pine double-takes when 
               he sees Arthur Baylor at the Defense table.

                                     JUDGE HAROLD PINE
                         Before we proceed, I'd like to ask 
                         the Defense if there's anything this 
                         court should be made aware of.

               Arthur stands.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Yes, your honor. I have joined the 
                         defense in the representation of Mr. 
                         William Dane McCall, otherwise known 
                         to this court as Joe Doe.

               Everyone turns to look at Joe (William McCall). CAMERA PUSHES 
               in on him. It doesn't look as if he's sure who he is yet.

                                     ARTHUR
                         I have represented the McCall family 
                         for several years before William 
                         McCall's disappearance seven years 
                         ago. It was assumed that he had died, 
                         but since he has reappeared under 
                         these tragic circumstances, I would 
                         ask this court for a continuance to 
                         allow the defense to prepare 
                         adequately in light of his real 
                         identity now being known.

                                     JUDGE HAROLD PINE
                         How long do you need.

                                     ARTHUR
                         One week should be sufficient.

                                     JUDGE HAROLD PINE
                         Any objection to a week's continuance 
                         by the State?

                                     HELEN
                         I don't... believe so, your honor.

                                     JUDGE HAROLD PINE
                         Then I grant a one week continuance. 
                         We will start the proceedings next 
                         Monday morning.

               Judge Harold Pine taps his gavel.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         -- when it was discovered that the 
                         man who has confessed to killing an 
                         undercover DEA agent, was actually 
                         himself thought dead for seven years. 
                         The man who signed the confession as 
                         Joe Doe is actually William Dane 
                         McCall, brother of Nathan McCall. 
                         Both are sons of the founder of McCall

                         in telecommunications, computer design 
                         and development and other related 
                         industries. The net worth of both 
                         men is estimated at over a billion

               Parked on the street. Rodriguez and Divinci inside. Rodriguez 
               reads the paper.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         -- but William McCall shunned the 
                         business world and turned his life 
                         to medicine, receiving his medical 
                         degree from Harvard in 1969. Once 
                         again he turned his back on the 
                         established norm and spent several 
                         years in Africa performing organ 
                         transplants for the poor.

               Rodriguez slams down the paper.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         Jesus Christ, this is who you picked? 
                         A goddamn surgeon who performs organ 
                         transplants on poor Africans?!

                                     DIVINCI
                         He was living in the fuckin' street! 
                         How the hell was I supposed to know 
                         he was a goddamn doctor?!

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         He's not a goddamn doctor! You picked 
                         a fuckin' Saint to pin a fuckin' 
                         murder on!

               Divinci grabs the paper away from him. Both cops are angry, 
               upset, frustrated and scared to death.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         When we pick 'em, we really fuckin' 
                         pick 'em. We shoulda just picked up 
                         the fuckin' Pope.

                                     DIVINCI
                              (reading)
                         -- he disappeared seven years ago on 
                         September 19 two weeks after the 
                         tragic death of his wife and two 
                         young children in a multiple vehicle 
                         accident. At the time it was assumed 
                         that he had returned to Africa, but 
                         that was never confirmed. What William 
                         McCall has been doing for seven years 
                         is now the mystery that the court 
                         will try to help unravel.

               Divinci closes the paper.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Alright, alright, let's think here. 
                         What's the worse case scenario?

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         Are you asking me if I can think of 
                         something worse than what we've done 
                         that we can still do, or something 
                         worse that might happen to us if 
                         this all blows up and we are convicted 
                         and sent to jail and die in the 
                         electric chair and go to hell?

               Divinci looks at Rodriguez.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Work with me here.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         I'm sorry. I'm a little on edge. 
                         Would you repeat the question?

               Both men are quiet for a moment, then --

                                     DIVINCI
                         Even if the doc walks, there's no 
                         evidence ties us to it. There's only 
                         one person who can connect us to 
                         Hudd.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         Okay, fine, I don't wanna argue about 
                         it anymore. Let's just fuckin' kill 
                         her.

               INT. BALL BOND OFFICE - DAY (LATE AFTERNOON)

               Manny LaDrew is pouring himself a cup of coffee. His SECRETARY 
               is typing up a letter at her desk.

                                     DIVINCI'S VOICE
                         We need to talk.

               Manny recognizes the voice. He mouths an oh fuck to himself, 
               then turns around to Divinci who is standing in the doorway.

                                     MANNY
                         Are you fuckin' with me?

                                     DIVINCI
                         No, I'm not fuckin' with you. Are 
                         you fuckin' with me?!

                         You don't know?

                                     DIVINCI
                         Know what?

                         Well this is a good one. You're a 
                         cop and you don't know.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Stop it.

                                     MANNY
                         Cops got her. Ain't that a gas. Cops 
                         got her, you're a cop, and you gotta 
                         find out from me. It's a crazy world 
                         we live in, don't you think?

               Divinci suddenly explodes, going for Manny, grabbing him, 
               slamming him against the wall, his arm to Manny's throat.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Cops?! What fuckin' cops?!

                                     MANNY
                         I don't know what fuckin' cops. All 
                         I know is, my people got to her 
                         sister's place and she was already 
                         gone. Her sister said some cops took 
                         her. I thought it was you!

               Divinci glares at Manny for a beat, then he storms out.

                                     SECRETARY
                         What an asshole.

               Manny looks down at his Secretary.

                                     MANNY
                         You're a good judge of character.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               at his desk, on the phone.

                                     DIVINCI
                         -- look, she's our witness, if she's 
                         in custody, somebody better tell me!

               Divinci slams down the phone. He sits quietly for a moment, 
               then rubs his face. Rodriguez crosses to his desk, sits down.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Anything?

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         Nothin'. Nobody knows nothin'. The 
                         D.A. thinks she's gone. D.E.A. doesn't 
                         know shit.

                                     DIVINCI
                         If she was bein' held by police, 
                         we'd know.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         Unless she said somethin'.

                                     DIVINCI
                         If she said something we wouldn't be 
                         sittin' here.
                              (a beat, then --)
                         I think it's that lyin' piece of 
                         shit.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               MANNY - INT. BALL BONDS OFFICE - NIGHT

               getting the shit beat out of him. The room is dark. Two men 
               are hammering on Manny. Throwing him against the wall, pulling 
               him up and hitting him in the stomach -- not the face. 
               Throwing him across the room, over the desk. Manny is too 
               hurt to get up. Divinci walks over to him, rubbing his gloved 
               hand.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Don't ever lie to me again.

               Manny looks up weakly. Divinci walks away. Rodriguez opens 
               the door and they exit.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. COUNTY JAIL CELL - MORNING

               Joe is sitting on his cot, staring at the floor. ANOTHER MAN 
               is in the cell with him, reading a magazine. His name is 
               DUNCAN. Duncan looks at Joe.

                                     DUNCAN
                         First trial, huh.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Yes.

                                     DUNCAN
                         I got one piece of advise. When you 
                         break for lunch, don't get the 
                         pastrami.

               We HEAR the BARRED CELL DOOR open.

                                     GUARD
                         Time to go.

               Joe gets up. Puts out his hands. They shackle him as we HEAR --

                         for which it stands.

               INT. COUNTY JAIL CELL - HALLWAY - MORNING

               Joe is lead down the hall by TWO GUARDS, past rows of cells 
               filled with other PRISONERS --

                         The Criminal Court, Department G is

               EXT. COUNTY JAIL - PARKING AREA - DAY

               Joe is lead to a waiting prison van. He gets inside.

               The van pulls away.

                         -- when he pulled this gun and fired 
                         at the driver of the car. Killing 
                         him instantly. Let the record show 
                         that this is the weapon used in the 
                         crime, a Smith and Wesson forty-four 
                         caliber handgun.

               INT. LARGE COURTROOM - DAY

               Joe is sitting at the Defense table with Arthur and Elliot. 
               The trial is underway. And they watch the .44 go to the 
               evidence table -- the .44 with the BLACK STAIN.

               Richard Stein is seated at the Defense table. He, too, is 
               watching the .44. He leans across to his ASSISTANT.

                                     RICHARD STEIN
                         All these goddamn guns are startin' 
                         to look the same to me.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               DIVINCI - INT. LARGE COURTROOM - LATER

               on the stand, being questioned by Helen.

                                     HELEN
                         And when you arrested the defendant, 
                         did he deny that he had killed Agent 
                         Hudd.

                                     DIVINCI
                         No.

                                     HELEN
                         Can you describe the defendant's 
                         condition at the time of his arrest.

                                     DIVINCI
                         He was drunk. We could smell the 
                         booze on him. But we drew blood. He 
                         didn't object.

                                     HELEN
                         We have the blood test report that 
                         shows --
                              (picks up report)
                         -- that he had four times the legal 
                         limit to drive. The people would 
                         like to enter this into evidence.

               They so enter it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               RODRIGUEZ - INT. LARGE COURTROOM - LATER

               on the stand. Elliot is cross-examining.

                                     ELLIOT
                         -- and you arrested the defendant 
                         four days after the killing. What 
                         lead you to suspect Mr. McCall?

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         You ask questions. Work the 
                         neighborhood. Find out who was on 
                         the street that night.

                                     ELLIOT
                         Yes, but specifically Mr. McCall? He 
                         had no previous criminal record.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         We found someone who'd seen him in 
                         the area. So we picked him up for 
                         questioning. We didn't expect it to 
                         be him. But if someone saw him in 
                         the area that night we would want to 
                         talk to him. If he wasn't the killer, 
                         he might've seen the killer. Just 
                         routine really.

                                     ELLIOT
                         Where did you find the defendant?

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         On the street. Corner of Third and 
                         Madison.

                                     ELLIOT
                         What was he doing?

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         He was passed out.

                                     ELLIOT
                         But you knew it was the man you were 
                         looking for.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         Yes.

                                     ELLIOT
                         Based on what?

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         His description.

                                     ELLIOT
                         Who provided you with the description?

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                              (hesitates a beat)
                         Cynthia something, I think.

               Elliot moves to the defense table, glances at Arthur as he 
               picks up a paper. Arthur nods approvingly. Elliot looks at 
               the paper.

                                     ELLIOT
                         I believe her name is Cynthia Webb. 
                         According to the statement filed the 
                         night she picked him out of the line-
                         up. The name familiar?

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         Yes... that's her.

                                     ELLIOT
                         Where did you find Ms Webb?

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         On the street. Same area.

                                     ELLIOT
                         And she agreed to pick the defendant 
                         out of a line up.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         Yes.

                                     ELLIOT
                         Where you aware that Ms Webb 
                         disappeared after she was served 
                         with a subpoena?

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         Yes, my partner and I tried to contact 
                         her about the case and were 
                         unsuccessful.

                                     ELLIOT
                         Thank you, Detective, that's all the 
                         questions I have.

               Rodriguez gets up as we --

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ETHNIC BAR/RESTAURANT - NIGHT

               A waitress cruises past tables to the booth in the back. She 
               sets down two scotch and waters to the two men. Rodriguez 
               and Divinci. The waitress exits. Divinci picks up his glass.

                                     DIVINCI
                         To justice in all its forms.

               Rodriguez picks up his glass.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         We're not home free yet.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Without Ms Webb, there's no place 
                         they can go. We still got the 
                         confession, the gun, the ballistics... 
                         And I don't give a shit about all 
                         this African doctor crap... the man 
                         is a drunk and he's been a drunk for 
                         seven goddamn years. So lets have a 
                         drink for drunks.

               Rodriguez reluctantly lifts his glass. They clink and drink.

                                     DIVINCI
                         That's the thing about life. You 
                         control it or it controls you. Most 
                         people don't understand that. They 
                         try'n blame their fuck-ups on 
                         something or somebody else. But it's 
                         not like that. I don't wanna hear 
                         why your life's a mess. It's a mess 
                         cause you're a mess. That simple. 
                         They're waitin' to live happily ever 
                         after. But after what? After all the 
                         shit happens? Well, I got a clue for 
                         everybody, the shit never stops 
                         happening. So you deal with it or 
                         you get buried in it. I'm not talkin' 
                         about you, you know what I'm sayin' 
                         here.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         Yeah.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Life don't work in mysterious ways. 
                         There ain't no mystery to it. You 
                         just work it. And you don't take it 
                         too serious. You can't take it too 
                         serious otherwise you get fragile. 
                         And you can't be fragile and have 
                         any fuckin' fun.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         You think I'm fragile?

                                     DIVINCI
                         That's the first sign of trouble, 
                         when you start askin' other people.

               Rodriguez nods.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         ...I just wish I knew where the hell 
                         she was.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HELEN'S D.A. OFFICE - NIGHT

               Helen and Richard Stein are working late. Over take-out 
               Chinese.

                                     RICHARD STEIN
                              (referring to papers)
                         -- so I think we'll have to rely on 
                         the confession for his description 
                         of what happened. He'll never take 
                         the stand, even if --

               The phone rings. Richard picks up.

                                     RICHARD STEIN
                              (into phone)
                         D.A.'s office... What?... When?... 
                         Where will --

               Richard is surprised. He turns to Helen.

                                     RICHARD STEIN
                         They found Cynthia Webb.

                                     HELEN
                         Where?

                                     RICHARD STEIN
                         I don't know.

                                     HELEN
                         When?

                                     RICHARD STEIN
                         I don't know.

                                     HELEN
                         Well who the hell was that?

                                     RICHARD STEIN
                         I don't know. They hung up.

               Richard hangs up the receiver. He and Helen exchange a look.

                                     HELEN
                         What the fuck is going on?!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LARGE COURTROOM - DAY

                                     HELEN
                         Your honor, the people call Ms. 
                         Cynthia Webb to the stand.

               VARIOUS REACTIONS

               Rodriguez and Divinci are stunned. Cynthia? Elliot is 
               completely surprised. Cynthia? Arthur is never shaken by 
               anything.

               The courtroom doors open and Cynthia is lead down the aisle 
               by a SHERIFF'S DEPUTY. She moves to the chair.

               But it's Joe's turn to double take. He remembers her. My 
               God, he knows her. It's Cynthia -- the girl from the apartment 
               building. He never saw who pointed him out, but he never 
               expected it to be her.

                                     BAILIFF
                         Raise your right hand.

               Cynthia raises her hand. But her look goes right to Joe. 
               Staring at him. She's never seen Joe like this -- cleaned 
               up, trimmed, handsome. She's not sure she even recognizes 
               him.

                                     BAILIFF
                         You swear to tell the truth, the 
                         whole truth and nothing but the truth 
                         so help you God.

               She turns her eyes from Joe.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         Sure.

                                     BAILIFF
                         You may be seated.

               Cynthia sits down. Looks at Divinci.

               And Joe leans across to Arthur and Elliot. Their conversation 
               is in whispers --

                                     WILLIAM
                         I know her.

                                     ELLIOT
                         She's the woman who identified you.

                                     WILLIAM
                         No. I mean I know her.

                                     ARTHUR
                         ...How?

                                     WILLIAM
                         I'm not sure... I think I lived near 
                         her.

               Arthur exchanges a look with Elliot. Arthur turns now and 
               looks at Cynthia. The wheels are turning.

                                     HELEN
                         Please state your name for the court.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         Cynthia Webb.

                                     HELEN
                         Do you see the man that you identified 
                         in a police line-up in this room.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         Yes.

                                     HELEN
                         Is it the defendant, Mr. McCall?

               Cynthia looks at Joe. Joe looks straight at her. Cynthia 
               turns her eyes away.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         Yes.

                                     HELEN
                         Please describe what you saw the 
                         night of September 14th.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         I was comin' out of an all night 
                         minimart --

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. STREET - MINI MART - NIGHT

               Cynthia comes out of a ALL NIGHT MINI-MART with a bag of 
               food. She walks down the street and suddenly we HEAR a 
               GUNSHOT. Followed by a CAR CRASH. She turns toward the sound. 
               And we HEAR RUNNING FOOTSTEPS. Then we see a man running. He 
               has a pistol in one hand.

               Cynthia watches the man run past and disappear into the 
               darkness.

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

               INT. LARGE COURTROOM - DAY

               Cynthia is looking at Helen.

                                     HELEN
                         And you're positive the man you saw 
                         with the gun is the defendant.

               Instead of looking at Joe, Cynthia turns to Rodriguez and 
               Divinci who are seated in the rows behind the prosecution 
               table. They are looking right at her. They wait for her 
               answer.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         Yeah.

                                     HELEN
                         No further questions.

               Divinci offers her a small smile.

               Cynthia turns away. Arthur is now standing in front of her.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Miss Webb... is it Miss?

                                     CYNTHIA
                         Yes.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Miss Webb, had you ever seen the 
                         defendant before that night, the 
                         night you described to us?

                                     CYNTHIA
                         No.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Do you know what perjury is?

                                     CYNTHIA
                         When you lie.

                                     ARTHUR
                         When you lie under oath in a court 
                         of law. Do you know what the penalty 
                         for that is?

                                     CYNTHIA
                         You go to jail.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Yes... Cynthia, have you ever seen 
                         the defendant before that night?

                                     HELEN
                         Objection. The witness has already 
                         answered that question.

                                     JUDGE HAROLD PINE
                         Sustained.

                                     ARTHUR
                         I just want to give the witness the 
                         opportunity to remember if she could 
                         have seen Mr. McCall anyplace else 
                         before the night in question.

               Divinci stares at Cynthia. As if willing her to give the 
               answer he wants her to give.

                                     JUDGE HAROLD PINE
                         Ms. Webb, do you understand the 
                         consequences of perjury?

                                     CYNTHIA
                         Yes.

                                     JUDGE HAROLD PINE
                         Let's get on with it then.

                                     ARTHUR
                         What did you buy the night you went 
                         into the mini-mart?

                                     CYNTHIA
                         What did I buy?

                                     ARTHUR
                         You remembered seeing Mr. McCall 
                         that night and hearing the gunshot 
                         and a car crash. I just wondered if 
                         you remembered what you bought in 
                         the mini-mart.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         ...shampoo I think.

                                     ARTHUR
                         That's all?

                                     CYNTHIA
                         Yes.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Where do you live?

                                     CYNTHIA
                         4356 17th Street. Number 37.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Is that close to where this mini-
                         mart is?

                                     CYNTHIA
                         Close? Sort of.

                                     ARTHUR
                         How far would you say?

                                     CYNTHIA
                         I don't really know.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Within walking distance?

                                     CYNTHIA
                         No... I don't think so.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Did you walk there that night or 
                         drive?

                                     CYNTHIA
                         I ahh... drove.

                                     ARTHUR
                         You drove. But when you left the 
                         mini-mart you stated that you walked 
                         down the street.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         Yeah.

                                     ARTHUR
                         How far?

                                     CYNTHIA
                         ...to the corner.

                                     HELEN
                         Objection. Your honor, I don't see a 
                         point to this line of questioning.

                                     JUDGE HAROLD PINE
                         Is there a point?

                                     ARTHUR
                         Yes, your honor. Since this is the 
                         only witness, I'm trying to establish 
                         what the scene was like that night.

                                     JUDGE HAROLD PINE
                         Try to get there as quickly as 
                         possible.

                                     ARTHUR
                              (to Cynthia)
                         And how far away from the corner was 
                         the Mini-mart? For example was it in 
                         the middle of the block, close to 
                         the corner, where?

                                     CYNTHIA
                         In the middle I think.

                                     ARTHUR
                         So you walked all the way to the 
                         corner. I assume then you were walking 
                         back to your car, yes?

                                     CYNTHIA
                         ...yeah.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Was there a reason you parked so far 
                         away?

                                     CYNTHIA
                              (getting nervous)
                         Um... there were lots of cars parked 
                         on the street.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Was there anyone else on the street 
                         besides you?

                                     CYNTHIA
                         No.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Lots of cars, but no people. Any 
                         traffic?

                                     CYNTHIA
                         I don't remember.

                                     ARTHUR
                         So you were the only person to see 
                         Joe on the street that night?

                                     CYNTHIA
                         I didn't see anybody else.

                                     ARTHUR
                         So you heard a gunshot, a car crash 
                         and a man running with a gun in his 
                         hand.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         Yes.

                                     ARTHUR
                         What did you do then? Did you call 
                         the police, 911?

                                     CYNTHIA
                         I went home.

                                     ARTHUR
                         You went home. Straight home?

                                     CYNTHIA
                         Yes.

                                     ARTHUR
                         And you're sure it was Joe you saw 
                         that night?

                                     CYNTHIA
                         Yes.

                                     ARTHUR
                         When you went home.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         Yes.

               Arthur pauses.

                                     ARTHUR
                         When you went home you saw Joe?

               Cynthia realizes what she's said.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         No.

                                     HELEN
                         Objection. Defense is trying to 
                         confuse the witness.

                                     ARTHUR
                         I'm not trying to confuse the witness, 
                         it's the witness that's trying to 
                         confuse the court. I have witnesses 
                         who will refute her testimony. 
                         Witnesses who were on that corner 
                         the night of the shooting, who never 
                         saw Ms. Webb, who never heard the 
                         gunshot, who never saw Joe run past. 
                         Ms Webb saw Joe outside her apartment 
                         building that night because he lived 
                         in the alley next to it. Isn't that 
                         right, Ms Webb?

               Arthur turns dramatically to Cynthia. She is scared.

                                     HELEN
                         Objection!

               Everyone's attention is on Cynthia.

                                     ARTHUR
                         When I referred to him as Joe, you 
                         knew who I was talking about, didn't 
                         you. This case is the People versus 
                         Mr. William McCall. Not Joe. Joe has 
                         never been mentioned in this trial. 
                         How did you know who I was talking 
                         about, Ms. Webb?

               Cynthia looks from Arthur to Divinci. Divinci is frozen. 
               Rodriguez is sweating.

               Then Cynthia turns and looks at Joe.

               Joe looks at her, feeling sorry for her. Not hating her.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Ms. Webb, how did you know that Joe 
                         was the defendant?

               Cynthia lowers her eyes to the floor.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         He lived in the alley next to my 
                         apartment building.

               Helen and Richard Stein are stunned yet again.

                                     HELEN
                              (to herself)
                         Oh shit.

               Divinci and Rodriguez are doing their best to remain cool, 
               calm and collected.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Why did you lie to this court?

                                     CYNTHIA
                         I don't know.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Are you afraid of somebody?

                                     CYNTHIA
                         I don't know.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Are you protecting somebody?

                                     CYNTHIA
                         I don't know.

                                     JUDGE HAROLD PINE
                         Answer the questions, Ms. Webb or 
                         I'll be forced to cite you for 
                         contempt.

               Cynthia looks up at the judge. She's not talking.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         She didn't talk.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Don't hold your breath.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         You think she'll talk.

                                     DIVINCI
                         I know she'll talk.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         We'll make it look gang related.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Problem is we're gonna need another 
                         gun.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         The problem?! Have you forgotten? 
                         She's in fucking jail. That's the 
                         goddamn problem.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Since when is being in jail a guaranty 
                         of a long life? You just get a fuckin' 
                         gun.

               EXT. STREET - DAY

               Rodriguez gets out of the car. Divinci pulls away, driving 
               into traffic. Rodriguez heads into the Station.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BAIL BOND OFFICE - DAY

               Divinci enters. Manny looks up from his desk. His face is 
               bruised and bandaged.

                                     MANNY
                         Oh shit. I didn't do anything!

                                     DIVINCI
                         Everything's fine, Manny. I just 
                         came to apologize.
                              (looks at secretary)
                         We need some privacy...

               Manny looks at Divinci, then motions for his Secretary to 
               take a walk. She gets up, exits.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Just one more favor. I want you to 
                         bail somebody out of jail.

                                     MANNY
                         You're kiddin'.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Bail's twenty-five thousand.

               Divinci pulls out a piece of paper.

                                     DIVINCI
                         I want her out tonight. And don't 
                         tell her who. It's a surprise.

                                     MANNY
                         And how'm I payin' for this? They 
                         don't take American Express.

               Divinci pulls a plastic bag filled with cocaine out of his 
               pocket -- tosses it onto Manny's desk.

                                     DIVINCI
                         I know you know how to exchange that. 
                         It's worth a lot more than twenty-
                         five grand. You can keep the change.
                              (points to cocaine)
                         I want her back in two hours... Or 
                         I'll nail you for possession.

                                     MANNY
                         How'd you get to be such a prick?

                                     DIVINCI
                         DNA.

               Divinci exits.

                         What a piece of shit.

                         You don't have to say nothin', but... 
                         you really a doctor?

                                     WILLIAM
                         ...I was... a surgeon.

                                     DUNCAN
                         No shit, no shit, really. A surgeon. 
                         I know I'm nobody to judge, but you 
                         musta been a smart guy. What the 
                         hell's a smart guy like you doin' in 
                         here?

               Joe looks up at Duncan, hesitates, then --

                                     WILLIAM
                         ...I had an affair with another 
                         woman... a nurse at the hospital I 
                         worked at. It was nothing... I can't 
                         even remember much about her... Except 
                         my wife found out. We had a fight. 
                         She left the house, took the kids... 
                         She was hysterical. I should've done 
                         something... gone after them, I don't 
                         know... they were killed in a car 
                         accident about a mile from the 
                         house... I've never told anybody 
                         that... about why she left.

               Duncan nods.

                                     DUNCAN
                         Hey, doc, you can trust me. It won't 
                         go no farther.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. 6TH STREET OUTSIDE STATION - NIGHT

               Rodriguez is outside the Station. Looking nervous and upset. 
               The unmarked car pulls up. Rodriguez moves for the car. He 
               gets in and the car pulls away.

               INT. UNMARKED CAR - NIGHT

               Divinci drives. Rodriguez sweats. Divinci notices.

                                     DIVINCI
                         You get the gun?

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         I got it.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Everything okay?

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         Are you kidding? We're going to kill 
                         a goddamn witness who's in fucking 
                         jail because we killed an undercover 
                         DEA agent. I'm sorry, but this kinda 
                         shit troubles me a little.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Take off the dress and get back in 
                         the game. We gotta do what we gotta 
                         do.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         Yeah. I know. Let's just get it over 
                         with.

               Divinci glances at Rodriguez. He's more nervous than normal.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. COUNTY JAIL - FRONT - NIGHT

               Manny walks out of the jail building. Cynthia is with him.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         I don't understand. Why can't you 
                         tell me who put up the bond?

                                     MANNY
                         Look, a guy comes in, says bail her 
                         out, gives me the money, I do it. 
                         That's how I make my living, I bail 
                         fuckin' people outa jail. You wait 
                         with me.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         Was it a cop?

                                     MANNY
                         Yeah, right. Cops bail people outa 
                         jail all the time. Doesn't there 
                         seem to be a dichotomy there for 
                         you?

                                     CYNTHIA
                         I don't like this.

                                     MANNY
                         You wanna stay in jail, that's up to 
                         you. Or you come with me.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         What'd he look like?

                                     MANNY
                         You're a stripper right? Lotta guys 
                         fall in love with your type. But 
                         they don't know how to get close, 
                         know what I mean? Somebody wants you 
                         to owe them something.
                              (shrugs)
                         Take it or leave it.

               Manny starts down the steps. Cynthia hesitates, then follows.

               INT. UNMARKED CAR - PARKED DOWN THE STREET - NIGHT

               Divinci and Rodriguez watch Cynthia get into the car with 
               Manny.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         This is the last time, Frank. The 
                         last time we kill somebody.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Yeah, it's the last time.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         This'll be eleven, Frank. Eleven is 
                         enough.

                                     DIVINCI
                         I get the picture.

               Divinci looks at Rodriguez. He's staring out the window, but 
               he looks ill. Something is not right with him.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         It was all okay until you shot Hudd.

                                     DIVINCI
                         What's goin' on here? You mad at me 
                         or something?

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         It wasn't my idea to start killing 
                         people, Frank. That's all I'm sayin'. 
                         We're in this goddamn mess because 
                         you started killing people.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Drug dealers don't qualify as people. 
                         Never did, never will. So what the 
                         hell's wrong with you tonight? You 
                         suddenly worried about where all the 
                         money went?

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         I'm just sick of it, that's all.

               Divinci stares at Rodriguez for a beat, then starts car.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

               The unmarked car turns off the street onto the side street 
               and stops. The lights go out.

               INT. UNMARKED CAR - NIGHT

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         What're you doin'?

                                     DIVINCI
                         I need some fresh air.

               Divinci exits. Rodriguez hesitates, then gets out with him.

               EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         Frank --

                                     DIVINCI
                         Talk to me, okay? Just fuckin' talk 
                         to me.

               Rodriguez hesitates a moment, then --

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         I don't know... I owe some money. I 
                         don't know how I'm gonna pay it...

                                     DIVINCI
                         You gambling again?

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         Yeah, yeah... I just couldn't... 
                         Frank... let's forget about this. 
                         Let's just get the fuck outa here. 
                         We got enough money, let's go. We'll 
                         get outa the country or something.

               Divinci turns toward Rodriguez. And he's got his pistol out.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         What the hell're you doin'?!

                                     DIVINCI
                         Take off your shirt.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         What're you talkin' about?

                                     DIVINCI
                         Just take off your shirt. If there's 
                         nothin' to worry about, then I'll 
                         apologize. But I'm not gonna argue. 
                         Take off your fuckin' shirt now.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         What is this, you piece of shit?! 
                         You don't trust me?! Is that it?! 
                         YOU DON'T FUCKIN' TRUST ME AFTER ALL 
                         WE'VE BEEN THROUGH?!

                                     DIVINCI
                         ...Take off your shirt.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         Fuck you, you don't trust me.

                                     DIVINCI
                         I'm askin' you one more time.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         You wanna shoot me? Shoot me.

               Divinci hesitates. He doesn't want to. This is his partner. 
               A beat, then he lowers his gun.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Okay, I'm sorry. You're right. I'm 
                         fuckin' nervous. Like you. Forget 
                         it. This thing... shit. Let's just 
                         get it over with.

               Divinci holsters his gun. Rodriguez hesitates, breathes a 
               sigh, then returns to the car. They both get back in.

               INT. UNMARKED CAR - NIGHT

               Divinci starts up the car.

                                     DIVINCI
                         I'll just feel a whole lot better 
                         when she's dead. Then we're off the 
                         hook.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         Right.

               Divinci starts to shift gears, but suddenly throws his elbow 
               into Rodriguez' face. And Divinci is all over him like a 
               tornado. Slamming a fist into his face repeatedly. He grabs 
               his shirt and rips it open REVEALING the TAPE RECORDER 
               strapped to his body, recording their every word.

                                     DIVINCI
                         YOU FUCKIN' RAT!

               Divinci puts his revolver to Rodriguez' head. Rodriguez, 
               bleeding from the mouth and nose, looks at Frank.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         Yeah... yeah... I am, I'm a fuckin' 
                         rat... I traded you, Frank, I fuckin' 
                         traded you... Simms knows everything.

               Divinci pulls back the hammer, ready to blow Rodriguez' head 
               off.

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         Just fuckin' shoot me, get it the 
                         fuck over with! I DESERVE IT! I 
                         FUCKING DESERVE TO DIE!

               Divinci is ready to pull the trigger.

                                     DIVINCI
                         You're fuckin' right.

               Divinci rips the wires off the recorder. Rodriguez closes 
               his eyes, waiting for the end. A tense moment, then --

                                     DIVINCI
                         ...Get out.

               Rodriguez opens his eyes, looking at Divinci, who is still 
               holding the gun to his head. Another moment, then --

                                     RODRIGUEZ
                         Frank --

                                     DIVINCI
                              (calm)
                         Get outa the car NOW!

               A beat, then Rodriguez gets out. Divinci looks up at his 
               partner.

                                     DIVINCI
                         This is why you can never -- ever -- 
                         lose your sense of fuckin' humor.

               EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

               The car tears away, leaving Rodriguez alone in the alley.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE KEY - INSERTED INTO THE DOOR LOCK - NIGHT

               Rodriguez pushes open the door to his apartment, enters. 
               Shuts the door. Stands alone in the room for a moment, then 
               suddenly erupts in rage. Ripping off his coat, ripping off 
               his shirt, ripping off the tape recorder taped to his chest.

               He throws the recorder on the ground. Stomps on it until 
               it's shattered into pieces. He stares at the broken recorder.

                                     MAN'S VOICE (VIC)
                         I guess we caught you at a bad time.

               Rodriguez spins around. Vic steps into the moonlight streaming 
               in through the window. Behind him is Cutless Supreme.

                                     VIC
                         But we all have problems.

               Rodriguez suddenly YELLS and CHARGES THEM. He tackles Vic. 
               But in the darkness we can't see anything. Until the explosion 
               of a GUN and the FLASH of flames lights up the room. A moment 
               of silence then --

                                     VIC
                         Oh shit. You shot him, you fuckin' 
                         shot him!

               Two men stumble to the door. Leaving one on the floor. The 
               door is flung open and Vic runs out. Followed by Cutless 
               Supreme.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CRIME SCENE TAPE - INT. RODRIGUEZ APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING

               The crime scene is swarming with cops, DEA and FBI. The task 
               of evidence collection in progress. Rodriguez' body on the 
               floor. Agent Simms is standing over the body with Agent 
               Sarkasian.

                                     AGENT SARKASIAN
                         Divinci musta figured it. I didn't 
                         think he'd kill his own partner 
                         though.

                                     SIMMS
                         He's an animal.

               DEA AGENT Hooper comes up behind Simms.

                                     AGENT HOOPER
                         Recorders busted up. But we might be 
                         able to salvage some of the tape.

                                     SIMMS
                         I want him. You understand me, I 
                         don't care what it takes. I want 
                         that sonuvabitch!

               Simms heads for the door. Sarkasian and Hooper follow.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BAIL BOND OFFICE - MORNING

               A car pulls up in front.

               INT. BAIL BOND OFFICE - MORNING

               It is deadly quiet. We PAN SLOWLY around the office until we 
               find Manny in his chair, sprawled back. Continuing to PAN 
               until we see Cynthia sprawled on the couch. But no signs of 
               blood. Just the bodies. The door opens. TWO MEN enters. All 
               we SEE are GUNS in hands.

               Cynthia and Manny wake up with a start. Manny is scared.

                                     MANNY
                         Shit! Who the fuck're you?!

               A BADGE comes out. And now we see Agents Hooper and Sarkasian.

                                     AGENT SARKASIAN
                         Ms. Webb. We'd like you to come with 
                         us.

               Cynthia looks at Manny. She's pissed.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         This was the big secret? Shit. You're 
                         an asshole.

               Cynthia puts her coat on and heads for the door. Manny doesn't 
               know what the hell is going on.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - FEDERAL BLDG. - DAY

               Cynthia is in with Agents Simms, Hooper and Sarkasian.

                                     SIMMS
                         Who set it up?

                                     CYNTHIA
                         I don't know.

                                     AGENT HOOPER
                         It was Divinci wasn't it?

                                     CYNTHIA
                         I don't know.

                                     SIMMS
                         Which one pulled the trigger? Divinci 
                         or Rodriguez?

                                     CYNTHIA
                         I don't know.

               Agent Simms looks right into Cynthia's eyes.

                                     SIMMS
                         Detective Rodriguez is dead. He was 
                         shot in the head last night.

               This gets Cynthia's attention.

                                     SIMMS
                         Rodriguez was wearing a recorder. 
                         Divinci found it. You can do addition, 
                         can't you.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         You're full of shit.

                                     AGENT SARKASIAN
                         Just tell us what you know.

               Cynthia looks at both of them.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         Where's Divinci?

                                     SIMMS
                         We don't know. But we're gonna find 
                         him.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         You're gonna find him?
                              (smiles sarcastically)
                         Right... I don't know a fuckin' thing.

               Simms stares at her for a moment, then turns to Hooper and 
               nods. Hooper takes Cynthia's arm and leads her out of the 
               office. When the door closes --

                                     SIMMS
                         Get a copy of the tape to Bailor. 
                         But make sure it doesn't come from 
                         us.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. COUNTY JAIL CELL - DAY

               Cynthia is alone in her cell. We HEAR footsteps. She looks 
               up as the GUARD approaches.

                                     GUARD
                         Your attorney's here.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         What attorney?

               INT. ROOM - COUNTY JAIL - DAY

               Cynthia enters the office. The Guard shuts the door. Cynthia 
               finds herself facing Arthur Baylor. A tape recorder on the 
               table in front of him.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Hi, Cynthia. Please sit down.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         I got nothin' to say.

                                     ARTHUR
                         So I'm told.

               Arthur pushes the tape recorder and we HEAR --

                                     DIVINCI'S VOICE
                         ...Take off your shirt...

                                     RODRIGUEZ'S VOICE
                         Fuck you, you don't trust me.

                                     DIVINCI'S VOICE
                         I'm askin' you one more time.

                                     RODRIGUEZ'S VOICE
                         You wanna shoot me? Shoot me.

                                     DIVINCI'S VOICE
                         Okay, I'm sorry. You're right. I'm 
                         fuckin' nervous. Like you. Forget 
                         it. This thing... shit. Let's just 
                         get it over with. I'll just feel a 
                         whole lot better when she's dead. 
                         Then we're off the hook.

               Arthur watches Cynthia's reaction to "when she's dead." But 
               Cynthia has seen enough not to be too shocked by anything. 
               And her reaction is subtle. She knows better than to reveal 
               what she's really feeling and thinking.

                                     RODRIGUEZ'S VOICE
                         Right.

                                     DIVINCI'S VOICE
                         YOU FUCKIN' RAT!

                                     RODRIGUEZ'S VOICE
                         Yeah... yeah... I am, I'm a fuckin' 
                         rat... I traded you, Frank, I fuckin' 
                         traded you... Simms knows everything. 
                         Just fuckin' shoot me, get it the 
                         fuck over with! I DESERVE IT! I 
                         FUCKING DESERVE TO DIE!

                                     DIVINCI'S VOICE
                         You're fuckin' right.

               The recording ends. Arthur shuts off the machine.

                                     ARTHUR
                         I think you know my client is 
                         innocent. That's all I care about, 
                         my client. But I understand why you're 
                         scared. You're already facing perjury 
                         charges. My guess is, your involvement 
                         is deeper than that. But I don't 
                         really care, I'm not after you... I 
                         get nothing if you go to jail. But I 
                         think if I help you, I can help my 
                         client.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         ...how?

                                     ARTHUR
                         William -- Joe -- didn't do it, did 
                         he?

               Cynthia hesitates, then shakes her head.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Why don't you sit down.

               A beat, then Cynthia pulls up a chair.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               angry.

                                     SIMMS
                         No goddamn way! I'm not going to 
                         grant that whore immunity. She lied 
                         on the stand, she's protecting 
                         somebody. And she's involved. I want 
                         them all.

               Arthur, who was sitting across from him, stands.

                                     ARTHUR
                         Before I leave, let me remind you 
                         that you have shit for a case. If 
                         you really care about seeing justice 
                         for your dead agent, don't blow this 
                         deal. Immunity for her testimony is 
                         a small price for a bad cop. It's 
                         the only way she's going to talk.

               Simms glares at Arthur.

                                     ARTHUR
                         And William McCall walks, right now, 
                         all charges dropped.

               Simms hesitates, then --

                                     SIMMS
                         If what she says is any good, I'll 
                         deal. If it isn't, then nobody goes 
                         anywhere.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Agents Simms, Hooker, Sarkasian and TWO TECHNICIANS are

               The guards withdraw, closing the door.

               Cynthia looks at the men, then at the TAPE RECORDING EQUIPMENT 
               on the table and the empty chair. A MICROPHONE is waiting.

               Cynthia looks at Arthur, then sits down in the chair.

                                     WILLIAM
                         I just want to go back to work.

                                     REPORTERS
                         As a surgeon?

                                     WILLIAM
                         Yes.

                                     REPORTERS
                         What about the signed confession, 
                         did the police coerce you into signing 
                         it?

                                     ARTHUR
                         I'm sorry, no more questions.

               They get into the back of the waiting limo and it pulls away.

               INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY

               Nathan is in the back, staring at Joe. Arthur sits next to 
               Joe. Nathan smiles. Joe smiles.

                                     NATHAN
                         Good to have you back, Will.

                                     WILLIAM
                         ...I'd like to make one stop.

                                     NATHAN
                         I know.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

               The limousine is parked curbside. Nathan and Arthur wait. 
               Watching Joe walk across the lawn. He stops, looking down.

               The grave stones are for his wife and two children. He sits 
               down beside them. It's very near where Agent Hudd was buried.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE MCCALL MANSION - DUSK

               Giant party in progress. Expensive cars parked along the 
               drive.

               INT. MCCALL MANSION - DUSK

               Filled with well-wishers in TUXES and GOWNS. Arthur Bailor 
               and Elliot in attendance. Elliot isn't used to this much 
               glory, but he's taking credit where where he can -- with one 
               of the PRETTY YOUNG WOMEN.

                                     ELLIOT
                         -- you know, it just didn't make 
                         sense, a man wanting to be punished 
                         for a crime? How many times does 
                         that happen? Once in a lifetime, I 
                         can tell you.

               CAMERA MOVES to Arthur, who is also receiving his share of 
               the credit.

                                     ARTHUR
                         -- to tell the truth, I had no other 
                         witnesses to refute her testimony. 
                         But she didn't know that. All we 
                         knew was that she was reluctant to 
                         testify. You look for signs.

               And CAMERA CONTINUES TO Joe and Nathan.

                                     A MAN
                         My God, we thought you were dead, 
                         you know. It's just incredible that 
                         you're here.

                                     A WOMAN
                         Life moves in such strange ways. Oh, 
                         I just think what might've happened 
                         to you had you not been arrested for 
                         killing that poor policeman. You 
                         still might be on the street.

               Joe just takes it all in, smiling and nodding.

                                     ANOTHER WOMAN
                         Joe, you look wonderful. After what 
                         you've been through... I just can't 
                         imagine.

                                     ANOTHER MAN (SINCLAIR)
                         When you're ready to come back to 
                         work, let me know. I've already spoken 
                         to the board, they're ready to re-
                         certify you anytime. I can put you 
                         in the emergency sector until you 
                         get warmed up. We all want you back. 
                         We can't afford to waste someone of 
                         your talent.

               A beat, then Joe smiles.

                                     WILLIAM
                         ...I'm ready.

               A BLACK TUXEDO WIPES past CAMERA as we --

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BLACK SCREEN. We HEAR the POUNDING of the MUSIC -- a FAMILIAR 
               RHYTHM. And in GRAFFITI across the screen:

                                    FOUR MONTHS LATER

               EXT. STRIP JOINT - NIGHT

               The neon blares as usual.

               INT. STRIP JOINT - NIGHT

               And there's Cynthia. Back bumping and grinding to the music. 
               He life hasn't changed at all. And she knows it. But there's 
               nothing else she can do.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CYNTHIA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (EARLY MORNING)

               Door opens. Cynthia enters. Shuts the door. Tries the light. 
               It doesn't go on. Suddenly a man is next to her --

                                     MAN'S VOICE (DIVINCI)
                         I guess you had no choice.

               Cynthia tries to move, but a hand grabs her arm. And now we 
               see Divinci. He looks like hell. A man on the run. Desperate 
               and dangerous. He hasn't shaved. His clothes are filthy. He 
               looks like... Joe. Cynthia looks up at him.

                                     DIVINCI
                         You had to do the right thing.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         What d'you want?

                                     DIVINCI
                         What do I want?

               Divinci suddenly shoves her hard across the room.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Why're you asking me that? You gonna 
                         grant me three wishes? I don't know 
                         where to start. Let's see... money 
                         would be nice... love would be 
                         better... but a little loyalty... 
                         you can never get enough of that.
                              (moves up to her)
                         ...But we'll start with... money.

               Divinci pushes her into the bedroom.

               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT (EARLY MORNING)

               Cynthia goes to her closet, pulls out a box, opens it. It's 
               got her savings.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         This is all I've got.

               Divinci grabs the money and stuffs it into his jacket pocket.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         They'll catch you.

                                     DIVINCI
                         I don't think so.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         You wanna bet?

                                     DIVINCI
                         They don't have a clue, baby. And 
                         you wanna know why? Because I am 
                         following my heart.

               Divinci puts aside his gun. And pushes Cynthia down on the 
               bed. He leans in close to her. Face to face.

                                     DIVINCI
                         And they don't know where that is.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         So tell me about your plans. I think 
                         I'd like to hear 'em now.

               Divinci looks at Cynthia for a moment, almost with remorse.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Loyalty is what it all comes down 
                         to. Nothing holds together when it's 
                         gone. And once it's gone, you don't 
                         ever get it back... You shouldn't've 
                         told 'em.

                                     CYNTHIA
                         I shouldn't've done a lotta things 
                         in my life. But that's not one of 
                         'em.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Let me tell you something... the 
                         only difference between a liar and a 
                         witness is that just one of 'em knows 
                         what he's doing.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (EARLY MORNING)

               It is dark and quiet. No clue as to what's going on inside. 
               And we hold on this for a long moment. Just wondering what's 
               she being made to do. And then there's a MUFFLED BOOM. Divinci 
               exits the bedroom quickly. He is upset. We HEAR the DOOR 
               close.

               AND WHITE FEATHERS

               fall like snow flakes on Cynthia's body draped across the 
               bed. The pillow on the floor beside her with the stuffing 
               blown out. She has a hole in her chest, right above her heart.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BAIL BOND OFFICE - EARLY MORNING

               Manny unlocks the door, enters his office.

                                     DIVINCI'S VOICE
                         Shut the door and lock it.

                                     MANNY
                         Jesus Christ!

               Manny looks toward the voice. Divinci is sitting on the floor 
               out of sight. Holding his revolver.

                                     MANNY
                         You scared the shit outa me.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Lock the door.

               Manny locks the door.

                                     DIVINCI
                         One more favor, Manny.

                                     MANNY
                         Since when did I become such a good 
                         guy?

                                     DIVINCI
                         I'm takin' some time off. I want a 
                         car, here tonight, and a driver. You 
                         can do that for your old friend, 
                         right?

                                     MANNY
                              (disgusted)
                         Yeah, I can do that. But you are a 
                         hot fuckin' potato. And drivers that 
                         don't talk, don't come cheap.

                                     DIVINCI
                         I got the money. Just put it together.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. HOSPITAL - EARLY MORNING

               An AMBULANCE races up to the EMERGENCY entrance.

               INT. HOSPITAL - EARLY MORNING

               TWO PARAMEDICS push the gurney down the hall. Cynthia is 
               conscious on the gurney. Looking up at the ceiling. She is 
               fading. We HEAR --

                                     VOICES
                         -- come on, hang in there, hold on.

               CYNTHIA'S (MOVING) P.O.V OF THE CEILING and FACES.

               The gurney pushes past and CAMERA PICKS UP TWO SURGEONS moving 
               out of an Operating Room. Pulling off masks and rubber gloves 
               bloody from surgery. One of them is Joe. The other surgeon 
               pats him on the back.

                                     OTHER SURGEON
                         Just like riding a bike.

               Joe finally breathes a sigh of relief and manages a smile.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BLACK LINCOLN - EXT. BAIL BOND OFFICE - NIGHT

               pulls up in front of the office. Tinted windows.

               INT. BAIL BOND OFFICE - NIGHT

               Manny is looking out the window.

                                     MANNY
                         Leather upholstery, moon roof, CD. 
                         What more could you ask for?

               Divinci looks out. Gun in hand. He's cleaned himself up. 
               He's now wearing a Hawaiian shirt, slacks. A traveler.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Better not be a set up.

                                     MANNY
                         Want me to hold your hand?

                                     DIVINCI
                         Just walk me to the door.

               EXT. BAIL BOND OFFICE - NIGHT

               The Lincoln idles at the curb. Divinci and Manny exit the 
               office. Divinci glances up and down the street as they move 
               toward the car. Manny opens the back door. Nobody inside.

                                     DIVINCI
                         I think I'll let you live.

                                     MANNY
                         You are a real prince. Now how about 
                         my money?

               Divinci hands Manny a wad of cash from his pocket, then gets 
               into the back of the car.

                                     DIVINCI
                         You never saw me.

                                     MANNY
                         Don't I wish that were true.

               He closes the door. The Lincoln pulls away. Manny watches it 
               move off down the street.

                                     MANNY
                         Have a nice trip.

               INT. LINCOLN - NIGHT

               Driving. Divinci in the back. Can only see the DRIVER'S EYES 
               in the REAR VIEW MIRROR.

                                     DIVINCI
                         Head south. Get on the interstate. 
                         Don't break the speed limit.

               Divinci settles into the leather seat. Looks at the rear 
               view mirror.

                                     DIVINCI
                         You know, the one thing about life... 
                         you can never lose your sense of 
                         humor. Without it, you got nothin'.

               Suddenly the driver turns around, holding a 9mm and fires. 
               BLAM. BLAM. BLAM. Divinci's head snaps back as the BACK WINDOW 
               BLOWS OUT of the Lincoln.

               And now we recognize the driver. It's Clyle D. Dunner.

                                     CLYDE
                         Fuckin' A.

               THE LINCOLN

               moves right into CAMERA. BRIGHT HEADLIGHTS filling the screen. 
               The car stops. We HEAR the DOOR OPEN and RUNNING FEET. And 
               PAN INTO THE BRIGHT HEADLIGHTS GLARING into CAMERA.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SURGICAL LIGHTS - INT. OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT

               SHINING BRIGHTLY into CAMERA.

                         -- run the cardioplegia.

               Faces appear. Looking down. We recognize Joe and one of the 
               friends from the party -- Sinclair.

                                     WILLIAM
                         She's fibrilating. Go on bypass.

               Faces move away as we HEAR MEDICAL MACHINES in operation. A 
               NURSE reappears. CAMERA MOVES back now, revealing the room. 
               And the operation in progress.

                                     SURGEON SINCLAIR

                              forceps)
                         Just like old times.

                                     WILLIAM
                         I wouldn't have done this without

                         I heard it was a cop's heart.

               Joe looks at the nurse.

                                     NURSE
                         He was shot in the head a couple 
                         hours ago.

               CAMERA PUSHES IN ON JOE

                         They think it was gang related.

               The BRIGHT LIGHTS OVERHEAD bleed the scene to WHITE and we --

INT. ROOM OLD BREWERY DAY 

Half in shadow, a man named VALLON, dressed in black, fastens a clean
white clerical collar around his thick neck. He raises a jagged razor to
his face, RAKES it across his right cheek, drawing BLOOD. He does not
flinch.
The sharp SCRAPING of the jagged blade against skin is the first SOUND we
hear.
VALLON cuts himself similarly on the left cheek, then hands the razor
ceremoniously to a BOY standing beside him. The boy, no more than twelve
years old, looks at VALLON worshipfully, keen eyes shining with fear and
excitement. He starts to wipe the razor blade on the bottom of his jacket.

VALLON
No. Never. The blood stays on the blade, son.

He hands the boy a dark red velvet pouch. Very carefully, the boy, known
as AMSTERDAM, wraps the razor up, hands it back to his father.
From the shadows, VALLON now raises a long pole with a beautiful golden
crucifix mounted on the end, then holds his free hand out to his son.
Amsterdam squeezes tight.
VALLON nods toward the door. Amsterdam pulls it open. Outside is a dim
hallway. We hear SOUNDS that might be animal or human.
MUSIC begins: a steady, driving cadence somewhere between a march and a
hymn.

CUT TO

2 INT. HALLWAY

VALLON strides in long measured steps. Amsterdam has trouble keeping up
with him.
They are walking down a long corridor that's like a tunnel. Patches of
LIGHT stain the darkness. Sometimes Amsterdam glimpses a FACE peering out
from the gloom. Once or twice he almost stumbles over a BODY stretched
across his path.

CUT TO

3 INT. ROOM

Another room, even smaller. The only decoration is a bizarre rendering of
a Madonna and child painted on the wall.
A beefy man picks up a home-made PIKE, its iron tip sharpened to a lethal
point. He is smiling. The grin is huge, but cockeyed. It occupies only
half of his face. The grotesque, unending grin is the result of facial
paralysis, and has given him a nickname: HAPPY JACK MULRANEY.
Jack lifts the pike carefully, then takes a candle from the wall and bends
down over a wooden cage full of rabbits. He slowly moves the candle back
and forth across the cage top. Wax falls on the cage, splattering an
unlucky rabbit.
Jack thrusts the pike between the wooden bars, impaling the rabbit's body.
He pulls the pike from the cage and leaves.

CUT TO

4 INT. HALLWAY

Jack falls into step beside VALLON and Amsterdam. He holds the pike with
the dead rabbit high, next to VALLON's cross.

HAPPY JACK
Did you bring the boy for a charm, Priest?

VALLON
No, Jack. For a baptism.

Now a WOMAN joins them. She's dressed in man's clothes, her pants held up
by suspenders. She wears a set of IRON CLAWS.
MUSIC builds, growing more insistent and more ominous.
Now a figure looms before them. Over his street clothes, this WARRIOR
wears a rig of home-made armor made from fracgments of steel, lengths of
chain and bits of leather. He carries a battle-axe as lightly as if it
were a twig.

RABBIT WARRIOR
We'll send a few across the river today, Priest.

He joins the procession. Another woman, as tough as the first and half
again as large, and several more men, all armed with implements of
destruction, fall in beside him. Their faces are marked with blood, like
Vallan's, or covered with ritual markings made with paint and ink.
The group grows ever larger and more forbidding. occasionally PEOPLE dart
around them in the tunnel and scamper out of their way like animals
frightened in a burrow.

CUT TO

5 INT. ROOM

Vast and dank, like a cavern. We start CLOSE on...
... the body of a dead rat being filled with some pieces of lead.
Then a little WIDER to reveal: an eager boy, SHANG DRAPER, about the same
age as Amsterdam. He drops the last few pieces of lead into the mouth of
the rat, then sews it closed. He hefts the animal by the tail, swinging it
as he stands up.
He is near a primitive forge where a half-drunk SLACKSMITH hammers crude
weapons into shape and distributes them to OTHER MEN and WOMEN. The floor
is covered with bits of lead and steel, which Shang has been using to sew
into his rat.
Shang FOLLOWS the crowd of men and women with their weapons. And now we
see this room full. It is huge: the main room of the Old Brewery, crowded
with families huddled together for warmth and comfort, or out of fear; men
and women, together or separately, drunk or passed out. They are like zoo
animals in a pit. There are sticks of furniture jammed in corners, or,
more often, arranged at angles in the middle of the room to form tiny
enclaves where the ancient brewery machinery forms irregular boundaries.
Above Shang's head, VALLON and his gang walk across a plank bridge that
spans the room a hundred feet beneath them. Armed men and women from the
Brewery are climbing a rope ladder to join them. Shang SCURRIES up after
them.
The men and women from the Brewery fall in behind VALLON and the others in
the lead. Shang SPOTS someone near his own age toward the front:
Amsterdam. He presses through the crowd like a hunting dog.

SHANG
What's the fight?

AMSTERDAM
The Dead Rabbits against the Native Americans, same as ever. But it'll all
be settled today.

SHANG
Are you Native or Rabbit?

AMSTERDAM
(points to rabbit on pike)
What do you think?

SHANG
Looks alright. I'll stand by you, then.

CUT TO

6 INT. HALLWAY

The group now turns down the last corridor, as dim and long as a tunnel.
In the distance, there's a faint glimmer of light and the figure of a MAN
(MONK EASTMAN). VALLON stops near the door.

VALLON

I don't know you.

MAN
(lightly)
I suppose there's to be a fight.

VALLON catches the heavy Celtic inflection in the man's voice.

VALLON
Derry?

MAN
Donnegal. Name's Monk Eastman.

VALLON
And you want to fight, Mr. Eastman?

MONK
lf there's money in it.

VALLON
Fight for the Natives. They have a proper war chest.

MONK
Well, I might at that. But I thought I'd ask you first, seeing as how I'm
not quite a Native American myself.

VALLON
Let's see your skills, and we'll talk of payment later.

MONK
Fine. But if you like what you see, pay me double.
Monk turns to the door with the grace of a dancer and delivers a
SHATTERING kick, sending it flying off its hinges. Clear white LIGHT
streams in, and we see Monk Eastman plain for the first time: a huge man,
in stature and girth, wearing a small DERBY that intentionally makes his
head look even bigger.

VALLON
(as the door splinters settle)
Stand with us then.

CUT TO

7 EXT. STREET DAY (WINTER)

WINTER WIND blows across a scene as strange and bleak as an alien planet.
VALLON, carrying his cross high, steps through the doorway. The OTHERS
slowly follow VALLON out of the building, which is three stories high and
maybe a block long. A dilapidated sign identifies it as the 5 Paints
Brewery.
It is the tallest structure in the midst of low, squalid SHACKS, winding
ALLEYS as narrow as a snakels back, and DIRT STREETS filled with ruts, mud
and filthy snow. A few PIGS wander forlornly about, rooting for garbage.
WASH hangs stiff, in the middle of the square, from a peculiar monument
erected to some forgotten war hero.
The Brewery occupies one side of a SQUARE surrounded by some storefronts
and a couple of collapsed wooden sidewalks. If this place resembles
anything at all, it's a horrible hybrid of London's Limehouse and a
pioneer town in the American West whose best days have long passed--or
never came at all.
VALLON stands still, staring across the square past the monument. His
battalion of irregulars waits for his signal.
Now... very, very slowly...from around both sides of the monument comes
ANOTHER GANG, in size the same as VALLON's, men and women both, armed like
Visigoths with HOMEMADE WEAPONS: knives, pitchforks, building blocks and
bricks, boards with sharp nails protruding from the ends. Every member of
this second group is dressed in a long DUSTER which reaches to the ankles.
Several MEN in front of the group sport dusters made of leather.

VALLON
Bill Poole! on whose challenge are we assembled?
A MAN in a leather duster (BILL THE BUTCHER) steps forward. He is young,
lean and fierce. And then there are his eyes. They do not match. One is
real. The other is a huge, bulging PEARL upon which has been engraved,
instead of a pupil, a full-color portrait of the AMERICAN EAGLE.

On the side of the square, arranged to get a good view of the impending
combat, is a group of STREET KIDS, girls and boys, none older than eight.
They talk and laugh excitedly among themselves, picking their own
favorites among the gangs as if the warriors were players on a team.

BILL THE BUTCHER
On the challenge of the Native Americans, to settle for good and all who
holds sway.

VALLON
Bene.

BILL THE BUTCHER
By the ancient laws of combat, we offer our bodies to the ghosts of those
warriors who have gone before us. Valor is avid for glory, and glory is in
our wounds.

VALLON
But this time can you bear to look on the glory when it comes, Bill? Can
you see it clear with your single eye?

BILL THE BUTCHER
Whoever fights untouched in battle has skill, but the warrior who returns
wounded has been touched by God.

VALLON
It wasn't God who touched your eye.

BILL THE BUTCHER
It was God gave me guidance. Will you be able to look on the death blow
like a gladiator, and not look away? No honorable man turns an eye from
his death.

VALLON
I don't expect a death blow from your hand, Butcher. Let's have at it.

BILL THE BUTCHER
There is another matter.

VALLON
Say it out and quick, before spring gets here.

BILL THE BUTCHER
No Native American Warrior will dishonor himself with the blood of the
halt and maimed.

VALLON
So?

BILL THE BUTCHER
So we would like to know whether Squire Jack Mulraney of the Dead Rabbits
can smile out of both sides of his face.

A pause of a single second. Then HAPPY JACK takes the dead rabbit off the
tip of his pike and hurls it across the square. It lands right at BILL THE
BUTCHER's feet.
In a flash, BILL THE BUTCHER opens his coat. Inside, on a special belt he
carries a CLEAVER, a CARVING KNIFE and other instruments of the butcherls
trade, all stained with blood and gristle. Now the MAN standing next to
him removes the broad BELT from around his coat. The brass buckle is
sharpened to a point, the leather studded with glass.
The gallery of Street Kids tenses for action: they are thrilled.

VALLON reaches up to the CROSS, pulls off the top piece, to disclose,
underneath, a gleaming sword point. He folds the arms of the cross down,
like the blades of a jackknife.

VALLON
Prepare to receive the Lord.

And the air is full of screams and battle cries as the two gangs hurl
across Paradise Square into BATTLE.
VALLON draws first blood. He impales a Native American on the sword end of
his cross and turns to fight again.
Amsterdam and Shang exchange a glance of frightened, worried wonder.

Then a Native American rushes at them, shouting for blood. The boys act
together. Amsterdam dives down in front of the man, sending him sprawling.
Shang BLUDGEONS the fallen warrior, using his lead-filled rat like a
blackjack as Amsterdam kicks him savagely; the Native collapses
unconscicus at their feet. Before the boys can thank one another, however,
they are separaten by the SURGING GANGS all around them.
BILL THE BUTCHER leaves his meat CLEAVER imbedded in the middle of a man's
skull, then WADES through the combat as if shielded by a charm.
The gallery of Street Kids is thrilled by this display and reacts with
CHEERS.

VALLON BATTLES three Natives who come at him at once.

Monk Eastman grabs a Native in his arms like a groom hugging a bride. He
raises his knee and brings the man crashing down across it, BREAKING his
spine like a Thanksgiving wishbone.
The gallery of Street Kids is awed by this display of power from a new
star in the making.

The Rabbit Warrior in the home-made armor grins at an intrepid Native and
lowers his battle-axe. The Native rushes as the
Rabbit Warrior swings and SEPARATES the man from his legs.

A NATIVE WOMAN lowers her head and charges her Dead Rabbit adversary,
delivering a shattering BUTT to his stomach.

A NATIVE BOY holds a rusty old pistol, which he uses at pointblank range
against several Rabbits.

A RABBIT WOMAN flies into a Native, using her IRON FINGER EXTENSIONS to
GOUGE his face.

The NATIVE with the deadly belt uses it to TEAR a piece out of a Rabbit's
face.

Amsterdam, beginning now to be overwhelmed by the hellish fight, looks
around in growing PANIC for his father.

SHANG uses his lead-rat blackjack to clear an escape back toward the
Brewery. The Street Kids can tell he's trying to escape, and start BOOING
him...
... as Shang's GRABBED from behind and pulled off his feet by a PEG-LEGGED
NATIVE. He THROWS the boy to the ground and pins him by holding the
sword-sharp point of his wooden leg against Shang's throat.

SHANG
(desperate)
I run with you! I'm one of you! Born a Native American from the blood of
five generations!

PEG-LEG
Yeah? Then you oughta be a red Indian.

He pushes down. Shang starts to bleed. But now PEG LEG is distracted by
the sudden SOUND of bells and whistles. He watches the BOY trembling on
the ground, then moves off him, making for the sound of the bell, leaving
the BOY quaking.
The SOUND grows louder as TWO HORSE-DRAWN CARTS full of battle ready
POLICE tear around the curve of a narrow thoroughfare and stop in Paradise
Square.
The BELLS on the carts toll loudly and work magic. The fighting stops.

The POLICE, all carrying clubs and wearing leather helmets, LEAP OFF the
wagons.

There are several moments of ABSOLUTE SILENCE, broken only by the SOUND of
the wind and the GROANS of the wounded.
Then, as one, the Dead Rabbits and the Native Americans RUSH the police
together, hurtling stones and brandishing weapons. Even the Street Kids
get into the act, kicking and biting and generally having a fine time.
The gangs SWARM all over the police, driving them back. Some lucky cops
climb back on the wagons and try to get away. The unlucky police remain
behind, dead on the ground.
The GANGS cheer, jeer and continue to throw things at the retreating
POLICE. When the second wagon disappears from view, the GANGS confront
each other once again.
Another brief moment of QUIET. The Street Kids settle back into their
spectator role. Then the GANGS go at each other with fresh intensity.
Amsterdam finally SEES his father and starts to PUSH his way toward him.
VALLON and BILL THE BUTCHER stand facing each other in the midst of battle
like two titans: then they rush at each other, joining with a terrible
fury.
Shang, still blindly SWINGING his blackjack, makes his way closer to the
relative safety of the Brewery, his face stained with tears of fear. He
hits someone. The MAN turns, swats him down. Shang sprawls on the street,
which is a SWAMP of mud and blood and dirty snow, and finds himself face
to face with a departed PEG LEG. Someone has removed his artificial limb
and driven it through his heart.
Across the square, Amsterdam has reached his father in time to see a
NATIVE AMERICAN sneaking up behind him. Amsterdam grabs a long TRUNCHEON
from a fallen warrior and uses it to hit the man a strong blow behind the
knees.
The MAN falls, howling. AMSTERDAM HITS him again. And again. He is
hysterical.

VALLON and BILL THE BUTCHER keep fighting. Amsterdam sees, with a single
look, that his father is in the fight of his life. He looks for a weapon
to help...
... sees a HATCHET lying by the body of the Rabbit he has just beaten
senseless. He grabs it and runs forward, looking for an opening between
the Butcher and his father...
As the two combatants move, Amsterdam MOVES. Bobbing, weaving, feinting,
falling back... looking for his chance...
... as Bill deals VALLON a blow that ROCKS him back and throws him off
balance...

...just as Amsterdam has made his move. He RUSHES forward, sees his father
FALLING, tries to turn but...

... too late. The boy's hatchet SLASHES his father in the leg. VALLON
falls to one knee, gestures frantically to the stunned Amsterdam to get
away...
... and Bill is upon VALLON, SINKING his knife into his chest. VALLON
screams and falls on his back, Bill kneeling over him. He looks into his
enemy's eyes ... and VALLON's EYES LOCK ON HIS. For all his suffering,
VALLON's eyes HOLD Bill ... he forces himself to look at Bill...it's a
terrible struggle... but VALLON will not look away.
Amsterdam, hysterical, RUSHES at the Butcher. The Butcher grabs Amsterdam
by the arm, making him drop his hatchet.

BILL THE BUTCHER
You need a weapon? Use a knife.
He puts the struggling boy's hand on the hilt of the knife that the
Butcher sunk into his father's chest.

BILL THE BUTCHER
It makes a deeper cut.
And, HIS HAND GUIDING THE BOY'S, he RAMS his knife deep into VALLON's
heart.

BILL THE BUTCHER
Say a benediction, Priest.

VALLON bellows in agony. Amsterdam screams at the very same moment, his
cry mingling with his fatherls tearing through the air.

BILL THE BUTCHER
(to Amsterdam)
Hold this close to mind, boy, should you ever think of going up against
the Native Americans.
Bill the Butcher rises and all around him, as if on some mysterious
signal, the fighting subsides. A DEAD RABBIT sees the fallen Vallon, takes
a battered brass HORN from his belt and sounds THREE NOTES, quick and
sharp. As the notes fade away, the fighting stops completely.

BILL THE BUTCHER
(announcing)
Ears and noses will be trophies of the day.

The Rabbits SCAMPER to collect their dead and wounded before the Natives
can get to them to slice off the battle souvenirs. But there are many
corpses maimed. The Street Kids DISPERSE. The main battle is over, and the
Natives have clearly carried the day.
The Rabbits file past Vallon, rorming a protective CIRCLE around him.
Amsterdam kneels at his side. Vallon tries to speak. Blood bubbles in his
throat.

VALLON
Can't..can't cross the river... with steel through my heart.
Amsterdam looks around. None of the Rabbits makes a move. This is clearly
something he is meant to do himself.
Amsterdam grabs the tortoise handle of the knife, PULLS on it. Vallon
tries not to cry out. The knife does not move.
Amsterdam tries again. He can't budge the knife. Vallon MOANS. Nearly
wild, Amsterdam PULLS with all his strength. Vallon SCREAMS in agony.
Amsterdam is pulling so hard he raises his father's back four inches off
the ground. Still the knife will not move. Vallon passes out from the pain.
Now, finally, someone steps forward: Monk Eastman. He leans over but
Amsterdam, berserk with grief, pushes him away, turns back to his father,
and, with a last desperate pull, DRAWS the knife from his father's heart.
He throws it on the ground. Monk picks it up, wipes the blade on his arm,
closes the knife and hands it to Amsterdam.

MONK
That's yours, rightfully.
Now Monk leans over the lifeless body and reaches inside Vallon's coat,
REMOVING some money.

MONK
And this is mine. Only what's owed. Use the rest for funeral.

AMSTERDAM
No!
He tries to shove Monk away from his father, when the Native Warrior
intervenes.

HAPPY JACK
It's fair.

Amsterdam, wild with shock and grief, turns back to his father as Monk
takes what's owed him. Amsterdam bends over to KISS Vallon on both cheeks,
then on his left eye.
The boy is just about to kiss his fatheros closed right eye when the lid
springs OPEN - Amsterdam jumps back despite himself. Vallon stares at him:
a last moment of recognition.
VALLON
Hon ...
AMSTERDAM
No, Pa!

VALLON
... honor me... think of me ... don't never look away.
Vallon convulses and DIES. Amsterdam shakes him to revive him.

RABBIT WOMAN
Take the body. Bring the boy.
Several RABBITS take a step or two forward, but Amsterdam springs up at
them, like an animal.

RABBIT WARRIOR
Come an, lad. Therels nothing to be done now.

AMSTERDAM
Get away! Get away!

HAPPY JACK
Leave him be. He's his to mourn.

And the RABBITS turn away, going back to the Old Brewery or vanishing down
the narrow streets.
Now a few CITIZENS venture out into Paradise square. A couple of
SCAVENGERS scoot about, looting bodies.
Amsterdam stays in the center of the square unmoving, undisturbed, keeping
solitary vigil over his father.

A TITLE is superimposed across this scene:

NEW YORK CITY 1844

8 EXT. HARBOR DAY WINTER (MATTE)

The same afternoon. As the sun goes down, we have our first full look
(MATTE) at the low pale outlines of the city.
The harbor is crowded with the high masts of sailing ships. Just north of
the island tip is the steeple of the city's tallest structure, Trinity
Church. The buildings of Wall Street are masses of concrete and wood, the
streets surrounding them paved with cobblestones. Just above the financial
district are the sloping buildings and rutted avenue of the Five Points .
The Old Brewery stands tall and forbidding over Paradise Square.
Above the Five Points, in the distance, we can glimpse some finer, newer
buildings. One wide street--Broadway--seems to run from the very tip of
the island clear up into the woods just a few miles north of the harbor.
The only SOUNDS are the lapping of the harbor water against the boats, the
creaking of masts in the winter WIND.

CUT TO

9 EXT. HARBOR DAY

A closer view - The TITLE fades off. We see an imposing edifice on the
edge of the harbor with a wooden sign identifying: "IMMIGRATION
DEPARTMENT, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA."
The sun has nearly set. A boy--about 10 years old--sits on the edge of the
Castle Garden dock, gazing down at the frozen Hudson. He can just about
make out his reflection in the dull sheen of the ice. His name is JOHNNY
SIROCCO, and he watches himself with bewildered seriousness.
Abruptly, he reaches down and SMASHES through the ice with his fist. In
SLOW MOTION, we watch the ice fragments drift apart in the river current,
each bearing away a REFLECTION of Johnnyls face, like pieces of a puzzle.

POLICEMAN
Where's your family, sonny?

Johnny sees a POLICEMAN scrutinizing him.

JOHNNY
(lilting brogue)
My mother's just there.

He gestures toward a ship, where MEN are unloading cargo. In a hoist, they
are lowering a thin pine COFFIN to dockside.

JOHNNY
On the trip, her insides all broke up. She wasn't dead and there was three
others fighting for her bed.

POLICEMAN
And your father? Where's he, then?

JOHNNY
I never knew him.

POLICEMAN
(taking Johnny's hand)

We better see to you, then.

CUT TO

10 EXT. STREET NIGHT

The Policeman leads an awed Johnny through the TEEMING streets of the Five
Points.

POLICEMAN
Where all those streets come together right ahead is the true Five Points.
But most speak of the Five Points and mean anywhere between the Battery
and the Bowery.
Although the night's cold, the streets are jammed. WHORES painted like
carnival Gypsies sell themselves to any man sober enough to stand up.
SOUNDS of laughter and combat filter out from garish SALOONS like the
Little Naples, the Hell Hole, the Egyptian Hall.
In the midst of all this highlife are BEGGARS and the SICKLY, looking for
charity, scrounging garbage in the street. An INDIGENT battles a CRIPPLE
for a meager scrap of faod. A richly dressed WOMAN, riding by in a
carriage, hides her eyes by raising a HUGE BOUQUET OF FLOWERS in front of
her face.

POLICEMAN
Streets hereabouts are lively of an evening. The city comes here to sport.
But there's places to put up a boy on his own.

Three WOMEN, exquisitely costed, burst from the door of the Egyptian Hall.
Under the harsh glare of a nearby gas lamp, their faces are no longer
striking. Johnny STARES; there is something not right about these faces.

JOHNNY
And those? What are those?

POLICEMAN
Well, those. Those are, as you might say, a sort of...

We SEE one of the women's faces, suddenly harsh under gaslight: under
thickly caked make-up is a smiling TRANSVESTITE.

POLICEMAN
... sort of whatnot.

TRANSVESTITE
Say, policeman. I'll buy your bonny friend.

The Policeman fetches the Transvestite a strong WHACK with his nightstick.
The Transvestite screams and falls ... and Johnny RUNS.

POLICEMAN
Hey!

But Johnny's off, already lost in the mad street life.

INT. MORTUARY NIGHT

A funeral chapel.

Vallan's body lies in state. He is wearing his gang regalia, and all the
Dead Rabbits FILE PAST his coffin in solemn tribute. A WOMAN bends down
and kisses the body. Happy Jack Mulraney holds Vallon's crucifix, which he
has obviously inherited. As a disreputable looking Minister mutters
PRAYERS, Happy Jack whispers to a silent Amsterdam.

HAPPY JACK
We passed the plate amongst ourselves. Come up with enough ned to carry
all this, and carry you a while, too.

He stuffs some money in Amsterdam's pocket.

AMSTERDAM
Where will my father rest?

HAPPY JACK
Potters Field, with everyone else.

AMSTERDAM
My father won't be buried with everyone else. He'll lie separate in fresh
ground, facing east.

HAPPY JACK
What difference where he faces?

AMSTERDAM
He'll face east for the second coming of Christ.

HAPPY JACK
Fine, son. When Jesus gets to the Battery you show Him the way from there.

The Minister finishes the service. MR. CORNELIUS, a funeral director who
resembles one of his own customers, ushers in a WOMAN (MAGGIE) pulling a
lovely 10 year old GIRL (JENNY EVERDEKNE) by the hand. The woman is
obviously drunk, the girl frightened.

MR. CORNELIUS
Will you have music, entlegen

WOMAN (MAGGIE)
My daughter'11 do any song you like.

HAPPY JACK
Not tonight, Maggie, we got...

Monk Eastman interrupts from the Background.

MONK
How much?

MAGGIE
Any ned in your pocket, sir.

MONK hands MAGGIE some coins.

MONK
She sing sweet as she looks?

MAGGIE
Pure celestial, sir.
(to girl)
Go on, Jenny.

Jenny's voice is sweet as promised. The song she SINGS, however, is a
bawdy saloon song. Maggie cuts her off fast.

MAGGIE
No, Jen, the other.

Jenny starts to sing a HYMN. To avoid looking at the corpse, she lets her
eyes rove all around the chapel until she SEES Amsterdam. She locks
straight at him until the hymn is over. And he does not take his eyes off
her.

12 INT. MORTUARY HALLWAY NIGHT

Mr. Cornelius is about to escort Maggie and Jenny into another room
crowded with mourners when a smartly-dressed man (DANIEL KILLORAN)
gestures to him from the shadows.

KILLORAN
Mr. Tweed would like a word, Mr. Cornelius.
(Cornelius hesitates)
Tweed of Tammany.

At the mention of the name, Cornelius shoos Maggie and Jenny into the
mourning room and shuts the door behind them. Then he gives Killoran his
full attention.

KILLORAN
In your office. At your pleasure, of course.

CUT TO

13 INT. MORTUARY OFFICE
As the door opens, we see a man gazing out the narrow window onto the
spectacle in the next building. He is in his late 20s, already a little
fleshy but dressed with dash: WILLIAM TWEED... "BOSS" TWEED. He shows a
bemused, almost schalarly interest in the goings-on next door.
This mortuary is located next to a bordello, where the windows are
uncurtained and the energy and variety of the
activities inside is astounding.

Tweed finally TURNS as Killoran opens the door.

TWEED
Mr. Cornelius. With a view like this I'm surprised the dead can rest in
peace.

CORNELIUS
Is there anything I can...

TWEED
(interrupting)
Yes. A favor.

CORNELIUS
Happy to serve, Mr. Tweed.

TWEED
Excellent. Lend me something.

CORNELIUS
(puzzled)
Oh, I don't know what I could ...

TWEED
I believe in form and appearance, you see. Just like yourself, sir. And I
believe in law, and the power of example. Our city is a lawless
wilderness, sir. I'm asking you to help chasten it.

CORNELIUS
A matter of civic duty, then.

TWEED
And civic pride. I want you to help me set an example.
(smiles)
I only need to borrow one of your clients.

14 INT. MORTUARY NIGHT

Two native Americans open the door where Vallon is laid out and Bill the
Butcher STRIDES into the room.
There is immediate TENSION, like an electric charge, as other Natives
stand in the doorway and crowd the hall stand while Bill walks over to the
coffin. He places a BLACK ROSE in Vallon's folded hands.

BILL THE BUTCHER
Tomorrow your cortege will cross Paradise Square, into territory protected
by the Native Americans. You will be permitted undisputed passage both
ways. That is our tribute. After that, any Rabbits wishing to join the
Native Americans and willing to swear blood loyalty will be welcomed. All
others will be dispatched.
He starts out of the silent room, but STOPS when he sees Mank Eastman
looking at him with easy interest. Bill the Butcher
STARES him down, but Monk's gaze never wavers.

BILL THE BUTCHER
I'll expect you first.

MONK
Me? Oh, I don't know. All that talk of blood loyalty makes me quake. I'll
spill blood when the price is right. But blood for ceremony? I prefer holy
communion.

BILL THE BUTCHER
You saw us fight today. You know we can pay any price.

MONK
Not mine. Not now, and not any time after.

BILL THE BUTCHER
We'll see. Independence is a slippery thing. But being a rival ... well,
that's dead dangerous.
Bill brushes past Monk and leaves, followed by the NATIVES.
Now the RABBITS file out, with Monk among them.

HAPPY JACK
Come on, boyo. I'll put you up tonight.

AMSTERDAM
I'll do for myself, Jack.

HAPPY JACK
You can't.
(Amsterdam stares at him)
There's no mistaking you're his son.

Happy Jack leaves Amsterdam alone in the room.


Now, by himself, sure of no one seeing, Amsterdam CRIES.

15 INT. MORTUARY NIGHT

Mr. Cornelius is seated in his office, enjoying a late supper while
looking out his window at the bordello activity across the alley. A NOISE
at the door disturbs him: Amsterdam.

AMSTERDAM
What's the cost to bury my father proud and proper?

MR. CORNELIUS
For a plot, a headstone, hands to break the earth...

AMSTERDAM
How much?

MR. CORNELIUS
What are your current means?

Amsterdam turns out his pockets, which contain Bill the Butcher's pirate
knife as well as the cash Happy Jack pressed on him. Cornelius TAKES it
all.

MR. CORNELIUS
Of course you'll have to wait three days for a city permit. But all this
may do for part.

AMSTERDAM
No.

Amsterdam takes the knife back from Cornelius.
AMSTERDAM
That's owed another.

CUT TO

16 EXT. STREET/PARADISE SQUARE DAY

A grey day. Amsterdam stops in front of a window. He STRUGGLES with his
scarf, trying to keep himself warm. His eye strays for a moment, and he
sees he is outside Mr. Cornelius' Establishment. Then he NOTICES something
else....
.... his FATHER, propped up in a coffin, on public display. There is a
large sign beside the body: "The Dead End of Lawlessness. Tammany Abhors
Crime. Tammany Means Justice."
A sizeable CROWD is goggling at the body. Amsterdam BULLS his way through
the people to the street. He looks in the gutter, then looks up quickly.
Someone is watching him: Johnny. He's carrying an armful of wood.

JOHNNY
Firewood?

Amsterdam grabs the longest plank Johnny has.

JOHNNY
It's a penny the load.

AMSTERDAM
Later.

He turns with the plank in his hand and starts to RUN back through the
crowd.

JOHNNY
Hey!

Johnny manages to GRAB the other end of the plank. But Amsterdam's so
strong he YANKS him right along. The Crowd YELLS as it parts for
Amsterdam, who CHARGES through using the plank like a battering ram, with
Johnny on the far end, born along by stubbornness and momentum...
... toward Mr. Cornelius' window. Amsterdam SHATTERS the window and the
Crowd SCATTERS in a blizzard of GLASS.
Amsterdam stumbles into the window and against the coffin, which falls
over, spilling Vallon's BODY, knocking the boy over. Amsterdam picks
himself up as Johnny stands frozen.

AMSTERDAM
Help me.

He starts to pull his fatherls body from the window.

AMSTERDAM
Come on! Help me, goddamn it!

In a daze, Johnny steps forward and HELPS Amsterdam pulls the body onto
the street.

Now: the SOUND of WHISTLES and WHEELS and RUNNING HORSES as a wagon full
of POLICE arrives on the scene. Behind them, the Crowd returns, yelling
insults.

The police RUN toward the window. Mr. Cornelius dithers at the front of
the crowd.

Amsterdam and Johnny exchange a look. Then Johnny RUNS for it. Amsterdam
stays with the body...

... as the cops close in, SWINGING clubs. Amsterdam's grabbed and hit a
couple of times. The Crowd yells. A COP swings his arm back to give
Amsterdam a good wallop...

... and someone grabs his arm: Bill The Butcher.

BILL THE BUTCHER
Easy, crusher. What's this all about?

CRUSHER
Ask the boy.

AMSTERDAM
I paid Cornelius for my father to rest in honor. He told me I had to wait
on a permit, but he only wanted time to...

BILL picks up the Tammany sign from the ground.

BILL THE BUTCHER
Make another Arrangement, looks like. For advertising.
(to cop)
Better go along. I'll see to all this.

COP
The boy...

BILL THE BUTCHER
Take the little malefactor.
The Cops YANK the wildly flailing Amsterdam to his feet and DRAG him off
to their wagon. Bill The Butcher approaches Cornelius.

BILL THE BUTCHER
Give the boy what he paid for.

17 EXT. STREET/PARADISE SQUARE DAY

Amsterdam is HURLED into the police wagon. The door is locked behind him.
He pulls himselt to his feet, looks out the tiny barred window, SEES ...

... Dead Rabbits join up in a rough funeral procession. SEVERAL help LOAD
Vallon's body back into the coffin and place it onto Mr. Cornelius' fancy
funeral wagon. Monk Eastman LEAPS up onto the wagon and closes the coffin
lid tight.

There are PEDDLERS everywhere. One dispenses drinks from a portable
samovar. A SAILOR hawks ships in a bottle, repeatedly shouting the same
advertisement: "Encourage the work of a landswamped sailor!" A SILHOUETTE
ARTIST offers to draw portraits of passersby.
Funeral music is furnished by STREET MUSICIANS: a drummer, a fiddle
player, and a horn player, with a couple of BUSKERS performing along side
for good measure.
Mr. Cornelius takes the wagon reins and guides the horses out of the
square. The gang FOLLOWS solemnly behind.

And across the square, the police wagon carrying Amsterdam starts MOVING
OFF in the opposite direction. He keeps looking out the tiny wagon window.
The funeral procession leaves the square and activity returns quickly to
normal. Peddlers' CRIES once again fill the air. The Buskers start PLAYING
a snappier tune. SNOW begins to fall.

A huge, awful prison building modeled on an Egyptian mausoleum.
Amsterdam--trying to hide his growing fear--waits on line with other
PRISONERS, all of them older than he.
At the head of the line, prisoners are being processed by a JAILER and a
couple of COPS. Each prisoner is asked several cursory questions, then
told to strip. Every one of the men is SCARRED in some way.
AMSTERDAM nears the front of the line. The MAN just ahead of him
undresses. His left buttock is missing, and his back is covered with whip
scars. A PRISONER behind Amsterdam WHISPERS loud enough for Amsterdam to
hear...

PRISONER
Ain't his first Tombs trip.

ANSTERDAM steps up to the desk. The JAILER hardly takes notice of him.

JAILER
What do they call you?

And this is the first time in the film we have heard his name.

AMSTERDAM
Amsterdam.

The JAILER looks him over.

JAILER
Your full name.

AMSTERDAM

The JAILER writes this down with a scratchy pen.

JAILER
First name?

AMSTERDAM
I told you.

JAILER

Address?

AMSTERDAM
Got none.

JAILER

stage on which four blowsy DANCING GIRLS are giving out with a ribald
number titled "My Father's Teeth Were Plugged With Zinc."
One end of the bar is entirely taken up by a huge woaden keg with an
attached hose. BAR ATTENDANTS DUMP the unfinished contents of glasses into
the open barrel top as a line of FAR GONE DRUNKS wait their turn for the
hose. Maggie, Jenny's mother, is close to the front of the line, very
drunk, hanging on to a mush-faced HOODLUM.

Two VISITORS watch. One has a pad and makes quick SKETCHES.

VISITOR ONE
Ought to be served in a trough, properly. Will you try some?

ARTIST
Probably. What is it?

VISITOR ONE
All-Sorts. It's made of all that's poured and not drunk, and any they can
salvage that's spilt.

Maggie GRABS the hose, staring at the Artist as she takes a drink. His
hand moves quickly an the page, SKETCHING her.

VISITOR

Your health.

She SPITS at him, insulted. The Artist steps forward, puts some of the
All-Sorts from the hose into his glass, and toasts Maggie. She nods and

He UPENDS the sack over the pit and a dozen live RATS tumble out. A
GAMEMASTER slips Johnny a couple of cents as he starts his spiel.

GAMEMASTER
Alright, gents and ladies, your bets now on Towser against the vermin, the
count to beat is ten rodents in three minutes.

The crowd starts to place bets. A sleepy Johnny settles down close to
ringside to watch the show.

At a signal from the Gamemaster, a TRAINER tosses TOWSER--A fierce
mongrel--into the ring. The crowd cheers lustily, continuing to shout out
bets, as the dog goes after the rats.The rats, fighting for their lives,
bite the dog, attaching themselves to his body. Towser retaliates by
gnawing the rats, SNAPPING them in half and spitting them out.

As the CROWD cheers, and Towser kills, and money changes hands, Johnny

Jenny Everdeane and a girl FRIEND, her own age, huddle together in a dark

JENNY
Let me see! I don't believe it.

FRIEND
(closing her hand)
No! It's a danger.

JENNY
Oh come on! It's not.

Then tell me where you got it.

FRIEND
From some man. He took me in his carriage. He only wanted to do something

JENNY
What?

FRIEND

I didn't understand.

JENNY
Would he do the same with me?

FRIEND
I won't tell you if he's around again.

He's my secret.

JENNY
Better keep it more careful, then.

The Friend GETS UP and starts across the Brewery floor, acting nonchalant.
But she looks around her, across the sleeping, passed-out bodies, past the
desperate families and their squalling infants, to see if she's been
noticed.
A man and two women cast a glance her way. She looks away, but the TRIO
keeps watching her... then FANS OUT and starts to FOLLOW her.
The Friend looks over her shoulder again. SEES the Man. Locks in another
direction, SEES: the woman. And then: the second woman. All closing on her.
The Friend starts to RUN. The Trio runs after her. And no one else pays
attention. The Friend PLUNGES into one of the warren of TUNNELS that lead
off the Brewery floor.
CAMERA plunges through the darkness, after her. Her footsteps ECHO; there
is the SOUND of stumbling, falling, an angry CURSE and a BLOW being
struck. The FRIEND picks herself up out of the darkness and keeps running,
CAMERA following down the dank halls.
Suddenly the TRIO runs AHEAD of the camera. There is a SCREAM. CAMERA
staps. And others SOUNDS follow quickly now: the dull THUD of a heavy
object against bone, REPEATED several times; and then, very soon after,
the most terrible sound of all: silence.
Then Two Women emerge from the darkness of the tunnel, fighting over the
penny. The Man, several steps behind them, throws an object to the dirt
floor: it's a STONE, and it is covered with blood. He comes up behind the
Two Women quickly and GRABS the penny from them with a hand that still
DRIPS blood and gore. They CHASE after him across the crowded Brewery

BILL THE BUTCHER
You come into the Five Points and you stole from me.

Thank you. Just listen good. The Native Americans holds the Five Points.
We have prevailed. What you do outside the Points is your deciding.
Outside is your city. Inside the Points is mine. Anyone who says
different, or does different, or thinks different...

BOSS TWEED
There's things demanding to be done that no police force can do, not even
an obedient one. There's contributions from every dive and brothel.
Loyalties to be secured and debts to be collected.

BOSS TWEED (Cont'd)
And now you and your Natives have emerged as the foremost force in the
Five Points, I'm prepared to extend you an opportunity. You can work for
Tammany...

BILL THE BUTCHER
We work for no one.

BOSS TWEED
... beside Tammany... in the performance of these civic obligations. And
for a satisfactory... I'm prepared even to say equitable... financial
participation. It's not the sort of responsibility the founding fathers
might have recognized. But then, the founding fathers never imagined the
city New York has become.

BILL THE BUTCHER
Maybe you Tammany boys should do your own lifting and carrying and muscle
work. Might build you up.

BOSS TWEED
We'd like to. I do miss it. But it's wiser for men in the public life to
give an appearance of probity.

BILL THE BUTCHER
Then get cops to do it.

BOSS TWEED
Oh Jesus, no. The appearance of law must be upheld, especially while it's
being broken.

BILL THE BUTCHER
Appearance means nothing.

BOSS TWEED
Perhaps not within the Points. But the smart man could go higher.

Bill looks at Tweed for a long moment. The he SHOVES himself away from the
wall, pulls away the chair on which Tweed has been resting his feet and
sits down close to him.

BILL THE BUTCHER
If you can talk plain, maybe we can do business.

26 EXT. STREET NIGHT

A small slum thoroughfare congested by a splendid FIRE-WAGON labeled
"Americus Co./Tammany Hall." Curious SPECTATORS and panic-stricken
RESIDENTS crowd around to watch a ramshackle building going up in FLAMES.
As Johnny presses through the crowd to get a good look at the fire, Tweed,
in a white coat and fancy fire helmet, steps off the fire wagon to address
an ONLOOKER.

TWEED
Anyone inside?

ONLOOKER
No, praise God, but all we own...

TWEED places a bucket over the only fire plug in the vicinity, then sits
on it.

ONLOOKER
Well?

TWEED
Waiting on reinforcements.

The SOUND of another bell, nearby. Down the street from the opposite
direction come TWO MORE FIRE-WAGONS. The crowd starts cheering. Tweed does
not move from the plug.

TWEED
That's not them. It's only the Black Jokes. Seems your fire interrupted
their festivities.

The wagons pull up next to the fire plug. Each of them has the words
"Black Joke Fire Co." written large on the side, but the FIREMEN wear
party costumes, not regular uniforms. Some are dressed as British
Redcoats, still others as Indians.
The FLAMES continue to devour the building, but Tweed does not budge from
the plug. He is approached by the Black Jake chief, who is dressed as an
Indian chief.

CHIEF
May I point out that the building is burning to ashes?

TWEED
Certainly. And may I then remind you, Pocahontas, that this entire area is
the province of the Americus company, and you will kindly keep your
distance.
Impasse. The rival Fire Companies size each other up and start toward each
other. The building continues to burn. Tweed remains regal and unperturbed
atop the fire plug.
As the two COMPANIES are about to close with each other, a second BELL
sounds. Tweed's "reinforcements" have arrived: the Native Americans, led
by Bill The Butcher. They PILE OFF the wagons before the horses halt. Now
the Black Joke Co. is outnumbered, and it FALLS BACK. As the Crowd CHEERS,
Tweed takes the bucket off the fire plug.

TWEED
Alright, boys! To work!

The MEN of the Americus Co. give a great SHOUT and start firefighting: a
hose is hitched up to the plug, buckets are filled, a primitive pump sends
water spluttering everywhere.
But there is not much blaze left to combat and the Men quickly grow
frustrated. Tweed realizes this immediately.

TWEED
Next building over, boys! Mustn't let it spread!

The men charge into a neighboring building, STOMPING down doors, CLIMBING
through windows and SWINGING AXES with gusto, all to save a building that
is in no danger at all.
A local poll named DANIEL KILLORAN detaches himself from the crowd and
approaches Tweed, giving him a hearty SLAP on the back.

KILLORAN
Another proud night for Tammany, Bill.

TWEED
Just tell them...
(lowers his voice)
... to take enough to share. And not to steal so in the open.

Indeed, the Men are leaving the building with lots of LOOT. CITIZENS who
question their right to do this are promptly KNOCKED DOWN. Killoran GRABS
Bill The Butcher as he rushes by.

TWEED
Jesus! Boss says to tell you to fight the fire from the front and loot out
the back.

Bill grins and leaves to spread the word as an angry WOMAN approaches
Tweed.

TEARFUL WOMAN
The Black Joke could have saved my house!

TWEED
Black Joke had no business here, Madam.

TEARFUL WOMAN
Their business was to save my house!

TWEED
Tammany's your business. When we're here to call upon there's no need of
other. We understand loss, Madam, and take care of our own.

As Tweed leads her off, away from the blaze and the thieving, he passes a
boy sitting an the curb, watching the fire ... and watching Tweed ... with
admiration. It's Johnny.

The FLAMES light up his EYES as we...

DISSOLVE TO

27 INT. BREWERY NIGHT 2

Jenny's face, as she tries to sleep on a narrow, filthy mattress. Her
mother Maggie lies beside her, crowding her, THRASHING about in a
troubled, drunken sleep.

DISSOLVE TO

28 INT- ROOM/HIGH BRIDGE ORPHANS ASYLUM 2

Amsterdam, eyes wide, lying on a cot in the middle of a long room crowded
with KIDS - This place is a step or two up from the Brewery--but not a big
step. He stares at the ceiling, eyes grave, untroubled by the small cries
of loneliness and fear that come from some of the beds surrounding him. As
we move CLOSE on his EYES we...

DISSOLVE TO

29 EXT. HIGH BRIDGE ORPHANS ASYLUM DUSK

... the same eyes. But OLDER. Smart and full of savagery.

It is Amsterdam. He is now in his early 20s, fully grown and no man to
trifle with. Moving with jungle stealth and strength he ...

... BURSTS out the door within the massive frame of a great iron gate over
which hangs the sign "High Bridge Orphan Asylum." He starts to RUN and a
TITLE comes up...
1852

Pursued by GUARDS, Amsterdam runs hell-for-lather for a long vaulted
bridge. It's a beautiful, stern old Romanesque span across the Harlem
River with rolling banks of leafy trees on the far side. Even in the
twilight, we can see that it is late spring, the end of a long afternoon.

CUT TO

30 EXT. HIGH BRIDGE DUSK (MATTE)

Amsterdam is on the bridge. But he does not slow up until ....

... two orphanage GUARDS suddenly TACKLE him. A THIRD GUARD beats him with
a billy club. Amsterdam moans and curses, as much from frustration as pain.

SECOND GUARD
It's Blackwell's Island certain now, boyo.

The SECOND GUARD pulls AMSTERDAM up by the hair.

THIRD GUARD
Are you hurting? Let's hear you!

Amsterdam won't give him the satisfaction. The Guard hits him. Amsterdam
goes down, biting his lip so he won't cry out. Instead, he forces a SMILE.

SECOND GUARD
There's nothing funny, boyo! You been beat and turned back four times now.

AMSTERDAM
But every time you bring me back... you got to come further to catch me.

CUT TO

31 EXT. CORLEAPS' HOOK PIER NIGHT
Through the THICK FOG comes a ghostly apparition: a tattered SKULL AND
CROSSBONES, made of rags, fluttering from the mast of a leaky, unstable
vessel.
The bow of the small boat breaks the fog, and on board we see: a hulk
called SHEENY MIKE KURTZ and a huge black kid named JIMMY SPOILS, manning
the cars. Johnny Sirocco, grown wary and wiry, peers into the fog like a
lookout, while Shang Draper, at the tiller, looks anxious.
The HULL of a large boat suddenly laoms in front of them, not five yards
away.

JOHNNY
Hard starboard, Shang! Hard starboard!

SHANG
(panic)
I told you forget that sailor stuff! Which way's star...
Too late. Their Ticket craft crashes into the side with enough force to
make a LOUD THUMP and to send Shang sprawling.

SHEENY MIKE
(sarcastic)
Why don't we just knock on their front door?

Shang gestures for QUIET. They wait and listen. No sound from the deck of
the boat above them. The boys throw two ROPE LADDERS over the rail of the
larger ship and start climbing.

CUT TO

32 EXT. SHIP NIGHT

The boys board the ship and gather on deck. They look around uneasily,
spooked by the silence and the fog.

SHANG
Spread out and make for the cabin.
Moving slowly, the boys FAN OUT and move toward the cabin at the far end
of the deck. Johnny stays close to Shang, holding onto the shipls rail for
support.

SHANG
(whispering)
Nothing. Looks picked clean.

Johnny stops. His hand, on the railing, is BLOODY. On the other side of
the deck, Sheeny Mike discovers more traces of blood and SIGNALS Shang.

SHANG
Bill and the Natives must have got here first.

Johnny freezes in terror.

SHANG
What ...

A long SHADOW falls across his shoulder. Shang jumps.

Standing before him, holding a musket and covered in blood, is the ship's
CAPTAIN. A BUTCHER'S CLEAVER is imbedded between his neck and shoulder.
With his dying energy, the Captain takes AIM at a petrified Shang and
fires his musket.
Jimmy Spoils JUMPS the Captain from behind, sending the musket ball way
wide. But the SOUND of the musket is thunderaus, and echoes through the
harbor. The boys panic and head for the side.

SHEENY MIKE
That'll bring the Harbor cops for sure.

JOHNNY
(about the dead man)
Wait! Take him. If he's still alive he's good for ransom!

SHEENY MIKE
Hels dead as Good Friday, can't you...

JOHNNY
Then we'll take Bill the Butcher's cleaver and sell the body to the
medical students. They'll go five dollars for it anyway.

SHANG
Come on. We'll get something out of this.

Shang and Johnny start DRAGGING the body. Pushing, pulling and mostly
panicked, the others help. As they boost the body over the side, the SOUND
of a bell cuts through the fog.

SHEENY MIKE
The Harbors!

Shang shoves the body off the side and into the boat. It lands with a
resounding THUD. The boys CLAMBER after it.

CUT TO

33 EXT. BOAT/RIVER NIGHT

PUSHING OFF with cars, tearing their rope ladders from the side of the
ship, stumbling over the captain's body, the boys slip off into the fog.
The Harbor Police are so close to them they can see a police LANTERN
shining. The boys stay absolutely still. Suddenly, WE SEE: the POLICE
BOAT, breaking through the fog, then
DISAPPEARING again.

SHEENY MIKE
We can't go back to Corlears Hook, they'll be watching...

SHANG
We'll make for Blackwells.

JIMMY SPOILS
And which way's that through this fog?

Johnny throws his hands up for quiet. From close by comes the SOUND of
COP'S VOICES. They are near. Very near. The boys stay as still as they
can...
... and the VOICES recede again in the thick fog.

JIMMY SPOILS
Should have asked them directions as they drifted by, Shang.

SHANG
You'd have liked that, wouldn't you Coal Face? You're the only one they'd
miss in the dark.

SHEENY MIKE
Let's quiet, or we'll all be found out!

As the BOYS stay still, their boat DRIFTS against an outcropping of land
and STOPS.

SHANG
Alright. We lay up here till first light. Then we run back across the
river.

JIMMY SPOILS
(contemptuously)
River pirates!

Spoils settles back and tries to sleep. Johnny watches Shang in the bow.
Shang is too agitated to notice Johnny's stare. He looks away, waiting for
the sun.

CUT TO

34 EXT- BLACKWELLS ISLAND DAWN

Shang drowses in the boat, fighting fatigue, then succumbing to it. But
h's brought awake suddenly by a loud SPLASH. He looks in the direction of
the noise, SEES ...
... the BODY of the slaughtered ship's captain floating away in the
company. He starts to cry out but Amsterdam GRABS him, locking his throat
in the crook of his arm.

AMSTERDAM
(to everyone)

Push off! Or his pipe snaps!
The other boys are too stunned to resist. They push the boat away from the
island.

AMSTERDAM
Head straight out, then turn for the current.

He pushes Shang away from him. The two boys stare at each ather, finally
remembering...

SHANG
(breathing hard)
Figured you for dead.

AMSTERDAM
Close enough.

SHANG
This is my crew. And welcome to join, if you've the mettle. We're river
pirates and quick thieves and street brawlers...

AMSTERDAM
(casual disdain)
You're lost.

SHANG
Yeah? You've no business saying anything against us! Do you know how much
you cost us? You know how much that body's worth?

AMSTERDAM
I doubt it's worth the water it's floating in.

SHANG
Fifteen dollars! Fifteen dollars from them medical ghouis.

AMSTERDAM
I'll make it back for you whatever it is, once we're in the city. Just
keep sailing, or we're all done for.

SHANG
(beat; to crew)
Go ahead then.
(beat; to Amsterdam)
He was in his prime. He'd have fetched thirty dollars easy.

CUT TO

35 INT. HIDEOUT DAY

A ramshackle room near the docks. It is part meeting hall, part living
quarters for the gang, and part clearing house forstolen goods. SHANG
presides over a boisterous meeting.

JIMMY SPOILS
You're as flat as Broadway going north. We can't run the river no more.
We're poaching the Natives and the Harbor cops are looking for us.

SHANG
The cops can go to blazes. Who cares about them?

SHEENY MIKE
Youlre all sand when it comes to cops, Shang. But do you have the sand to
go against the Natives?

SHANG
It ain't the time to go against the Natives. We've got to build first.
Then we go.

JIMMY SPOILS
If we go like we did in the river, all of us'll sink.

Amsterdam is sitting off to the side, watching this ongoing debate with
contemptuous detachment. Johnny sits next to him.

AMSTERDAM
Does Shang have the sand to ever go against the Natives?

JOHNNY
I don't know. He acts like it.

AMSTERDAM
If he only acts, held be better on the stage.
(looks away)
Like her.

His tone of voice has changed. Jenny Everdeane passes before him; she's
ravishing. Amsterdam STARES, as if he's trying to see into her heart.
Jenny pays him scant attention as she moves across the room toward Shang.

JOHNNY
Jenny Everdeane. Shang turned her into the best bludget in the Points.

Jenny gives Shang silk scarfs, wallets and several purses from her coat.

AMSTERDAM
Shes his mort, is she, as well as his best provider?

JOHNNY
Yeah. But Jenny says she's anyone's she chooses.

Jenny's haul is impressive. Shang picks a BRIGHT RED SILK SCARF with a
distinctive PAISLEY design from the pile of stolen goods. He examines it
with a shrewd, appreciative eye.

SHANG
That's the prize of the month. Spice Islands silk.

He puts the scart in his coat pocket with a FLOURISH, then throws his arm
about Jenny in a proprietary way.

SHANG
You'll learn our way if you're going to be one of us, Amsterdam.

Jenny reacts slightly to the mention of the name: she looks over and
RECOGNIZES Amsterdam now.

SHANG
Every one of us gives a portion of all they steal to the gang. Morts more
than men, being morts.

AMSTERDAM
Yeah? And why is that?

SHANG
Because morts have more resources. Men can work only on their feet, but a
mort can turn out on her back.

AMSTERDAM
I mean, why give at all? Why don't they keep for themselves?

SHANG
If you think there's something off about my way of running things, you got
no place in this gang.

AMSTERDAM
I got no place anyway, and you got no gang. This ain't a gang, no matter
what you say. It's a mob.

There's a tense hush in the grubby room. Shang takes his arm from around
Jenny, wanting to be restrained.

JENNY
(smiling)
It's all your play now, Shang. Maybe you can set him right.

Jenny hands him a cane. Barely managing to hide his reluctance, he
starts--slowly--toward Amsterdam, who stands his ground. The gang steps
back to give them room in this tiny space. Shang pulls the cane apart:
it's a SWORD CANE, but Amsterdam shows no fear. He shifts his weight a
little, watching ... and they're interrupted by a...

VOICE (HAPPY JACK)
You boys settle with me before you settle each other.

They turn to him.

HAPPY JACK
I've come for my due and proper, Shang.

Happy Jack Mulraney (the Dead Rabbit gang member with the halfparalyzed
face) stands before them in a POLICEMAN'S UNIFORM-sparkling clean and
splendid--a leather helmet and long coat. In his hand, he twirls a
NIGHTSTICK.

SHANG
As agreed, then, Jack. Refreshment?

Shang OPENS the top of the gold-handled sword cane. Inside are large,
solid LUMPS of cocaine. Jack reaches for the choicest.

AMSTERDAM
Still smiling, are you?

HAPPY JACK
(sizing him up)
It's the young Vallon, is it? I hardly recognized you.

AMSTERDAM
I hardly knew you under that hat, Jack.

By now, Jack has taken not only the cocaine, and the money and swag Shang
offers, but several of the purses and wallets Jenny delivered. Jenny
stares at him with contempt, and he laughs, tossing one of the purses back
at her.

JACK
There. For your respect.

Jack turns to leave but a BRASH BOY blocks his way. Moving fast and fancy,
Jack bashes the Boy to the floor with his nightstick.

HAPPY JACK
Anybody else? Any number at all, come on.

Several of the gang make a move toward Jack, but Shang WAVES them back.
Jack departs UNHARMED, to general disgust. Jenny walks back across the
room to help the Brash Boy. Shang GLARES at Amsterdam, slides his sword
back into his cane and follows Jenny, trying to explain himself.

AMSTERDAM
Is that sand we've just seen?

JOHNNY
It's politics.

CUT TO

36 EXT. PARADISE SQUARE DAY

A hot summer day. All the TRADESMEN are out in force, jamming the square
and the side streets leading to it. Amsterdam walks fast through the
crowd, enjoying the freedom and the bustle, as Johnny tags along close
behind him.

AMSTERDAM
I've got my own way to go, why don't you find yours?

JOHNNY
Because your way's different, and I want to see where it goes.
(Amsterdam looks at him)
Unless you say otherwise. Amsterdam shrugs and keep walking.

JOHNNY
You act like you have something in mind, like you know every day what
you'll be doing the next. Me, I don't figure on tomorrow.

AMSTERDAM
Well, if you shut up a while maybe it'd come on its own.
(he stops, looks)
Now what the hell's that?

JOHNNY
(following his glance)
Oh that's heaven.

WE SEE what they're looking at: the Old Brewery. In worse shape than ever
before, but shut-down, abandoned. A tattered banner flaps against the
front door: "Future Home of the Five Points Mission/ Praise God!/ The
Reverend Shadrach Raleigh, Pastor."

JOHNNY
The city shut down the Brewery as unfit to live and Tammany gave it over
to this minister.

AMSTERDAN
What's Tammany?

JOHNNY
Why Tammany ... you don't know? Tammany makes the city run. A political
organization that's like... like the Native Americans, only ranging over
the whole city.

CUT TO

37 MONTAGE

As Johnny continues to speak, we see Tammany tactics in action:
WARD-HEALERS dispensing coal to the poor, and TOUGHS stealing meat off of
butcher's wagons; a political PARADE with fife and drum-and
politicians--including Boss Tweed--in ceremonial Indian costume, and a
group of GOONS busting up a saloon; Tweed making a speech to enthusiastic
CONSTITUENTS and a Tammany Fire Company tearing through the streets,
scattering everyone in their way, finally revealing they are not rushing
to a fire but are CRASING OFF a rival fire company.

JOHNNY
They seem like the law, but they got a way of acting outside the law.
Anything that happens in this city, on the straight or on the sly,
Tammany's a part of, and Boss Tweedls the heart of Tammany.

CUT TO

38 EXT. PARADISE SQUARE,/OLD BREWERY DAY

Amsterdam studies Johnnyls enthusiastic face.

JOHNNY
They're the best gang there is.

AMSTERDAM
So if Tammany's the best, go with Tammany. What are you running with this
mob for?

JOHNNY
'Cause they're more my size for now. With Tammany, you got to do something
large, something that makes them take notice of you.

AMSTERDAN
You're better oft without their notice. You can run free, work your own
schemes.

JOHNNY
But if your schemes have size, you need size to bring them off.

AMSTERDAM
What are you thinking?

Johnny shrugs, grins: he doesn't want to give anything away. Amsterdam
understands, turns toward the Brewery.

AMSTERDAM
Let me in if you ever get it figured.

Amsterdam starts toward the Old Brewery, Johnny keeping step.

AMSTERDAM
I'll go on my own from here.

Johnny STOPS and Amsterdam continues on by himself.

CUT TO

39 INT. MAIN ROOM/OLD BREWERY

Echoing. Dank. Amsterdam holds a candle high for light. RATS skitter. He
crosses the main floor, enters one of the side tunnels.

CUT TO

40 INT. ROOM/OLD BREWERY

A tiny room we recognize from the first scene: this is the place where
Amsterdam lived with his father. He crouches and TEARS UP some
floorboards, then quickly LOWERS HIMSELF into the hole.

CUT TO

41 INT. UNDER FLOOR/OLD BR.EWERY

A short tunnel under the Brewery floor, the kind a kid might make.
Amsterdam has trouble crawling through it. DIRT and ROCK sprinkle him
until he finds what he wants stuck in a shallow hole; a battered leather
MONEY PURSE; and a PAPER-WRAPPED PACKAGE.

Amsterdam snaps open the purse to make sure the little bit of MONEY is
still there, then turns his attention to the package. He TEARS it open.
Inside is the PIRATE KNIFE that Bill the Butcher used to kill Amsterdam's
father.

Amsterdam handles the knife carefully as he opens it. The candle light
makes the blade GLEAMS.

CUT TO

42 EXT. ALLEY/OLD BREWERY DAY

A shock of summer SUNLIGHT as Amsterdam emerges from one of the back
entrances of the Brewery onto a fetid alley filled with rotted barrels,
broken glass and insensible drunks.

Amsterdam looks carefully up and down the alley, letting his eyes adjust
to the bright light. Ahead of him, he SEES ...

Shang Draper, in jovial conversation with a SECOND MAN we do not
recognize. The man is bareheaded, and has a deep scar running back to
front clear down the center of his bald head. Amsterdam waits, WATCHES.

Shang takes the RED SILK SCARF he got from Jenny's swag and hands it to
the Second Man. He and Shang SHAKE HANDS, as if they have concluded a
business deal, and the Second Man walks away.

Amsterdam PRESSES himself close to the door as Shang LOOKS AROUND...
doesn't see Amsterdam... and walks off in the opposite direction, across
Paradise Square.

CUT TO

43 INT- RECEPTION ROOM AND TWEED'S OFFICE DAY

The main room is as loud and as prosperous as the stock exchange. Bill the
Butcher makes his way past Small GROUPS of men engaged in heated political
dealings of dubious virtue.

Bill knocks on the door to Tweed's private office while he's opening it.
Inside is Boss Tweed, seated in a large WOODEN BOX like a primitive sauna.
Around him are various PETITIONERS, and his assistant Daniel Killoran.

TWEED
I dread city stimmers. They bring illness and beget vermin.

PETITIONER #l (GLEASON)
My plague box fends off all pestilence. Its elixir combats ill humors...

KILLORAN
We can't have every citizen of the Five Points boxed up like cargo.

TWEED
But the season is vicious, and I must take thought of our constituents.
Mr. Gleason, I'd like you to shake hands with Mr. Barnett Baff...

Gleason, dubious, shakes hands with PETITIONER #2 as Bill the Butcher
looks on with amusement.

TWEED
A friend and owner of an estimable carting service. Work out an
arrangement whereby the citizenry can receive the benefit of Mr. Gleason's
wondrous elixir outside this excellent box. At a cost, Mr. Gleason, of how
much the barrel ...

GLEASON
(figuring rapidly)
Oh, perhaps twenty-five dollars.

TWEED
...and how much, Mr. Baff, for haulage and distribution...

BAFF
The same again. At least.

TWEED
At least. That's a price of fifty dollars. And greedy, low piracy at that
(Gleason and Baff splutter)
But a price that Tammany, in its generosity, will meet. Merely submit a
bill for a hundred. We'll each have half. And I'll retain this box for
further experiment. Hello, Bill.

Killoran LEADS the astonished Gleason and Baff away as Bill APPROACHES.

TWEED
Bolt the door.

Bill complies. As Tweed speaks and the anti-plague VAPORS SWIRL around his
head, he keeps his eyes closed.

TWEED
Scotchy Lavelle's gone wrong in his accounts.

BILL THE BUTCHER
I know. Scotchy's a good man.

TWEED
Not good enough to rake thirty percent of our share from Sparrow's and use
it for his own.
(opens his eyes)
You got to give him over, Bill.

BILL THE BUTCHER
I can't do that. No matter what he steals, I still get more from him than
any two others. As do you.

TWEED
Alright then. What about Charles McGloin? He's running a panel game off to
one side. Did you know that?
(Bill shrugs)
I can't get a day's work done for all the good citizens pouring in here
complaining about crime and corruption all over the Points. They accuse
Tammany of carelesoness. Some even suspect ... a few practically suggest.
(eying Bill significantly) 
... our complicity with this rampant criminality. We must show them
Tammany stands behind the letter of the law. We need to set an example. 
BILL THE BUTCHER
(beat)
Charles McGloin will do.

TWEED
I'll set the trial for Friday.

CUT TO

44 EXT- TOMBS DAY

CAMERA moves high along the outside wall, past small rectangular slits
that pass for jail windows. EYES peer out, as if a peep show is underway
directly below in the Tombs courtyard. A PRISONER is being readied for the
gallows by having a hood tied to his head.

The CROWD is in a carnival mood; HOT CORN GIRLS, STREET VENDORS,
"HOKEY-POKEY" (i.e., ice cream) MERCHANTS, even BUSKERS, all add to the
holiday spirit.

Jenny works through the crowd, pushing and smiling her way past groups of
raucous merrymakers. She stops once or twice to have a word with a
GENTLEMAN, flirts for a moment, then moves on.

Further back in the crowd, Amsterdam NOTICES her. He watches her go
through the crowd with an admiration that quickly turns to FASCINATION as
he realizes what she's doing: picking pockets. The best bludget in the
Five Points. He starts to FOLLOW her.

Jenny has worked her way close to the hanging platform, but she's so
intent on her job she has not noticed Amsterdam. The closer the platform,
the closer the spectacle and richer the pickings: Jenny's concentration is
absolute. On the platform, an ASSISTANT HANGMAN addresses the Crowd.

ASSISTANT HANGMAN
Those interested in the effects of the condemned please come forward.

44 CONTINUED:

Part of the Crowd PRESSES in toward the platform, temporarily blocking
Amsterdam's view of Jenny. He is right against the platform.

ASSISTANT HANGMAN
What am I bid for this coat? A coat of some wear but excellent cut...
containing a rather remarkable pocket silk...

MAN IN CROWD
Bid a quarter!

HANGMAN
A quarter, thank you. Do I hear fifty cents? Fifty cents?

The Hangman is holding up the condemned man's coat which contains the RED
SILK SCARF Amsterdam saw Shang give away. Amsterdam flips the HANGMAN a
quarter, reaches out and GRABS the handkerchief.

AMSTERDAM
Here. Just for the silk.

He stuffs it into his pocket and starts to PUSH his way through the crowd.
On the platform, the WARDEN steps forward holding a primitive megaphone.

WARDEN
Do you have any last remarks, Charles McGloin?

McGloin grunts from underneath the hood.

MCGLOIN
Not from under this hood I don't.

Crowd near the platform begins to CHANT "No hood, no hood, no hood!" The
Warden puts his hand on the hood, starts to remove it...

... and the Crowd CHEERS. Amsterdam turns, SEES: Charles McGloin. Bald,
with a deep scar running front to back on his head. The very SAME MAN he
saw in the alley with Shang.

McGloin acknowledges the cheers of the crowd. The Warden holds to
megaphone close and McGloin bellows...

MCGLOIN
I never struck a foul blow or turned a card and may God greet me as a
friend!

The Crowd ROAR approval at these words. Amsterdam PUSHES through the
crowd, looking for Jenny ... SPOTTING her finally...

... while up on the platform, the NOOSE is placed around McGLOIN's neck,
and he is HOISTED UP in no time. We hear his neck SNAP. His feet kick
after death. The Crowd raises a zighty cheer.

CUT TO

45 EXT./INT. BROADWAY AND BROADWAY STAGE DAY

Amsterdam walks with a crowd toward a waiting Broadway stage, a vehicle
that looks like a horsedrawn train car. The stage will take spectators
back uptown from the hanging.

He is working his way toward Jenny, who is now BOARDING the stage.
Amsterdam DASHES through the crowd and SQUEEZES onto the stage, which
moves forward with a JOLT.

Once on board, Amsterdam looks through the jammed car, SEES: Jenny, about
to sit down - A MAN has offered her his seat. She smiles dazzlingly as she
sits...

... and arranges her hands genteelly on her lap. The Man looks down on her
and she smiles up at him again. He is bequiled.

Amsterdam manages to get a little closer.

MAN
I hope you won't think me rude if I speak.

JENNY
No, sir. You look a proper Gentleman down to the ground.

As this conversation continues, we watch-not only Jenny and The Man in
conversation, and Amsterdam watching them; but we begin to notice what
Amsterdam SEES. Although Jenny's hands apparently remain folded on her
lap, her RIGHT HAND moves SLOWLY out from her wrap... toward The Man...

MAN
Well, I wouldn't want you to think me forward, you see.

... and BRUSHES past his jacket. He does not notice or feel a thing.
Jenny's hand GLIDES past his THIGH ... nearly brushing it ... moving up
across his pelvis and around his buttocks...

JENNY
Does it matter to you what I think?

MAN
Well, I might like it to.

JENNY
Oh.

...toward his pocket. The Man is in Jenny's thrall. He feels nothing and
continues to have no idea what is going on. But Amsterdam KNOWS. Every
silken, surreptitious move of her HAND across The Man's body is like a
CARESS that Amsterdam can feel. Jenny's grace is balletic and EROTIC. As
she picks The Man's pocket, she is, without knowing it, also seducing
Amsterdam

MAN
I mean, if you would like.

JENNY
I might like, sir. But I can't say now.

Her hand HOVERS above his pocket, waiting for the SWAY of the stage to
match and mask her movement....

MAN
Why?

... and she starts to get up as soon as the stage JOSTLES. The entire car
full of passengers LEANS into one another...

... and Jenny's hand SLIDES the Man's WALLET from his trousers as

he recovers his balance. Amsterdam watches her withdraw her HAND in a
flash and hide it beneath her wrap.

JENNY
Because this is my stop.

MAN 
May I walk with you a little, then? 
JENNY
(firmly)
That would be too bold.

MAN
But I'll never see you again.

JENNY
I come every Thursday to the Tombs to see my father.

MAN
I'll look for you.

Jenny fetches him another fine SMILE--it's almost demure--and takes her
way off the rear entrance of the stage.

lt PULLS AWAY up Broadway and Jenny walks briskly toward an alley.

CUT TO

46 EXT. ALLEY/BROADWAY DAY

Jenny looks to make sure she has the alley to herself, then moves her body
a little...

... and her arms seem to come off. She has been wearing a set of
ARTIFICIAL ARMS, hollow inside, which she can leave folded on her lap
misleadingly while she goes about her pickpocketing.

She's folding up the appliance--cotton sewn over a soft form-when a VOICE
behind her makes her turn.

AMSTERDAM
May I walk with you a little, then?

CUT TO

47 EXT. BROADWAY DAY

As Jenny and Amsterdam walk through the noisy bustle of the city's main
thoroughfare.

JENNY
Are you a spy, then?

AMSTERDAM
Got no one to spy for. I'm an appreciator, you might say.

JENNY
Appreciator of what?

AMSTERDAM
A good touch.

She STOPS in the street, looks him straight in the eye.

JENNY
Don't bother with the chat. If you want me, we come to a business
arrangement. lf the terms is right, then I decide how you suit me. Then I
do it or not.

AMSTERDAM
Just take a minute, I was Just...

JENNY 
I know what you was just. I had years already of what you was just. You
know how I got so good at thieving? So's I wouldn't have to lay down for
everyone who had the ned. Now I do it when I want to for how much I want
to. Otherwise I don't do it, and don't have to do it, and to hell with
anyone's rules but my own. 
AMSTERDAM
What about Shang's rules? You pay a lot over to him. The better your day,
the better his. It don't seem gute right.

JENNY
(a little curious now)
What's it to you?

AMSTERDAM
Give him this.

He hands her the RED SILK SCARF. She recognizes it instantly as the same
one she gave Shang.

AMSTERDAM

And you can keep a little more of what you earned.

JENNY
How'd you come by this?

AMSTERDAM
I got my own touch.

JENNY
Are you making me a present, or making an Arrangement?

AMSTERDAM
It's your rules, right? So you decide.

She looks at him for a moment, then starts to TIE the scarf around her
neck like a kerchief.

CUT TO

48 INT. HIDEOUT

A gentlemen's WALLET skims across a pitted wooden table, straight into
Shang's hand. Jenny is giving him her CUT. He opens the wallet, looks up
at Jenny. No more goods are forthcoming. Amsterdam, hanging back, watches
them both.

Shang SEES the RED SILK SCARF, tied around her neck.

SHANG
Pretty slim cut for a hanging day. Where'd you get that?

JENNY
From Amsterdam.

SHANG
(beat)
It don't suit you.

CUT TO

49 EXT. STREET AND PARADISE SQUARE NIGHT

A SWELTERING evening. The streets are jammed with REVELERS and RESIDENTS.
Some people sleep in doorways in futile search for fresh air. Happy Jack
Mulraney leads a group of apprehensive UPTOWN CITIZENS past drunks and
whores.

JACK
Commissioner Brunt said to spare you nothing concerning conditions.

CITIZEN
Nothing but our safety, of course.

JACK
All's snug around Paradise Square in my company, squire. See there.

He gestures toward the street, down which one oi Mr. Barnett Baff's CARTS
is being drawn by a team of WHEEZING NAGS.

The cart bears massive barrels of what a colorful banner advertises as "an
anti-pestilence influenza-thwarting solution... a service of Tammany
Hall." As the wagon draws abreast of a large group of languishing
RESIDENTS, HOSES spurt waves of solution all over the streets. Many people
are SOAKED. Jack and his Citizens jump back just in time.'

JACK
Tammany makes the streets nanitary, I make 'am safe.

WOMAN CITIZEN
(apprehensive)
Even against them?

A small distance behind the anti-plague cart, moving in rough formation,
come some of Shang's mob, heading aimlessly across the Square cruising for
action

JACK
Against them especially. Let me demonstrate.

Jack takes out his GOLD WATCH AND CHAIN, which he HANGS carefully over a
nearby lamppost. Then, very casually, he leads the Citizens off.

JACK
We'll be back for this at our leisure.

WOMAN CITIZEN
You dare leave it here?

JACK
Safe as a vault, lady. Since all knows it's mine.

The Gang draws abreast of the lamppost. No one makes a move to take the
watch until one of the YOUNGEST BOYS reaches out ... but

Shang knocks his hand away. Jack, at a distance, NODS approvingly.

SHANG
You know that's Jack's.

BOY
So what?

AMSTERDAM 
It should be hangin' off Jack's vest, then. Not here, like some war flag. 
SHANG
That watch is a small price for free run of the Points.

AMSTERDAM
If it's free, how come we pay so much? Wo shouldn't pay for what's our due.

SHANG
We don't tight when we don't have to. It's not warring that counts. It's
the living day to day.

ANSTERDAM
(smiles)
Is that right? Did I hear that correct? John, did we hear that correct?

Eyes now on Johnny. Jenny looks at him with great interest.

JOHN
(uneasy pause)
We heard the same.

AMSTERDAM
So then.

He reaches for the watch.

CUT TO

50 EXT. STREET AND PARADISE SQUARE NIGHT

Happy Jack stands at the lamppost, aghast. A WOMAN lowers her head and
retches. Jackls watch and chain are still in place.

But the watch has been SMASHED. And hanging from the chain is a BLACK CAT,
skinned and strangled.

CUT TO

51 INT- HIDEOUT

Happy Jack stands with his Citizens. The room QUIETS as, one by one, the
mob notices him.

JACK
You!

He GRABS the Young Boy who had reached for his watch on the lamppost and
starts to BEAT him.

JACK
What'd you do to my watch, you dirty little bastard...

Jack breaks the Boy's hand with his nightstick. The Boy SCREAMS

and FAINTS. So does one of the Women in the group. Jack takes the Boy's
other hand.

JACK
Hands won't be so quick in future.

SHANG 
That's enough sport this evening, Jack. 
JOHNNY
(stepping forward)
It wasn't him.

All turn to look at Johnny. Jack drops the Boy's hand.

JOHNNY
I have word for you from who did it. You're to meet him at Sparrow's
Chinese Pagoda.

CUT TO

52 INT. SPAPROW'S CHINESE PAGODA NIGHT

A low and lunatic place: a combination of an opium dream out of the
Arabian Nights and a panel from a Bosch triptych. FAN-TAN games played by
Orientals; WOMEN and CHILDREN of various colors suspended in cages from
the ceiling as MEN and WOMEN in a secondfloor GALLERY point at them and
JOKE. On the main floor, a long line waits for a shot at the barrel of
All-Sorts. Jack charges in the front door, looks around.

JACK
All right, step out, you yellow...

All the NOISE subsides. Only the Fan-Tan game continues;

nothing is so interesting that these Orientals will stop gambling.

Now Amsterdam STEPS right in front of him. It's a grandstand play.

AMSTERDAM
Hello, Happy Jack. I'm the one you're looking for.

JACK
Then you're marked for dead.

Jack lunges ahead, swinging his NIGHT STICK. Amsterdam throws a chair
across his path. Jack stumbles, goes down, dropping his night stick.
Amsterdam grabs it, jumps on top of him, HITS him twice on the side of the
head. There is a CRACKING SOUND. The PATRONS of the Pagoda gather round.

CUT TO

53 INT. SPARROW'S CHINESE PAGODA NIGHT

Later. Festive again. And no sign of Amsterdam.

Two PATRONS step away from the all-sorts barrel. Hanging from the spigot
like the cat from the watch chain is the BODY of Happy Jack Mulraney. The
belt has been removed from his trousers, tied like a NOOSE around his
throat, then looped over the spigot. His TEETH lie scattered on the floor
around him. His NIGHT STICK has been jammed down his throat.

CUT TO

54 EXT. DOCKS/HIDEOUT NIGHT

Amsterdam holds the FANCY COAT from Jack's uniform over his arm.
Carefully, he DRAPES the coat over Jenny's shoulders. SHANG steps forward.

SHANG
I gave no order for this.

Amsterdam says nothing at first, just holds his hand out: he's holding the
RED SILK SCKRF.

AMSTERDAM
(very quietly) 
Never mind giving orders. What were you giving this for? 
SHANG
I'm calling you out, Amsterdam.

AMSTERDAM
I got this at the hanging. It was Charles McGloin's. Everybody here saw
you take it from Jenny. What was MCGloin doing with it? What'd you give it
to him for?

SHANG
I didn't give it to him. Why would I give it to him?

AMSTERDAM
I gaw you give it to him. Last week, behind the Old Brewery.

SHANG
(to group)
He's gone flat. I got no reason to trade with the Native Americans.

AMSTERDAM
What about stepping up in the world, as it were, and leaving the rest of
us behind. There's a reason. Making a separate arrangement for yourself
with the one Native so stupid and luckless that he got hung. That's you to
the ground, Shang.

SHANG
(very edgy now; to group)
Who believes what he's saying? Can any of you believe what he's saying?

AMSTERDAM
Bene. We'll see. Any of you that believes I did proper by Happy Jack
Mulraney tonight, stand beside me. Any of you that still likes Shang's way
with the cops, and Shang's way with the Natives, go to him.
(to Shang)
Or should we settle right now, you and me, and just see which of us is
left standing?

SHANG
Let see where they stand.

Jenny rises, stands next to Amsterdam. Jimmy Spoils, Johnny, Sheeny Mike
are next. Now the other members of the mob move in clusters to all STAND
with Amsterdam.

AMSTERDAM
What's your pleasure, Shang?

One of the YOUNG BOYS has a dead rat blackjack hanging from his belt.
Shang grabs it. He BITES the head oft the rat and spits it across at
Amsterdam. Amsterdam almost smiles at him. Shang sneers, drops the body of
the rat, and LEAVES.

AMSTERDAM
This mob ever have a proper name?

JOHNNY
We was called after Shang when we was named at all.

AMSTERDAM
We're the Dead Rabbits from now. They were the best. They were history.
They were legend, and we'll live up to them.

CUT TO

55 EXT. DOCKS/WATERFRONT NIGHT

Amsterdam sits on an empty pier, watching the ships in the river. There's
a SUDDEN RUSTLING NOISE as a NOOSE coils around his neck.

It's Jenny. She's slipped the SILK Amsterdam gave her close to his throat,
and she's TIGHTENING it. Amsterdam starts to resist. Then he sees how's
she's looking at him.

She uses the silk to bring his face closer to hers. She KISSES him.

AMSTERDAM
What's this then?

JENNY
Payment for the silk.

Then DROPS the silk from his throat and starts to touch him. Then his
hands are under her skirt. Then, under the cloudy moonlight, they start to
make love.

CUT TO

56 EXT. DOCKS/WATERFRONT NIGHT

Later. Amsterdam pulls Happy Jack's uniform COAT over Jenny to keep her
warm in the chill air.

JENNY
You were waiting for me out here, weren't you?

AMSTERDAM
Maybe I was, yeah.

JENNY
You was that sure of me?

AMSTERDAM
Sure enough to wait, anyway. Waiting don't cost nothing.

JENNY
It don't do to be sure. I could go away just as easy.

AMSTERDAM
Alright.

He sweeps the coat away from her body, allowing her to leave.

JENNY
I'll say when I want to, not you.

AMSTERDAM
Stay then.
(beat; smile)
One way or another, I get what I want.

JENNY
(looking at him)
Yeah. If it was just a shag you wanted.

AMSTERDAM
You're a gypsy, are you, come to tell my fortune? Go ahead then. Tell me
what I'm wanting.

JENNY
You got blood in your eye for someone.

AMSTERDAM
It's just I can't look away, that's all.

JENNY
Who from?

AMSTERDAM
Bill Poole.

JENNY
You better get someone else in your sights. No one's ever taken him.

AMSTERDAM
'Cause he's mine, that's why. I'll take his one eye, and then the rest of
him, piece by small piece.

JENNY
You have a plan for this? You going to raise a militia? I'll wager Bill
the Butcher don't even know about you or care if he does.

AMSTERDAM
He'll know about me soon enough.

JENNY
And after the Butcher?

AMSTERDAM
You.

JENNY
Is that so?

AMSTERDAM
You'll be in love with me.

JENNY
Love you? You just had me. You can have a mort any time you want. So why
look for more than that.

AMSTERDAM
That's taking love, not giving it. I want it to be just you and me, no one
else for either.

JENNY
Why?

AMSTERDAM
'Cause none of us means nothing in life except one to the other.

JENNY
I don't know I want to mean something, to you or anybody. Can there be
good in that?

He stares at her.

AMSTERDAM
We'll see.

Jenny pulls the coat tighter around her.

JENNY
It'll take a while if we do. If we ever do.

AMSTERDAM
And what about the meantime?

JENNY
Meantime's business.

CUT TO

57 EXT PARADISE SQUARE DAY

A CROWD gathers in one of the main thoroughfares bisecting the 5 Points. A
beefy SPEAKER is making an anti-Irish speech on behalf of James W. Barker,
a mayoral candidate supported by Tammany's current rivals, the
Know-Nothing Party. Hand-painted signs are everywhere, bearing Barker's
unsavory likeness. A couple of BUSKERS provide a musical score for the
political spiel.

SPEAKER
The potato is a thick vegetable. Heavy. Meaty. Comes out of the ground
dirty and stays that way unless you scrub it and boil it to death!
(cheers and laughs from crowd)
We don't want to keep lem out of the country! We'll even give 'em a place
at our table! But we ain't gonna vote 'em into office.

Much CHEERING and jovial approval from the Crowd. On its fringes,
Amsterdam and the Dead Rabbits make their way roughly across the Square.

SHEENY MIKE
Any Irish hears that will be out for blood.

AMSTERDAM
The Irish is too busy building up Tammany. That's where their brains and
muscle goes. Once they're inside with their cronies, they turn on their
own outside. Tammany'd steal the air and rent the daylight if they could.

SHEENY MIKE
We'd do the same.

AMSTERDkM
Not against our own we wouldn't. That's the difference.

JOHNNY
Tammany earns better. That's the difference.

AMSTERDAM
I ain't seen their ned yet.

Johnny stops walking, betraying slight annoyance that he has to explain
the day's deal.

JOHNNY
You will at day's end, that's our arrangement. A quarter a voter, whether
they're repeaters or not. I'm telling you, we got a square deal.

SHEENY MIKE
It's sound, Amsterdam.

AMSTERDAM
Yeah? Well, it's ned anyway. Just make sure you count it when we get it.

JOHNNY
It's just a day's job, we don't have to make it a life's work. We work for
Tammany today and kill them tomorrow, if that's our pleasure.

JIMMY SPOILS
So we're politicians just for today.

AMSTERDAM
Not for a minute. We're better than that. We're thieves.

CUT TO

58 MONTAGE

The Dead Rabbits go about the business of rounding up Tammany voters. They
pick up DRUNKS in alleys; Jenny and some of the Dead Rabbit MORTS raust
PATRONS in a whore house; Rabbits shanghai SAILORS from saloons; corral
CITIZENS as they walk along the street, either wheedling or bullying to
get them to vote. It's the strong arm of democracy.

CUT TO

59 EXT. POLLING PLACE DAY

On one side of the door, some Dead Rabbits, with a RABBLE of potential
voters; on the other, POLICE doing their best. Behind and all around,
various WARD HEELERS and SMALL-TIME POLITICIANS, representing both the
Know-Nothing candidate Barker and Tammany's Fernando Wood. Varicus
factions push and pull at one another as they wedge their VOTERS into the
polls.

JIMMY SPOILS 
He's got the right to vote, damn you! 
COP
Not four times he don't.
(shoves a Voter)
There'll be no damned repeaters here!

The Cop and Jimmy play tug-of-war with a besotted VOTER, while other gang
members rush to GRAB VOTERS leaving the polls.

PANDEMONIUM.

CUT TO

60 INT. TAMMANY HALL DAY

The main floor is jammed with CLUBMEN and PARTY RACKS. Daniel Killoran
bustles from group to group, making promises, taking notes and searching
out Boss Tweed, who is holding court in a far corner, surrounded by
JOURNALISTS.

BOSS TWEED
I would never speak ill of a rival. I would never say that every
Know-Nothing is a horse thief. It is my observation, however, that every
horse thief is a Know-Nothing.

Good-natured LAUGHING all around. Even TWEED seems amused. Killoran
catches the Boss' eye and whispers to him.

KILLORAN
The Know-Nothings are already finished, and there's four more hours at the
polls yet.

BOSS TWEED
Keep our men voting. Everybody works today. It's not a victory we need,
Daniel. I want a triumph.

CUT TO

61 INT. DON WHISKERANDOSO BARBER SHOP DAY

Amsterdam roughly deposits REPEAT VOTERS in the barber chairs, as the
BARBERS work FRANTICALLY to cut their hair, prune beards, and otherwise
alter appearances. As soon as one customer is done, Sheeny Mike douses him
with bay rum and pushes another REPEATER down in his place. Johnny keeps
count of the turnover.

DON WHISKERANDOS (BARBER)

Now that's eight... and how many still to come ...

He looks toward the door, where more Repeaters are lined up, waiting their
turn under close supervision.

REPEATER
I already voted once today. Cast for Tammany, by God, and Fernando Wood.

AMSTERDAM
Once? Come here and do your duty.

Amsterdam GRABS him and SLAMS him down in a chair.

CUT TO

62 INT. FAN-TAN PARLOR DAY

Amsterdam and some RABBITS BURST into the front door, frightening and
scattering all the Chinese GAMBLERS.

AMSTERDAM
(barking orders)
Line up like soldiers!

SHEENY MIKE
They got no notion what you're talking about.

AMSTERDAM
(To Johnny)
You explain their democratic right. Illl see they unterstand.

Amsterdam GRABS the nearest two CHINESE by their PIGTAILS and
HURLS them against the wall.

CUT TO

63 INT. OPIUM DEN

Amsterdam and the Rabbits PROWL the murky darkness where OPIUM EATERS lie
in bunks stacked high against the walls. The Rabbits start ROUSING and
rounding up the Opium Eaters. Jimmy Spoils SLINGS a couple over his
shoulder like flour sacks. Amsterdam SHOVES two more out the door, past an
admiring Daniel Killoran.

KILLORAN
(to Johnny)
I come to see if our counts square. You boys have made a remarkable
showing....

AMSTERDAM
Who the hell's this?

JOHNNY
He's our Tammany man.

Killoran compares his figures to the piece of paper where Johnny has been
keeping his own count.

KILLORAN
... remarkable...

AMSTERDAM
(With an edge)
Our own Tammany man. We are coming along. Happy to meet any friend of
Johnny Siroccols.

KILLORAN
Likewise. Pleasure to meet the best but one in the whole Five Points.

AMSTERDAM
Best but one? Who's better?

Killoran looks up. Johnny, standing behind Amsterdam, SHAKES his head "NO"
VIGOROUSLY. Killoran gets the message.

KILLORAN
(smooth)
Maybe nobody. But when the count's done the numbers will tell who's come
out in front.

AMSTERDAM
I'm in no race. Just pay us what you owe.

KILLORAN
Tonight. At the victory celebration.

CUT TO

64 INT. SPARROW'S CHINESE PAGODA

A Tammany victory celebration. When we last saw this place--as Amsterdam
confronted Happy Jack--the place was busy, alive. It's RIOTOUS now, jammed
to bursting with POLITICIANS, CRIMINALS, GANG MEMBERS, MORTS, WHORES,
HANGERS-ON, UPTOWN THRILL-SEEKERS, JOURNALISTS and COPS, not all of them
off duty. The SOUND of the place is a cacophony of SHOUTING, SINGING,
GAMBLING and STRANGE MUSIC--which we can't identify at first. We START
CLOSE on a huge ruby ring and we HEAR...

BOSS TWEED
(V.O.)
Read what it says there, alongside the ruby...read it out ...

... and WE MOVE OUT as a WELL-WISHER reads the Latin inscription.

64 CONTINUED:

WELL-WISHER
"Fortuna Juvat Ordentes."

TWEED
A grand victory gift from the men of Tammany. Now, tell 'em what it means,
Mayor Wood.

WOOD
"Fortune favors the bold."

TWEED gives him a resounding slap on the back.

BOSS TWEED
What do you think? Would that make a fit motto for our fair City?

WOOD
Well, I could certainly see ...

KILLORAN
(interrupting)
We've got a motto.

BOSS TWEED
what is it?
(no one knows)
Well, hell, let's get one we can remember. We're going to build a new City
hall, we better have something to put over the front door. And Mayor,
you'll make sure the Latin's right?

As Wood nods his assent, CAMERA MOVES across room...

... past the gilded CAGES suspended ten feet over the floor, where the
women and children look down at the action just below them with a mixture
of trepidation and resignation. Occasionally a REVELER will jump up to try
and GRAB one of the caged inhabitants. Still MOVING, CAMERA...

... passes a stage, where we finally SEE the source of all the strange
MUSIC we've been hearing: the music is provided by

CHINESE MUSICIANS, a woman SINGER, a DANCER and some ACROBATS. They
perform some weird, mangled Five Points version of Chinese opera. The
music and performance continues as we MOVE PAST...

... across a PEWTER FAN-TAN TABLE, where CHINESE GAMBLERS play with fierce
animation and concentration. By comparison, the Occidental types playing
beside them seem like tourists.

Everyone SHOUTS and SCRAMBLES to place bets with the FAN-TAN DEALER.

Above the Dealer is an oval opening in the ceiling, through which OTHER
PLAYERS may watch the action below. These FAN-TAN PLAYERS lean over an
elegantly carved rail, peering at the action on the table below, placing
their bets and collecting their winnings by means of a BASKET attached to
WIRES that whirrs constantly overhead. We continue to MOVE PAST...

... until we are at the door of the place, where Amsterdam, Johnny and the
Rabbits are having words with a BOUNCER.

BOUNCER
I don't know you, you don't enter.

AMSTERDAM
(enjoying himself)
Come on, what are you saying? If you don't know us now, you'll know us
tomorrow and you'll be working for us next week.

JOHNNY
(more temperate)
Daniel Killoran knows us.

BOUNCER
Oh he does?

JOHNNY
We work for him.

AMSTERDAM
The hell we do.

JOHNNY
(to Amsterdam)
Tampen down, will you?

BOUNCER
Why don't you all get the hell out of here and go fix on a story? Go on!

He SHOVES Johnny, who STUMBLES back into Amsterdam. They're both mad now,
and they step forward together toward the Bouncer...

... until Killoran intervenes.

KILLORAN
(to Bouncer)
It's all right, Nat. They're saying the truth. They gave a good day's work
for a good wage.

Killoran HANDS OVER a paper-wrapped parcel of money, which Amsterdam takes
firmly.

KILLORAN
A fine first showing. But second best.

AMSTERDAM
Second, eh? You don't say so.

KILLORAN
It's no shame to be bested by veterans. The Native Americans always sweep
the field.

AMSTERDAM
What?

KILLORAN
We count on them sure as mass comes an Sunday.

AMSTERDAM
(to Johnny, glaring)
Did you know this? Is this some scheme of yours?

JOHNNY
No, I didn't have no idea ...

AMSTERDAM
I was working the same side as the Natives? The Natives?

KILLORAN
That's only right. Bill the Butcher's our ambassador throughout the
Points, as you might say. It's deemed an honor to work with him. Everyone
knows Bill Poole, everyone fears him, everyone ...

AMSTERDAM
I sure as hell don't fear him. And I sure as hell won't stand with him, or
any who calls him one of theirs.

KILLORAN
Well, if it's matter of personal honor, the money can only be a further
insult. I have no wish to rile you further, so if you'll allow me...

He REACHES to take back the parcel of money, but Amsterdam BATS his hand
away.

AMSTERDAM
Where is he? Where's Bill the Butcher?

KILLORAN
Listen, buck. This is a Tammany night. If you and Bill Poole have matters
to settle, you can do it any other time, any other place, I don't give a
good dancing goddamn. But you do it here tonight and all the Five Points
will be down on you like the righteous wrath of heaven. or you could, as
the Book says, put away childish things. Join the celebration. Personally,
I always find the least strenuous solution the most appealing. Don't you?

Amsterdam stares at him as we...

CUT TO

65 INT. SPARROW'S CHINESE PAGODA

As a CHINESE ACROBAT TWIRLS in the air, off the stage, and lands in the
middle of the audience. The crowd is raucously appreciative as the Acrobat
does GYMNASTIC MOVES among them...

... past a table where the Dead Rabbits have settled. it is later in the
evening, and everyone has been drinking.
Amsterdam, sullen, intense, WATCHES ...

..Bill the Butcher, across the room. He is like a prince regent. Everyone
pays him court, including several uniformed COPS, TAMMANY HANGERS-ON, and
NEWSPAPERMEN. Bill receives the attention as his due....

... while Amsterdam keeps watching, contempt and hatred gleaming in his
eye. He pays attention to none of the gang around, including Jenny. Johnny
takes advantage of the situation.

JOHNNY
I got experience. It's the education I lack.

JENNY
And you heard I was a good teacher?

JOHNNY
I don't listen to talk, I figure for myself. And I figured you'd be good
at everything you did.

JENNY
That's right.

JOHNNY
And tonight I got the ned.

JENNY
And now what?

JOHNNY
Now I'm ready for you. Unless there's an arrangement between you and
Amsterdam.

JENNY
(glancing over at Amsterdam)
Not to my thinking.

JOHNNY
(needs to be sure)
Amsterdam... listen up, Amsterdam...

Amsterdam glances over at them.

JENNY
(to Johnny)
You going with me or him? It's my thinking matters here. You don't have to
ask him nothing.

AMSTERDAM
What?

JOHNNY
(makes his decision)
How's the evening passing?

AMSTERDAM
Fine. Why?

JOHNNY
(puts his arm around Jenny)
'Cause it's treating me fine too.

She gets up and starts toward the stairs to the second floor, Johnny
following her, holding her hand. As they pass Amsterdam he LEANS toward
Jenny.

AMSTERDAM
This is no game, you and me. Don't go on like it's a game.

JENNY
I said already, it's not a game. It's business.

Johnny pulls her away. As he watches her go through the crowd, Amsterdam's
gaze falls on Bill the Butcher again...

... and for the first tine their EYES MEET. Bill's eyes rest on Amsterdam,
take him all in... but DON'T REMEMBER him. He looks away as a TAMMANY HACK
steps up to pay court....

.... and a MASTER OF REVELS, center-floor, SHOUTS ...

MASTER OF REVELS
Gentlemen and gentlewomen, if you please ... we will now... raise the
cages and start the bidding!

The Crowd CHEERS and KIDS PULL on a series of ropes and pulleys to RAISE
the CAGES further above the floor until they are parallel with the
second-floor gallery of the Pagoda. WOMEN AND MEN call out BIDS even as
the cages rise through the air. Depending on their age, the Women and
children inside the cages respond to the auction with grim resignation,
trepidation or fear. A few, drugged or drunk on all-sorts, lie insensible
in their impossibly cramped space.

Johnny and Jenny make their way along the second floor gallery until she
spots a COUPLE LEAVING a room and walks inside. Johnny CLOSES the door
behind them as a BURST of APPLAUSE...

... rises from the main floor, where Bill the Butcher stands in the dead
center of the room. He slowly removes his coat and hands it to a FLUNKY.
He is wearing his battle vest underneath, and it is fully rigged with all
his butcher's implements.

The place QUIETS. KIDS swarm silently, like busy ants, all over a huge
wooden CHANDELIER, LIGHTING its HUNDREDS of CANDLES. Only the noise from
the Chinese playing fan-tan in the far corner of the room can be heard now.

The Kids finish lighting the candles and the chandelier is RAISED toward
the Pagoda ceiling, casting the whole place into a new riot of LIGHT and
SHADOW as The Butcher prepares himself.

Now the Chinese Opera DANCER steps forward and stands near Bill. He NODS.
The unsprung MUSIC begins. The DANCER starts to move, sinuously...

...and Bill, with amazing skill, starts THROWING his KNIVES. The knife
MISSES the Dancer by a hairsbreadth, landing in the floor near her foot.
She doesn't flinch. She keeps dancing. And Bill keeps THROWING...

... the KNIVES, which follow the Dancer around the room in a careful,
deadly choreography. They land just inches from where she has just been,
or will be: in a wall; a pillar; the apron of the small stage; the bar;
the barrel of all-sorts. After each knife LANDS, kids retrieve it. When
one of the KNIFE KIDS pulls the blade from the all-sorts barrel, DRUNKS
knock each other over to drink from the stream that flows from the hole.

Native Americans, meanwhile, WORK THROUGH the awed, attentive Crowd. They
AVOID Cops, Tammany Members and anyone who looks too prosperous or too
sober. But when one of the Natives SPOTS a MARGINAL CITIZEN, they GRAB his
hand and examine it as if they were telling fortunes.

Center floor, Bill pulls TWO KNIVES out, BALANCES one in each hand ...

... as a WHORE in the crowd pushes a guy who's groping her toward a couple
of Natives. Hels wearing a large RING. As soon as the Natives SEE the ring
they throw their arms around the GROPER like a long-lost pal and escort
him to Bill ...

... who THROWS both knives rapidly at the Dancer. They land on the floor,
inches from her dancing feet. She SPINS AWAY to great applause as the
Natives bring the Groper to Bill.

BILL THE BUTCHER
Evening, sir. Are you prepared to be celebrated? Are you ready to be
famous?

GROPER
How much will it cost?

BILL THE BUTCHER
Just a moment of your time. My men will assist you.

They do quite a bit more than that: they GRAB the Groper and KNOCK him to
the floor. In the crowd, one SPECTATOR turns to his companion.

PAGODA SPECTATOR
Watch this careful. I've never seen the like, not even in Barnum's Museum.

The Groper CRIES OUT as the Natives PIN HIM to the floor, SPREADEAGLED.
Bill has one weapon left... in a special pocket, inside his vest. It's his
CLEAVER. He takes it out slowly, SAVORING the moment.

The Pagoda goes QUIET. Only the gambling continues. The MUSIC dies. The
only SOUND beside the noises of the Chinese at their fan-tan is the
Groper, who HOLLERS for help as soon as he sees the cleaver.

Bill HEFTS the cleaver in his hand, feels its weight, calculates timing,
figures distance .... and starts THROWING it in the air...

... CATCHING it by the handle ... then throwing it again... higher, FASTER
and HARDER with every toss.

BILL THE BUTCHER
(in full control)
What's it so quiet for? I don't need quiet.

The Chinese opera MUSIC commences with a dissonant CRASH...

... and Bill catches the cleaver again. But EVERY TIME he throws it and
every time he catches it by its handle ...

... he also MOVES CLOSER to the terrified Groper. Now... standing
very close... he gives the cleaver a mighty toss ...

... sending it SPINNING high in the air... up past the cages ... past the
second-floor gallery, jammed with appreciative spectators ... until it
SLOWS ... seems to HANG in the air... then starts its descent...

... FALLING FASTER... towards Bill's waiting, STEADY HAND.

The Groper SCREAMS in fear. Bill SMILES confidently, holding his hand out
until ... just as smoothly, just as confidently...

... he PULLS his hand AWAY and the cleaver FALLS with terrific impact on
the SPLAYED HAND of the Groper, cleanly SEVERING it at the wrist. The
Groper FAINTS dead away as a TREMENDOUS CHEER greets Bill's amazing feat.
One of the Natives TOSSES Bill the severed hand.

Bill SLIDES the ring off the finger and TOSSES it to the Chinese Dancer.

BILL THE BUTCHER
There's for your beauty and your song.

The Dancer puts the ring on her finger and DANCES OFF. Bill TOSSES the
hand to the floor and walks back to his table. The Crowd PARTS, murmuring
compliments on his dexterity, and the Knife Kids reverently RETURN the
Butcher's implements.

Now two DOGS from the rat pit in the back room RUN through the crowd and
FIGHT FRENZIEDLY over possession of the bloody hand.

The Crowd PASSES the Groper overhead and WE SEE from ABOVE: the Groper's
unconscicus BODY being passed from hand to hand. The Crowd looks like a
wave bearing the body toward the door. The Groper's stump BLEEDS on them
as he passes overhead, sprinkling drops of blood and flesh like a moveable
sacrament.

Bill approaches his table, acknowledging the continuing adulation, and is
about to sit down when a VOICE rises above all others.

AMSTERDAM
Mr. Poole!

Bill turns, searching out the voice ...

AMSTERDAM
Bill Poole!

And SEES Amsterdam, standing at his own table. His attitude is calm,
smiling, respectful. But his eyes are demonic.

AMSTERDAM
My compliments on your exhibition, sir.

BILL THE BUTCHER
Thank you, sir.

AMSTERDAM
It was like watching a dance.
(Bill nods his thanks)
Some great grand goddamned dance. (Bill looks at him more closely)
You know me, sir.

BILL THE BUTCHER
Do I? Are you missing a finger?

Appreciative laughter from the crowd.

AMSTERDAM
No. A father.

The laughter turns a little uneasy. Bill the Butcher sizes up the younger
man.

BILL THE BUTCHER
Do you have a name?

AMSTERDAM
Amsterdam.

BILL THE BUTCHER
That's a New York name.
(suddenly smiles)
shall we drink to it?

AMSTERDAM
Indeed.
(they drink)
And to my other name. Vallon. Will you drink to that?

BILL THE BUTCHER
Priest Vallon's son?
(Amsterdam nods)
Of course I'll drink to that. Your father was a worthy man.

AMSTERDAM
Not worthy of you. Those dogs ain't worthy of you. You ain't worth what
they feed on, and what they shit's too good for you.

DEAD QUIET. Absolute. Breathless. Only the Chinese Gamblers at their
fan-tan ignore this confrontation.

BILL THE BUTCHER
What do you want, boyo?

AMSTERDAM
I got to give you something, Butcher. Something from my father.

Amsterdam PULLS OUT the piratels knife which Bill the Butcher used to kill
his father almost 12 years before.

BILL THE BUTCHER
You got the sand to draw a blade in front of me? You will make good sport.
Come ahead and give it here, you son of a bitch.

 
And Amsterdam THROWS the knife, the bright blade FLASHING OUT of his hand
like lightning.

And just as quickly the Buitcher PICKS UP his table, sending glasses
flying and breaking, using it as a SHIELD...

... and the knife THUMPS into it dead center. The Butcher HEAVES the table
at Amsterdam...sending PATRONS yelling and SCATTERING.

Amsterdam LEAPS out of the way of the table, then RUNS AT Bill the
Butcher...

... who's already coming for him. As they CLASH and GRAPPLE with each
other...

... PATRONS all over the Pagoda crowd around for a good view of the action
and start to MAKE BETS on the outcome. The odds do not favor Amsterdam.

And neither does the fight. Amsterdam fights with real blood lust, but he
doesn't have the Butcher's skill, or experience, or dispassion. He breaks
the Butcher's CLINCH... HITS him once in the face... then a second time
... and then gets FLOORED by a well placed kick. The Crowd cheers.

And, on the second floor, Jenny and Johnny come out of the room. Still
arranging her clothes, Jenny looks over the gallery rail onto the floor
below, sees the fight... and starts to RUN down the stairs. Johnny WATCHES
her go ... looks at the fight again, for a second... then follows Jenny to
the main floor.

The Butcher is on top of Amsterdam now. He HITS him upside the head with
the wood and brass handle of his cleaver. Then hits him again. AND AGAIN.

In the Crowd now, Jenny finds Sheeny Mike.

JENNY
The Butcher'll kill him if we don't do something.

SHEENY MIKE
It was Amsterdam's own doing. And it'll be our death too if we try to stop
it.

JOHNNY
(finally catching up)
That's the truth.

JENNY
The truth is you don't give a damn about him.

SHEENY MIKE
Yeah, well, if he gave a damn about us he wouldn't have called out the
Butcher in the first place.

Jenny looks at him with contempt, then STARTS into the crowd. Johnny grabs
her ARM but she pushes him off.

On the floor, Bill uses the FLAT SIDE of the cleaver to SMACK the barely
conscious Amsterdam on one side of his face... then on the other...
REPEATEDLY... until Amsterdam is barely sensible. Bill grabs him by the
hair. Amsterdam's body is slack.

BILL THE BUTCHER
What do you say? Loin or shank? Rib or chop?

The Crowd YELLS their choices. Jenny tries to PLUNGE through toward
Amsterdam, but a HALF-DOZEN MORTS and WHORES put hands on her and HOLD her
back.

BILL THE BUTCHER
Come on, let me hear you!
(the Crowd yells louder)
You're all talking at once, I can't hear you!
(a near frenzy)
I don't hear the choicest cut! The best, the vital!
(they quiet a little to listen)
The heart. I think I must have the heart!

This is greeted with the biggest CHEER of the night. The newlyelected
Mayor Wood seems to feel as if he should do something to stop the
slaughter, but Boss Tweed calms him with a single dismissive GESTURE. Even
the Boss himself is excited by the prospect of this ritual sacrifice.

BILL THE BUTCHER
Come on, look at it! You fancy yourself a gladiator, act a gladiator!
(raises his cleaver)
Watch the death blow when it comes to you. Go to hell with open eyes!

Bill the Butcher readies himself to deliver the blow... and a HAND GRABS

his wrist, STOPPING his arm.

Who would dare do this to Bill the Butcher? Bill turns, incredulous, to
look into...

... the untroubled face of Monk Eastman.

MONK EASTMAN
It's been a full evening's fun now, Butcher. It's enough.

BILL THE BUTCHER
You got nothing to do with this, Monk.

MONK EASTMKN
Well I'm the game warden, you might say. I'm telling you this buck's too
young yet. Wait till he's aged for a proper kill.

BILL THE BUTCHER
The hell.

With his gigantic strength, Monk actually PULLS the Butcher off Amsterdam
and onto his feet.

MONK EASTMKN
Just settle yourself Bill ...

... and he part SHOVES, part THROWS Bill back a good twenty feet.

MONK EASTMKN
... and let the merrymaking continue.

The Dead Rabbits have scampered forward, and they're picking Amsterdam up
off the floor. Monk looks at Jenny and Johnny, who each have Amsterdam by
an arm.

MONK EASTMAN
It was his father took me in first, and it's thanks I'm returning now.

BILL THE BUTCHER
Eastman!

MONK EASTMAN
(ignoring Bill)
This squares any debt. Get him out of here.

BILL THE BUTCHER
Monk Eastman!

As the Rabbits CARRY Amsterdam toward the door, Monk finally turns his
attention back to Bill.

BILL THE BUTCHER
I'll have you then!

MONK EASTMAN
Come ahead, Bill. Unless you're wanting to shout me to death.

And Bill comes forward, BRANDISHING his cleaver. Monk Eastman stands his
ground, unmoving, untroubled. Everyone looks on in awe at this contest ...

... except Boss Tweed.

BOSS TWEED
(to Killoran)
If these two are going to combat, it aught to be a worthier occasion. And
more rewarding for all.

Tweed SIGNALS to Bill: STOP. The Butcher sees the signal but can't believe
it. He SHAKES his head. His blood is up. He won't stop.

Tweed SIGNALS AGAIN. Bill KEEPS COMING.

Tweed signals Killoran, who STANDS himself. And, when he stands, every COP
and TAMMANY LOYALIST in the place--a hundred of them anyway--STAND behind
Boss Tweed.

As Bill keeps coming, and Monk stands easy, waiting...

... the Natives and their ALLIES now stand, facing the Tammany crew. The
Tammany backers, dressed flush and fancy, face the scruffier, more savage
Five Points bunch: the twin factions of the criminal underworld, so
different in style and so similar in purpose, SIZE EACH OTHER UP from
opposite sides of the room.

Bill STOPS. The odds are shifting, the stakes are climbing. Even the
Chinese STOP GAMBLING. For the first time all evening the room is
absolutely STILL. Even the Dead Rabbits have turned, at the door, to see
what will happen.

Tweed and the Butcher LOCK EYES: neither blinks. Then after a moment ... a
very long moment ... a calm, bemused Tweed RAISES his glass.

BOSS TWEED
I only wanted to thank you, Bill, for the customary good job today... and
an equally bright future for us both.

Another pause. Bill does not look placated. The whole place seems ready to
explode...

... until Boss Tweed RISES to his feet, and RAISES his glass higher.

BOSS TWEED
Will you drink with me, Bill, as a friend? An honored friend.

Bill weighs the proposition... then looks to his men, NODS his head to
call them off. He GRABS a glass off a table to join Tweed's toast.

The MUSIC begins again. The gambling recommences. Patrons take their
seats. The Dead Rabbits help Amsterdam out the door.

Monk Eastman sidles up to Bill the Butcher.

MONK EASTMAN
If there's one thing I can't abide, it's fighting for free.

He takes the Butcher's glass from his hand, raises it in salute, DRINKS
DEEP and hands it back to him.

At the door of the Pagoda, a badly beaten Ansterdam starts FLAILING and
fighting by brute instinct. He HITS Jenny, and she goes down. Johnny
grapples with him as Jenny PICKS HERSELF up and struggles to help SUBDUE
Amsterdam.

JENNY
Go easy! Go easy. It's over.

JOHNNY
He knew what he was doing, hitting you.

JENNY
Let's get him up.

She grabs Amsterdam's arm and, with Johnny's help, tries to HOIST him back
to his feet.

JENNY
(Looking at Amsterdam's bloody face)
Therels too damn little of him left to know anything.

They start across Paradise Square, holding him up...

... as the rest of the Dead Rabbits join to help them... all growing
smaller in the distance against the primeval nighttime landscape of the
Five Points...

... and the Bouncer CLOSES the door.

DISSOLVE TO

66 INT. DON WHISKERANDOS BARBER SHOP DAY

Another DOOR OPENS, and Amsterdam stands on the threshold. A week or so
has passed since the big night at Sparrow's Pagoda, but Amsterdam's face
still shows the marks of Bill's beating.

Don Whiskerandos is ministering to Monk Eastman with a straight razor,
giving him a close and careful shave. Monk is thoroughly relaxed, doesn't
even glance over when the door opens, hardly reacts when Don Whiskerandos
says ....

DON WHISKERANDOS
Someone's here for you.

MONK EASTMAN
That so? What's he look like?

DON WHISKERANDOS
He looks pretty damned sorry.

MONK EASTMAN
(looks at Amsterdam)
Indeed.- Can I buy you a shave?

AMSTERDAM
No thanks.

MONK EASTMAN
Face is too sore, eh? I understand.

AMSTERDAM
No. I'm beholden enough to you as it is. I don't like to be beholden.

MONK EASTMAN
We're all even, son. There's nothing more between us.

AMSTERDAM
I'd like it if there was.

MONK EASTMAN
Are you proposing employment?

AMSTERDAM
A collaboration. The Dead Rabbits got to get strong before we make another
move. I figure you're the one to make us strong. There's a lot we can
learn from you.

MONK EASTMAN
Boyo, I'm a freebooter and a mercenary, not a teacher. I can't learn
nothing from you and I can't earn nothing from you either.

AMSTERDAM
The Dead Rabbits is going to be glorious again. We're going to reign over
the Points.

MONK EASTMAN
And Bill Poole's Natives? What will they have to say?

AMSTERDAM
Nothing. They won't have tongues left to speak.

MONK EASTMAN
Don't worry about what theylll have in their mouths. You think about what
they got in their hands.
(beat)
Listen, son... take a word from a man who was honored to fight beside your
father. Temper yourself like a sword, and pay attention to balance. Anger
spoils an edge.

AMSTERDAM
Then you say no?

Monk SIGHS and points to a huge WAR CLUB which hangs in a place of honor
above the shop mirror. It has deep marks running along its front, like
NOTCHES-

MONK EASTMAN
You see my instrument there? First notch represents two dollars and fifty
cents. That's how much I got for my first kill. There are forty-eight more
notches after it, and my fee has grown with each one. I can accommodate
you alright, but you got to afford me. So do business with me or do it on
your own.

AMSTERDAM
Everything I got is still to come. So I guess it's on my own, then.

MONK EASTMAN
Fair enough. You'll find independence a fine thing, a fierce thing.
Although I do hold money preferable to all.
(Amsterdam turns to leave)

But I'm sure we'll have news of each other.

AMSTERDAM
Bound to.

As he shuts the door of the shop, Monk Eastman gestures to Don
Whiskerandos for another hot towel.

CUT TO

67 EXT. STREETS OFF PARADISE SQUARE DAY

A large wagon bearing a Tammany banner and carrying dozens of small sacks
of coal moves slowly down the narrow street. Boss Tweed sits on the front
seat, next to the driver, as his minions HAND him coal sacks. Tweed
distributes them with a smile to the NEEDY who trot next to the wagon.

BOSS TWEED
(to the people as they grab the coal)
Tammany's here to take the chill off the winter and the weight off your
heart. It's Tammany can make this city a fit place, with the help and vote
of all you good people...

As he continues, Bill the Butcher JUMPS onto the wagon and sits down
beside him. Boss Tweed hardly gives him a glance.

BILL THE BUTCHER
You sent me word.

BOSS TWEED
We could use help here. Grab a sack.

BILL THE BUTCHER
I keep my hands clean.

BOSS TWEED
(now he looks at him)
So I've observed.

BILL THE BUTCHER
(tense)
Better be on your mark to talk like that to me. It was you stopped me at
the Pagoda. I would have cut Monk inside out.

BOSS TWEED
What if you hadn't? Think of the embarrassment. And what if you had?
Consider the waste. Next time you're in a dust-up like that, think ahead
and make proper plans. It'd be a grand source of revenue, whoever prevails.

BILL THE BUTCHER
It touches my heart how you always. have our best interests in mind.

BOSS TWEED
Our mutual interests. That's why I want you to contact Monk Eastman.
(Bill's incredulous)
I want you to extend a proposition. I want him to join US.

BILL THE BUTCHER
What?

BOSS TWEED
Oh, not Tammany, of course not. We could no more have him there than you.
But he should throw in with the Native Americans, become aware of our
Arrangement and ... well, use his influence, shall we say, to enrich us
all.

BILL THE BUTCHER
You're saying I can't do everything you need? You don't think the Natives
has been doing good and right? You think there's something more he can do
that I ...

BOSS TWEED
(interrupting)
It's none of that, Bill. None of that. His independence is like a rebuke
to Tammany. And an insult to you.

BILL THE BUTCHER
Then you should have let me have him at Sparrow's.

BOSS TWEED
I should. If I'd been confident-absolutely certain--that you would have
prevailed. Monk is an unpredictable power, and a figure of size. He needs
to be reckoned with.

BILL THE BUTCHER
He needs to be killed.

BOSS TWEED
No. He's an elemental force. Them you don't destroy. But you can contain
them and use them for the good they give off.

He hands Bill a sack of coal.

BOSS TWEED
Coal?

Bill doesn't answer. He HOPS DOWN off the moving wagon, and the Needy give
way quickly before him, then regroup and SWARM after Tweed and his coal.
The Boss continues with his Tammany spiel-enjoying all the attention--as
the Butcher watches, disdainful of Tweed but filled with angry
frustration. From his face we ...

DISSOLVE TO

68 INT. DON WHISKERA.NDOS BARBER SHOP DAY

... the incredulous face of Monk Eastman, as he looks at Bill the Butcher.

MONK EASTMAN
And this is your offer?

BILL THE BUTCHER
It's Boss Tweedls offer.

MONK EASTMAN
How do you think we'd sit as allies, Bill?

BILL THE BUTCHER
The only way we could tolerate being near each other would be stretched
out dead.

MONK EASTMAN
My thoughts exactly. Then why are you here? Because you were asked to be.
You were ordered to be. And who would order me among the Natives? You? And
would you follow my orders, even if they was being relayed from William
Marcy Tweed himself?

He EASES himself out of the barber chair. The Butcher TENSES as Monk comes
toward him.

MONK EASTMAN
Dubious and doubtful, my friend. But your offer--pardon, the offer you
bring--is the most generous that's ever been extended. I favor the terms,
if not the personalities. So let us decide the way any Native American
would appreciate. We'll do it the democratic way.

He throws open the door of the barber shop and stands there, beside Bill
the Butcher, his arm thrown carelessly around him. PASSERSBY stop in
wonderment as Monk ADDRESSES them.

MONK EASTMAN
Citizens of the Five Points! It seems the Native Americans have come to
trouble. They have grown so weak that now they seek my help. They can pay
any wage I ask. But I ask you now. Even for money, should I carouse and
conspire alongside a boyo like this with gristle on his knife and spittle
on his chin every time his cock gets hard?

Monk is beaming, the Butcher is appalled. His body tenses like a snake
ready to spring. But the people in the street just STARE- They can't
believe what they've just heard.

MONK EASTMAN
(to Bill)
There. You see. I'm afraid the people have spoken.

BILL THE BUTCHER
I'll see you again, you bog Irish bastard.

MONK EASTMAN
Well, if it's a fight you want now, Bill, remember to come back with a
bankroll.

Monk returns to the shop and the comfort of his chair. Bill GLARES at the
people in the street. One lock from him starts them moving fast. But they
do not look away from him quite so fast, or at him, either, with quite the
same fear.

CUT TO

69 INT. MISSION (FORMERLY OLD BREWERY) NIGHT

The vast main room has been changed into a dance floor and decorated for
the evening. An altar has been hung with bunting; SHIP'S LANTERNS and
CANDLES illuminate the place. The REVEREND SHADRACH RALEIGH GREETS
everyone. The room, already crowded with CELEBRANTS of all ages, grows
quiet as the Dead Rabbits, done up in their party best, show up for the
revelry.

REVEREND RALEIGH
Ah, the Native Americans, is it now?

AMSTERDAM
Are they coming?

JENNY
We don't want a ruckus, minister.

REVEREND RALEIGH
Nor do I. I intended no disrespect. I'd heard the Native Americans were
figures of the greatest prominence here.

AMSTERDAM
Indeed they are, just for the moment. Let them come. Happy to have them.
Everyone's welcome in a house of God, isn't that right, Reverend?

REVEREND RALEIGH
As all are welcome in heaven.

SHEENY MIKE
Ild like to go to heaven. Ild like to go to heaven and bite off Gabriells
ear.

REVEREND RALEIGH
You're still welcome, even with such peculiar appetites.

AMSTERDAM
But if the Natives do come, Father...

REVEREND RALEIGH
I'm not a priest, son ...

AMSTERDAM
... there's no accounting for what may follow.

REVEREND RALEIGH
I'm sure God's hand will guide us in that. Just as He guided you here at
the right perfect time, with a right perfect regent. The young lady with
the sunset hair. Miss ...

JENNY
Everdeane. Jenny Everdeane.

REVEREND RALEIGH
Miss Everdeane. Step forward, please.

Radiant and curious, Jenny joins the Reverend Raleigh in the center of the
room.

REVEREND RALEIGH
And the evening's regent chooses her evening's partner.

There is much MUTTERING about this from everyone. Someone makes a wet,
farting SOUND.

REVERAND RALEIGH
(unfazed)
Here we make only joyful noises to the Lord.

Under the instruction of the bustling Reverend and his HELPERS, the Women
skeptically stand away from the Men, who allow themselves to be arranged
into a LINE. The Reverend Raleigh escorts the delighted Jenny to a chair
that has been placed, by itself, in the center of the room. Jenny sits
down, facing away from the rest of the guests. She holds a MIRROR in her
hand.

REVEREND RALEIGH
Now. The men, please. One by one.

The first volunteer Reverend Raleigh brings forward is a reluctant Sheeny
Mike. There are RUDE COMMENTS as he leads Mike slowly to the center of the
room, coming up behind Jenny until she can see Mikels face reflected in
the mirror. She SHAKES her head.

REVEREND RALEIGH
Next Gentleman, please.

More laughing. The BOYS push out one CANDIDATE. Rejected.

Now ANOTHER CANDIDATE comes forward. And STILL ANOTHER- Jenny rejects each
with the composure of a princess.

Now it is Johnny's turn. He WALKS slowly across the big room, and stands
behind Jenny, trying to look confident. The moment is long, the room's
tense... until--just once but very decisively-Jenny SHAKES her head.

Jenny watches Johnny's face in the mirror. She stays still. Finally, he
walks back to the GANG.

Now Amsterdam starts toward the center of the room. He keeps his eyes
fixed on Jenny.

Jenny catches Amsterdam's reflection in the mirror. He STOPS. She NODS her
head. Yes. Him.

A small BAND strikes up a barely recognizable version of "A Mighty
Fortress Is Our God," arranged in waltz time. Jenny rises and holds out
her arms to Amsterdam. They start to DANCE, a little clumsily, as other
COUPLES join them.

AMSTERDAM
So you accept?

JENNY
What?

AMSTERDAM
You accept to be my mort and no one else's.

JENNY
(teasing)
No, it's just that I didn't recognize you in the mirror. You still got
some of the face the Butcher gave you.

AMSTERDAM
(going along with the joke)
It's not the Butcher, it's the dancing. It shifts my face all around.

JENNY
Maybe you'll look better later.

The Reverend Raleigh and his Helpers DASH among the dancers, distributing
LIGHTED CANDLES, which the COUPLES take and hold as they move around the
floor.

AMSTERDAM
I will if we're together later.
(she smiles)
And what about after that? After tonight?

JENNY
I chose you just for tonight. If that's not good enough I'll go with
someone else.

She takes a candle from the Reverend and holds it so the light FLICKERS on
Amsterdam's face.

AMSTERDAM
I'll have tonight. But after this don't come to me no more till you're
ready. No more.

His eyes, in the candlelight, show both his love and his Resolution. Jenny
NODS and they DANCE AWAY ...

... losing themselves now among the dancers, all moving and holding
candles. As they dance, their movement becomes SPLIT, SEQUENTIAL, a study
in motion like an old Gjon Mili photograph. Their bodies create a RUSH OF
YELLOW LIGHT ACROSS the screen like the tail of a comet.

CUT TO

70 INT- DEAD RABBITS HOUSE NIGHT

In the hallway. JOHNNY stands pressed against a door.

JOHNNY
(whispering)
Amsterdam.
(louder; hissing)
Amsterdam!

AMSTERDAM (V.O.)
Who is it?

JOHNNY
Me.

AMSTERDAM
Come on in.

JOHNNY
I don't want to come in! You come out.

AMSTERDAM
Just a damn minute.

AMSTERDAM comes to the door, half-dressed and sleepy. We see Jenny asleep
on the floor inside.

AMSTERDAM
What do you want?

CUT TO

71 EXT. PIER/DEAD RABBITS HOUSE NIGHT

Just before dawn. The streets are empty, the river is quiet. AMSTERDAM
follows JOHNNY out of the house.

JOHNNY
I'm going to fight you.

AMSTERDAM
Oh, Jesus, Johnny, I'm tired. How about sometime else?

JOHNNY
Now.

AMSTERDAM
You want to tell me what this fight's over? Is it The Butcher? Jenny?
(Johnny turns, determined)
Alright, alright. Then tell me why like this?

JOHNNY
So when I lose no one will see.

And he SLUGS him. Hard. Harder even than he thought he could. AMSTERDAM
stumbles, stunned, then pulls himself up. And CHARGES at Johnny, knocking
him down.

The two friends PUNCH, WRESTLE, BITE and PUMMEL EACH OTHER with such
extravagant energy that they soon...

... ROLL OFF the pier...

CUT TO

72 EXT. PIER DAWN

... onto the muddy ground underneath the pier. They LAND with a shuddering
SPLASH in the soggy earth, but they keep fighting ....

... as a PACK OF ORPHANS, eyes glinting like night animals, scatter like
wild beasts disturbed in their burrow.

Amsterdam has the physical advantage, and more skill. But Johnny has the
fury. All the feeling and the frustration rain out of him physically,
making the match nearly even.

The Orphan Pack watches the fight silently, showing no favoritism or
emotion, just an edge of curiosity.

Amsterdam HITS Johnny a wicked combination that makes him SINK to one knee
in the mud. But Johnny will not go down. Amsterdam, hurt himself, just
stares at Johnny in wonderment.

AMSTERDAM
Satisfied?

JOHNNY
Satisfied? It wasn't me that's been dancing and shagging all night.

And he pulls himself to his feet and THROWS a roundhouse at Amsterdam, who
half-staggers out of the way. The moment throws Johnny off balance, and he
falls in the mud again, this time on all fours. Amsterdam SINKS down
beside him.

AMSTERDAM
Enough.

Johnny won't stop: he throws a punch that Amsterdam can see coming a block
away. But he's too tired too duck; or maybe he's just fed up. He takes the
punch and FALLS on his back.

AMSTERDAM
That's it then.

JOHNNY
The hell.

And he THROWS HIMSELF on Amsterdam. It's more like he rolls over onto him
than anything, but he's on top of him now, hitting him in the face with
all he's got left in him.

AMSTERDAM
Goddamn it.

Amsterdam HEAVES Johnny off and pops him a solid SWIPE to the jaw. That
does it. Lights out. Johnny falls unconscious into the slime beneath the
pier.

The Orphan Pack keeps staring from the shadow with their ferret eyes.
Still silent. Amsterdam STRUGGLES to his feet, stops at the river's edge
to get a handful of water to revive himself. Then he looks over, sees his
unconscious friend.

AMSTERDAM
Goddamn you anyway.

He grabs Johnny's body by the shoulders and pulls him to the river's edge.
He gets some water on his hand, lets it drip over Johnny's face, washing
away a little of the blood. Not enough. He draws some more water, and RUBS
it gently onto Johnny's face.

CLOSE: on the motion of his hand. It is nearly gentle.

CUT TO

73 INT. DON WHISKERANDOS BARBER SHOP DAY

As Don Whiskerandos' hand, holding a razor, travels over the great plains
of Monk Eastman's face. His hand is shaking.

MONK EASTMAN
What's the trouble, Don?

DON WHISKERANDOS
There's someone here.

Monk bestirs himself in the chair, SEES: Bill the Butcher, standing in the
doorway.

MONK EASTMAN
It's just a man of commerce.

Monk settles back in the chair as Bill the Butcher walks into the shop.

BILL THE BUTCHER
You're right enough this time, Monk.
(to Don Whiskerandos)
Go ahead.
(the barber hesitates)
Go on with your work. I'll finish my business.

Don Whiskerandos picks up a pair of SCISSORS and NERVOUSLY starts to TRIM
Monk's hair.

MONK EASTMAN
Come out with it then.

Bill NODS emphatically at Don Whiskerandos, who is clearly terrified. Bill
nods again, almost vehemently. Don Whiskerandos SHAKES his head. Bill
GLARES at him. The Barber takes a STEP BACK. Monk opens his eyes, starts
to size up the situation.

BILL THE BUTCHER
You damn craven, do it!

Bill LEAPS forward, grabs the trembling barber's arm and pushes it toward
MONK...

MONK EASTMAN
(rising from his chair)
What the hell...

...and the scissors, held by Don Whiskerandos and pushed by Bill the
Butcher, meet Monk full in the face as he bolts from the chair. The long
scissor BLADE SINKS into Monkls right eye.

MONK BELLOWS, staggers toward Don Whiskerandos, who shrinks against the
wall. The scissor protrudes from Monk's eye as he RAGES, blinded by blood,
now reaching out for the Butcher

BILL THE BUTCHER
Your eyes was open for that alright. And you still got one to see this.

Bill the Butcher reaches above him for Monk's war club, which hangs on the
wall. He grabs tight hold of it and, with Monk nearly upon him, swings it
viciously at Monk's head. The BLOW sends the scissor FLYING out of Monk's
eye, with the eyeball still attached. It also SMASHES in the side of
Monk's face. He FALLS, still GRABBING desperately for the Butcher...

... who now stands over him, beating him incessantly with the war club.
CAVING his head in. KILLING him.

Don Whiskerandos looks at Bill in a virtual paralysis of terror. The
Butcher lets the CLUB FALL, reaches in his pocket and throws some MONEY at
the barber.

BILL THE BUTCHER
If I was you I'd use that to open in a new location. Consider St. Louis.

The enormity of what he's done is beginning to sink in. He turns to leave
the shop ... but STOPS in the doorway.

Outside, CITIZENS of the Points are staring at the fallen Monk in mute
wonder. They have just witnessed a moment in history.

Bill the Butcher surveys them all silently, then calls out to Don
Whiskerandos.

BILL THE BUTCHER
The war club.

The barber steels himself to CARRY the bloody club to the Butcher, who
hefts it slowly in his hands, in view of all.

He takes a knife from his vest, and CUTS the LAST NOTCH in the club. Then,
slowly...

... he steps down into the crowd, which PARTS before him. He

walks among them in regal splendor, the war club at his side, dripping
gore.

As the crowd falls back, Bill spots Amsterdam, Johnny and some of the
other Dead Rabbits, watching his every mave. He STOPS.

 
HOLDS OUT the bloody war club in front of him... straight in front of
him... POINTING IT right at Amsterdam.

BILL THE BUTCHER
I promise you, Amsterdam. I promise you.

Then he grins, turns away and walks through the crowd: prince of all he
surveys.

CUT TO

74 INT. RESTAURANT/PARK ROW

Boss Tweed reigns in the banquet room of a vast, gaslit restaurant, at a
long table overburdened with food. Seated along both sides of the table is
an array of the city's POWER BROKERS, with whom Tweed and his Tammany
MINIONS mix easily. Their attitude toward the Power Brokers is a mixture
of ribald fawning and fine condescension; the Power Brokers, in turn,
enjoy the food, and the MUSIC from a small BAND, and the DANCING GIRLS who
flirt and entertain them, while exuding the unmistakable impression of
amateur anthropologists exploring a decaying civilization.

Tweed is courting and joking with a bewhiskered HORACE GREELEY, editor of
the influential Tribune.

GREELEY
I may enjoy the bounty of your table and the pleasures of your company,
Mr. Tweed ...

BOSS TWEED
And the pleasures of the company provided you, Mr. Greeley.

GREELEY
...without the Tribune endorsing your politics.

BOSS TWEED
I suppose you can at that. Take with one hand, flay with the other.
Virtuels on your conscience, Horace, but Tammany's in your heart.

Killoran materializes at Tweed's side and whispers something quickly,
discreetly in his ear. Tweed EXCUSES himself, rises quickly and WALKS
across the restaurant floor...

... past the Band and the Dancing Giris ...

... to the swinging doors of the kitchen. As he pushes open the SWINGING
DOOR, his face has lost its humor.

CUT TO

75 INT. KITCHEN/RESTAURANT/PARK ROW

A madhouse of activity. WAITERS in black suits, vests and serving outfits
STREAM by carrying huge TRAYS of food while the KITCHEN STAFF works
double-time to keep up with the unceasing volume.

As Boss Tweed walks in, Bill the Butcher PLUCKS a piece of roasted poultry
off a tray as it's carried out the door.

BILL THE BUTCHER
I'm not good enough for your table, so I eat where I can. (takes a big
bite)
It's good, what is it?

BOSS TWEED
Pheasant.

BILL THE BUTCHER
Is that like pigeon? I killed a pigeon once but it didn't taste nothing
like this.

BOSS TWEED
You killed a bull this morning. I told you to make an Arrangement with
him, and you come back with his blood on your hands.

BILL THE BUTCHER
(chewing his food)
He insulted me. He aggravated me. I couldn't stand for that, for no one.

BOSS TWEED
You stand for anything if I tell you.

BILL THE BUTCHER
You think I should be afraid of you. You act like lightning strikes when
you talk.

As they talk, and the tension builds between them, the two men are
constantly BUFFETED by the swinging doors and the unending stream of
WAITERS.

BILL THE BUTCHER
I never was afraid of you, so don't think I was or act like I was, you
ain't earned it.

BOSS TWEED
What did you earn us, killing Monk?

BILL THE BUTCHER
Where'd you earn the right to ask that question? You raised some dust in
the streets a while back, but no more. You got power but you ain't got
muscle and you ain't got a notion what it means to be a warrior.

BOSS TWEED
I see it lost you a lot of God's sense, along with that eye.

BILL THE BUTCHER
You don't know nothing about that! It was my doing! It says in The Book,
"If thy eye offend thee, pluck it out." I followed that law with my own
knife and hand. The first I ever fought Priest Vallon, he bested me. And
when he came to bring me to death, I looked away and he watched me and he
let me go. The shame was worse than the killing. I would have cut out both
eyes if I could still have fought, but cutting just the one gave me heart.
When I killed Priest Vallon, that restored me. Now I sent Monk Eastman
over I got glory. I got all there is, and small thanks to you, squire.

BOSS TWEED
(measured, conciliatory) You need two eyes to see the depth, Bill. That's
how we help each other. If it wasn't for me would be happy enough to
plunder the Points and put the fear into people who don't know nothing
else. But Bill, I'm only saying... I'm counselinm... look in the distance.
You want to sit at my table, fine. But you must always remember who the
host is. It's not a matter of courage welre talking. It's manners.

Bill grabs another piece of food from a tray.

BILL THE BUTCHER
Howls these manners?

BOSS TWEED
Fine, if you're hungry.

BILL THE BUTCHER
I'm always hungry.

BOSS TWEED
I've always told you, Bill. There's plenty for all, and more for us
together than separate. We'll dine together sometime.

Bill the Butcher nods, appeased, and leaves, swaggering his way through
the kitchen chaos, making everyone get out of his way. Boss Tweed watches
him go, his expression changing from bemused appeasement to molten rage.

CUT TO

76 INT. RESTAURANT/PARK ROW

Later. Everyone's gone except some WAITERS, cleaning up, and Boss Tweed
and Daniel Killoran, who sit at the end of the banquet table. Leftover
plates of food have been massed at Tweedls place and, as he talks, he
PICKS from them.

BOSS TWEED
Let me put this to you, Daniel. Now that the Butcher has killed the single
most prominent figure in the Five Points--a man of myth and moment--who is
there to take his place?
(as Killoran starts to answer)
Of course. Then what do we do about the Butcher? He's too useful to be
killed, but he must be checked.

KILLARAN
It could be a police matter.

BOSS TWEED
Impossible! Any cops who might have the mettle to go against the Butcher
have blood ties to the gangs. They can't be trusted. And any cops that can
be trusted are too craven to be any use. If Bill's to be checked, it must
come from within the Points, not without.

KILLORAN
The Dead Rabbits did a proud job for elections. That Amsterdam boy has
sand.

BOSS TWEED
That so? The last time I saw him he was under the Butcher's knife looking
like a fine filet. Who else is there?

KILLORAN
Well, the Rough and Tumble Boys over to Slaughterhouse Point. There's
Country McCleesterls bunch, too, and the Plug Uglies, but there's none
that have the promise of the Dead Rabbits, or the stake, neither.

BOSS TWEED
What would that be?

KILLORAN
The boy Amsterdam has a blood feud with the Butcher. He's sworn revenge
for the death of his father, and he's got the heart to carry it forward.
He'll have the skill and power soon enough.

BOSS TWEED
Blood will make a man intrepid. Bring them along, then. Nurture the
Rabbits with neglect. Let them roam where they like.

KILLORAN
And if they roam into some portion of our own revenues?

BOSS TWEED
I'd tolerate a little trespassing if it was for a higher good and use.
They'll cross with the Natives soon enough and keep each other occupied.

KILLORAN
Bill's got to be a lot more than occupied.

BOSS TWEED
I'll hold Bill in check. If he becomes unwieldy ... well, damn it all,
Daniel, I might just have to oil up my old musket. What do you think of
that, eh?

Boss Tweed gets up from the table. A WAITER is DIMMING the gaslights,
filling the room with deep shadows.

KILLORAN
It'd be gratifying, Mr. Tweed. Even edifying.

BOSS TWEED
But poor politics, eh? Well, we musn't have that.
(as he walks away)
I do miss those roistering days, though. Oh, and bring some of that food
for the canaries.

CUT TO

77 EXT. STREET/THE BLOODY ANGLE DAY

The sharply-angled turn of Doyers Street, nicknamed "The Bloody Angle."
SOUND of a horse and cart as we see a row of UPTURNED mostly WOMEN and
YOUNG CHILDREN.

A NATIVE AMERICAN drives a cart carrying large barrels of MILK. A SECOND
NATIVE rides beside him on the seat, holding a rifle, looking impassively
at the faces turned up to him. A WOMAN holding a BABY in one arm and a
CHILD by the hand steps in front of them. They almost run her down.

WOMAN
We ain't had no milk this week.

NATIVE 2
You can have as much as you can pay for.
(to crowd)
Anyone that's got the ned, step up with your pitchers. Any not, come back
when you do.

The Woman gives her children to other WOMEN in the crowd and advances
toward the wagon. Native 2 cocks his rifle...

... and Jenny steps from the watchful Crowd.

JENNY
I got ned enough for all. See? Fair enough?

She holds her hand out as she WALKS slowly toward the milk wagon. She's
carrying a huge fistful of GLEAMING COINS. The Natives on the wagon watch
her warily...

... and are JUMPED from behind by a couple of Dead Rabbits. Amsterdam
grabs a milk pitcher from a WOMAN in the crowd, AXES open the spigot on a
milk barrel and FILLS the pitcher to overflowing. Jenny JUMPS up on the
wagon seat.

JENNY
(to Amsterdam)
What's our rate? What do we charge?

AMSTERDAM
Johnny worked it out to a nickel less than the Natives. Just till we're
established. Then we raise it a penny more than now.

JENNY
Raise it? Is that what you want?

AMSTERDAM
You say, then.

JENNY
(beat; then, to Crowd) There'll be no paying at all this day. Or this
week, neither. This is Dead Rabbits business from now on.

The Crowd scrambles for milk and the Rabbits try to keep ORDER.

JENNY
(to Crowd)
We'll take ned if you got it, now or in future. But no one will go without.

AMSTERDAM
(to Jenny)
Except us. You opening a charity?

JENNY
They'll pay us what they owe, in loyalty if not in cash. Tammany gives
coal, we give milk.

AMSTERDAM
They can afford it.

JENNY
Can't we?

CUT TO

78 INT. MOTHER JOYCE'S BORDELLO DAY

The midday sun shining through the windows makes the place look tatty and
slightly desperate: this is a place that needs low light and long shadows
to look good.

Amsterdam and Johnny are at a long bar, talking to Mother Joyce, a beefy,
wised-up woman with pornographic tattoos an both forearms.

MOTHER JOYCE
This place is so clean it's the next thing to chaste. And safe as a
convent, too.

AMSTERDAM
From the Natives, maybe. But not from us.

MOTHER JOYCE
You're saying I got to worry about your mob too?

JOHNNY
No worries at all. You throw in with the Dead Rabbits and we'll worry
about the Natives.

Across the room, Jenny is sitting talking to a few of the WHORES, one of
whom is a mixed-blood Eurasian with long black hair named Emma Loss. She
gets up lazily and heads for the bar. As she passes a DRUNK, he reaches
out to grab her. She's used to this, and she knocks his hand away. He
keeps after her.

At the bar, Mother Joyce notices Emma being hassled, but pays no
attention: her girls can take care of themselves.

MOTHER JOYCE
(to Amsterdam and Johnny)
And if someone else comes along, do I pay them too?

AMSTERDAM
You only pay us. We see you safe from everyone.

Johnny has been watching the drunk bothering Emma Loss. Without saying
anything to Amsterdam or Mother Joyce, Johnny LEAVES the bar, walks over
to the drunk and SHOVES him away.

JOHNNY
Leave off her. She don't want you. Not even if you could pay her.

EMMA LOSS
Hey, just a minute.

JOHNNY
(to Emma)
He can't pay. I can pay.

AMSTERDAM
(watching this)
Maybe I should offer Johnny as a bouncer for your busy nights.

MOTHER JOYCE
(laughs)
A bouncer! I don't know if he could bounce on a feather bed. He wants to
be a character like you, is that it?

AMSTERDAM
He's got his own ideas. Too full of Tammany, maybe, but he's a fast friend.

Across the room, Johnny is talking to Emma Loss. She NODS and starts to
LEAD him upstairs.

MOTHER JOYCE
But in my trade you go on your instincts. My instincts says to heed you,
and my memory of your father says I'm right. We'll shake on it.
(Amsterdam grabs her hand)
And have one of my best to seal the bargain. Megs!

A lanky blonde, seated across the room near Jenny, bestirs herself.

MOTHER JOYCE
Come here and show my new friend why we're worth special care.

Jenny watches MEGS move toward Amsterdam.

CUT TO

79 INT. ASSIGNATION ROOM/MOTHER JOYCE'S

Big enough to contain a half-gutted mattress supported by a rickety bed,
some worn sheets and a few GUTTERING CANDLES.

Johnny undresses as Emma sits on the bed and starts to take off her dress.

JOHNNY
You liked that old man? You would have gone with him?

EMMA LOSS
I like anyone that pays, that's all.

JOHNNY
Tell me what he wanted you to do.

EMMA LOSS
He mostly wanted comforting.

JOHNNY
I never seen hair so black. Can you take the pins out?

EMMA LOSS
It takes so long to do back up.

He sits beside her and starts slowly, almost tenderly, to remove the pins.

79 CONTINUED:

JOHNNY
Did your mother have the same color?

I don't know.

JOHNNY
(as the hair cascades over her bare shoulders)
Lie back, I want to look at you.
(his eyes glide along her body)
What's that mark?

EMMA LOSS
I always had it.

JOHNNY
(touching her lightly)
And there? Is that a scar?

EMMA LOSS
(she looks at her naked belly)
There was a baby. They cut it out.

JOHNNY
And that on your shoulder? That looks old.

EMMA LOSS
Yeah, I got that when I ...

JOHNNY
(interrupting, quiet)
I don't want to know when. Don't tell me about before or what you used to
be, I don't want that.

EMMA LOSS
What about your scars. Do you have scars?

JOHNNY
None I ever seen. Maybe you can find them.

Her hands and mouth cover his body. He closes his eyes.

CUT TO

80 INT. ASSIGNATION ROOM/MOTHER JOYCEIS

Another room. Amsterdam and Megs are undressing each other when Jenny
walks in.

AMSTERDAM
Go on. I can see you later.
Megs leaves, brushing past Jenny.

JENNY
What are you doing?

AMSTERDAM
I couldn't decline what Mother Joyce offered. It's in the interests of
business. You understand business.

JENNY
Sure I do. But there's something else I still don't understand. At
Sparrow's Pagoda, did you hit me, knowing it was me?

AMSTERDAM
Yeah. I did.

She HITS him. In the face. Hard. Not a slap. A solid PUNCH. His nose
starts to gush blood. He puts his arm under it to staunch the flow,
keeping his eyes an her.

JENNY
Meantime's over.

AMSTERDAM
Oh fine. That's fine. I'd be celebrating but I'm losing too much blood.

Jenny tears part of the sleeve from her blouse and puts it against his
nose.

JENNY
Put your head back.

AMSTERDAM
That don't work.

JENNY
Put your head back I said.

AMSTERDAM
(as she tends to him)
So why so sudden, then?

JENNY
Sudden? Every day I see you and you complain I can't decide. Now I decide,
you say it's sudden.

AMSTERDAM
It's the whore did it, then.

JENNY
Don't flatter yourself.

AMSTERDAM
It's because you're jealous.

JENNY
It's because you didn't lie about hitting me.

AMSTERDAM
Christ, I wish I had. Come here, then.

He reaches to pull her down on the bed.

JENNY
Not here. There's too much past.

CUT TO

81 INT. ROOM/DEAD RABBIT HOUSE

The room where Johnny fetched Amsterdam out for the fight. Amsterdam and
Jenny have just made love.

JENNY
It must be morning.

AMSTERDAM
I don't care, I'm not getting up.

JENNY
This is what you meant, then? It's going to be just the same from now on?

AMSTERDAM
What?

JENNY
Every morning I wake up next to you.

AMSTERDAM
Or you don't wake up at all.

JENNY
We only just started in and you're already threatening me.

AMSTERDAM
It's not a threat.
(no teasing now)
It's a declaration of love.

JENNY
I prefer my kind. This kind.

She reaches beneath the pillow and pulls out a fine DIAMOND RING, which
she slips on his finger. Amsterdam reacts with surprise, gratitude and (of
course) suspicion.

AMSTERDAM
What's this? Where'd you get this?

JENNY
You said I was the best thief in the Five Points. But I got
restless. Will you wear something I got?

CUT TO

82 EXT- UPTOWN STREET DAY

A long street of tree-shaded houses. Spacious lawns. North of the Five
Points. Considerably north. This is the first time we have been outside
the Five Points and Paradise Square. The city
rent place.

Jenny and Amsterdam stand near a residence at the end of the street.
Amsterdam, dressed in a suit, can't quite conceal his wonder as he stands
staring at the house.

AMSTERDAM
What is this place?

JENNY
My jeweler's.

She GESTURES for him to follow her and we see now that she is dressed in a
maid's outfit.

JENNY
Come on.

AMSTERDAM
I don't see nobody.

JENNY
That's the best time. They're all having lunch.

CUT TO

83 EXT. UPTOWN HOUSE DAY

At the back door of the grand house, as Jenny OPENS it slowly and glances
inside.

AMSTERDAM
You're off your head.

JENNY
(pleased, showing off)
You can wait on me a minute. Or I'll see you back in the Points if you're
scared.
(Amsterdam looks at her)
Don't worry. I know every house on this street. They all leave their doors
open. They live like they're not in New York.

She GOES IN the house. Amsterdam WATCHES through the window, sees her
going up stairs. Then he looks at the dining room, visible distantly
through an open kitchen door.

He WATCHES, fascinated, fragments of the everyday rituals of a world he's
never seen. As SOUNDS drift listlessly from the street beyond, and a light
BREEZE blows, WE SEE IN A SERIES OF DISSOLVES the serving of a meal;
SERVANTS carrying and passing plates; FAMILY MEMBERS reaching for dishes
and passing them; the LOW KURMUR of Konversation in accents he has never
heard. It's not so much that these people and their life are foreign to
him. It is as if he has stepped into another Dimension.

He loses his sense of time, and of danger. So that when Jenny TOUCHES his
arm she surprises him thoroughly.

JENNY
Come on. I might still be taken for a maid. But you're nobody's notion of
a butler.

84 EXT. UPTOWN STREET DAY

As Jenny and Amsterdam walk away from the house. She holds his arm. They
look young and full of hope, like a servant couple just over from the old
country enjoying a day off.

JENNY
The Police Commissioner lives the next street over. I was thinking of
visiting him next month, but cops don't buy goods. They keep all their
graft in cash.

Amsterdam looks at the houses with wonder that he tries to make casual.
She opens her satchel a little way, then NUDGES him to have a lock at the
swag inside.

JENNY
How's that for ten minutes?

AMSTERDAM
It's a lot to fence.

JENNY
I'm not going to fence it. I'm going to keep it and take it where no one
will recognize it.

AMSTERDAM
Where would that be?

JENNY
Somewhere west. Far west. Past the Mississippi River, somewhere into that
territory.

AMSTERDAM
That's a hard journey for a woman alone.

JENNY
You'd be with me.

AMSTERDAM
You got it all planned and straight, is that it?

JENNY
Once I said I'd be with you I wanted someplace we could be together.
Someplace better than here. What's the matter with that?

AMSTERDAM
Nothing. Except there's no place but here for me right now. I got to
settle things.

JENNY
Yeah, I know, but I'm talking about settling down, not settling debts.

AMSTERDAM
You don't have my obligations.

CUT TO

85 EXT. PARADISE SQUARE DAY

The Dead Rabbits SWEEP across the bustling square, Johnny and Amsterdam in
the lead.

JOHNNY
It's a fair day's wage. We just move the people out of the building, and
collect.

AMSTERDAM
Who from?

JOHNNY
Who owns the building.
(points)
Them.

The gang approaches a tumbledown BUILDING called Jacob's Ladder because of
the iron rungs that run straight up its front to the roof. Two
well-dressed GENTS stare at the building fretfully.

GENT 1
(to Johnny)
I'm glad you came in force. There's half a hundred people still in there.

GENT 2
Maybe more.

GENT 1
And not one's given rent the whole year.

AMSTERDAM
You live here?

GENT 1
No, no, of course not.

AMSTERDAM
I mean in the city. A ways north, I'll bet.

GENT 2
Yes. Why?

A RIFLE SHOT sounds from an upper window and a Rabbit falls wounded. They
all DUCK FOR COVER.

JOHNNY
It's not just citizens in there?

GENT 1
Of course it is.

JOHNNY
with arms?

GENT 2
From their damned gang. Some of them live there.

AMSTERDAM
Some of who?

GENT 2

The Native Americans.

JOHNNY
We didn't contract for that.

GENT 1
We'll pay extra for the danger.

AMSTERDAM
No danger. But you will pay extra.
(turns; to gang)
Let's go and greet some Natives.

Under SCATTERED RIFLE FIRE and a barrage of ROCKS, the GANG STORMS the
building, charging inside and starting up the ladder as if they were
attacking a medieval fortress. ARMS reach out from windows to try and pull
them off. The Rabbits respond with knives and PISTOL SHOTS. As they charge
inside, the CAMERA RISES to an OVERHEAD shot and we ...

DISSOLVE TO

86 EXT. PARADISE SQUARE DAY

Later. The same OVERHEAD ANGLE. BODIES litter the street everywhere. Some
dead and wounded Rabbits lie near NATIVES who have gone to their reward.
Some BUILDING RESIDENTS wander the street in a daze. JOHNNY is collecting
money from the Two Gents, who look very pleased as Amsterdam approaches
with Jenny. He's carrying a rifle he took from the building.

AMSTERDAM
(to Gents)
Alright, then?

GENT 2
Very much alright. Quite a spectacle.

AMSTERDAM
Oh really? Just the entertainment you favor, is it? Pardon me for a
moment, gents.
(he turns to Jenny)
You wanted to settle, you and me. That's so, isn't it? You did agree, did
you not.

JENNY
I did, yes.

AMSTERDAM
Good, because I didn't want to act hasty. I can never tell for sure what
you're thinking, and sometimes I'm not always sure what you're saying...

GENT 2
(interrupting)
Excuse me, we have to finish and...

AMSTERDAM
(to Gent 2)
Excuse me. We'll conclude in a moment.
(back to Jenny)
Where do you settle?

JENNY
Amsterdam, what are you saying?

AMSTERDAM
I'm asking, where does anyone settle?

JENNY
I don't know, you mean a place, a home?

AMSTERDAM
A home yes.

GENT 1
Excuse me, but we really must conclude.

AMSTERDAM
(ignoring him)
Well, I'm saying to you then, Jenny Everdeane, welcome home.

No one sees it coming. Amsterdam FLASHES around, swinging the BUTT of his
rifle into Gent l's midsection, doubling him over and sending him
breathless to the ground. Amsterdam SPINS again and swings the butt into
Gent 2's face, knocking him cold.

AMSTERDAM
Fine place. Room enough for all.
(to Johnny)
Get them out of here.

GENT 2
They'll come back looking for you.

AMSTERDAM
With whose help? The Natives? They won't help these flourishing bastards
even for ned.
(to Jenny)
Tell any who wants they can stay. If they can't pay rent they can join the
gang. But make sure the best rooms go to us. Look around ...

JENNY
(interrupting)
I know this building.

CUT TO

87 INT. UNDERGROUND/JACOB'S LADDER

As Jenny leads Amsterdam through a narrow tunnel. The place is like a
weird catacomb: it is narrow and dank, filled with bones of dead animals,
of the two- and four-legged variety.
 
JENNY
These lead all under the Square, into the Brewery and out again from
there. They're closed off and forgotten since the Reverend opened the
mission. Pass me the candle.

Amsterdam hands Jenny a stump of candle, which she holds high enough to
see...

... that the tunnel has opened onto a small room just above the foundation
of Jacob's Ladder. It's a graveyard, memorializing gang members gone to a
better world--or worse. Trophies from many gangs--including the bones and
skulls of some Dead Rabbits-litter the place in loose ritual fashion, as
if this were a catacomb in Palermo.

Stooping low, Jenny walks to a narrow corner of the room, where several
PAVING STONES have been laid in the rough pattern of a cross. A slab of
slate serves as a headstone, and on it, in fading paint, barely legible,
is the name "Maggie Everdeane."

JENNY
We lived in this building till she lost her seamstress work and we went to
the Brewery. One day she slept so drunk she never woke and I brought her
back here. Dug this myself.
(beat)
Families. Give here what I gave you.

Amsterdam hands her a chest that looks like a small version of
Blackbeard's treasure box. She opens it and holds the candle close: inside
is the swag from all her cat burglaries. There's a lot of it, GLITTERING
with promise in the GUTTERING flame. Jenny starts to dig in her mother's
grave.

JENNY
She'll keep an eye on this for us. How about some help?

He KNEELS beside her and they dig at the grave with stones and bones.

AMSTERDAM
You trusting me with your treasure, then?

JENNY
Just take another look at it to remind you. I can always do fine on my own.

Amsterdam reaches inside the chest, pulls out a ring and SLIPS it onto
Jenny's dirt-covered finger. She KISSES him.

JENNY
What's mine is yours, is that it?

AMSTERDAM
I could use this, too.

From the bag he holds up a small GOLD CROSS.

JENNY
You making an offering to the Reverend Raleigh?

Amsterdam slips the cross into his pocket without answering and starts to
dig again.

AMSTERDAM
Are you sure we can trust your mother?

CUT TO

88 INT. HALLWAY/TAMMANY

BOSS TWEED listens to an angry BILL THE BUTCHER as they walk briskly down
a long marble corridor lined with formal portraits of former Tammany
worthies.

BOSS TWEED
The building and how many?

BILL THE BUTCHER
A dozen at least of my Natives.

BOSS TWEED
The Dead Rabbits are a wooly bunch alright.

BILL THE BUTCHER
I want at them. All of them, and Amsterdam especial. Now.

BOSS TWEED
Not just now. It's between too late and too soon. They've become a little
too prominent for comfort, but they're still too small for you to soil
your hands. The man who killed Monk Eastman pushing around a mob of
upstarts. It's practically undignified.

BILL THE BUTCHER
To hell with any of that.

Tweed stops under a grand new PORTRAIT of himself.

BOSS TWEED
Very well, and to hell as well with any plans you and I may have for
growth and change and even greater reward. You'll never advance anywhere
beyond the limited perimeter of your imagination.

BILL THE BUTCHER
I don't got to advance anywhere further.

BOSS TWEED
Got to, no. But ought to.

He hands him a fancy embossed envelope.

BILL THE BUTCHER
What's this?

BOSS TWEED
(eyes merry)
An invitation. To dinner.

CUT TO

89 INT. JENNY AND AMSTERDAM'S ROOM/JACOB'S LADDER DAY

Better by a little than their place in the old hideout. There's even a
window that throws some LIGHT an the few bits of castoff furniture in the
room... an the bed where Jenny sleeps with her face turned to the dawn
light... and an Amsterdam, who is dressing quietly in the corner. He
checks in his coat Pocket,...finds the gold cross ... and leaves. Jenny
does nat stir.

CUT TO

90 EXT. GRAVEYARD DAY

START CLOSE on: Amsterdam's hand, as he places the gold cross in a small
hole at a grave site, then covers it over with dirt.

Then WE SEE: Amsterdam is kneeling at his father's grave.

AMSTERDAM
He never had his own cross. Thanks.

Now he STANDS and TURNS. Jenny is half-hidden behind an elm tree.

AMSTERDAM
Your touch is light, but as a tracker you work awful heavy. Come ahead.
Now that I met your mother, you should come and meet my father.

As Jenny starts to WALK towards the grave, we see for the first time ...

... that we are in the country, a graveyard in an open field with an
astonishing PANORAMA of New York and the East River. (MATTE) The cemetery
is atop a hill, and the East River, busy with ferries and vessels of
trade, glistens in the near distance. Just beyond it is Manhattan Island:
low buildings, winding narrow streets, houses surrounded by open land. A
BREEZE off the river rustles Jenny's dress and blows her hair as she steps
up to the grave site, looks at the headstone and sees ...

... it is blank. No name, no date. Clean stane.

JENNY
You should finish the stone.

AMSTERDAM
It'll be finished when everything's finished. That's when helll rest. The
hand that killed him is the hand that will bury him in peace.

He holds up his open hand, covered in dirt.

JENNY
It was Bill killed him, not you.

AMSTERDAM
With my hand on the knife.

JENNY
And his hand on yours!

AMSTERDAM
And me feeling the life go out of my father! He looked at me ... he looked
at me and he swore me with his eyes. I could feel his spirit... I say I
could feel it rising... flowing through the knife like blood into my own
heart.

JENNY
You talk like he lives in you.

AMSTERDAM
I don't want him to live, I want him dead! I kill Bill and I'm free of
them both!

JENNY
You think you can be free that easy? You need your way so clear, and
you''' use anything to clear it. Anyone, too. Me, everybody, we're all
just a way for you to settle your damned ghosts.

AMSTERDAM
You're part of me now, like the gang is part of me and my father both. If
I can bring us to glory, then my father... like The Book says...my father
can enter his house justified.

As Amsterdam continues to talk we ...

DISSOLVE TO

91 MONTAGE

The growth of the Dead Rabbits, as we continue to HEAR Amsterdam speak
passionately to Jenny. We first see the Rabbits surrounding and
OVERTURNING a fire wagon; this starts as a live action scene but soon
BLEEDS into SEPIA, then freezes like an old magazine illustration.

AMSTERDAM (V.O.)
All of us is set on the same road together. The gang can have everything
they ever wanted and get me what I want while they're doing it. We're not
interfering with each other, we're helping each other. It's all the same,
we're all one together.

We CONTINUE with sepia illustrations: of Dead Rabbit morts picking pockets
and purses along a crowded Broadway; climbing onto a wagon distributing
newspapers and tossing off the occupants, taking over the route
themselves; swarming all over a merchant ship in the harbor as the captain
doles out protection money to have his cargo unloaded.

AMSTERDAM (V.O.)
We'll all have a share of the profit like we'll all have a portion of the
fame. If we come to be notorious, that only means we're strong, and if
we're strong that means we're ready.

A sepia illustration of a fire wagon rounding a corner, refurbished and
manned by Rabbits, all wearing striking uniforms with short capes called
TAMLAS. (N.B.: they will be seen wearing the tanlas from these uniforms
during all gang activity throuqhout the rest of the film. Only Johnny,
Amsterdam and Jenny do not wear them.)

The sepia illustration turns to live action as the fire wagon TEARS around
Paradise Square, SCATTERING everyone in its path, the Dead Rabbits
laughing, their tamlas FLYING behind them.

AMSTERDAM (V.O.)
And I'll know that time, know it right off when it comes. Just like I knew
you.

The live action DISSOLVES TO...

... the last image in the montage: an ILLUSTRATION of Amsterdam, a
half-decade older, turned out in fancy clothes, but with all his
fierceness intact. This is a magazine illustration, and there is a dated
headline over his picture: "Fresh Scourge of the Five Points." The date
reads "June, 1863.11

AMSTERDA.M (V.O.)
And just like that, there'll be no way of stopping till it's ended.

From this illustration, we quickly...

DISSOLVE TO

92 EXT. RIVER DAY

... Amsterdam, as he is in the picture, but in live action, SPRINGING to

his feet and YELLING at a couple of PRIZEFIGHTERS doing battle in a ring.

AMSTERDAM
Now! Finish him now!

Far up the sparkling Hudson, a RAFT floats slowly upstream. It's a huge
thing (perhaps half a city block in size) crowded with SPORTSMEN. They
form a LARGE RING around two mammoth PRIZEFIGHTERS who are brawling with
bare knuckles. Amsterdam and Johnny are among the spectators.

JOHNNY
Our man will take him in another five. What puts you in such a hurry?

FIGHTER 1 fetches FIGHTER 2 a powerful roundhouse punch that sends him
CRASHING to the deck. As soon as he hits the floor, a CARD GIRL appears
carrying a sign announcing "Round 37.11 SECONDS drag the stupefied Fighter
2 to his corner, while two BOYS minister to Fighter 1, SUCKING THE BLOOD
off his knuckles.

A GONG sounds to announce the appearance, in the center of the ring, of
the fight promoter, a florid and fulsome P.T. Barnum .

BARNUM
I want to extend thanks and admiration not only to our two combatants
today, but to their sponsors, the Dead Rabbits ...
(indicates one side of the ring)
... and the Native Americans.

He FLINGS an expansive arm toward the opposite side of the ring, where
Bill the Butcher sits with Daniel Killoran and a large group of Natives.
Amsterdam and the Butcher eye each other with all the old animosity: it's
almost ceremonial now, part of the Tradition.

BARNUM
Their generous support allows me to bring you this splendid exhibition.
With their indulgence I'd like to remind you also of the further wonders
that await you at my new Museum, located on Broadway...

There are BOOS from the crowd at such untoward commercialism.

BARNUM
... P.T Barnum's gallery of wonders from worlds natural and unnatural,
from nature and from myth!
(continued boos)
And to encourage you also in the view that new Albany ordinances
forbidding sportive violence on land shouldn't dampen your enthusiasm for
wagering. Bets down, entlegen, and you gents..
(indicated fighters)
... fists up!

The Fighters come to center ring, circle each other, then start slugging.
A flurry of punches, and Fighter 2 GOES DOWN again. As he hits the deck,
the round automatically ends and the between-rounds ritual takes place
again.

JOHNNY
Dobbs will take him this round. That'll be something. The Natives has
never lost before.

AMSTERDAM
Because there's never been a Dead Rabbit fighting before.

JOHNNY
That'll shame them thorough.

AMSTERDAM
There'll be worse than shaming. We only got the Natives in range.

It's time to squeeze the trigger, John.

The next round begins and the Fighters set to, MAULING each other
furiously.

JOHNNY
Don't push the Natives too far, Amsterdam. Otherwise it'll be Tammany
pushing back.

AMSTERDAM
That don't matter any more.

JOHNNY
It does matter, and it's going to matter even more. Tammany's the heart
and future of this city. If the Rabbits is going to keep growing, we're
going to have to throw in with Tammany some way.

The action in the ring is FURIOUS. The Crowd cheers. Fighter 1 seems about
to go down, but recovers and starts returning punishment to Fighter 2.

JOHNNY
They got that Conscription Act from Washington keeping them busy, but they
won't leave us alone forever. And the Natives is strong as they ever been!

In the ring, Fighter 1 drives Fighter 2 to the deck again, and this time
KNOCKS HIM COLD.

AMSTERDAM
(indicates Fighter 1)
You call that strong, John?

In the ring, a couple of agitated NATIVE AMERICANS are trying to get at
the Rabbit-sponsored winner. RABBITS start to RUSH the ring but Amsterdam
WAVES them back.

AMSTERDAM
(to Johnny)
This is our time now!

BARNUM
(trying to make official announcement)
The winner... gentlemen, please! ... the winner in the 39th round is the
Dead Rabbits champion, High Water Dobbs ... please, gentlemen!

The unofficial ring COMBAT continues, knocking Barnum about, as the new
champ throws marauding Natives around like empty flower sacks. Amsterdam
iumps into the fray, PUSHES some Natives away. They start for him but the
champ stands them off while Amsterdam WHISPERS to Barnum.

BARNUM
Just a moment, please, gentlemen! There's a word for us all. Amsterdam
promises ...
(Amsterdam whispers to him briefly)

... something large, something grand, something epic. The greatest these
are my own words, of course the greatest righting of the gravest wrong
ever done in the Five Points.

The crowd quiets, their sporting blood still up, curiosity engaged. Only
Johnny seems glum, concerned.

This is to be a duel not for money, but for honor! A fight to the death...

AMSTERDAM
(interrupting, emphasizing)
To the death. If he can stand up to it.

BARNUM
... on which money, I hasten to add, may certainly be wagered. The names
of the two champions are Amsterdam Vallon, here beside me, and ... and Mr.
William Poole, known to all as ...

BILL THE BUTCHER
(leaping up)
They know me by any name, you son of a bitch!

The crowd ERUPTS: this is a death match between Olympians. Only Johnny
does not rejoice. He looks at Amsterdam's face, flush with the belief that
the right moment has finally come, and he has to turn away. He walks away
from the ring as Killoran tries unsuccessfully to PULL the Butcher down
and cool him off.

BILL THE BUTCHER
(yelling)
I'll have him stretched on a spit!

Killoran is beside him now, whispering urgently. Bill the Butcher shakes
his head vehemently.

BILL THE BUTCHER
(to Killoran)
You got no more to say about this now.

92 CONTINUED:

AMSTERDAM
Come on, Bill! Let go of your Tammany wet nurse! My challenge, your terms.

KILLORAN
(to Bill)
Don't do it, you can't do it! There's the Conscription to deal with, and
elections coming, too. That's your calling now, not these ancient quarrels.

BILL THE BUTCHER
I'll do my work. But this is a shame, a public shame. It demands my
attention.
(yelling to Amsterdam)
Fine, then! Fine and welcome! Day after elections, we'll meet with seconds
on neutral ground to work out time and terms. It will be done and done.

He walks to the ring, holds his HAND out to Amsterdam.

BILL THE BUTCHER
You know this hand. Last time it was this close, it was on your throat.

AMSTERDAM
I remember it better from another time.

He takes the Butcher's hand. The duel is on.

CUT TO

93 INT./EXT. DRAFT REGISTRATION OFFICE

START CLOSE ON: money being counted out: $300. And a RECEIPT quickly
written and given. We think at first this must be a bet being made on the
duel between Amsterdam and Bill the Butcher-

But we go WIDER to reveal: an office, tables and chairs, and a line. Two
lines, in fact. One, very long, filled with young man. And the second,
very short, in which a CLERK is handing the receipt to a PROSPEROUS YOUNG
MAN.

CLERK
Your release from service, according to the terms of the Conscription Act.
Keep it somewhere safe.

PROSPEROUS YOUNG MAN
I'll keep it with me.

There is only one OTHER PERSON standen behind the Prosperous Young Man,
and he steps up quickly and hands $300 to the Clerk as the Prosperous
Young Man heads for the door...

... past the second line, which snakes out into the street, filled with
draftees who SHOUT at the Prosperous Young Man as he leaves.

DRAFTEE 1
Hey, tell your Papa to pass me three hundred dollars too.

DRAFTEE 2
Tell him if he don't we'll come get you on our way to Gettysburg.

The Prosperous Young Man HURRIES away, but spots Boss Tweed and Daniel
Killoran as he leaves.

PROSPEROUS YOUNG MAN
Oh, Mr. Tweed, I'd take the time to say proper thanks but...

BOSS TWEED
No thanks owed, son. Conscription's Federal Law, and so's the $300
exemption. You might remind your father, though, that you saw me here
today, minding that the law's strictly and equitably enforced.

The Prosperous Young Man hurries out, as the Draftees continue to holler
abuse. Boss Tweed HEADS for them, followed by Killoran.

KILLORAN
You see how much they like this damned law? Enforcing it's going to hurt
us in elections.

BOSS TWEED
It's not my law, and not my liking, either. But Washington's always
treated us with sufferance, and we must extend the same regard to them.
(to Draftees)
Boys, we are bound by honor and love of country to fight in this time of
crisis!

DRAFTEE 4
We're bound by our wallets and the emptiness in them, that's what!

BOSS TWEED
Boys, the union is in distress, our land is wounded deeply, our future is
suddenly a frail and finite thing. We must ask ourselves how...

DRAFTEE 5
Yeah, you could talk a dog off a meat wagen, Tweed. But let's see you
fight!

DRAFTEE 6
That'd be worth twice three hundred dollars to see!

BOSS TWEED
(as he backs off)
Thank you, boys, thank you for your understanding.
(to Killoran)
Holy Mother.

Tweed hustles Killoran outside, where the line of Potential draftees
snakes down the block and into Paradise Square.

BOSS TWEED
Daniel, between the blindness of Washington and the damned brass of Bill
Poole Tammany will fall like an autumn leaf. We must take what measures we
can. Attend to the Butcher. After the elections, of course. Unless you
think Amsterdam will do our work for us first.

KILLORAN
He could at that. Then he would become a fresh concern

BOSS TWEED
Not so daunting as this.
(turns to the Draftees in the street)
Boys, I've just had a word with your compatriots inside, and if you show
half the sand and a fraction of the spirit they have manifeste for joining
this great struggle...

There is a chorus of BOOS and JEEPS from the Draftees outside.

OUTSIDE DRAFTEE
Put a rope around it, Tweed, and swing in your own wind!

BOSS TWEED
Great weeping Jesus, Daniel, whatever happened to the halcyon days?

CUT TO

94 EXT. POLLING PLACE/PARADISE SQUARE DAY

Election Day pandemonium. The Dead Rabbits aren't working the repeaters
this day, but Johnny observes the action as Native Americans--identifiable
because of their long dusters--strongarm REPEATERS into the polls.

His attention is drawn to a HARRIED TELEGRAPH OPERATOR, who is being
SHOUTED at by Natives as he is inundated by pieces of paper and teetering
volumes of the voting registry. It's chaos. The poor Operator can't cope.

CUT TO

95 INT. TAMMANY HALL

It's chaos here, too. The large main room is filled with TELEGRAPH
OPERATORS receiving election returns. There is SHOUTING and CONCERN
throughout the room. Even Boss Tweed shows signs of worry.

BOSS TWEED
I swear that science will be the death of industry.

KILLORKN
The telegraph moves the voter tabulation by wire faster than we can get
the repeaters in and out.

BOSS TWEED
(losing patience)
Your role is to expedite, Daniel, not to explain.
(Killoran looks at him blankly)
Do something!

JOHNNY
If you'll allow me.

They both TURN to see Johnny standing coolly before them.

JOHNNY
There's a scheme we might try.

KILLORAN
You got no place among us, get the hell out of here however you come in.

BOSS TWEED
A moment please, Daniel. One moment.
(to Johnny)
You're a Dead Rabbit, aren't you? Friend to Amsterdam?
(Johnny nods)
And therefore no particular friend to us. What brings you here?

JOHNNY
Opportunity. Science and opportunity.

KILLORAN
You got opportunities enough among your own.

JOHNNY
I did have. But times change faster than people. Some people, anyhow. And
I like to stay with the advantage.

BOSS TWEED
Well, then, a Gentleman of foresight! Are you suggesting... or perhaps
you're even saying... that your friend and your gang may be ... well,
lagging behind the great march of history?

JOHNNY
Something like that, yeah.

BOSS TWEED
Well fine, step up to history then and tell us what you have in mind.

CUT TO

96 EXT. POLLING PLACE/PARADISE SQUARE DAY

START CLOSE ON: telegraph wire, HUMMING with the election returns. And,
below it--far below--Johnny, Killoran and a couple of TAMMANY BOYOS,
looking up at the wire.

BOYO 1
I ain't goin' up there. I got my election suit on.

JOHNNY
This election'll be over unless we get up there.

KILLORAN
"We?" This was your notion, you go up there.

BOYO 2
(looking at polling place)
Him. He looks likely, and he ain't workin'.

He points over at Sheeny Mike Kurtz, who is observing the action at the
polls.

JOHNNY
(calls to him)
Sheeny Mike, you want to make ...
(to Boyo 1)
...how much?

BOYO 1
A dollar.

JOHNNY
(to Sheeny Mike)
Five dollars? Just to help us?

SHEENY MIKE
(a bit wary)
What's the pitch, Johnny? Amsterdam wouldn't like it, working with Tammany.

BOYO 2
Well, now, if Amsterdam wouldn't like it ...

JOHNNY
(interrupting)
He knows about it. Welre working a whole new scheme. But I won't tell him
youlre helping, if that's the way you want it. And you can keep the full
five. Just start climbing.

SHEENY MIKE
(beat)
Where's the ned?

Boyo 2 hands Sheeny Mike five bucks, which he pockets as Boyo 1 gives him
a large pair of SHEARS. Mike wipes his palms on his pants and STARTS UP
the pole.

For Killoran and the Tammany Boyos, this is like a circus stunt. They
watch Mike's ascent with pleasure.

Sheeny Mike is quite pleased with himself as he nears the top of the pole.
He turns to look at Johnny and the Tammany group below. A couple of
SPECTATORS have stopped to watch as well.

Mike gets to the top of the pole, REACHES OUT--STRETCHES OUT-toward the
telegraph wire with the shears...

... strains... reaches ... MAKES THE CUT.

On the ground, Johnny looks relieved. The Boyos offer a partmocking round
of applause.

In the spirit of things, Sheeny Mike TURNS to acknowledge the applause.
Just briefly. But long enough so he's distracted. He sees the upturned
FACES fill suddenly with fear, and he TURNS when he HEA.RS a sharp, odd
WHISTLING NOISE.

A LIVE TELEGRAPH WIRE is coming at him. He doesn't even have time to
scream. The wire hits him, whipping around him as JOLTS OF NT leap through
his body and he FALLS to the ground.

CUT TO

97 EXT. PARADISE SQUA.RE DAY

HANDS pick up the lifeless body of Sheeny Mike and start to carry it
off... past Amsterdam and Jenny, who stand on one side of it, watching...
and Johnny, who is on the other.

JOHNNY
He was working a Tammany job, Tammany will see to him.

AMSTERDAM
He wasn't Tammany. Not like you.

JOHNNY
He made the right choice.

AMSTERDAM
You don't know what you're saying! You killed one of our own. One of your
family!

JOHNNY
(slowly)
I didn't know he was going to die, Amsterdam. And don't tell me what's my
own and what isn't. You're not my family. And I swear, I swear on the
Virgin Mother's eyes ... I know what I'm doing, Amsterdam. It's you that's
always been blind.
(they look at each other)
I'll say my farewells.

Johnny KNEELS down beside Mike's body, brushes the hair from his brow.

JOHNNY
You still smell like drink.

He nods to the Rabbits to carry the body on and, as he RISES a half-dozen
NEWSBOYS DASH into the square, carrying fresh copies of the Tribune and
crying...

NEWSBOYS
New Tammany victory! Fernando Wood elected to third term! Tammany ticket
prevails by narrow margin! Boss Tweed vows
Armageddon for crime!

JOHNNY
(looking at Amsterdam and Jenny)
Can't you hear the future?

He walks away from the gang, through the rushing Newspaper Boys.

CUT TO

98 INT. SPARROW'S CHINESE PAGODA

The place has been cleared out for a war council: Amsterdam with a couple
of Dead Rabbits, and Bill the Butcher with a few Natives. They sit at a
round poker table with a green felt top.

JIMMY SPOILS
We say the Square is the place. Let Barnum sell the tickets for a share of
the price...

NATIVE SECOND
(interrupting)
A small share.

JIMMY SPOILS
And the Rabbits and Natives will split the majority portion equal.

NATIVE SECOND
Who works the crowd?

AMSTERDAM
Nobody. This is a day of honor. No pickpockets, no lush-rollers, nothing.

BILL THE BUTCHER
I'll cut their hands off. After the fight.

NATIVE SECOND
We got to fix positions for everyone so there won't be no other fighting.
I know for fact the Roach Guards has sworn blood against the Black Birds,
and the Forty Thieves don't tolerate the Chichesters.

As these delicate negotiations continue, the only two outsiders in the
place, Mother Joyce and a Bartender, are listening intently on the far
side of the room.

BARTENDER
Amsterdam will make the Butcher a fine banquet.

MOTHER JOYCE
My ned's on the boy. He's got the youth, and he's got the hunger.

BARTENDER
Is he so hungry you'll put up a hundred?

MOTHER JOYCE
Two.

CUT TO

99 EXT. PARADISE SQUARE DAY

OFFICIALS stand on a high wooden platform facing a JEERING CROWD. Banners
announce a "DRAFT LOTTERY." OFFICIALS are preparing to draw the first
numbers as Boss Tweed gives out with a speech.

BOSS TWEED
Your honor... yes, and the law of the land... lies in the balance. The
Conscription Act of 1863 was handed down by President Lincoln himself ...

CROWD MEMBER
(shouting)
If Lincoln signed it, then let Lincoln fight!

CROWD MEMBER 2
It's an army of the poor fighting for a bunch of rich slackers!

CROWD MEMBER
Tammany's been our voice, let Tammany pay the exemption for all!

A YOUNG MEMBER of the crowd steps forward as Boss Tweed turns to look at
those backing him on the platform: Killoran, a CAVALRY OFFICER in fancy
dress ... and, out of sight of the crowd, Johnny Sirocco. Their
expressions are not reassuring.

YOUNG CROWD MEMBER
Your first payment, m'lords.

The Young Crowd Member hurls a STONE through the front window of a nearby
store. The CROWD cheers and runs to sack the store, and others SURGE
toward the platform. Johnny'and Killoran grab a fearful Tweed and rush him
to safety. But the Cavalry Officer stands his ground with sword and
pistol. He SHOOTS.

That STOPS them. But only for a fractured, eerie moment. Then they jump on
the Cavalry Officer, PULL him to the ground, begin to KICK and BEAT him.

CUT TO

100 EXT. STREET/JACOB'S LADDER NIGHT

A building burns at the end of the street, spreading a silhouette of smoke
and flame in the air...

... as a LION CHARGES down the street, growling, scattering RIOTERS in its
wake. It's a mad, frightening sight, like a fulfillment of the Biblical
prophecy produced by P.T Barnum, whose Museum is burning in the distance.

SCREAMS, YELLS, CURSES and GROANS. CRIES of pain and fear as RIOTERS jump
out of the way of the wild animal, then course up the street toward
Broadway burning in the distance.

From ABOVE, on the roof of Jacob's Ladder, Amsterdam and Jenny watch the
madness below.

AMSTERDAM
(watching lion)
That must be the vanguard of Barnum's army.

JENNY
This city will burn like Gomorrah.

AMSTERDAM
Then we'll take what we can before it gets too hot.

JENNY
I think it's past that already.

AMSTERDAM
It'll never come to that. These people ain't gang-led and they have no
purpose.

They'd rather die for themselves than the army, that's the purpose. What
would you do?

AMSTERDAM
Fight better and not get so mad. They're only doing what they should have
done years ago. Why'd they ever think there was another way to live?

JENNY
They believed what people told them, that's all.

AMSTERDAM
What people is that? The Reverend at the mission? Boss Tweed? Daniel
Killoran? People like Johnny Sirocco?

JENNY
You believed Johnny.

AMSTERDAM
Hell.

JENNY
And I believed you.

AMSTERDAM
I ain't done nothing different than what I told you, Jen.

JENNY
I believed what you said abaut being with me, with me alone. But you lied
to me. It's not me alone, it's just you and Bill Poole. Youlre so
blood-blind you can't see nothing else, not even this!

AMSTERDAM
I don't care a fine damn about what they want! It's what I want! They
won't dare harm the Points, that's all I care about! Let them turn the
rest of the city into hell! It's another country anyway.

JENNY
It's not a country for me, Amsterdam. I don't know about you. Will you
come with me?

AMSTERDAM
Not now.

JENNY
Now is when I'm going. Will you come?

AMSTERDAM
I don't want all this fighting to go to waste, Jen. I want to come out of
it with something. And I got to be waiting for the Butcher.

CUT TO

101 INT. UNDERGROUND/JACOB'S LADDER

Jenny digs out her treasure from her mother's grave, throws open the box,
starts to GRAB all the swag she can and hide it on her person... in her
pockets, under her clothes, anywhere. She takes as much as she can, but
she has to travel fast.

CUT TO

102 EXT. STREET NIGHT

Beginning a swift series of scenes that are like a laudanum nightmare.

The street is JAMMED with people fleeing and people fighting... as Jenny
forces her way through, trying to escape.

A small mob starts to ATTACK a house where a TERRIFIED FAMILY stands in
the doorway.

FAMILY MAN
We're with you, don't harm us!

MOB MAN
Show us your spirit and come out with us then!

MOB WOMAN
And put a candle in the window to show you're one with us! Every light is
a flame against the draft!

The WIFE begs her husband not to join the mob, but they PULL HIM out into
the street. The Mob Woman hands the Wife a candle, then runs back to join
the mob.

Jenny starts to cross Paradise Square now... tries to cross, anyway... and
passes the stand where Tweed delivered his speech that very morning. She
sees: the Cavalry officer. Several MOB WOMEN have revived him with water.
He has been beaten terribly, but as he MOANS and starts to regain
consciousness, the MOB WOMEN fall upon him with fresh fury, KICKING and
HITTING his helpless body. They BREAK his bones with rocks and TEAR OFF
the fancy braid of his uniform to hang around their necks.

Now a SECOND MOB RUSHES toward the first from the opposite side of
Paradise Square. Chaos. Jenny is buffeted wildly. It's like being in a
whirlpool. She grabs a LITTLE GIRL whose face is bruised and blaody but
whose eyes shine wildly.

JENNY
What is it?

LITTLE GIRL
Cops has everything closed to the north, and the militia's coming.

CUT TO

103 EXT. STREET/FIVE POINTS NIGHT

As Jenny presses her way through the mob-devoured streets. She sees: MEN,
WOMEN and CHILDREN attacking a small group of BLACKS.

BOY
My Daddy don't have to die for you! Why should he fight and die for you?

Jenny looks ahead, sees: the river, in the distance. And flames. She runs
forward, STUMBLES. Some of the swag FALLS to the street. She SCRAMBLES to
pick it up as Rioters rush by her.

CUT TO

104 EXT. PIERS HUDSON RIVER NIGHT

MATTE: The surface of the water looks like a mirror made of flame. The
piers are BURNING. The docks are ash.

SAILORS battle a MOB for possession of a small rowboat. As they fight, the
boat starts to DRIFT. Jenny spots it, RUNS for it

... but so does ANOTHER GIRL. Younger than Tenny--20 maybe, Jennyls age
when Amsterdam fell in love with her. They both get to the boat at the
same time. Each grips it by a gunwale, and they STARE at each other like
two jungle beasts over a kill.

JENNY
I'd kill you for this.

The Girl lunges at her with a knite, and Jenny SHOOTS. The GIRL slides
into the flame-reflecting Hudson as if she drowning in a pit of lava.

Jenny climbs into the boat and frantically starts to row. We stay CLOSE on
her ... working the oars clumsily, furiously ... moving the boat across
the water, trying to get away from the city...

... and we go WIDER now. A huge line of IRON--like the side of a
glacier... bisects the frame, then starts to move. Jenny
turns, SEES it. It is ...

... the looming hull of an ironclad war ship (MATTE). It LOBS cannon fire
into the city, setting off tremendous explosions.
Jenny TURNS back for the shore...

... as cannonballs land, devastating rioters.

CUT TO

105 EXT. SHORE/RIVER NIGHT

MATTE: Police and MILITIA push the rioters back toward the river like
rats. A cannanball EXPLODES in their midst...

... injuring many more cops and militia than rioters. The rioters rally,
RUN over the bodies of fallen cops and soldiers. Now the advantage is
theirs; cops and militia are in retreat.

Jenny climbs up on shore and joins the mob as it presses back inland.

CUT TO

106 EXT. DOYERS STREET/THE BLOODY ANGLE NIGHT

Further from the docks. Shells still exploding in the distance. Jenny
moves with the marauding mob, recognizes Doyers Street. She splits away
from the mob, moves stealthily into the street known as the Bloody Angle.
And STOPS.

Weird shadows dance on the walls of the buildings. SMOKE and EERIE LIGHT.
The angle is lined with lampposts. And from every lamppost dangles the
BODY of a black man. Or woman. Or child. Some are still smouldering.

At the base of a lamppost, a group of RIOTERS have cut open the hog-tied
CORPSE of a black man and are pouring oil into it. One of the Rioters sees
Jenny, grins and holds out the TORCH he's holding. She shakes her head and
starts to BACK out of the alley.

The Rioter touches the torch to the oil in the wound of the corpse. The
body IGNITES in flame. The RIOTERS pull on a rope and the body rises,
burning, to the top of the lamppost ...

... where its awful shadow joins all the others in the madhouse
refractions on walls all up and down the street. On the street, as the
flames dance and the bodies burn, rioters DANCE and SING. Walpurgis Night.
From these mad SHADOWS, we...

DISSOLVE TO

107 EXT. ROOF/JACOB-S LADDER NIGHT

... the face of Amsterdam, stepping out of the SHADOWS of the roof. There
are flames in the distance. The whole gang is assembled, facing him as he
speaks.

AMSTERDAM
No we ain't going to fight, but we can take something for ourselves out of
this.

JIMMY SPOILS
I want to know who hung them bodies in the Bloody Angle. I want to address
who done it.

AMSTERDAM
Five thousand people in the street done it! Boss Tweed done it! Abe
Lincoln done it! There's nothing you can do about any one of them but stay
with us. You'll have a little of your own back.

JIMMY SPOILS
How's that?

AMSTERDAM
These riots are a gift. They...

... he PAUSES just for a moment as he sees a hand on the last rung of the
outside ladder leading to the roof: it's Jenny, returning.

AMSTERDAM
... they've made everything clear, as you might say.
(to Jenny)
Are you with us, then?

JENNY
Until I can get out. I'll go with you...
(straight at Amsterdam)
...meantime.

AMSTERDAM
Good. We're going for the Armory at Canal Street.

JIMMY SPOILS
The Armory! We'll have to beat the militia to get there.

AMSTERDAM
There's a way through the lines. Jen, did you see the cops and militia?

JENNY
I can show you from here where they are. I doubt they'll get to the Armory
in force before midday tomorrow.

AMSTERDAM
We'll get there first. We'll take everything we can carry, and destroy the
rest so no one else has the use of it, the militia, the Natives, nobody.
Then we'll turn to real business. We'll go down to the Battery.

JIMMY SPOILS
Why, we going to take a sail to Europe?

AMSTERDAM
No. But we could, after this. We're going...
(slowly, savoring this)
...we're going to take the banks. The government banks.
(awed silence from all)
Are we not?

JENNY
(beat; steps forward)
Seems we are.

One by one, then in small groups, the entire gang FOLLOWS her. They are
uncertain, reluctant, even frightened at the audacity of the scheme. But
they stand with Amsterdam.

CUT TO

108 INT. MAIN ROOM/TAMMANY HALL NIGHT

The crowded main room of Boss Tweed's domain, jammed with anxious
POLITICOS and OFFICIALS, as well as a harried group of TELEGRAPH OPERATORS
who receive news of the riots from all over Manhattan. There is a huge map
of the city against one wall: the place has been converted from a
political princedom to an operational headquarters. Johnny Sirocco and
Bill The Butcher are there. Other guests include the GOVERNOR, Mayor
Fernando Wood, and a badly shaken Horace Greeley.

GREELEY
They attacked me! I had every sympathy for them at first...

BOSS TWEED
Too much sympathy, Horace. Writing these riots were a rising against
"unjust laws and unsuitable law-givers." The shame!

GOVERNOR
I suspended the draft at noon but the mobs only grew more virulent. It is
a criminal rising of the lowest class, of the Gangsters and rabble who
have been allowed by Tammany to run lawless!

BOSS TWEED
It was Tammany and the rabble that elected you, Governor. And it's Tammany
and the gangs who'll stop it. Isn't that so, Bill?

BILL THE BUTCHER
(nods at Johnny)
I won't say nothin' in front of him. Who knows what business he's here on?

BOSS TWEED
He's here on our business and my invitation. He's already been of great
help. What's the opposition strength, John?

To answer, Johnny yanks back a CURTAIN drawn across a high window. The
view, looking downtown, is one of almost continual ILLUMINATION-- every
place the eye falls, CANDLES burn in sympathy for the rioters.

JOHNNY
Each candle is against you, gents.

MAYOR
"Against you," sir? Don't you mean "us".

JOHNNY
(diplomatic)
Some of us come from those people, Mayor. I'll not deny they still claim
part of me.

MAYOR
Which part? Perhaps your heart.

BOSS TWEED
Gentlemen, I'm sorry you find it necessary to question the loyalty of my
friend here, and by extension, my own judgement. So as proof ... John,
where will the mob go? What will the gangs do?
(Johnny is uneasy about answering)
Go on, tell them what you told me.

JOHNNY
There's no telling about the mob. Or the small gangs. But the Dead Rabbits
... if I was Amsterdam...

BOSS TWEED
(interrupting)
As indeed you nearly was. Were.

JOHNNY
... if I was ... I'd figure to take the Rabbits to the Armory.

BOSS TWEED
Would you agree with that, Bill? Wouldn't you do the same? If you were
fighting against the militia instead of beside them?

BILL THE BUTCHER
Beside them? What are you talking... ?

BOSS TWEED
(interrupting)
You will have to fight beside them to take the Armory. It cannot fall into
unfriendly hands.

BILL THE BUTCHER
I can't stand with the militia against the people. I could never work the
Points no more if I did.

BOSS TWEED
We're all of us swept up in a great tide of events, Bill. Have you learned
to swim?

From Bill's face, struggling to make sense of this, knowing Tweed's right
but not wanting to believe it, we ...

DISSOLVE TO

109 INT. MAIN ROOM/TAMMANY HALL NIGHT

... Johnny's face, as Tweed talks to him. It is later, and the Butcher has
left. The activity is still frantic all around, but Tweed speaks in
unhurried tones.

BOSS TWEED
I'm sure that Bill will do his usual splendid job. But after that ...
well, I'm afraid he's grown away from us.
(Johnny looks puzzled)
He shows distressing signs of... shall we say, free-thinking. Crime
flourishes in chaos, and these riots could encourage Bill to overstep
himself. He no longer inspires in me the same trust... well, that you
might. If you can prove yourself further.

109 CONTINUED:

JOHNNY
You already said in front of everyone you trusted me.

BOSS TWEED
In vital things. Would I be talking to you now otherwise? Vital things,
but small things. Are you equal to greater responsibility and opportunity?

JOHNNY
Such as what?

BOSS TWEED
Ridding me of Bill the Butcher.
(Johnny is startled)
He may question your loyalty to me, but Bill would never believe you had
the sand to go against him. He'd never expect it. Do you have the sand?

From Johnny's face, struggling to make the right answer, we...

DISSOLVE TO

110 INT. JACOB'S LADDER

... Ansterdam's face, as he looks up from preparing a brace of pistols for
the next day's scheme.

AMSTERDAM
Let him in.

Johnny enters the common room of Jaccb's Ladder, where the Dead Rabbits
have gathered to ready themselves. As they work over their weapons and
prepare battle dress, Johnny walks through their midst. They do not
acknowledge him... except for Jenny.

JENNY
Did you miss us, John?

JOHNNY
Not a bit.

AMSTERDAM
(rising to meet him)
Are you here to spy?

JOHNNY
I don't have to spy.

Amsterdam leads Johnny off to a shadowy corner of the room where they can
talk privately.

JOHNNY
(as they walk)
I know what you're doing. I told Tweed what you're doing.

AMSTERDAM
You don't know what I'm doing.

JOHNNY
You're going after the Armory.

AMSTERDAM
Am I now? Why do you think that?

JOHNNY
'Cause that's what I would do, and you and I think alike.

AMSTERDAM
No more. And it don't seem worth a visit to tell me something you already
think I'm doing.

JOHNNY
There's something else alright. Tweed's arranged to kill Bill the Butcher.

AMSTERDAM
(disbelieving)
Who could Tweed get to do that?

JOHNNY
One of his own.

AMSTERDAM
There's no one around him...

JOHNNY
(interrupting)
Listen, it don't matter who, it's going to be done, that's all! Tweed
ain't going to wait around
for you and Bill to settle yourselves. I'm telling you so you have a
chance.

AMSTERDAM
Chance of what?

JOHNNY
A chance... a chance to do what you want. Bury the Butcher, draw what
blood you got to. But you better make speed. The Natives will move on the
Armory too.

AMSTERDAM
And what's any of it mean to you?

JOHNNY
It means whatever's left of friendship, I don't know. There's still part
of me here. I don't
want to see you lose everything in your life at once.

AMSTERDAM
I'm going to lose nothing.
(beat)
If you believe me, you can stay.

JOHNNY
I got to go.

He turns so Amsterdam can't see his face and LEAVES-

JENNY
So Tammany's going to kill the Butcher. That puts you and Tweed on the
same side. Does that make the path clear enough to suit you?

From Amsterdam's face, trying to work out all the new angles, we...

DISSOLVE TO

111 INT. NATIVE AMERICAN HIDEOUT

... Amsterdam's face, full of resolve, staring unblinking as ...

... the barrels of two dozen RIFLES SURROUND the edges the screen, boxing
Amsterdam in, as if his head were in a frame.

And Bill the Butcher gazes at him with astonishment. We are, for the first
time, in the Natives' lair, a house hung with American flags of all shapes
and vintages, some of them torn by battle, others by years of weather and
use. Some of them go back to the early days of the republic. There is not
an inch of wood or wall space to be seen for all the stars and stripes.

BILL THE BUTCHER
Murder Me? No one's going to murder me.

AMSTERDAM
Then you better learn to fight locking over your shoulder, Bill, because
that's the only way you'll ever see it coming.

BILL THE BUTCHER
I don't believe it, and I don't believe it's you telling me. You got no
reason to care about any danger to me.

AMSTERDAM
One reason. You're my kill, Butcher. No one else is going to have you, not
Tweed, not Tammany, not those pigs in the street. No one--not even you,
Bill--will ever take the pleasure of your death away from me. I'd do
anything to keep you for my own, even if I have to protect you.

BILL THE BUTCHER
You protect me? Get out of here and go to hell.

AMSTERDAM
Fine, so long as I pass you on my way.

BILL THE BUTCHER
Maybe I'd believe you more if I knew who was talking to you.

AMSTERDAM
Someone I credit.

BILL THE BUTCHER
That means nothing to me. None of this means nothing to me because I am
Tammany. Without me and my Natives they're nothing but a bunch of old
horses at a trough.

AMSTERDAM
You join with me and we fight against Tammany, fight them back and out of
the Points. Then you and me can settle. But if you don't join with me,
then there won't be no settlement because you'll be murdered in the street
and the whole Points will be mine.

BILL THE BUTCHER
I relish the thought... just the thought... of cutting you up and opening
you wide. So if just thinking about it gives me such pleasure, imagine how
I'm going to enjoy doing it.

AMSTERDAM
Why don't I make it easy for you, then.

He TURNS his back on the Butcher and starts to walk out, through the
entire gang of Natives.

AMSTERDAM
Same as you're making it easy for Tweed.

He keeps walking... through the Natives ... dozens of ancient enemies
glowering at him.

BILL THE BUTCHER
Amsterdam!
(Amsterdam looks around)
Don't be like your father. Don't make it too easy.

Amsterdam struggles to keep his temper. But he turns and keeps walking
through the enemy camp as we...

DISSOLVE TO

112 INT. JACOB'S LADDER

....Amsterdam walking. But this time, he is WALKING among his gang. All
the Dead Rabbits are assembled, weapons ready. Jenny is beside him. Then
Jimmy Spoils. Then a few others.

As the group passes, others STAND and walk with them...

... until the whole gang is rallied...

... and bound for the passageway in the corner of the room that leads
under the building.

DISSOLVE TO

113 INT. BASEMENT

As Amsterdam and the gang heads through the catacomb-like basement, past
the graves, into a tunnel. Torchlight GUTTERS all around. Their steps echo
like repeated rifle shots.

DISSOLVE TO

114 INT. TUNNEL

The whole gang MARCHES down a tunnel under the Old Brewery. Except for
Amsterdam and Jenny, they all wear their tamlas. Many have marks and gang
insignia on their faces. All of them have weapons. A lot of weapons.

Frightened FACES--people seeking shelter and safety from the riots--appear
in the darkness, then vanish like ghosts.

As the Rabbits walk, they summon memories of the first fight, that same
march through the tunnels when Amsterdam marched beside his father.
Amsterdam's face gives little away. But perhaps he is remembering that day
too.

DISSOLVE TO

115 INT. TUNNEL

The last tunnel.. Shreds of light from a door in the distance. Amsterdam
walks up to the door and--just as Monk Eastman did years before--KICKS it
down. Dim dawn LIGHT FLOODS the tunnel as the Dead Rabbits step out.

CUT TO

116 EXT. CANAL STREET DAWN

The first thing we see is an ELEPHANT, who trumpets fearfully at the
sudden sound of the sattere door. The gang stops, wary of this huge
refugee from Barnum's Museum, but the animal is more frightened of them.
It hurries on down the street...

... revealing behind it a group of several dozen RIOTERS who carry a huge
American flag and a long wooden plank bearing the legend "No Draft." They
stare at the Rabbits with something near reverence.

AMSTERDAM
Where's the Native Americans?

RIOTER
Ain't seen them. Ain't here.

AMSTERDAM
And the militia?

RIOTER
There's a detachment coming on from two streets over. The rest is still
north of here. What are you after?

Amsterdam POINTS to a formidable building a block away: the Armory. It
looks like a fortress.

RIOTER
The Devil himself couldn't take that place.

AMSTERDAM
That's why he sent us.

CUT TO

117 EXT. STREET NEAR ARMORY/ DAY

The DETACHMENT of militia proceeds warily towards the Armory. They are a
young, uncertain-looking outfit; their COMMANDER looks like an upstate
farm kid. He tenses and his eyes widen as he sees Jenny walking toward
him, carrying a BOY in her arms.

JENNY
(crying)
Help me. Oh please help me. He's shot, we need a doctor, please help.

DETACHMENT COMMANDER
Miss, we ain't a medical outfit. The main unit's ten minutes behind us,
they'll have...

He doesn't get the chance to finish. Jenny DROPS the Boy from her arms and
shoots the Detachment Commander once, cleanly...

... as the Boy roles into a prone position and FIRES two shots into the
stunned Detachment...

... while the Dead Rabbits SWARM from every doorway along the street,
FIRING GUNS and brandishing weapons.

It's over in seconds. The Detachment has hardly gotten off a shot. Every
one of them lies dead or wounded in the street...

... as the Rabbits CROUCH over their bodies.

CUT TO

118 EXT. ARMORY DAY

A rifle emplacement manned by a dozen GUARDS- They stand anxious post in
front of the Armory. Each window is barred and fortified, and the front
door is massive. But the tension in the Guards' faces eases a little when
they see ...

... the Detachment of militia heading towards them down the street. Some
of the Detachment are wearing bloody uniform jackets; several are being
carried. The Detachment, unrecognized by the Guards, is made up entirely
of Dead Rabbits.

AMSTERDAM
Help us, we got wounded!

GUARD 1
We can't leave the post.

AMSTERDAM
Open the damn doors then! We're bad hurt!

GUARD 1
Where's the others?

AMSTERDAM
Just behind us! But I got our major here wounded so bad half his guts is
out!

Guard 1 SIGNALS for the doors to be opened to the Armory as the Detachment
draws close to the emplacement.

GUARD 1
God, it's good to see you!

AMSTERDAM
Likewise.

Ainsterdam SHOOTS him where he stands as the Rabbits OVERWHELM the
emplacement.

AMSTERDAM
(shouting)
Move fast! We got to get out with everything we can before the militia
gets here!

As the Armory Guards return fire, the Boy Jenny carried in the previous
scene RUNS for the telegraph pole and starts to CLIMB. A SHOT makes the
wood fly inches from his face...

... as the Rabbits storm into the Armory, FIRING wildly.

The Boy reaches the top of the telegraph pole and CUTS the wire. He
shinnies back down the pole as the wire SWINGS ineffectually in the air
and we ...

DISSOLVE TO

INT. Y HALL/MAIN ROOM 119

..a telegram, held in Killoran's hand. He passes it to Tweed.

KILLORAN
It's from the Armory Guards. That's the last before the wire went dead.

BOSS TWEED
(reading, furious)
If the Rabbits are already at the Armory, where the hell is Bill and the
militia?

He THROWS the telegram onto the floor, where it joins a whole SEA of
yellow telegraph forms. They are shin-high; there must be thousands of
them.

KILLORAN
They got to be near.

JOHNNY
So long as they're near, it's alright. The Rabbits can take the Armory,
but they can't hold it. If Bill can get into position, he can make sure
they don't get out.

BOSS TWEED
Alright then, John, you pray to any God you choose that's the fact of it.
If Bill thinks he can best the Natives, that is your opportunity. That is
your moment.
(Johnny hesitates)
Are you a Bible man? The Book says in Revelations, "I saw a new heaven and
a new earth." If the hand of God's not on you to fulfill that prophecy,
then the hand of Tweed will be. Go on and God bless.

Johnny looks like he is about to say something, but he stops; looks at
Tweed a moment longer; then nods acknowledgment and leaves.

GOVERNOR
I don't believe he can do it, Tweed.

BOSS TWEED
Oh, I think he can. Whether it's one man against another or a mob against
the city, the mathematics remain the same. You never enjoyed the
enlightenment of poverty, did you, Governor? If you had, you'd know you
can always hire half the poor to kill the other half.

CUT TO

120 EXT. ARMORY DAY

A TREMENDOUS VOLLEY of GUNFIRE, as if to illustrate the Tweed theory of
class warfare. Bodies fall in the street. Bodies fall from the Armory. The
building is under siege by the main unit of the MILITIA and by Bill the
Butcher and the Natives. The Dead Rabbits are trapped.

Johnny SNAKES through the Native American lines, over dead bodies, moving
towards Bill, who he sees a hundred yards away...

... running over corpses of comrades and enemies toward the MILITIA
COMMADER. As SHOT WIDENS, the carnage is revealed. Bodies of Natives, in
their uniform dusters, and Rabbits, in their tamlas, lie side by side in
the street.

120 CONTINUED:

FIRING continues from both sides as the Butcher shouts at the Militia
Commander.

BILL THE BUTCHER
We move now and we can drive them out! We press them and they'll break!

MILITIA COMMANDER
I can't spare the men or stand the risk! We stay fast and smoke lem out!

BILL THE BUTCHER
Tweed put me in charge of this! I say we move, and by the crucified Christ
we will move!
(turns to his men)
Native Americans, come with me! Any militia that wants to live upright
instead of die hunkered down, come with us!

Bill STALKS through the lines, rallying the men. And Johnny starts to
FOLLOW.

BILL THE BUTCHER
We'll show you gladiators' greatness! Come on!

The men start to JOIN the Butcher; even some militia fall in. Johnny SLIPS
through the men gathering near the Butcher. He's closer to Bill than ever.

Bill starts to mount their BARRICADE. There is MOVEMENT and commotion all
around him as Natives and militia fall into rough formation. It threatens
to obscure Bill from Johnny's view. Shield him.

He has to make his move. NOW. He DRAWS a revolver as militia and Natives
pass in front of him... he AIMS ... he's anxious, confused ... his HAND
shakes ... he fires... too soon! ...

... and HITS a Native, who falls dead. Right near Bill.

The Butcher turns in the direction of the shot, SEES Johnny. Their eyes
lock. Johnny FIRES again ... WINGS Bill ...

... and Bill SHOOTS him. Johnny FALLS with the first shot. Bill's above
him now, looking down at him.

BILL THE BUTCHER
Was it Tweed or your friend put you to this?

JOHNNY
Tweed.

Bill SHOOTS him again, point blank. Johnny screams.

BILL THE BUTCHER
You'd lie to save your friend.

JOHNNY
(in terrible pain)
No. There's no friends for me.

BILL THE BUTCHER
Me the same. Pity us both.

He EMPTIES his revolver into Johnny.

BILL THE BUTCHER
(to his men)
Hold your fire!
(toward the Armory)
In there! Hey in there! I want to talk to Amsterdam!

The Militia Commander is aghast at this proposition and starts forward,
gun in hand. But a Native STOPS him.

Amsterdam's face APPEARS in a front window of the Armory.

AMSTERDAM
Go on, then, talk.

BILL THE BUTCHER
You and me.

AMSTERDAM
(beat)
Come ahead then. And bring my friend's body.

Bill the Butcher SLINGS Johnny's body over his shoulder as easily as if it
were an empty sack of flour...

... and starts walking thraugh the lines toward the Armory. The Militia
watches in disbelief, the Natives in confusion. The Dead Rabbits keep the
Butcher in their sights. But no one fires. No one moves.

And Bill the Butcher enters the front doors of the Armory.

CUT TO

121 INT. ARMORY DAY

As the Butcher is admitted through the huge doors which clang SHUT quickly
behind him. It's a scene of devastation inside-dozens of dead and wounded
everywhere. And enough rifles and munitions to sink Manhattan island.

Bill the Butcher stands dead center in the middle of the Armory floor as
Amsterdam walks toward him. The Butcher DROPS Johnny's body in a heap at
his feet.

BILL THE BUTCHER
Your friend made different friends lately.

AMSTERDAM
Tammany's put us all in the same place. You want to get out alive?

BILL THE BUTCHER
It don't matter to me. I got enemies outside, enemies in here. The militia
can move on me anytime. You could drop me before I get to the door.

AMSTERDAM
I don't want to lose you so easy. You'll never get past the militia unless
you come with the Dead Rabbits.

BILL THE BUTCHER
You'd lay aside what's between us?

AMSTERDAM
I'm not forgetting where I put it.

BILL THE BUTCHER
If you do, I'll remind you.
(he turns, leaves)

AMSTERDAM
What's your call, Bill?

BILL THE BUTCHER
I'm considering where's my better chance.

He walks to the doors. The Rabbits guarding it don't make a move. He OPENS
it himself and strides out into the street.

CUT TO

122 EXT./INT. ARMORY DAY

Bill walks alone toward the Native/militia lines.

From inside... from every window ... the Dead Rabbits watch him.

The sun is high, but the street is eerily quiet. There are FARAWAY SOUNDS
of battle, but here there is only the sound of distant, unheard
conversation between Bill, the Militia Commander and some Natives.

Amsterdam WATCHES intently.

The Butcher and the Militia Commander argue, but we still can't hear what
they're saying. There is still no sound...

... until, SUDDENLY, we see the Militia Commander's face. Huge. EYES WIDE
with surprise as we HEAR the thunderclap of a SHOT.

Bill the Butcher has just gutshot the Militia Commander.

As if the shot were a signal, the Natives TURN on the militia. It's
hellish, close-quarter combat. Guns fired inches from enemies who had just
been allies. Knives, swords, bludgeons, kids with dead-rat blackjacks,
women with hob-nailed wooden planks, attacking better-armed but totally
stunned soldiers.

Bill the Butcher falls back toward the Armory, the Natives following him.

Inside the Armory, Amsterdam turns to his own greatly diminished gang.

AMSTERDAM
Go ahead them, give them cover! Give them some damn cover!

The Rabbits are so stunned to be fighting on the same side as their sworn
enemies that, even with Amsterdam's order, no one makes a move. It's
Amsterdam who FIRES the first shots. And that unleashes a great VOLLEY
from the Armory...

... toward the militia.

The Butcher and the Natives are closer to the Armory now... and the Armory
doors start to open...

... when a MILITIA LIEUTENANT SIGNALS ...

... and MILITIA on the surrounding roofs, waiting for this moment,
suddenly open fire...on the Natives below and on the Rabbits on the roof
of the armory. Many drop in the street and fall from the Armory roof...

... as the Armory doors SWING WIDE to admit the Natives. As they run or
stagger inside, the Rabbits start to close the doors. Some Rabbits are cut
down by the fire from the rooftops. Other Natives never make it to the
doors. And a few are shot...

... when the doors close before they can get through.

CUT TO

123 INT./EXT. ARMORY DAY

The Dead Rabbits keep firing, but they have sustained grave losses. The
Butcher looks around at the Natives who have made it inside with him: he
has perhaps one-quarter of his original strength.

BILL THE BUTCHER
Well, it seems like between us we got two mobs that might make a gang.

AMSTERDAM
Whose gang might it be?

BILL THE BUTCHER
Not William Tweed's.

Jimmy Spoils and a crew of Natives PUSH a cannon toward the rear of the
Armory.

AMSTERDAM
Which way you pointing that?

JIMMY SPOILS
Any way you say. One direction could let us out, the other will let them
in.

BILL THE BUTCHER
They got to come in if we're going to fight them.

AMSTERDAM
Who do you want to fight, Bill?

Amsterdam MOTIONS toward the rear wall and Jimmy swings the cannon around.

Everything surrounding them is MOVEMENT and COMMOTION as the remaining
members of both gangs TAKE whatever weapons they can carry from the Armory
stockpile...

... and Jenny steps forward with a torch, LIGHTING the fuse of the
cannon...

... which ROARS and BLOWS a huge hole in the rear wall of the Armory.

AMSTERDAM
(to Bill the Butcher)
See you in the street.

The gang members RUSH for the opening, carrying whatever they can manage.

Outside, the MILITIA LIEUTENANT hears the cannon blast... sees no damage
to the front of the building... and SIGNALS for a frontal ASSAULT on the
Armory.

HIGH ANGLE FROM ABOVE, CAMERA MOVING as the militia CHARGES ... following
them forward, then moving ahead to the Armory

... SHOOTING straight down inside (no roof or ceiling) as the Gangs HURTLE
through the still-smoldering hole in the wall ...

... and drop twenty feet to an alley below...

... where militia on the roof try to pick them off. As the militia presses
closer from the front, gang defenses start to fall back inside the Armory.
Everyone wants to get through that hole.

Amsterdam, Jenny, Jimmy Spoils and some of the other gang nembers are
carrying TORCHES. Jenny HANDS a torch to the Butcher. Amsterdam MOTIONS
them all toward the back of the Armory.

But he stays behind. Just for a moment. He BENDS over the crumpled body of
Johnny Sirocco, ARRANGES it, folding JOHNNY'S HANDS across his chest.

AMSTERDAM
You'll have a warrior's funeral anyway, John.

He STANDS and RUNS for the hole in the wall, where Jenny and the others
stand waiting.

He TURNS, takes a last look inside the Armory. The militia is BATTERING
DOWN the front doors. Then he raises his TORCH over his head... and HURLS
it through the air. Jenny and the others do the same.

His single torch BLAZES a path of light across the screen. The others,
JOINING it, make a fiery CONSTELLATION.

CUT TO

124 EXT. REAR OF ARMORY/STREETS BEHIND ARMORY DAY

As Jenny, Jimmy Spoils, Bill the Butcher and Amsterdam HURTLE through the
hole into the alley below...

... and start to run through the withering GUNFIRE of the militia on the
roof...

... getting away... just barely away.

As Jenny runs, her swag drops and FALLS from under her clothes. She TURNS
to pick it up but Amsterdam PULLS her on....

... and just away from the titanic EXPLOSION of the Armory. The CONCUSSION
throws some of the militia from their perches on the roof. It sends a
fountain of FLAME and RUBBLE high into the sky. It is VOLCANIC in its
brilliance and intensity. The sky turns BLACK with powder, BLAZING ORANGE
with flame.

In the small streets BEHIND THE ARMORY, many gang members are CRUSHED by
debris or burned by FIREBALLS breaking off from the central flame.

The Armory is gone. Much of the surrounding area is gone with it.

On the ground, everything is smoke, flame, dirt, death, confusion, Corpses
everywhere. Gang members and kids running all over, desperate. It looks
like the last day of mankind on earth.

Bill the Butcher HELPS a couple of fallen Natives, then SEES through the
smoke and flame and storm of ash ... Amsterdam.
Coming towards him.

BILL THE BUTCHER
We're finished, all of us.

AMSTERDAM
But you and me ain't settled.

BILL THE BUTCHER
We got the same now, a full share of nothing. There's nothing to settle.
There's nothing left.

Amsterdam takes a weapon from his pocket, OPENS it for the Butcher to see:
it is the pirate's knife which the Butcher used to kill Priest Vallon.

AMSTERDAM
Then let's start over.

Bill the Butcher looks tired, sorrowful. He BURIES his face wearily in his
arms. And for a moment we think he has given everything up. Amsterdam
MOVES toward him, throu

               FADE IN:

               EXT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - LONDON - NIGHT

               Framed in the large picture window stands JACK CARTER, 
               alone, looking out at the night. He turns away as the heavy 
               satin curtains close, wiping him from view.

               INT. FLETCHER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               A blinding beam of light cuts across the room. One 
               pornographic slide after another hits the screen at the 
               opposite end of the room. They show a dowdy group in some 
               anonymous bedroom, frozen in various stages of a sexual 
               orgy. 

               GERALD FLETCHER is slumped on a sofa. His young wife, ANNA, 
               is curled up beside him. 

               SID FLETCHER, operating the projector's remote-control, 
               has the same flaccid appearance as his twin brother. 

               Jack Carter, drink in hand, watches from an armchair. 

               Clunk. Another slide hits the screen. Gerald is getting 
               turned on. He runs his hand along his wife's stockinged 
               leg. Anna shudders momentarily. She obviously finds his 
               touch repulsive. Carter watches Gerald's hand.

                                     GERALD
                              (removing the cigar 
                              from his mouth)
                         Bollock naked with his socks still 
                         on?

                                     SID
                              (thoughtfully)
                         They do that up North.

                                     GERALD
                         What for? Protective purposes?

               He laughs.

                                     SID
                         Ask me?

                                     GERALD
                         Ask Jack. It's his old stamping 
                         ground.

               Carter turns sharply away to the cocktail cabinet. Lights 
               and sweet music happen when he opens it. 

               Clunk. The slide changes.

                                     SID
                         Must be a bloody contortionist

               Still looking at the screen, Gerald continues.

                                     GERALD
                         We don't want you to go up the 
                         North, Jack.

               Jack and Anna look at each other momentarily. There is 
               definitely something between them. 

                                     JACK
                         No.  

               Clunk. The slide changes.

                                     GERALD
                              (groans)
                         Not suede boots!  

                                     SID
                         Knock it off, Gerald.

                                     GERALD
                         What? And get the clap?  

               Clunk. The slide changes.

                                     GERALD
                         You work for us, Jack. We have 
                         connections in those parts.  I'd 
                         hate you to screw 'em up.  

               Clunk. The slide changes.

                                     GERALD
                         What's that? A python.  

               Sid laughs raucously.  Clunk. The slide changes.

                                     GERALD
                         What are you going for?  

                                     JACK 
                         To find out what happened.  

               Clunk. The slide changes. 

                                     GERALD
                         Some hard nuts operate up there, 
                         Jack. They won't take kindly to 
                         someone from London poking his 
                         bugle in. 

                                     JACK
                         Too bad. 

                                     GERALD
                         I smell trouble, boy.  

               Clunk. The slide changes. 

                                     SID
                         The law was satisfied. 

                                     JACK
                         Since when was that good enough?  

               Clunk. The slide changes. 

                                     GERALD
                         Think again, Jack.

                                     JACK
                         I will.

               EXT. RAIL TRACK - DAY

               Express train plunges into a tunnel Blackness. 

               BEGIN TITLES:

               INT. TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY

               The compartment is full. Jack Carter sits in one corner, 
               reading a Raymond Chandler paperback, Farewell My Lovely.

               EXT. RAIL TRACK - DAY

               The train speeds northwards. In the distance the stacks of 
               a lonely power station belch a continuous stream of brown 
               smoke.

               INT. TRAIN CORRIDOR - DAY

               Carter steadies himself as he comes along the corridor.

               EXT. RAIL TRACK - DAY

               A massive iron bridge crossing a river whips past. Its 
               mesh sides create an almost hypnotic effect.

               INT. TRAIN TOILET - DAY

               Carter tips his head back and dispenses drops into his 
               nose.

               EXT. RAIL TRACK - EVENING

               The train breaks from another tunnel. Evening light cuts 
               across the track as the train hurtles on.

               INT. TRAIN RESTAURANT CAR - EVENING

               Carter pours himself a glass of water and takes out a small 
               phial of brown pills. He swallows one.

               EXT. RAIL TRACK - NIGHT

               A chemical factory, brightly lit, passes by and the 
               outskirts of the city appear.

               INT. TRAIN COMPARTMENT - NIGHT

               The train moves slowly along the platform and stops. Carter 
               collects his coat and briefcase from the rack.

               EXT. NEWCASTLE STATION - NIGHT

               The street is fairly deserted.  

               Carter exits with other passengers from the train. He pauses 
               and looks about before crossing to the pub opposite.

               INT. THE LONG BAR - NIGHT

               A couple of youths are playing records on the juke box. An 
               old man sits in the corner reading a newspaper.  

               Carter enters through the swing door and a weedy BARMAN 
               comes to serve him.

                                     CARTER
                         Pint of bitter.

               The barman picks up a glass mug and begins to draw the 
               beer. Carter snaps his fingers at him.

                                     CARTER
                         In a thin glass.  

               The barman sighs petulantly, transfers the beer into a 
               thin glass and puts it on the counter.

               A telephone rings. The second barman answers it. 

                                     BARMAN
                         Is there a Mr Carter in the room? 

                                     CARTER
                         Yes.

               Carter walks to the far end of the bar and picks up the 
               receiver.

                                     CARTER
                         Hello?
                              (pause)
                         Margaret?
                              (pause)
                         Why the hell aren't you here?
                              (he lights a 
                              cigarette.)
                         What time?
                              (pause)
                         Is Doreen at the house?
                              (pause)
                         Who's with him then?
                              (pause)
                         When can I see you? Will you be 
                         there tomorrow?
                              (pause)
                         Now listen, Margaret...  

               The line goes dead. Carter hangs up.

               INT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - HALL - NIGHT

               A key hanging inside the letter box starts to move upwards 
               and out through the flap. A moment later, the door opens. 
               Carter is standing at the bottom of a flight of stairs in 
               a worker's terraced house. He closes the door and climbs 
               the stairs.

               INT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - LANDING - NIGHT 

               Carter moves cautiously. His eyes scan the peeling 
               wallpaper, the mildew on the banisters. A roof leak hits 
               an unseen bucket with depressing regularity.

               INT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

               An unmade bed with pyjamas on it, a beaten-up wardrobe, a 
               dressing table and chair are about it. Carter hears a 
               vehicle stopping on the street below. He eases back the 
               ancient net curtain. Two men in a Land Rover are looking 
               up. They see him and quickly drive off.

               Carter looks around the room. On top of the wardrobe there's 
               an old shotgun. He reaches up and brings it down. Memories 
               flood back. He reaches up again and finds a box of 
               cartridges. More memories, jack and Frank grew up here. He 
               leaves the gun on the bed and returns to the landing.

               INT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Pitch black.

               An overhead light snaps on to the face of a dead man FRANK 
               CARTER. He is lying in a coffin. His eyes are closed, his 
               skin made-up, like porcelain.

               Carter stands over the coffin. He gently touches his 
               brother's crossed hands and folds the shroud over his face. 
               He exits, turning out the light and closing the door. 

               Darkness returns.

               INT. 'LAS VEGAS' BOARDING HOUSE - ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT

               The landlady, EDNA GARFOOT, is climbing the stairs. She's 
               well built, sexy, experienced. Carter follows with his 
               baggage. He watches her appreciatively from behind.

                                     CARTER
                         I won't be using the room tonight.

                                     EDNA
                              (stops and turns)
                         I see.

                                     CARTER
                         I'm staying with a friend.

                                     EDNA
                              (continuing up the 
                              stairs)
                         Her husband docks tomorrow, does 
                         he?  

                                     CARTER
                              (smiles)
                         It's not like that, luv.

                                     EDNA
                         It never is.

               INT. BOARDING HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

               The door opens and the light goes on. It's a big room 
               overlooking the road, furnished cheaply but comfortably. 

               Edna and Carter enter, talking. 

                                     EDNA
                         Are you a traveller?  

                                     CARTER
                              (smiling)
                         Definitely.

                                     EDNA
                              (surveying the room)
                         Will this do?  

                                     CARTER
                              (looking around)
                         Very nice. (He takes his wallet 
                         out.) I'll pay you for tonight as 
                         well.

                                     EDNA
                         Don't be bloody silly. You're the 
                         first since Monday.

                                     CARTER
                         You sure?  

               Carter gives her the money.

                                     EDNA
                         Ta.

                                     CARTER
                              (feeling the mattress)
                         I'll bet this one's seen some 
                         action.

               Carter smiles and looks straight at her. Edna returns his 
               look, dead pan.

                                     EDNA
                         I'll give you the key when you 
                         come down.

               She closes the door.

               INT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

               Carter moves around the coffin as he shaves. His electric 
               razor is plugged into the lamp above his dead brother.

               INT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

               The coffin lid is being screwed down.  

               Carter stirs a cup of instant coffee while watching the 
               undertakers at work.  

                                     CARTER
                         Was he in bad shape?  

                                     UNDERTAKER
                         They come worse.

               INT. HEARSE - DAY

               The hearse is parked outside the row of terraced houses. A 
               youthful UNDERTAKER is minding it. He turns and looks 
               through the back window as a young girl walks up the street. 

               DOREEN CARTER is sixteen and, like most girls of her age, 
               tries to look older. She wears all the right gear but it's 
               cheap and doesn't fit properly. Her long hair is lank.  
               There's something sad and embarrassing about her appearance. 
               The young undertaker watches as she enters Frank's house.

               INT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

               The door opens slowly. Doreen stands there looking at the 
               coffin. Carter sees her.

                                     CARTER
                         Doreen?  

               She seems mesmerized by what's going on.

                                     CARTER
                         All right, are you?  

               Doreen doesn 't answer.

                                     CARTER
                         Been staying with a friend?  

               Doreen nods. The undertaker coughs and thrusts another 
               screw into the coffin.

                                     CARTER
                         Sorry about your father.

                                     DOREEN
                              (pause)
                         Yeah.

                                     CARTER
                         Tell me, Doreen, did the police 
                         say anything?

                                     DOREEN
                              (dazed)
                         They said he was drunk.

               INT. HEARSE - DAY

               The young undertaker is still in the hearse listening to 
               the radio. In the driving mirror he sees the Land Rover 
               moving slowly tip the road. It stops by the house. Two men 
               suss the scene and drive off.

               INT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

                                     CARTER
                         How's school?  

                                     DOREEN
                         I left last year.

                                     CARTER
                         Oh, what you doing now?  

                                     DOREEN
                         Working at Woolworths. 

                                     CARTER
                         That must be interesting.

                                     DOREEN
                         Yes.

               Carter and Doreen look at each other awkwardly.

                                     CARTER
                         What you going to do? Live with 
                         Margaret? 

               Doreen looks at him nervously, shakes her head and fumbles 
               in her bag for a cigarette.

               Carter continues, slightly indignant.

                                     CARTER
                         Well, why won't you come with us 
                         to South America? My fiancee won't 
                         mind,
                              (pause)
                         Your dad would have wanted it.  

               The undertaker puts the final screw in.

                                     UNDERTAKER
                              (to colleague)
                         Get Hughbert up, will you?
                              (to Carter)
                         We're ready now, sir.

               EXT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - DAY

               The undertakers struggle with the coffin down the narrow 
               staircase into the street. Outside Carter and Doreen wait 
               with two men. EDDIE APPLEYARD, a middle-aged man, is wearing 
               a shabby tweed suit, cap and black tie. KEITH LACEY is a 
               young barman who worked with Frank.

                                     EDDIE
                         We weren't sure where it was taking 
                         place, like.

                                     CARTER
                         Nice of you to come.

                                     EDDIE
                         No. Frank was a good bloke.

                                     KEITH
                         He was that.

                                     EDDIE
                         One of the best.

               INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY

               Through the windscreen of the following limousine Carter 
               can see his brother's coffin in the hearse as it moves 
               slowly through the streets of the city. Sitting in front 
               on fold-out seats are Eddie and Keith.

                                     KEITH
                         I couldn't believe it when I heard.  
                         Carter is suddenly attentive.

                                     CARTER
                         What?  

                                     KEITH
                         I mean, I was surprised when he 
                         didn't turn up for work.  He was 
                         always on time.

                                     CARTER
                         Did you work with him, Keith?  

                                     KEITH
                         At the Half Moon.

                                     EDDIE
                              (not to be left out)
                         It's a bloody funny thing. You 
                         know a bloke for six bloody years 
                         and all the time he's as calm as 
                         gentle Jesus...
                              (pause)
                         ...then he goes and does a thing 
                         like that.
                              (he shakes his head.)
                         It's a bloody funny thing.

                                     CARTER
                              (quietly)
                         Yeah. A bloody funny thing!

               EXT. CREMATORIUM GATES - DAY

               As the cortege drives into the crematorium, it passes the 
               Land Rover parked outside. The same two men who passed 
               Frank's house are in it. A long and expensive-looking 
               funeral cortege passes out as they move up the driveway.

               INT. CREMATORIUM - DAY

               Carter, Doreen, Eddie and Keith are in the front pews facing 
               the catafalque on which Frank's coffin rests. The vicar is 
               already midway through the solemn words of the 'committal' 
               when a woman enters. The clunk of her high heels cuts 
               through the silence. Everybody looks round.

                                     CARTER
                              (whispering to Doreen)
                         Is that Margaret?  

               Doreen nods. Frank's coffin sinks out of sight.

               INT. CREMATORIUM COMMITTAL CHAMBER - DAY

               Two men in long grey coats wait in silence. The coffin 
               appears. Expertly, they take it and swing it on to a 
               trolley. They push it up the wide corridor towards the 
               furnace. One of the men starts whistling cheerfully.

               EXT. CREMATORIUM - DAY

               MARGARET is thirtyish, blonde, attractive in a tarty kind 
               of way.  Her heels are too high and she is wearing a cheap 
               pair of sunglasses. She walks quickly away, down the 
               cloisters, past the memorial tablets and urns.  

               Carter comes out of the chapel and sees her.

                                     CARTER
                         Margaret.

               Margaret stops and looks round. Carter joins her.  I thought 
               you weren't coming.

                                     MARGARET
                         Changed me mind.

               They face each other in silence. Margaret looks past Carter 
               and sees Doreen watching them at the end of the cloisters. 
               She turns away and starts walking slowly. Carter moves 
               with her.  Margaret continues nervously.

                                     MARGARET
                         Everyhing go off all right? 

                                     CARTER
                         Fine...
                              (pause)
                         I want to talk to you. 

                                     MARGARET
                         What about?

                                     CARTER
                         Doreen. 

               Margaret stops in her tracks and looks back at Doreen. 
               She's still watching them.

                                     MARGARET
                              (adamantly)
                         She's nothing to do with me. 

                                     CARTER
                              (puzzled)
                         What do you mean? You've been 
                         Frank's bird ever since her mother 
                         cleared off. You're closer to her 
                         than anyone.

                                     MARGARET
                              (shaking her head)
                         No. No. It's not like that. I've 
                         got a husband, you know.

               Margaret starts walking again, fast.  

               Carter catches hold of her arm and stops her.

                                     CARTER
                         Hold it!   Hold it!
                              (looking her in the 
                              eye)
                         Who killed Frank, Margaret?

                                     MARGARET
                              (nervously)
                         Killed?  I don't know anything 
                         about it.

               She moves off rapidly. Carter catches up with her.

                                     CARTER
                         Really.

                                     MARGARET
                         I must go. I'm in a hurry.

                                     CARTER
                         I want to talk to you later.

                                     MARGARET
                         I can't.

                                     CARTER
                         Tomorrow morning, then?  

               Margaret dithers.

                                     MARGARET
                         Well, all right then. Twelve o'clock 
                         on the Iron Bridge.

               Margaret walks off as calmly as she can, her high heels 
               clicking as she goes. Carter watches her disappear. Doreen 
               watches too.

               INT. CREMATORIUM COMMITTAL CHAMBER - DAY

               Frank's coffin is slid inside the furnace. Flames start to 
               lick it as the steel trap closes.

               INT. THE HALF MOON PUB - DAY

               It's a large room with a horseshoe bar in the centre, a 
               real boozer.  A handful of hard drinkers are already in 
               position.

               Carter, Doreen, Keith and Eddie are sitting alone. Their 
               table is already covered with glasses. Doreen appears to 
               be slightly drunk on Babycham, Eddie on whisky and Keith 
               on beer. Carter is stone-cold sober.

                                     EDDIE
                         Absent friends.
                              (He raises his glass 
                              and drinks, then 
                              continues 
                              thoughtfully.)
                         You don't think he might have done 
                         it on purpose?

                                     KEITH
                         What? You mean, like, kill himself?  

               Eddie and Keith look at each other.

               Doreen watches them. She is getting very upset by the 
               conversation.

                                     KEITH
                         Naw. Frank? Kill himself? You what?  

               Carter stares at Keith, who is getting uncomfortable.

                                     KEITH
                         I mean, what for?  

                                     CARTER
                         That's what I was wondering.

                                     KEITH
                         Come off it. Frank was... well... 
                         straight. He had no worries I know. 
                         Hell, we worked together every day 
                         for a year. It would have showed.

                                     CARTER
                         Why would it?  

                                     KEITH
                         It just would. He was always the 
                         same.

                                     CARTER
                         Since when did he drink whisky?  

                                     KEITH
                         Don't know.

                                     CARTER
                         Nobody seems to know.

               Doreen is now crying openly.

                                     EDDIE
                              (finishing off his 
                              drink)
                         Bloody good bloke. One of the best.

                                     DOREEN
                              (blurts out)
                         How would you know?
                              (She suddenly jumps 
                              up and empties her 
                              glass in Eddie's 
                              face.)
                         Or you?  Or you? None of you knew.  
                         I knew. He was me dad.

               She runs off out of the door crying. Keith goes to follow.  
               Carter puts his hand out to restrain him.

                                     CARTER
                         Let her go. She'll be OK.
                              (to Eddie)
                         Sorry about that.

                                     EDDIE
                              (wiping his face 
                              with a handkerchief)
                         Don't worry. She's bound to be 
                         upset.

                                     CARTER
                              (to Eddie)
                         Have another?  

                                     EDDIE
                         No. I'll be off now. I should be 
                         at work.

               Eddie stands up, cap in hand. Carter pulls out a wad of 
               money.

                                     CARTER
                         Look, look.
                              (He peels off a 
                              note.)
                         Get your suit cleaned.

                                     EDDIE
                         No. It's all right.

                                     CARTER
                              (standing, pushes 
                              the note in his 
                              top pocket)
                         Thanks for coming.

                                     EDDIE
                         Frank was a good bloke. It's the 
                         least I could have done.

               Eddie leaves.

                                     CARTER
                         You work here, Keith?  

                                     KEITH
                         Yes.

               Carter thinks for a moment, then leans forward to Keith. 

                                     CARTER
                         Keith, if anybody comes in here 
                         and asks for me, you let me know. 
                         Right?  

                                     KEITH
                         Right.

                                     CARTER
                         I'm at the Las Vegas. Behind the 
                         dance hall.
                              (He casts an eye 
                              around the bar.)
                         Do you know a man called Albert 
                         Swift?

                                     KEITH
                         Yeah. He comes in here a bit.

                                     CARTER
                         Where would I find him?

                                     KEITH
                         Today? At the races. He always 
                         goes.

               Carter takes out his phial of pills.

                                     KEITH
                         How'd you know Albert?

                                     CARTER
                         Went to school with him.
                              (smiles)
                         He was leader of our gang. He'll 
                         know what's going on in this town.

               EXT. RACE TRACK - DAY

               The rain has just stopped. Bookies and punters lower their 
               umbrellas. Horses thunder towards the finishing post. Turf 
               flies in all directions as the jockeys whip their mounts 
               in a last desperate effort and the crowd roars.

               EXT. TRACK ENCLOSURE - DAY

               Albert Swift is standing by a bookmaker's marking bis race 
               card with a biro. A hot dog is sticking out of his mouth, 
               like a cigar. A man of about thirty-five, be appears much 
               older, probably from an excess of booze and women. He looks 
               up, and his mouth drops open, the hot dog falling to the 
               ground. He has seen Carter.

               EXT. TRACK ENCLOSURE - DAY

               Carter is pushing his way along the line of bookies, all 
               the time looking about him. The track loudspeaker announces 
               the winner of the last race.

               EXT. TRACK ENCLOSURE - DAY

               Albert pales. He holds his race card in front of his face 
               and disappears into the crowd. As he moves off, his foot 
               steps on the hot dog and tomato ketchup oozes out.

               EXT. TRACK SADDLING ENCLOSURE - DAY

               Carter stands alone, casting an eye over the punters. His 
               eyes rest on someone the other side of the saddling ring 
               ERIC PAICE.  Dressed in a grey chauffeur's uniform, cap, 
               dark glasses and gloves, he is standing close to three 
               well-heeled-looking men with binoculars and shooting sticks.

               Horses for the next race are being led around the enclosure.  
               Carter approaches from behind. He looks at Eric closely 
               before speaking.

                                     CARTER
                         Grey suits you, Eric.

               Eric swings round, startled.

                                     ERIC
                         Good God!

               Carter smiles.

                                     CARTER
                         Is he?

                                     ERIC
                         Jack Carter.

                                     CARTER
                              (amused)
                         Eric. Eric Paice.

                                     ERIC
                         What you doing around here then?

                                     CARTER
                         Didn't you know this is my home 
                         town?

                                     ERIC
                         No, I didn't know that.

                                     CARTER
                         Funny, that.

               Carter takes out his cigarettes. Eric takes one.

                                     ERIC
                         Thanks. So what're you doing? On 
                         your holidays?

                                     CARTER
                         No. I'm visiting relatives.

                                     ERIC
                         Oh, that's nice.

                                     CARTER
                         It would be. If they were still 
                         living.

                                     ERIC
                         Meaning what?  

                                     CARTER
                         A bereavement. A death in the 
                         family.

                                     ERIC
                         Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

                                     CARTER
                         That's all right, Eric.

               Carter flicks bis lighter and gives Eric a, light.

                                     ERIC
                         Well, well. Small world, isn't it?

                                     CARTER
                         Very...
                              (pause)
                         So, who you working for these days 
                         Eric?

                                     ERIC
                         Oh, I'm straight.
                              (indicating uniform)
                         Respectable.

                                     CARTER
                              (smiling)
                         What are you doing? Advertising 
                         Martini?

                                     ERIC
                         Oh, you've been watching television.

                                     CARTER
                         Yeah,
                              (pause)
                         Come off it, Eric. Who is it?

               Eric smiles back.  

                                     CARTER
                         Brumby?

               Eric shakes his head.

                                     CARTER
                         Kinnear?

               Eric shakes his head

                                     ERIC
                         What's it to you anyway? 

                                     CARTER
                         I've always ad your welfare at 
                         heart, Eric. Besides which, I'm 
                         nosy.

                                     ERIC
                         That's not always a healthy way to 
                         be...

                                     CARTER
                         And you should know, if I remember 
                         rightly.

               A track announcement interrupts them.

                                     CARTER
                         So you're doing all right then, 
                         Eric. You're making good. 

                                     ERIC
                         Making a living.

                                     CARTER
                         Good prospects for advancement, is 
                         there? A pension?
                              (He can't resist it 
                              any longer. He 
                              lifts the sunglasses 
                              off Eric's nose 
                              and looks into his 
                              eyes.)
                         Do you know, I'd almost forgotten 
                         what your eyes looked like.

               Eric stares back.

                                     CARTER
                         They're still the same. Piss holes 
                         in the snow.

                                     ERIC
                         Still got a sense of humour?

                                     CARTER
                         Yes, I retained that, Eric.
                              (He moves towards 
                              the saddling ring 
                              and turns to Eric.)
                         Do you know a man called Albert 
                         Swift, Eric?

                                     ERIC
                         Can't say I do.

               Carter looks across at the track.

                                     CARTER
                         Don't miss the start on my account.

               EXT. RACE TRACK - DAY

               Starting gates slam open and the horses leap out.

               INT. HIRE CAR - AFTERNOON

               Carter is driving along a country road. Ahead, two cars 
               are between him and a Cadillac with dark-tinted windows. 
               The Cadillac turns on to a minor road. Carter follows.

               INT. CADILLAC - LATE AFTERNOON

               Eric Paice is driving. In the back sit the three men seen 
               with him at the race track. The drinks compartment is open 
               and they are helping themselves to champagne. Racing results 
               come over the car radio.

               INT. HIRE CAR - LATE AFTERNOON

               Carter follows the Cadillac at a safe distance. It turns 
               into a driveway. Carter slows down and reads a sign by the 
               entrance: The Heights. 

               He drives on and parks.

               EXT. THE HEIGHTS - LATE AFTERNOON

               Carter comes through a wooded area. He pauses by a lake, 
               now overgrown with weeds. A big man stands tossing stones 
               into the water. Carter silently picks up a dead branch 
               then runs at the man. Carter whacks him on the head and he 
               collapses unconscious into the lake. Carter moves on towards 
               the house. MARTY and RAY the two men previously seen in 
               the Land Rover, are playing with an Alsatian on the spacious 
               lawn fronting the house. It's a Victorian building 
               surrounded by acres of woodland.

               Carter breaks from the trees and darts for the side door. 
               One of the men notices and shouts after him.

               INT. THE HEIGHTS - LATE AFTERNOON

               Carter runs into the house and slips into a small service 
               room. Ray and then Marty charge inside but miss seeing 
               Carter.

               INT. THE HEIGHTS - SITTING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

               A game of poker is in progress. Seated around the table 
               are the three men with Eric at the race track. With them 
               is an elegant man, CYRIL KINNEAR. On the sofa are GLENDA, 
               a sexy-looking young woman, and Eric Paice.

               Ray bursts in. 

                                     RAY
                         Carter's here.

               Eric jumps up.

                                     ERIC
                         Where? 

                                     RAY
                         I don't know.

                                     ERIC
                         You stupid shit! 

               Carter walks past Ray, blowing him a kiss.

               Kinnear watches with some amusement.

                                     KINNEAR
                         You see what it's like these days, 
                         Jack.  You can't get the material.

               Carter looks at Eric.

                                     CARTER
                         Yes, I can see your problem, Mr 
                         Kinnear.

                                     KINNEAR
                         Sit down, Jack,
                              (pause)
                         I could weep. I really could.  
                         Sometimes I think I'll retire. 
                         Just piss off to the Bahamas and 
                         let somebody else employ them,
                              (to girl)
                         Glenda, get Jack a drink. What is 
                         it, Jack?

                                     CARTER
                              (to Glenda)
                         Scotch, please.

                                     KINNEAR
                              (to bouncer)
                         Piss off, Ray.

               Ray closes the door behind him.

               Glenda brings Carter his Scotch. He looks at her as she 
               sits beside him.

                                     KINNEAR
                         Eric told me of your bereavement.

                                     CARTER
                         Yep.

                                     KINNEAR
                         Do you know, I never knew he worked 
                         in one of my places!

                                     CARTER
                         No? Funny that. Neither did I.

                                     KINNEAR
                         If I'd known, I'd have fixed him 
                         up with something better.

                                     CARTER
                         Yeah.

                                     KINNEAR
                         Nasty way to go.

                                     CARTER
                         Yes.

               One of the three men sitting around the table with Kinnear 
               gets impatient. PETER, LES AND HARRY are well-heeled, middle-
               aged, northern businessmen.

                                     HARRY
                         Are we here to play cards or talk 
                         about the old days? 

                                     KINNEAR
                         Harry! Jack, I don't want to be 
                         rude, but these men have brought a 
                         lot of money with them. Glenda, 
                         you don't offer a man like Jack a 
                         drink in those piddling little 
                         glasses.  Give him the bloody 
                         bottle.
                              (He picks up his 
                              cards.)
                         Now, where are we?

               Harry keeps a cold, wary eye on him.

                                     KINNEAR
                         Oh... I think I'll stay as I am.

                                     HARRY
                              (shaken)
                         You're bluffing, you bastard!

                                     KINNEAR
                         That's what you pay to find out. 
                         Right, Jack?

                                     CARTER
                         Right. If you can afford it.

                                     HARRY
                              (to Carter)
                         Thought you were going soon.

                                     CARTER
                         Soon. When you've lost your money. 
                         Won't take long. 

                                     HARRY
                         Clever sod, aren't you?  

                                     CARTER
                         Only comparatively.

                                     KINNEAR
                         Harry, I don't like to push, but 
                         could you let us know how much 
                         your hand's worth?

               Harry looks at his cards. Glenda tucks her legs up, making 
               sure that Carter gets an eyeful.

                                     GLENDA
                         You know Sid Fletcher?

                                     CARTER
                         What?  

                                     GLENDA
                         You know Sid Fletcher? 

                                     CARTER
                         I work for him.

                                     GLENDA
                         Do you?

                                     CARTER
                              (amused)
                         Yes, I do.

               Carter looks back at the table. Kinnear pushes in some 
               money.

                                     HARRY
                         What's that? A hundred?

                                     KINNEAR
                         That's right, Harry.

                                     HARRY
                         Your hundred, and another hundred.

               Kinnear lays more cash on the table.

                                     HARRY
                         What's that?

                                     KINNEAR
                         That, Harry? That's another hundred - 
                         twenty-five pounds notes of the 
                         realm.

                                     HARRY
                         Three hundred altogether?

                                     KINNEAR
                         Three hundred altogether, Harry.

               Glenda attracts Carter's attention again.

                                     GLENDA
                         I know him too.

                                     CARTER
                         Who? 

                                     GLENDA
                         Sid Fletcher.

                                     CARTER
                              (sending her up)
                         Oh, do you?

                                     GLENDA
                              (dumb)
                         Yes.

                                     CARTER
                         No, do you really? 

               Carter turns to the table yet again.

               Harry nervously puts another hundred on the table. Kinnear 
               purses his lips. 

                                     KINNEAR
                         I'll follow that and go two hundred.

               Harry looks sick.

                                     KINNEAR
                         You can always see me, Harry.

               Harry sweats and then smiles nervously.

                                     HARRY
                         All right. Two hundred.

                                     KINNEAR
                              (raises an eyebrow)
                         Ha.

               Kinnear takes a wad of notes out of his pocket. Glenda, 
               shifts herself on the sofa.

                                     GLENDA
                         Yes. I met him last year.

                                     CARTER
                         Go on.

                                     GLENDA
                         Oh yes. When he came up on business.

                                     CARTER
                         Really?

                                     GLENDA
                         He came to see Mr Kinnear.

                                     CARTER
                         No.

               Carter, getting bored, looks back at the game.

                                     HARRY
                              (panicking)
                         What's that?

                                     KINNEAR
                         That's six hundred pounds, Harry. 
                         Two hundred to follow you, and 
                         I've raised it four hundred.

               Harry sweats some more.

                                     HARRY
                         Four hundred?

                                     KINNEAR
                         That's right.

                                     HARRY
                         You're not seeing me?

                                     KINNEAR
                         No.

               Harry smiles nervously. He counts some money out.

                                     HARRY
                         I'll see you, then.

                                     KINNEAR
                         Calling my bluff, are you, Harry?

               Harry nods.

               Glenda speaks, but this time Carter keeps his eyes on the 
               table. Kinnear lays out his hand  a hearts flush, queen 
               high.

                                     GLENDA
                         We went about together.

                                     CARTER
                         Really?

                                     GLENDA
                         Yes, while he was here.

                                     CARTER
                         While he was here. You went about 
                         together?

                                     GLENDA
                         He was here for four days.

                                     CARTER
                         Was he? 

                                     GLENDA
                         Could you do me a favour?  

                                     CARTER
                         Yeah, I'll do you a favour.

                                     GLENDA
                         Could you please put my glass on 
                         the table? 

               Carter smiles and does just that.

                                     KINNEAR
                         Oh, come on, Harry. I haven't won, 
                         have I? Go on, you're pulling my 
                         leg.

               Kinnear leans across to pick up Harry's cards. Harry grabs 
               them and puts them in the pack. Kinnear turns to Carter.

                                     KINNEAR
                         How about that, Jack?  Old Harry 
                         thought I was having him on.

                                     HARRY
                         Shut up.

               Carter gets up from the sofa.

                                     KINNEAR
                         Not going, Jack? 

                                     CARTER
                         I have to. Things to see to.

                                     KINNEAR
                         Of course, of course. Well, any 
                         time, just drop by.

                                     CARTER
                         Yeah, I'll do that.
                              (He points at Harry.)
                         Told you it wouldn't take long, 
                         didn't I? 

               Eric opens the door and follows him out.

               INT. THE HEIGHTS - HALLWAY - EVENING

               Carter moves towards the front door.

                                     ERIC
                         Jack! I didn't like that.

                                     CARTER
                         You should have told me who you 
                         were working for. 

                                     ERIC
                         Cyril didn't like it, either.

                                     CARTER
                         Oh, Cyril, eh? So it's all girls 
                         together, is it?

                                     ERIC
                         He's thinking Sid and Gerald won't 
                         like it much when they hear you've 
                         been sticking your nose in.

               Carter carries on walking to the front door. He opens it. 

                                     CARTER
                         He's right. Tell him to save the 
                         cost of the phone call.

               Carter leaves. Eric signals Ray to follow him.

               EXT. SCRAPYARD - DAY

               Huge metal claw catches hold of an old car and lifts it 
               like it was a toy. The yard is beside the River Tyne. In 
               the distance a train crosses the Iron Bridge.

               Carter is examining a beaten-up Hillman when the yard owner, 
               BILLY LAWS, approaches.

                                     BILLY
                              (suspicious)
                         What do you want?

                                     CARTER
                         What happened to this car? 

                                     BILLY
                         What's it got to do with you? 

                                     CARTER
                         This is my brother's car.

                                     BILLY
                         Oh ay?

                                     CARTER
                         Yeah.

                                     BILLY
                         Well, he drove it into the river.

                                     CARTER
                         Was the steering faulty? 

               Billy shakes his head.

                                     CARTER
                         What about the brakes?  

                                     BILLY
                         Fine. Nowt wrong with them.

                                     CARTER
                         How'd it happen, then?

                                     BILLY
                         He was drunk. Drunk as a lord.

                                     CARTER
                         Was he?

               INT. THE HALF MOON - NIGHT

               A big, busty pub singer is performing on the small stage. 
               A trio on her right plays a good, grinding, up-tempo number.  

               Carter comes through the door. He pushes his way through 
               the packed drunken crowd to the bar. Keith serves him. 

                                     KEITH
                         What you having, Jack? 

                                     CARTER
                         Large Scotch.

               Carter watches the singer. The customers cheer and whistle.  
               Keith returns with the Scotch. He looks nervously around 
               and speaks to Carter quietly.

                                     KEITH
                         Heard of a man called Thorpe? 

                                     CARTER
                         Old Thorpey? Haven't seen him in a 
                         long time.

                                     KEITH
                              (picking up Carter's 
                              money)
                         That's what he was saying about 
                         you.

               Keith takes the money to the till. The music grinds away.  
               Keith returns.

                                     KEITH
                         Said he'd heard you were up in 
                         town. Wondered if I knew where you 
                         was staying. Wanted to look you 
                         up. Old time's sake.

                                     CARTER
                         That's nice. What'd you tell him?  

                                     KEITH
                         Nowt.

                                     CARTER
                         Good lad.

               Carter watches the singer, then finishes his drink.

                                     CARTER
                         See you later.

                                     KEITH
                         Where you off to?

                                     CARTER
                              (smiling)
                         Las Vegas.

               Carter makes for the door. The singer is now moving through 
               the tables. She pauses to give some man a kiss. Everybody 
               cheers.

               The woman sitting with the man snaps. She picks up his 
               glass of beer and throws it over the singer; then grabs 
               her hair and pulls her to the ground.

               Carter stops to watch. The two women roll on the floor, 
               punching and scratching.

               Carter smiles and leaves.

               EXT. ALLEY IN TOWN CENTRE - NIGHT

               On the corner is a neon-lit snack bar. Doreen and another 
               young girl are sitting inside sucking milk shakes. Somewhere 
               a drunk is singing. His voice echoes up the alley.

               Carter draws alongside and notices Doreen. He stops and 
               watches her. She hasn't seen him so he goes to the window 
               and knocks on it. She looks up and he beckons her outside. 
               Reluctantly, she comes.

                                     CARTER
                              (gently)
                         You all right now?

                                     DOREEN
                         Yeah.

                                     CARTER
                         You coming to South America?

                                     DOREEN
                         No.

               Carter's hurt and slightly irritated by this rejection. 

                                     CARTER
                         Where you going to live, then? 

                                     DOREEN
                         At me friend's house.

                                     CARTER
                         Where's that?

                                     DOREEN
                         Wilton Estate.

                                     CARTER
                         Nice family, are they? Church-goers 
                         and all that?

               Doreen nods.

                                     CARTER
                         Good. I'm off tomorrow, so I don't 
                         suppose I'll see you again.
                              (He pulls out a wad 
                              of money, and peels 
                              off some notes.)
                         There. Go and get your hair done.

                                     DOREEN
                              (Can't believe it)
                         Thanks.

               He lifts her chin with his finger and looks at her.

                                     CARTER
                         Be good. And don't trust boys.

               Doreen blushes and turns away. She rushes back to the snack 
               bar with the money to show her friend.

               INT. BOARDING HOUSE - HALL/SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

               The front door opens and Carter enters.

               Standing on the hall table is a small wooden casket with 
               an envelope taped to it. Carter pockets the envelope and 
               picks up the casket.  

                                     EDNA (O.S.)
                         That was left for you this evening. 

               Carter walks past her into the sitting room.

                                     EDNA
                         What is it?

                                     CARTER
                         My brother, Frank.

                                     EDNA
                         Is he staying the night?  

                                     CARTER
                         Funny.
                              (He puts the casket 
                              on a side table.)
                         Can I phone London?

                                     EDNA
                         It'll cost you.

               INT. FLETCHER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Anna is undressing. She's alone. Pulling the short black-
               silk underslip over her head, she stands in front of a 
               long mirror, clad only in black panties, bra and tights. 
               She looks at herself appreciatively. The phone rings. She 
               flops on the bed and picks up the receiver.

                                     ANNA
                         Hello.

               A voice speaks on the end of the line.

                                     ANNA
                         How I miss you.
                              (She stretches 
                              herself out sexily 
                              and smiles.)
                         Stop it, darling.

               INT. BOARDING HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

               It's a cosy room. Carter is on the telephone. EDNA sits in 
               a rocking chair.

                                     CARTER
                              (looking at Edna)
                         I fancy you. I wish I was touching 
                         you right now...

               Edna turns towards him. Carter fixes her with his eyes. 
               Edna rocks herself gently. Carter continues softly.

                                     CARTER
                         ...making love to you. I want to 
                         stroke you and kiss you all over. 
                         Where are you?

               INT. FLETCHER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Anna is lying full-length on the bed.

                                     ANNA
                         In the bedroom.

               Carter speaks on the other end.

                                     ANNA
                         My black underwear.

               INT. BOARDING HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

               Edna rocks backwards and forwards. 

                                     CARTER
                              (quietly)
                         The sexy, silk ones?  

               Anna replies. He continues softly.

                                     CARTER
                         Take your bra off.
                              (pause)
                         No, go on.

               INT. FLETCHER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 

               Anna unhooks her bra. There's a flash of breasts.

               INT. BOARDING HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

               The scene as before.

                                     CARTER
                         Now hold them. Gently.

               INT. FLETCHER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Anna's hands cover her breasts. Her head moves slowly from 
               side to side, eyes closed.

               INT. BOARDING HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

               Scene as before.

                                     CARTER
                         Slowly. Imagine it's me.

               INT. FLETCHER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Anna's hand caresses the inside of her leg. Her head rolls 
               from side to side slowly. She's breathing heavily.

               CROSS-CUT between Edna's head rocking backwards and forwards 
               and Anna's head moving from side to side.

                                     CARTER (V.O.)
                         When we're in South America, we'll 
                         make love in the sun. Roll over... 
                         and make love again... and again... 
                         For me... I fancy you...

               THE SPEED OF THE CUTTING BUILDS.

               INT. FLETCHER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Suddenly the door opens and Gerald comes in. He sees Anna 
               groaning on the bed.

                                     GERALD
                         What's the matter? You got gut 
                         trouble or something?

               Anna sits up abruptly and puts her hand over the receiver. 

                                     ANNA
                         No, darling. Just doing some 
                         exercises,
                              (into telephone)
                         Listen, Janet, Gerald's just got 
                         in, so I must ring off.
                              (pause)
                         Yes. Yes. I'll come tomorrow.

               INT. BOARDING HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

               Scene as before.

                                     CARTER
                         Save it till Sunday. I'll be back 
                         then.

               Carter replaces the receiver. He still holds Edna's eyes. 
               She rocks to and fro. The rocker creaks.

               The front door bell breaks the mood.

                                     CARTER
                         That'll be for me.

               INT. BOARDING HOUSE - HALL - NIGHT

               Carter opens the door. Keith is outside. He's sweating. 
               His tie is somewhere round the back of his neck and his 
               suit is covered with dirt.

                                     KEITH
                         Thorpey. They were waiting for us 
                         in the car park. 

                                     CARTER
                         How many?

                                     KEITH
                         Four of them.

               Carter pulls Keith inside and turns out the light. 

               A Ford Zodiac comes along the road. It stops. Four faces 
               peer into the darkness where they're standing. Nobody gets 
               out. The back window winds down. Thorpe's nervous voice 
               floats out.

                                     THORPE
                         Jack? 

                                     CARTER
                         Good evening.

                                     THORPE
                         I'd like a word with you, Jack.

                                     CARTER
                         That's nice.

                                     THORPE
                         Confidential, like.

                                     CARTER
                         You stay in the car. I'll come and 
                         listen. (
                              (He leaves the 
                              darkness and walks 
                              to the car.)
                         What you want to tell me, Thorpey?

               Thorpe holds out his hand.

                                     THORPE
                         I've been asked to give you this.

               He hands Carter a railway ticket. Carter smiles.

                                     THORPE
                         Train goes at four minutes past 
                         twelve. You've just got time.

                                     CARTER
                         That's very kind of somebody. Who 
                         do I have to thank? (pause) What 
                         happens if I miss the train?

                                     THORPE
                         I've been asked to make sure you 
                         don't.

                                     CARTER
                         Oh, really. You're getting very 
                         optimistic in your old age, aren't 
                         you, Thorpey?

               One of the men inside mutters.

                                     MAN
                         Let's stop pissing about.

                                     THORPE
                         Are you coming, Jack? It'd be best.

               Carter tears the ticket in half and drops it in the gutter.

                                     THORPE
                         Right lads.

               The front passenger door starts to open. Carter grabs it 
               and pulls it wide open. With all his force, he slams it 
               against the man as he gets out. The window shatters over 
               his head. Blood spurts everywhere.  The driver panics. He 
               accelerates away as the man in the back is getting out. 
               His foot is trapped in a safety belt. He's upended and 
               dragged along the tarmac, his head dangerously close to 
               the back wheel. His yells make the driver brake. In the 
               confusion Thorpe escapes from the car and makes off. Carter 
               spots him and begins to run.

                                     CARTER
                              (roars)
                         Thorpe!

               Thorpe turns into the main road. He makes for the dance 
               hall and disappears inside. Carter follows.

               INT. DANCE HALL - NIGHT

               The dance floor is full, mainly with miniskirted girls, 
               their handbags at their feet. A rock band play mechanical 
               music to match the dancing.

               Thorpe vanishes into the crowd circling the floor. Carter 
               arrives. He scans the place, then sees Thorpe as he 
               disappears down into the gents' lavatory.

               INT. DANCE HALL - GENTS' LAVATORY - NIGHT

               Carter enters. There's no sign of Thorpe. He checks the 
               cubicles until he finds the one that's occupied, then goes 
               into the next one. He climbs on the seat and looks over 
               the partition. Thorpe is sitting down looking at the door. 
               Carter quietly leans across and pulls the chain. Thorpe 
               jumps up, terrified.

                                     CARTER
                         Time's up, Thorpey.

               Carter smiles.

               EXT. BOARDING HOUSE - NIGHT

               Keith kicks broken glass into the gutter while he waits. 
               Edna's next-door neighbour, an OLD WOMAN, watches. Carter 
               and Thorpe come down the street.

                                     CARTER
                         Hello, Keith,
                              (pause)
                         Stay there, Thorpey.

               He knocks on Edna's door. It flies open. Edna is furious. 

                                     EDNA
                         What the bloody hell do you think 
                         you're at? 

                                     CARTER
                              (smiles)
                         I'm sorry.

                                     EDNA
                         You don't look it.

                                     CARTER
                         No. Really, I am.

                                     EDNA
                         Don't come that bloody flannel 
                         with me. If you're a traveller, 
                         I'm bloody Twiggy.
                              (She points at 
                              Thorpe.)
                         And who's he?

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         What's going on? Have you no thought 
                         for others?

                                     CARTER
                         We're going inside.

                                     EDNA
                         Inside? Why should I give house-
                         room to your sort? 

                                     CARTER
                         Up the stairs, Keith. The door on 
                         the right.

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Everybody knows you, Edna Garfoot.  
                         Everybody knew there'd be trouble 
                         when you moved in.

               Carter, Keith and Thorpe enter the house.

                                     EDNA
                         You keep your trap shut, Ma.

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         I'll send my old man to see you!

                                     EDNA
                         And wouldn't he love it!

               INT. BOARDING HOUSE - HALL - NIGHT

               Carter, Thorpe and Keith are climbing the stairs. Carter 
               stops to pick up Frank's casket. Edna rushes in and slams 
               the door.

                                     EDNA
                         Where do you think you're going? 

               Carter opens the door to his room.

                                     CARTER
                         Why don't you go and make us all a 
                         nice cup of tea? 

               Carter shoves Thorpe into the room.  Keith follows.

                                     EDNA
                         And what you going to do? 

                                     CARTER
                         Make us a nice cup of tea and I'll 
                         tell you. I might even let you 
                         watch.

                                     EDNA
                         I'll call the police.

                                     CARTER
                              (He knows she fancies 
                              him)
                         No, you won't.

               Carter closes the door.

               INT. BOARDING HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Carter carefully places the casket on the chest of drawers. 

                                     CARTER
                         Well now, Thorpey. It seems I've 
                         got a secret benefactor.
                              (He moves into the 
                              room and opens his 
                              briefcase, which 
                              is lying on the 
                              bed.)
                         It's nice to know that. Isn't it, 
                         Keith?
                              (He takes out a 
                              bottle of whisky.)
                         There's only one trouble, I don't 
                         know who to thank.

               Thorpe looks longingly at the bottle of Scotch. Suddenly 
               Carter punches him hard in the stomach. He grunts and 
               collapses into a chair.

                                     CARTER
                         Now, I want to know who it is, 
                         Thorpey.

               Carter tosses the whisky bottle to Keith and continues 
               wearily.

                                     CARTER
                         All right. If you like, Thorpey, 
                         we'll stop mucking about.  Somebody 
                         doesn't want me poking my nose 
                         into something and I happen to 
                         know what that something is.
                              (pause)
                         Now stand up.

               Thorpe looks at him, terrified. Slowly he stands. Carter 
               grabs him by the testicles and applies preasure. Thorpe 
               screams.

                                     CARTER
                         Who paid you to see me off?  

                                     THORPE
                         I can't Jack. How can I? 

                                     CARTER
                         Yes you can.

               Carter applies more pressure. Thorpe screams.

                                     THORPE
                         No, don't Jack, don't.

                                     CARTER
                         Who sent you, Thorpey? 

                                     THORPE
                              (desperate)
                         Brumby!

               Carter gives him a final squeeze and lets go. Thorpe groans 
               and slips to the floor, doubled up in agony.

                                     CARTER
                         There you are, you see. Now you 
                         could, couldn't you?
                         (pause)
                         And quickly.

               There's a knock on the door. Carter lets in Edna, who is 
               carrying the teatray.

                                     CARTER
                         Ah, Edna, come in. Join the tea 
                         set.

                                     KEITH
                         Who's Brumby? 

                                     CARTER
                         Cliff Brumby. Ever been to Westsea? 

               Keith nods.

                                     CARTER
                         Ever been into an arcade there and 
                         put a penny in the slot machine?  

                                     KEITH
                         Yeah.

                                     CARTER
                         Ten to one, it belonged to Cliff 
                         Brumby, and like as not the bloody 
                         arcade as well. Right along the 
                         coast. Isn't that right, Thorpey?

               Thorpe drags himself painfully to a chair.

                                     CARTER
                         Where's he living these days?  

                                     THORPE
                         He's got a new place at Burnham.

                                     CARTER
                         Address? 

                                     THORPE
                         On the Durham Road. The Pantiles.

                                     EDNA
                              (furious)
                         Suppose you tell me what the bloody 
                         hell's going on. It's my house, 
                         you know.

                                     CARTER
                         Yes, Edna, and I must say you've 
                         been great about the ...

                                     EDNA
                         Stick the soft soap. Let's be having 
                         it.

               Thorpe's plaintive voice interrupts.

                                     THORPE
                         Can I go now? 

                                     CARTER
                         You must be joking,
                              (to Keith)
                         Keep him away from the telephone. 
                         I'm going out for a bit.

                                     EDNA
                         Now just a minute...

                                     CARTER
                         Ta-ra.

                                     THORPE
                         Don't let on I told you, for God's 
                         sake.

               Carter laughs and closes the door.

               EXT. THE PANTILES - NIGHT

               It's a large, new, ranch-style house, set back from the 
               road. The front garden is a landscape gardener's nightmare, 
               with its phoney brick and wrought-iron wishing well, 
               porcelain dwarfs, lily pond, the lot. Fairy lights hang 
               over everything.

               There's a party going on. Lights are on in every room and 
               the rock music is loud. The drive is lined with sports 
               cars.

               Carter parks and gets out.

               Out of a side door a young man stumbles towards the lily 
               pond.  There, he promptly throws up.

               Carter watches from behind a tree.

               His attention shifts to the white Bentley turning into the 
               drive. It brakes sharply and the driver jumps out.

               CLIFF BRUMBY has been to a police ball. He is impeccably 
               dressed in tuxedo and white scarf. Now he's hopping mad.

                                     BRUMBY
                         Jesus wept!  

               MRS BRUMBY cowers in the passenger seat.

                                     MRS BRUMBY
                         Now, Cliff, don't get mad. 

                                     BRUMBY
                         I'll murder the little bitch!

                                     MRS BRUMBY
                         Cliff ...

               Brumby roars up to the front door, banging it furiously. A 
               young woman in a party dress, expecting to greet a 
               latecomer, is stunned to see who it is.

                                     SANDRA
                         Daddy!

                                     BRUMBY
                         That's right, bloody Daddy.

                                     SANDRA
                         I wasn't expecting you until three 
                         o'clock.

                                     BRUMBY
                         And this is what you call having a 
                         few friends back for coffee, is 
                         it?

               Brumby pushes past her into the house.

                                     BRUMBY
                         Running bloody riot over my bloody 
                         furniture, drinking my bloody 
                         booze...

               The rest is lost as he disappears inside. He then powers 
               out through the side door

                                     BRUMBY
                         ... spewing over my fucking 
                         goldfish.

               He aims a kick at the young man's backside, sending him 
               face-down into the lily pond.

               Mrs Brumby gets out of the car and hovers for a moment. As 
               she approaches the house, people pour out. Brumby appears 
               at the door with a boy pulling up his trousers.

                                     MRS BRUMBY
                         Cliff ...

               Brumby throws the boy out.

                                     BRUMBY
                         Shut up, Phyllis.
                              (He walks back into 
                              the house.)
                         Sandra!

               Mrs Brumby goes into the house and closes the door. Brumby 
               passes an upstairs window as Sandra locks herself in a 
               bedroom.

                                     BRUMBY
                         Sandra! Unlock the door, you bitch.

               Carter pauses outside the front door and listens to the 
               row going on upstairs. He opens the door and goes in.

               INT. THE PANTILES - NIGHT

               Carter passes silently through the hall into the large 
               sitting room. Mrs Brumby is sitting in an armchair. 

               Brumby is still yelling at his daughter upstairs. 

                                     CARTER
                         Good evening.

               Mrs Brumby jumps.  The front door is open.

                                     MRS BRUMBY
                              (standing)
                         Who are you?

                                     CARTER
                         I'm an old friend of Cliff's. I 
                         want to see him. 

               Mrs Brumby looks at her watch irritably.

                                     CARTER
                         It's urgent.

                                     MRS BRUMBY
                         What's it about? 

                                     CARTER
                         Business.

                                     MRS BRUMBY
                         I know all about Cliff's business.

               Carter moves further into the room.

                                     CARTER
                         Yeah, well, tell him the Fletchers 
                         sent me.

               Mrs Brumby is uncertain what to do. Carter sits in an 
               armchair to make his point. She leaves. A moment later 
               Brumby storms into the room.

                                     BRUMBY
                         What the bloody hell's all this? 

               Carter doesn't move.

                                     BRUMBY
                         You know what the bloody time is!
                              (pause)
                         It's two o'clock in the bloody 
                         morning!

                                     CARTER
                         I know.

                                     BRUMBY
                         Well? 

               Carter still doesn 't move.

                                     BRUMBY
                         The wife says the Fletchers sent 
                         you.

               Carter just looks at him. Weighing him up.

                                     BRUMBY
                         What's so bloody important it 
                         couldn't wait till the morning?  

               Carter starts to laugh. He realizes Thorpe has lied to 
               him.  Brumby isn't his man.

                                     BRUMBY
                         Listen, I'm not in the mood for 
                         bloody silly buggers. 

               Carter stands.

                                     CARTER
                         I made a mistake.

                                     BRUMBY
                         What?

                                     CARTER
                         I made a mistake.

                                     BRUMBY
                         What about?

                                     CARTER
                         Never mind.

               Brumby looks confused.

                                     BRUMBY
                         It's not business?

               Carter moves to the door.

                                     CARTER
                         See you.

               Brumby moves between him and the door.

                                     BRUMBY
                         Listen, I don't like it when some 
                         hard nut comes pushing his way in 
                         and out my house in the middle of 
                         the night.

               Carter again makes to leave. Brumby stops him.

                                     BRUMBY
                         Bloody well tell me who sent you.

                                     CARTER
                         You're a big man, but you're in 
                         bad shape. With me, it's a full-
                         time job. Now behave yourself.

               Brumby swings at him. Carter moves away from the punch, 
               then applies several sharp blows to Brumby's head and neck.  
               Brumby groans and collapses into the armchair, hurt.

               Carter walks into the hall and out of the front door.

                                     CARTER
                         Good night, Mrs Brumby.

               EXT. 'LAS VEGAS' BOARDING HOUSE - NIGHT

               Carter walks up the deserted street to Edna's place. He 
               finds the front door unlocked.

               INT. BOARDING HOUSE - HALL - NIGHT

               Carter enters cautiously. There is no sound. He closes the 
               door quietly and pauses at the foot of the stairs. Still 
               there is no sound. He waits. A sudden rustle attracts his 
               attention. Quietly, he moves to the sitting-room door.

               INT. BOARDING HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

               Carter switches on the light. Edna is pressed against the 
               far wall, holding a poker. Her dress is torn and her hair 
               dishevelled. When she sees Carter, she sighs with relief.  

                                     EDNA
                         You sod.

                                     CARTER
                         They came back?

                                     EDNA
                              (sarcastically)
                         No.

               Carter helps himself to a glass of water from the tap. 
               Edna looks at her torn dress.

                                     EDNA
                         Look at this. You bastard.

               Carter puts the glass on the table.

                                     EDNA
                         You don't care a stuff, do you?

               Carter takes out his phial of pills.

                                     CARTER
                         I'll buy you another.

               Carter swallows a pill.

                                     EDNA
                         What about the lad? They took him 
                         away.

               Carter shrugs his shoulders.

                                     EDNA
                         What'll they do to him?

                                     CARTER
                         Don't ask me.

               Edna rubs her wrists.

                                     EDNA
                         They bloody hurt me.

                                     CARTER
                         You're lucky. They kill as well. 

                                     EDNA
                              (mocking him)
                         And what about you? Did you kill 
                         Brumby?

               Carter shakes his head.

                                     EDNA
                         Thorpey nearly died laughing.

                                     CARTER
                         That little shit! 

                                     EDNA
                         What about Keith? 

                                     CARTER
                         What about Keith? 

                                     EDNA
                         What you going to do? 

                                     CARTER
                         Pension him off.

                                     EDNA
                         You're a bastard.

                                     CARTER
                              (angry)
                         What am I supposed to do?  I don't 
                         know where they've taken him. Do 
                         you?

               Edna shakes her head.

                                     CARTER
                         So shut up.

                                     EDNA
                         What's that gun doing in your room? 
                         Suppose I phoned the police and 
                         told them there's a bloke staying 
                         in my hotel who's planning to shoot 
                         somebody?

                                     CARTER
                         You wouldn't.

                                     EDNA
                         How'd you know I wouldn't? 

                                     CARTER
                              (smiling)
                         'Cos I know you wear purple 
                         underwear. 

                                     EDNA
                         What's that supposed to mean? 

                                     CARTER
                         Think about it.

               Carter takes hold of her torn blouse and rips it open. She 
               is wearing purple underwear.

               EXT. BOARDING HOUSE - DAY

               It's Sunday morning. A girls' marching band rehearses on 
               the wasteground in front of the terraced houses. The Pelaw 
               Hussars march back and forth carrying their proud banner, 
               led by the drum majorette.

               INT. BOARDING HOUSE - DAY

               Above the bed hangs a sign 'What would Jesus say?' In the 
               bed lie Carter and Edna. The distant sound of the marching 
               band helps them surface.

                                     EDNA
                         Are you awake? 

                                     CARTER
                         No.

                                     EDNA
                         Do you want breakfast? 

                                     CARTER
                         You must be joking. I never eat 
                         breakfast,
                              (pause)
                         Did you sleep well?  

                                     EDNA
                         Uh-huh.

               EXT. BOARDING HOUSE - DAY

               The Pelaw Hussars keep on marching. The back of their banner 
               a stirring motto For Youth and Valour.

               INT. BOARDING HOUSE - DAY

               Scene as before.

                                     EDNA
                         Did you sleep well?

                                     CARTER
                         Yes, thank you.

               He puts his arm around her and moves on top.

               EXT. BOARDING HOUSE - DAY

               As the band executes another movement, a red Jaguar slides 
               to a halt outside Edna's house. Two men get out. PETER the 
               Dutchman and CON MCCARTY are definitely not local lads. 
               They look, and are, lethal. They try Edna's front door. It 
               opens.

               INT. BOARDING HOUSE - DAY

               Scene as before.

                                     CARTER
                         Are you tired?  

                                     EDNA
                         No. Are you tired?  

                                     CARTER
                         No. I'm not tired,
                              (pause)
                         Do you eat breakfast? 

               Edna laughs. They start to make love. Gently. Below the 
               undulating bedsprings rests a large chamberpot and, beside 
               it, Carter's shotgun. Beyond is the bedroom door. It opens 
               slowly and the two men enter. Only their legs are visible.  

                                     CON (O.S.)
                         Put us in it, Jack.

               Carter is off the bed, and Edna, in a flash. Edna screams 
               and tries to stop the bedclothes following Carter on to 
               the floor. Peter and Con stand beside the bed smiling. 
               Peter is a queer and dressed fancy in a leather coat, wide-
               bottomed trousers and a loud silk scarf. His hair is 
               bleached blond. Con is more traditional, more butch. He's 
               in a camelhair overcoat, suit and tie. Both are in their 
               thirties.

                                     PETER
                         Don't let us interrupt you, Jack.

                                     CARTER
                         I might have guessed.

                                     CON
                         Sorry about this. But there you 
                         are. Orders are orders.  

                                     CARTER
                         And what orders would they be, 
                         Con?  

               Carter's hand runs over the carpet. It's going towards the 
               chamber pot instead of the gun.

                                     CON
                         Gerald phoned us in the middle of 
                         the night, said he'd heard you've 
                         been making a nuisance of yourself.

                                     PETER
                         We've got to take you back to 
                         London.

                                     CON
                         He said it'd be doing him a big 
                         favour.

               Carter's hand finds the chamber pot and quickly moves on 
               towards the gun.

                                     CON
                         We know why you're all steamed up, 
                         and so do Gerald and Sid.

                                     PETER
                         But they have to be diplomatic.

               Carter pulls out the gun and jumps up.

                                     CARTER
                         Right. Now take me back to London.

                                     CON
                              (smiling)
                         It'd be best if you got dressed 
                         first.

               Carter moves around the bed towards them. He's naked.

                                     CON
                         Put it away, Jack. You know you 
                         won't use it.

                                     PETER
                         The gun he means.

               Both men are laughing.

                                     CARTER
                         Out.

               Peter and Con back down the stairs. Peter looks up at 
               Carter's cock.

                                     PETER
                         If Anna could see you now.

                                     CARTER
                         Out.

                                     CON
                         Now, Jack. Be reasonable. You know 
                         we're going to take you back - 
                         sooner or later.

                                     CARTER
                         Out.

               EXT. BOARDING HOUSE - DAY

               Con is the first to emerge from the front door.

                                     CON
                         Mind you don't catch cold.

               Peter follows.

                                     PETER
                         I hope she's got understanding 
                         neighbours.

               Then Carter comes out, shotgun held across his chest.

                                     CON
                         See you when you've got your drawers 
                         on.

               The old woman next door chooses that moment to come out 
               for her milk. As she straightens up, she sees Carter. The 
               bottle flies from her hand and smashes on her doorstep. 
               Carter, never taking his eyes off Peter and Con, slowly 
               backs into the house.

               INT. BOARDING HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

               Carter watches from the window as he pulls on his jacket. 
               The gun lies across the armchair. Outside, he can see Peter 
               and Con talking by the Jaguar. Con exits.

               Edna, now in her dressing gown, enters.

                                     CARTER
                         Do us a favour?

                                     EDNA
                         What, and get myself beaten up 
                         again?

                                     CARTER
                         No chance of that.

                                     EDNA
                         Not much.

                                     CARTER
                         They're friends of mine.

                                     EDNA
                         And that'll make me feel better?  

                                     CARTER
                         I don't want to get rough, do I?  

               Carter picks up the gun. He hands Edna, bis case and the 
               casket.

               INT. REAR OF BOARDING HOUSE - DAY

               Edna comes out of the back gate into an alley, carrying 
               the casket and case. Con emerges from his hiding place 
               holding a handgun.

                                     CON
                         Hold it! Where do you think you're 
                         going?  

               Carter appears from the gate next door, covering Con with 
               the shotgun.

                                     CARTER
                         Strawberry Fair.

               He takes Con's handgun and signals him to go into Edna's 
               yard.

                                     CARTER
                         In.  Turn right. 
                              (He points the gun 
                              at the coalshed.)
                         Open that door.

               Con unbolts the door.

                                     CARTER
                         And go inside.

               Con goes in. Carter closes and bolts the door. He moves 
               quickly back to Edna and the car.

                                     EDNA
                         What you going to do?

                                     CARTER
                         I'm going to sit in the car and 
                         whistle 'Rule, Britannia'.

               Carter jumps into the car.

                                     EDNA
                         You coming back?

                                     CARTER
                         How could I stay away?

               The car roars off.

               EXT. BACK ALLEY - DAY

               Washing hangs behind each house as far as the eye can see. 
               Carter drives full tilt through it, collecting towels and 
               sheets on the windscreen.

               EXT. EDNA'S YARD - DAY

               The coalhouse door is getting a terrible battering. It 
               finally gives and Con bursts out. He runs into the alley, 
               following after Carter.

               EXT. BOARDING HOUSE FRONT - DAY

               Carter's car screeches as it corners from the alley on to 
               the road. Peter is leaning against the open door of the 
               Jaguar. When he sees Carter coming straight at him, he 
               scarpers for the pavement.  Carter hits the Jaguar's door 
               at speed, tearing it off. It flies up and crashes on to 
               the tarmac as Carter careers over the wasteground. Soon he 
               is out of sight.

               Con comes running. Peter is looking at the damage.

                                     PETER
                         Where were you, then?  

               Con sees what's happened to the car and is not pleased.

                                     CON
                         Bollocks.

               EXT. BACK STREET - DAY

               Carter pulls up outside a house and gets out. He takes the 
               washing off the car's bonnet, and throws it into a neglected 
               garden.

               EXT. FRONT DOOR - DAY

               Carter presses the bell. The door's opened by a young man, 
               SHAMIR.

                                     CARTER
                         Keith in?  

                                     SHAMIR
                              (shouts)
                         Keith.

               No answer. Shamir watches Carter as he walks into the hall.

                                     CARTER (O.S.)
                         Which is his room?

               INT. KEITH'S ROOM - DAY

               Carter enters and closes the door. Keith is in a had way, 
               his face like a piece of raw steak. He is lying on a bed, 
               still in the clothes of the night before.

                                     CARTER
                         What happened to you, then?

                                     KEITH
                         How'd you find me?

               Keith lifts his head painfully from the pillow.

                                     CARTER
                         Did they give you a rough time?

                                     KEITH
                         No.
                              (He lowers his head 
                              to the pillow.)
                         You bastard. You knew they'd come 
                         back.

                                     CARTER
                         No, I didn't,
                              (pause)
                         Does Albert Swift still live over 
                         the ferry?

                                     KEITH
                         Get knotted.

                                     CARTER
                         All right. All right. I want to 
                         square things with you first.

                                     KEITH
                         Oh yes? How?  

               Carter takes out of his wad of money. Keith's bloodshot 
               eyes watch him through the surrounding puff of flesh.

                                     KEITH
                         Stuff it! My girl friend's coming 
                         from Liverpool tonight.  Nice 
                         surprise, isn't it?  

                                     CARTER
                         I'm sorry. Here. This'll pay for a 
                         course in karate.  

               He throws some money on the bed. Keith tries to kick it 
               off, but it's too painful. He clutches his testicles.

                                     KEITH
                         Frank said you were a shit and he 
                         was bloody well right.

               Carter turns to leave.  Keith continues, crying and angry.

                                     KEITH
                         You even screwed his wife, didn't 
                         you?  

               Carter shuts the door, leaving Keith shouting after him.

                                     KEITH
                         The poor bastard didn't even know 
                         if the kid was his.

               He falls back on to the bed, crying out in pain.

               EXT. RIVERSIDE - DAY

               A wide road runs alongside the Tyne. It passes below the 
               vast steel bridges that link the two parts of the city. A 
               carpark lies at the foot of the 'Iron Bridge'. Carter pulls 
               up and parks. He gets out and moves quickly.

               EXT. THE IRON BRIDGE - DAY

               The bridge is a, massive structure. The traffic lanes are 
               flanked each side by pedestrian walkways. It is here that 
               Carter and Margaret have arranged to meet.

                                     CARTER
                         How were things between you and 
                         Frank?

                                     MARGARET
                         He was all right to me.

                                     CARTER
                         Nothing more? Just another feller?

                                     MARGARET
                         Nicer than most.

                                     CARTER
                         But he was just another feller, 
                         wasn't he?

                                     MARGARET
                         Yes.

                                     CARTER
                         Though nicer than most?  

                                     MARGARET
                         Yes. I can't help the way I am.

                                     CARTER
                              (ignoring the 
                              statement)
                         Why'd you see him so regular?

                                     MARGARET
                         Once a week?  

                                     CARTER
                         I call that regular.

                                     MARGARET
                         He was gentlemanly. I like that.

                                     CARTER
                         Once a week you like a gentleman?  

                                     MARGARET
                              (angrily)
                         Look, I'm me, right. You're not. 
                         We are what we are, like it or 
                         not.
                              (She turns and walks 
                              slowly along the 
                              bridge.)
                         Why all the bloody needle?  

                                     CARTER
                         What was bugging Frank?  

                                     MARGARET
                         He wanted me to leave Dave and 
                         marry him. Last Friday I told him 
                         it wouldn't work. Dave would have 
                         killed us both!
                              (pause)
                         He followed me home and kicked up 
                         a stink in the street,
                              (pause)
                         I had to tell Frank I couldn't see 
                         him any more. It was getting too 
                         dodgy. That was on Sunday.
                              (She stops and looks 
                              over the bridge.)
                         He said he'd kill himself. I was 
                         frightened what you might do.

               They look at each other for a moment. Carter shakes his 
               head. He gently takes the sunglasses from Margaret's face 
               and folds them up.

                                     CARTER
                         I don't believe you, Margaret. 
                         Frank wasn't like that.
                              (pause)
                         I'm the villain in the family, 
                         remember?

                                     MARGARET
                         It's the truth.

               Carter snaps her glasses in two and throws them away. 

                                     MARGARET
                         It is. Honestly.

                                     CARTER
                              (shouting)
                         You bloody whore. Frank was too 
                         careful to die like that. Who killed 
                         him?

                                     MARGARET
                         I don't know nothing.

               Carter holds her arm. She winces like she's been hit before. 

                                     CARTER
                         Listen, the only reason I came 
                         back to this craphole was to find 
                         out who did it. And I won't leave 
                         until I do. You understand?

               Behind Carter Peter's Jaguar comes slowly along the bridge.  
               It stops. The passenger side is a gaping hole.

                                     CON
                         Hello, Jack.

               Carter swings round to see them, then swings angrily back 
               to Margaret.

                                     CARTER
                         You bitch! It was you who told 
                         them I was here, wasn't it?

               He smacks her hard across the face. Margaret cries out. 
               The car draws alongside. A steel mesh separates the 
               pedestrian way from the traffic, so the two men can't get 
               to Carter until he reaches the end of the bridge. Con leans 
               out, his usual cheery self.

                                     CON
                         Peter's very upset about his car. 
                         He's going to shit all over you.

                                     CARTER
                         I'll catch up with you later, 
                         Margaret.

               And with that he vaults over the handrail on to a corrugated 
               roof. Con jumps out of the Jaguar.

                                     PETER
                              (shouts above the 
                              revs)
                         Come on, get in.

               Con does and they race off.

               EXT. WASTELAND - DAY

               Carter arrives at the top of some narrow, steep, overgrown 
               steps leading down to the river road, where his car is 
               parked. He leaps down the steps as the Jaguar screeches to 
               a halt at the top. Con leaps out of the Jaguar and gives 
               chase. Peter backs the Jaguar and roars off.

               EXT. RIVER ROAD - DAY

               Carter comes running down the steps with Con not far behind.  
               He arrives at the river road. In the distance, he can see 
               his parked car.   

               As he nears the car park, Peter's Jaguar comes down the 
               hill. It's going to cut Carter off from his car.

               A Sunbeam Alpine sports car waits there. Its engine roars 
               into life and it races out of the car park. It reaches him 
               just before the Jaguar and slows down.

                                     GLENDA
                         Over here, Jack.

               Carter sees that the driver is GLENDA. The hood is down, 
               so he vaults into the car as it accelerates off.

               The Sunbeam swings round, narrowly missing the oncoming 
               Jaguar, and roars away. Peter hasn't a chance. He's facing 
               the wrong way and has little room to manoeuvre.

               Glenda laughs as the car swings wildly around a corner at 
               the top of the hill.

               INT. SUNBEAM - DAY

               Every movement Glenda makes is sexually charged manual 
               gear changes, steering, even braking. Carter can't take 
               his eyes off her.

                                     GLENDA
                         You didn't know you had a fairy 
                         godmother, did you? 

                                     CARTER
                         No. I didn't know that.

                                     GLENDA
                         A fairy godmother, all of your 
                         own. Aren't you lucky? 

                                     CARTER
                         So where are we going, Princess?  

                                     GLENDA
                         To the demon king's castle, of 
                         course.

                                     CARTER
                         Of course. Where else?  

               The car screams off the road into a multi-storey carpark.

               INT. MULTI-STOREY CAR PARK - DAY

               Glenda really puts her foot down. The car hurtles around 
               each deserted floor.

                                     CARTER
                         How'd you know where I'd be?  

                                     GLENDA
                         You were seen parking your car. 
                         The demon king waves his wand and 
                         I was dispatched to bring you to 
                         him. Lucky for you I waited.

                                     CARTER
                         Very lucky, I should think. You're 
                         drunk!  

                                     GLENDA
                         Nasty.

                                     CARTER
                         He must have been pretty sure I'd 
                         come.

                                     GLENDA
                         Oh, he was. He told me a magic 
                         spell that would make you come.

                                     CARTER
                              (smiling)
                         And what was that?  

                                     GLENDA
                         We're there now.

               She brakes to a split-second stop.

               INT. PENTHOUSE RESTAURANT - DAY

               It's one large empty concrete box with big picture windows 
               all the way round. Wires are hanging from the ceiling and 
               walls where the lights will eventually be fixed.

               A tall figure stands at the opposite end, facing the setting 
               sun. He is just a silhouette.

               Carter and Glenda enter and walk towards the man. The 
               silhouette turns as he nears it. It's Brumby.

                                     BRUMBY
                         A new venture of mine. It's going 
                         to be a restaurant.
                              (pause)
                         Do you like it?  

                                     CARTER
                         Yes.

                                     BRUMBY
                         Last night, after you'd gone, I 
                         did a little bit of asking around. 
                         Seeing as you weren't very 
                         forthcoming,
                              (pause)
                         It seems that you are concerned 
                         about the death of your brother?  
                         (pause) I got to thinking it would 
                         be nice if the bloke you were after 
                         was the same bloke I wanted off my 
                         back,
                              (pause)
                         You know my life. Machines. The 
                         arcades. Nice business. Looks after 
                         itself. People put money in. I 
                         take it out. Not much rough stuff. 
                         It's a business that makes me very 
                         happy. But recently, I've had a 
                         spot of bother,
                              (pause)
                         One of my lads gets a bit over-
                         anxious and flogs some machines in 
                         a club that's already got some. 
                         The upshot is I've had to eat shit 
                         and stop flogging my machines to 
                         other clubs.
                              (pause)
                         So far as I'm concerned, that's 
                         it. Apparently not. These people 
                         I've offended get the idea that it 
                         would be good to take over my whole 
                         outfit,
                              (pause)
                         So I'm worried. I can't fight them 
                          I haven't that kind of set-up. 
                         But I've got to fix them before 
                         they fix me. Trouble is, if I try 
                         and they find out, I'm dead.

               Brumby picks up a black briefcase. He holds it up to Carter. 

                                     BRUMBY
                         Five grand. It belongs to you. 
                         Along with a little name I'm going 
                         to give you.

                                     CARTER
                         What name?  

                                     BRUMBY
                         Kinnear. Cyril Kinnear.
                              (pause)
                         Kinnear did it.  

                                     CARTER
                         Why?  

                                     BRUMBY
                         I don't know. All I know is that 
                         people were shitting bricks up at 
                         his place last Saturday. Your 
                         brother's name was mentioned. Next 
                         day, he was dead.

                                     CARTER
                         Why?  

                                     BRUMBY
                         I don't know. That's all I was 
                         told.

               Carter takes a last look at Glenda and walks slowly back 
               towards the entrance.

                                     CARTER
                         That's not good enough.

                                     BRUMBY
                         Christ, what...

                                     CARTER
                              (shouting)
                         Do me a favour. You don't really 
                         expect me to fix Kinnear on your 
                         say-so?
                              (pause)
                         Just because they tried to get me 
                         on you last night, don't think you 
                         can pull the same trick. Stroll 
                         on.

                                     BRUMBY
                         Jack, you're wrong.

                                     CARTER
                         Good afternoon, Mr Brumby. Carter 
                         exits.

                                     BRUMBY
                         Jack...

               EXT. MULTI-STOREY CAR PARK - DAY

               Carter steps out of the elevator as Glenda's Sunbeam comes 
               down the bottom ramp fast. The car brakes hard and stops. 
               Carter opens the door and gets in. Not a word is said.

               INT. GLENDA'S APARTMENT - DAY

               The apartment is one of many in a modern block and Glenda 
               has only recently moved in. There is a mattress on the 
               floor. A large mirror leans against the wall behind it and 
               a film projector stands close to the window, which has 
               makeshift curtains.

               Carter and Glenda are on the mattress. The bedding is all 
               over the place. They have just finished fucking.

                                     CARTER
                              (looking around)
                         Who's setting you up in this place?

                                     GLENDA
                         Brumby.

                                     CARTER
                         Is he coming here?

                                     GLENDA
                         Don't worry. He's meeting the 
                         architects at the restaurant.

               Carter plays with her hair.

                                     CARTER
                         Aren't you scared Kinnear will 
                         find out?

                                     GLENDA
                         He won't. He thinks I'm simple.

               Carter kisses her neck.

                                     CARTER
                         What does he want that bloody great 
                         country place for?

                                     GLENDA
                              (knowingly)
                         Entertaining.

                                     CARTER
                         What kind of entertaining?  

                                     GLENDA
                         Now you're asking.

               Carter looks at the film projector by the bed and points. 

                                     CARTER
                         Does Brumby get a kick out of that 
                         crap?

                                     GLENDA
                              (giggling)
                         Especially when I play the lead.

               Carter wraps his arms about her.

                                     CARTER
                         Did Kinnear say anything? After 
                         I'd left the other night?

               Glenda sits up sharply.

                                     GLENDA
                         That's why you waited for me.

                                     CARTER
                              (kissing her on the 
                              neck)
                         Not entirely. No.

                                     GLENDA
                         You sure about that?  

                                     CARTER
                         Sure I'm sure.

               Glenda pushes him away and gets out of the bed.

                                     GLENDA
                         You bastard.

               Glenda leaves for the bathroom. Carter, curious, looks at 
               the film projector. It's loaded. He switches it on. A beam 
               of light hits the opposite wall. He settles down to watch 
               the film. The leader flashes by, then a title being chalked 
               on a school blackboard 'The Teacher's Pet'.  A zoom back 
               reveals Glenda, bare-breasted, holding the chalk. This is 
               followed by a long shot of a young girl, dressed in school 
               uniform, waiting at a bus stop. A car approaches and stops. 
               A woman driver offers the girl a lift. The woman is 
               Margaret. The identity of the girl not revealed.

               INT. GLENDA'S BATHROOM - DAY

               Glenda is in the bath. Lots of foam. The hot water is still 
               running.  She's smoking. She leans forward, turning off 
               the tap.

               INT. GLENDA'S APARTMENT - DAY

               Carter is sitting up on the mattress, amused by the soft 
               porn unfolding on the white wall in front of him.

               The schoolgirl accepts the lift and the car drives off. 
               The door to an anonymous apartment opens and Margaret comes 
               in with the girl. Her school hat still hides her identity. 
               Glenda is there to greet them.

               The girl is very awkward. Glenda tries to make her relax, 
               sitting her down and showing her a magazine.

               Glenda brings her into a bedroom. She takes her own top 
               off and goes to do the same with the girl. She takes her 
               hat off. A close-up shows that it is Doreen.

               Carter tenses but never flinches from what's happening in 
               the film.  Margaret comes into the bedroom and feigns shock 
               at what she sees. She slaps Glenda and they start fighting, 
               eventually rolling off the bed.

               The apartment door opens and a man smoking a big cigar 
               comes in.

               Carter sits up. It's Albert Swift.

               Albert opens another door, looking for someone. He leaves.  
               Another door opens and he's in the bedroom. He sees the 
               two women fighting on the floor, but on the bed is his 
               prize Doreen.  Carter watches.

               Doreen bites her nails and looks terrified. Reflected in 
               the mirror behind Carter is the image of Albert taking off 
               his trousers. The reel runs out and flaps like a fish. 
               Carter doesn't move. Tears form in his eyes. He looks old 
               and defeated. His is a wasted life. Then the anger that 
               drives him explodes again and he throws back the bedclothes.

               INT. GLENDA'S BATHROOM - DAY

               Carter, now dressed, moves slowly towards her in the bath.  

                                     CARTER
                         I want to give you an Oscar.

                                     GLENDA
                              (laughs)
                         You've been watching the film.

                                     CARTER
                         Tell me about the girl.

                                     GLENDA
                         What girl?

                                     CARTER
                         The young girl. Who pulled her?

                                     GLENDA
                         I don't know.

                                     CARTER
                         Was it Albert?

                                     GLENDA
                         Shouldn't think so.

                                     CARTER
                         Is it one of Kinnear's films?

                                     GLENDA
                         Yeah.

                                     CARTER
                         Who set it up?  Eric?

                                     GLENDA
                         Yeah.

                                     CARTER
                         Then he must have pulled her.

                                     GLENDA
                         Expect so.

                                     CARTER
                         Did my brother Frank find out?

                                     GLENDA
                         Your brother? What you talking 
                         about?

               Carter's fury bursts. He's out of control. He seizes Glenda 
               and plunges her under the bathwater, holding her there. 

                                     CARTER
                         You're a lying bitch.

               Carter lifts her up, out of the water. She is spluttering, 
               nearly drowned.

                                     CARTER
                         Now tell me the truth.

                                     GLENDA
                         The girl's name was Doreen. That's 
                         all I know.

                                     CARTER
                         And you didn't know her last name?

                                     GLENDA
                         No.

                                     CARTER
                         Well, it's Carter. That's my name,
                              (pause)
                         And her father was my brother. And 
                         he was murdered last Sunday. Now 
                         get up and get dressed.

               He pushes her ahead of him.

               EXT. GLENDA'S APARTMENT BLOCK - DAY

               Carter manhandles Glenda towards her Sunbeam. He opens the 
               boot.

                                     CARTER
                         Get in.

               Glenda climbs in and he slams the boot shut. The car 
               scorches away.

               EXT. JETTY. TYNE FERRY - DAY

               Carter parks the sports car as the ferry docks. He moves 
               down the gangway towards it.

               INT. CAFE - DAY

               A girl with a baby in a pram is having a cup of tea. The 
               door slams open. There's Carter.

                                     CARTER
                         Where's Albert?

               The girl is numb with fear, unable to answer. Carter grabs 
               her by the throat.

                                     CARTER
                         Where's Albert?

               The girl is frozen with terror. He lets go as suddenly as 
               he grabbed her.

                                     CARTER
                         I know where I'll find him.

               EXT. BACK STREET - DAY

               Carter walks fast. There's the sound of a phone being 
               dialled. It's the GIRL in the cafe.

                                     GIRL (V.O.)
                         Eric, he's come for Albert,
                              (pause)
                         I don't know, (pause) On the ferry, 
                         I reckon.

               Carter reaches the front of a betting shop. He walks in.

               INT. BETTING SHOP - DAY

               Carter closes the door. Race results and odds are coming 
               over the Tannoy. He moves into the shop until he reaches 
               ALBERT SWIFT. Albert is making out a betting slip and 
               doesn't see him.

                                     CARTER
                         Hello, Albert.

               Albert looks like he's going to be sick.

                                     ALBERT
                         Hello, Jack,
                              (snivelling)
                         I don't know anything, Jack.

                                     CARTER
                         Yes, you do, Albert. Talk or I'll 
                         kill you.

                                     ALBERT
                         I know. I know.

               Carter sees a door at the back. There's a sign for the 
               toilets.

                                     CARTER
                         Do you want to go to the toilet, 
                         Albert?

               At first Albert doesn't understand.

                                     CARTER
                         Do you want to go to the toilet, 
                         Albert?

               This time it clicks. Albert moves to the door and Carter 
               follows.

               EXT. BETTING SHOP BACKYARD - DAY

               Carter turns to close the door. Albert runs for it. He 
               reaches the high double-gate at the end. It's locked and 
               he tries to climb it. No luck. Carter easily pulls him 
               down. Albert faces him.

                                     CARTER
                         You can't get away from me, Albert. 

                                     ALBERT
                         I know.

               He feels for his cigarettes but can't find them.

                                     ALBERT
                         For Christ's sake, give us a fag.

               Carter takes out his cigarettes. Albert takes one.

                                     ALBERT
                         I didn't know who Doreen was. 
                         Thought she was just another bird.

                                     CARTER
                         Did Eric Pake pull her?

                                     ALBERT
                         Yes.

                                     CARTER
                         How?

                                     ALBERT
                         I dunno. He's got his ways. He 
                         knows Margaret.

                                     CARTER
                         When did you find out?

                                     ALBERT
                         A couple of weeks back.

                                     CARTER
                         How?

                                     ALBERT
                         No choice. I had a visit from 
                         somebody.

                                     CARTER
                         Who?

                                     ALBERT
                         Cliff Brumby. He'd seen the film. 
                         He wanted to meet Doreen.

                                     CARTER
                         And you told Brumby?

               Albert nods.

                                     CARTER
                         Who killed Frank?

               Albert doesn 't answer.

                                     CARTER
                         Do you want to be dead, Albert?

                                     ALBERT
                         Last Sunday afternoon, Eric and 
                         two of his boys arrive with Frank 
                         and tell me that he's rumbled. 
                         Somehow, he's seen the film and 
                         was about to shoot his mouth off. 
                         They ask me for some whisky and 
                         start forcing it down his throat.
                              (pause)
                         I thought they'd just duff him up 
                         a bit. Honest.

                                     CARTER
                         What did you do?  Albert?

                                     ALBERT
                         Nothing. What could I do?

                                     CARTER
                         Did Eric know that Frank was my 
                         brother?

                                     ALBERT
                         Yes. I told him.

                                     CARTER
                         What did he say?

                                     ALBERT
                         'Good.'

               Albert draws deeply on his cigarette.

               They drove Frank away in a car.

                                     CARTER
                         Is that all there is?

               Albert nods.

                                     CARTER
                         Then that's it, Albert.

               Carter takes something from his pocket. There's a loud 
               click.  It's a. knife.

                                     ALBERT
                         Jack, for Christ's sake ...

               He falls to his knees.

                                     CARTER
                         You knew what I'd do.

                                     ALBERT
                              (crying)
                         Yes, but listen. Christ, I didn't 
                         kill him.

               Carter drives the knife into him with all his might.

                                     CARTER
                         I know you didn't kill him.
                              (and again.)
                         I know you didn't.

               A ship's horn calls mournfully from the harbour. Albert 
               leans back. Blood seeps from his chest. He pitches forward, 
               twitches, and is dead.

               INT. BETTING SHOP - DAY

               Carter comes in from the back and walks calmly through to 
               the street. A blind man is at the counter placing a bet.

               EXT. JETTY - TYNE FERRY - DAY

               The Sunbeam waits in the car park. Eric, Con and Peter 
               arrive in the Land Rover and park behind it. They go down 
               the gangplank to the floating jetty. A ferry is chugging 
               across the water.

               INT. FERRY - DAY

               Carter sits, watching the other passengers. A mother and 
               two young children take his attention. His look is tinted 
               with regret even remorse.

               EXT. JETTY - DAY

               As the ferry comes alongside, Eric, Con and Peter move up 
               to the rail. The passengers disembark, leaving Carter 
               standing alone.  He's holding Con's handgun.

               Eric, Con and Peter hack slowly away to the steel shelters. 
               Peter, impatient as ever, pulls a sawn-off automatic shooter 
               from under his coat, cocks it and fires. Too late. Carter 
               is already safely behind the ferry's superstructure. Eric 
               shouts.

                                     ERIC
                         No shooters. Cyril said no shooters, 
                         you stupid bastard.

                                     PETER
                         Get stuffed.  He's reloading.

                                     CON
                         Gerald wants to see him first.

                                     PETER
                         Shut up.

               Carter is listening to all this.

                                     CARTER
                              (shouting)
                         Are you coming in? Or do we piss 
                         about all day?

               Eric laughs.

                                     ERIC
                         You're finished, Jack. You know 
                         that, don't you? I've bloody 
                         finished you.

                                     CARTER
                         Not till I'm dead, Eric.

               Eric laughs.

                                     ERIC
                         Oh, you've still got your sense of 
                         humour?  Tell him how I've fixed 
                         him, Con.

                                     CON
                         He's told Gerald about you and 
                         Anna.

                                     ERIC
                         Didn't believe us at first, did 
                         he, Con? Then Peter talked to him.

                                     PETER
                         Didn't even say goodbye. Just asked 
                         us to take you back - alive.

                                     ERIC
                         He's probably talking to her right 
                         now. Are you still going to fancy 
                         her when Gerald's finished with 
                         her face?

               Carter shows no emotion. Or are his eyes just that bit 
               sadder?  Peter lets rip again. Another window is shattered. 
               Carter ducks back, allowing Peter time to board the ferry.  

               Carter catches a glimpse of Peter as he climbs up the 
               ferry's superstructure to the roof. By the time he heaves 
               himself into position, Carter is waiting.

                                     CARTER
                         Stay where you are, Peter.

               Peter is helpless, clinging to the roof, unable to even 
               raise his shooter.

                                     PETER
                              (screaming)
                         Don't.

               There's a long pause while Carter looks at him, then he 
               cold-bloodedly shoots. Peter is blown away. By the time he 
               hits the deck, he's dead.  

               Con and Eric panic. They run up the gangplank, safely out 
               of range.

                                     ERIC
                         Carter, your car needs a wash.

               Eric signals to the driver in the Land Rover to bump the 
               Sunbeam into the water. Two hits and the task is done.  
               Glenda's screams are lost as the river wraps itself around 
               the sinking car.

               Carter watches impassively.

               EXT. BRUMBY'S RESTAURANT COMPLEX - DAY

               Carter's hire car corners at speed into the high-rise 
               carpark.

               INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

               Brumby and two architects in a site meeting. Plans are 
               laid out on a table.

                                     BRUMBY
                         I don't want them cooking in here. 
                         You can put a hatch in that wall.

                                     INTERIOR DECORATOR
                         Yes, it's all a question of ...

               The sound of a car screeching up the ramps interrupts him. 

                                     BRUMBY
                         Who in Christ's name is that? It's 
                         a bloody madman.  

               He strides away to investigate.

               EXT. RESTAURANT - DAY

               Brumby comes out to the top tier. On the floor below, 
               Carter, unseen by Brumby, has parked and is now making for 
               the concrete spiral staircase.

               EXT. STAIRCASE - DAY

               Brumby pounds down to the first level. Carter comes around 
               the corner.

                                     BRUMBY
                         Jack!  

               Carter slams his fist hard into his gut.

                                     CARTER
                         You shouldn't have shown the film 
                         to Frank.

                                     BRUMBY
                         I had to. It was the only way I 
                         could get at them.

               INT. BACK STREET POST OFFICE -  EVENING.

               It's a combined shop and post office. Carter is on the 
               phone. 

                                     CARTER
                         The guy on the swing-bridge?
                              (pause)
                         OK.

               Carter hangs up. He takes a can of film from his pocket 
               and slips it into a large envelope.  At the counter two 
               women are talking.

                                     FIRST WOMAN
                         They don't know how it happened.

                                     SECOND WOMAN
                         How far did he fall?

                                     FIRST WOMAN
                         What did Betty say... Ninety floors, 
                         I think it was.

                                     SECOND WOMAN
                         Really. Was he dead?

                                     FIRST WOMAN
                         Oh, yes.

               The envelope is passed across to the post office assistant. 
               It is addressed to Vice Squad, Scotland Yard, London Sw1. 

                                     SECOND WOMAN
                         Better to go quick like that.

               EXT. SWING-BRIDGE - EVENING

               The huge steel superstructure pivots on a large man-made 
               island in the middle of the river.

               On top is a structure not unlike a small lighthouse, from 
               which a man operates the bridge. Carter climbs the outside 
               ladder. A man waits for him at the top.

               The man hands him a small cloth package. Carter opens it. 
               Inside is heroin and a hypodermic. He wraps it up again 
               and hands over an envelope. The man checks the money as 
               Carter disappears down the outside ladder.

               INT. BINGO HALL - NIGHT

               The hall is crowded. The compere calls the numbers. The 
               atmosphere is tense as the audience look at their cards. 
               Someone calls, 'Bingo.' A buzz goes round the hall as 
               everybody starts talking again.

               Carter enters, surveying the audience. Eventually, his 
               eyes alight on the person he's been looking for Margaret. 
               She's involved with a woman friend and doesn't see him. 

               The next game starts up.

               EXT. BINGO HALL - NIGHT

               Crowds of people come pouring out. It's the end of the 
               evening's entertainment. Margaret walks out with her friend. 
               Carter follows them and turns up a side street.

               EXT. STEPS LEADING TO BACK STREET - NIGHT

               The place is deserted. Margaret and her friend descend the 
               steps. The clop of their high heels is the only sound. 
               Carter follows discreetly. At the bottom, Margaret and her 
               friend chat for a moment and part.

               Carter follows Margaret.

               EXT. BACK ALLEY - NIGHT

               The clop of Margaret's shoes is heard in the distance. She 
               appears. Carter is following behind. He slips into another 
               dark alley to get ahead of her. As she reaches her home 
               Carter's arm shoots out from behind a pillar. It's holding 
               Con's handgun.

                                     CARTER
                         I've come for you, Margaret.

               INT. THE HEIGHTS - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

               There's a big party going on. The music is loud. It's mainly 
               rich-looking middle-aged men and young dolly birds. 
               Different things are obviously going on in different rooms 
               in the house. Dancing in one room, blue movies in another, 
               etc. Kinnear flits from one to another. Eric Paice is on 
               the phone. He puts the receiver down and crosses to Kinnear.

                                     ERIC
                         Gerald Fletcher wants a word with 
                         you Cyril.

               Kinnear crosses to the telephone.

                                     KINNEAR
                         Hello, Gerald.

               EXT. VILLAGE TELEPHONE KIOSK - NIGHT

               Carter stands in the dimly lit kiosk with Margaret. The 
               hire car is parked alongside.

                                     CARTER
                         It's Carter. Listen carefully, you 
                         hairy-faced git. I've got the film 
                         and enough evidence to put you 
                         away for a long time. All it takes 
                         is one call to the police.

               INT. THE HEIGHTS - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

               Kinnear listens.

                                     KINNEAR
                         Really?
                              (pause)
                         So?

               EXT. VILLAGE TELEPHONE KIOSK - NIGHT

               Carter into phone.

                                     CARTER
                         I'll do a simple deal with you. 
                         All I want is ...

               INT. THE HEIGHTS - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

               Kinnear is still listening to Carter. He looks over at 
               Eric, who's fixing a drink.

                                     KINNEAR
                         I see. I think that can be arranged.

               Kinnear continues listening.

               INT. VILLAGE TELEPHONE KIOSK - NIGHT

               Carter into phone.

                                     CARTER
                         ... but I don't want him there 
                         until six in the morning.  OK?
                              (pause)
                         Right.

               Carter hangs up. He pushes Margaret towards the car.

               INT. THE HEIGHTS - LIBRARY - NIGHT

               The noise of the wild party is heard off. Eric comes into 
               the room.

                                     ERIC
                         You want something, Cyril?

                                     KINNEAR
                         Yes, Eric. A word with you.

               EXT. DESERTED WOOD - NIGHT

               Headlights, through the thick trees, as Carter's car comes 
               bouncing over rough ground.

               INT. HIRE CAR - NIGHT

               Carter stops in a clearing and leaves his headlights on. 
               He turns to Margaret.

                                     CARTER
                         Get out.

               Carter and Margaret get out. They appear in the beam of 
               the headlights and move further into the wood.

               EXT. WOOD - NIGHT

               Carter and Margaret stop.

                                     CARTER
                         Take your clothes off.

               Margaret is confused.  Take your clothes off.  Margaret 
               does just that: coat, blouse, skin. She goes to remove her 
               knickers.

                                     CARTER
                         Keep your pants on.
                              (pause)
                         Lie down.

               Again she obeys.

               He kneels on her, pinning her arms with his knees, then 
               stuffs a gag in her mouth.

               He takes out the hypodermic, places it against her arm, 
               and injects the heroin into her. She struggles, her eyes 
               moving frantically about. She screams, but its muffled by 
               the gag.  Carter holds her down and she quickly goes under.  
               Carter removes the gag. He stands, picks her up and walks 
               into the darkness with Margaret in his arms.

               INT. THE HEIGHTS - LIBRARY - NIGHT

               Kinnear is alone, speaking on the telephone quietly. The 
               party is still going on.

                                     KINNEAR
                         I want you to listen very carefully. 
                         Jack Carter,
                              (pause)
                         You know what he looks like?

               INT. HOTEL BEDROOM - NIGHT

               A bedside light is on. A man in bed is listening on the 
               phone.

                                     MAN
                         Yes.

               He taps his cigarette against the ashtray. On his middle 
               finger is a large ring with the initial 'J' on it. He 
               listens until the line goes dead.

               The woman beside him stirs. He stubs out the cigarette and 
               switches off the light. Darkness.

               EXT. THE HEIGHTS - DAWN

               Eric comes out of the front door. Inside the party is still 
               in progress. He gets into a Cadillac and drives off.

               EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAWN

               Carter is parked where he can see the drive up to Kinnear's 
               house.

               The Cadillac appears and swings on to the road.

               There's the sound of a phone being dialled.

                                     CARTER (V.O.)
                         Police.

               EXT. THE HEIGHTS - DAWN

               A long line of police cars move slowly up the drive, 
               followed by a police bus. They park by the front door and 
               around fifty policemen pour out. They move silently around 
               the building. A chief constable opens the front door and 
               walks in.

               INT. THE HEIGHTS - DAWN

               The police move through the house and grounds. In the 
               bedrooms they find groups of people in bed together. The 
               men in particular protest and are obviously concerned about 
               being identified. The police find evidence of drugs, 
               pornography and so on.

               Outside, police are combing the grounds. In the long grass 
               leading down to the lake they find women's clothes. They 
               follow the trail until they discover a woman floating naked, 
               face downwards, in the lake. A policeman with waders goes 
               in and pulls her to the side. As others heave her out, we 
               see that it's Margaret.

               EXT. THE HEIGHTS - DAWN

               The house is surrounded by police measuring and 
               photographing, and outside the house are police cars and 
               ambulances.  The lawn is crowded with the party crowd. In 
               the early-morning light, they look like dolls.

               Kinnear comes out of the front door with two plain-clothes 
               officers and gets in a police car. Sirens going, it comes 
               down the short drive to the gate.

               INT. HIRE CAR - DAWN

               Carter is driving along a coast road. The sea and a wide 
               beach lie on his right. Long rows of houses are to his 
               left.

               The sun is still low. It's very quiet. He arrives at a 
               harbour and drives on until he reaches the end of a vast 
               wooden jetty running out into the estuary. It's a coal 
               loader for tankers.

               This jetty is very high, a complex of wooden staves and 
               pillars, interwoven with steps and gangways. On its top 
               tier is a complex of railway lines, signals and black coal 
               chutes.

               EXT. COAL JETTY - DAWN

               Carter parks his car and picks up the shotgun and a bottle 
               of Scotch off the back seat. He get out and walks over to 
               the jetty and along a lower gangway. At the far end, a man 
               is standing. It's Eric Paice. Eric turns around abruptly. 
               He sees Carter and disappears up the nearest stairway. 
               Carter follows.

               At the top he stops to listen, but can see and hear only 
               the harbour waters lapping below.

               Carter looks back to the coal jetty, just in time to see 
               Eric scamper down to the level below. Eric sprints for the 
               roadway. Carter waits and then starts running directly 
               above him.

               Eric keeps running. Carter stays always overhead. He's 
               playing cat and mouse with Eric.

                                     CARTER
                              (calling out)
                         You couldn't win an egg and spoon 
                         race, Eric.

                                     ERIC
                              (wheezing)
                         Sod off.

               Paice darts down another staircase to ground level and 
               makes for the roadway. Carter stops above the roadway. 
               Below, Paice makes for the parked car. Carter holds the 
               gun up. Eric stops and looks up.

                                     CARTER
                         Stay away from the car or I'll 
                         blow you apart.  

               Eric darts under the jetty. Carter runs on down the steps. 
               He can see Eric scampering along the row of cottages towards 
               the beach. Carter starts after him.

               EXT. BEACH - EARLY DAY

               Eric runs out on to the beach. The only sounds are his 
               feet pounding the pebbles and his hurtful panting.

               In the distance, factory chimneys belch out smoke.  Carter 
               appears. For a moment he watches Eric stumbling along at 
               the far end of the beach. He climbs down to the beach and 
               starts running.

               EXT. BEACH - EARLY DAY

               Carter is gaining on Eric rapidly. Eric looks round and 
               panics. He stumbles and falls over.

               He gets to his feet quickly and disappears round the 
               headland. Carter follows.

               EXT. BEACH - EARLY DAY

               On the other side of the headland, the scene is 
               extraordinary. The deserted beach is like the edge of the 
               world. The sand is black as far as the eye can see. It's 
               littered with rubbish. Several old lorries are sunk deep 
               in the sand. High, grass-covered cliffs flank it on the 
               left. It's deserted.

               In the distance, a continuous line of giant black buckets 
               move, like cable-cars, out to sea, before they deposit 
               their load of coal slag and move inland again. The coal 
               mine itself is inland, hidden away behind the cliffs. The 
               sea, like the sand, is black as it crashes on to the shore.  

               Eric is half-way along the beach, struggling in the mud. 
               Carter closes on him.

               EXT. BEACH - EARLY DAY

               Eric nears the line of buckets and cuts inland towards the 
               mine.  Carter has nearly caught up. The buckets grind and 
               crash as they move along the cable.

               Eric scrambles up the narrow valley down which the coal 
               slag travels. He is panting horribly. Carter is close on 
               his heels.  Near the top, where the buckets are practically 
               at ground level, Eric stumbles and falls. He is too 
               exhausted to get up.

               Carter stands over him.

                                     CARTER
                              (panting slightly)
                         Stand up, Eric. Stand up.

               Eric just manages it. Carter pulls the bottle of Scotch 
               out of his pocket.

                                     CARTER
                         I bet you could use a drink, could 
                         you, Eric?  

               He throws the bottle to Eric.

                                     CARTER
                         Eh? Have a drink.

                                     ERIC
                         Still got your sense of humour.

               Eric takes the cap off and looks at Carter. He's in a 
               terrible state.

                                     CARTER
                         Drink up, Eric. Drink up. I want 
                         you to drink all of that. Do you 
                         understand? Drink up. Just like it 
                         was with my brother, Frank. Go on, 
                         son. Drink up.

               Eric pours the whisky into his month. It spills over and 
               runs down his face.

                                     CARTER
                         Drink up, Eric.

               Eric begins to stagger about.

                                     CARTER
                         It was you who poured it down him. 
                         Eh, Eric?  

               Eric takes a breather and looks pathetically at Carter. No 
               mercy there.

                                     CARTER
                         Did you all have a good laugh, eh? 
                         Did you have a good laugh when he 
                         was spewing it up? The whisky is 
                         pouring all over Eric's face and 
                         suit.

               It's disgusting to watch. Suddenly, he retches, but nothing 
               comes up.

                                     CARTER
                         Drink it! Drink it! Did you all 
                         pass the bottle round after the 
                         car went over the top?  

               Eric is choking.

                                     CARTER
                         Don't stop, Eric.

               Carter leans forward and with his free hand lifts the bottle 
               up to Eric's mouth again. In the other, he holds the 
               shotgun.  Eric chokes and retches. Carter has seen enough. 

                                     CARTER
                         Goodbye, Eric.

               Carter raises the butt of the gun and brings it down on 
               Eric's head.

               EXT. BEACH - EARLY DAY

               Eric's body, loaded on to a a coal bucket, moves off on 
               it's final journey. Carter, laughing, walks beside it, gun 
               riding on his shoulder. The bucket shudders and grinds as 
               it moves along the cable. Eric's body moves of on its final 
               journey. It reaches the end of the line, where an automatic 
               catch tilts it. Eric's body drops into the sea. The coal 
               slag follows in a cloud of black dust. The waves pass over 
               and everything is gone.

               Carter stands for a moment, turns and walks back along the 
               beach. He stops, looks at the shotgun, and decides to get 
               rid of it.

               EXT. CLIFF TOP - EARLY MORNING

               Below, Carter moves slowly by the edge of the sea. He raises 
               the shotgun to throw it away. High on the clifftop a rifle 
               and telescopic lens line up on Carter. A finger curls around 
               the trigger. On the middle finger of the same hand is a 
               large gold ring with the letter 'J' engraved upon it. It 
               is the man Kinnear contacted after sending Eric to his 
               death. 

               The finger tightens on the trigger and pulls it. There's a 
               quiet, whooshing sound. Carter drops to the ground.

               EXT. BEACH - EARLY MORNING

               Carter lies on the beach. The waves lap around his head. A 
               small trickle of blood pours out of a hole in his temple. 
               He's dead.

               EXT. CLIFF TOP - EARLY MORNING

               Kinnear's hit man coolly dismantles his rifle. He carefully 
               wraps it in a cloth fishing-rod carrier. He walks off and 
               is soon lost as he drops out of sight.

                                                               FADE OUT:

                                                       FADE IN:

CARD OVER: SANDERSON PRISON

EXT. PRISON YARD - TITLES OVER - DAY

DOC McCOY IS BEING WALKED ACROSS THE COMPOUND BY A UNIFORMED
GUARD, carrying a riot gun. Other Prisoners around the yard
turn and stare as the two men head for the main building.

INT. PRISON CORRIDOR

DOC WALKS DOWN THE BLEAK HALLWAY: A BLACK PRISONER PASSES Doc
in the corridor, they slap hands... the Guard remains at his
shoulder. Near the end of the passage another Guard clangs
open a barred door and allows Doc and the First Guard to
enter the room where he stands sentry.

INT. HEARING ROOM - DAY

A LONG TABLE HAS BEEN SET UP AT THE HEAD OF THE ROOM, several
Prison Officials and Parol Board Members are seated facing
the length of the room.

Seated at one end of the table is an Irish looking Man;
floridly handsome and a bit overweight, his red hair is
beginning to grey. The Nameplate in front of him reads J.
BEYNON.

Doc enters the room and seats himself near two other
PRISONERS, the GUARD stands back against the wall.



                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                             2.
CONTINUED:


Another table has been set up; this one near the seated
Prisoners, for their LEGAL COUNSELS -- SEVERAL LAWYERS
examine papers before them, waiting for the hearing to begin.

A MAN at the center of the large table clears his throat,
then begins to speak.

                    CHAIRMAN
          I think we can begin... First parole
          request Carter "Doc" McCoy... is legal
          counsel present?

A MAN rises from behind the lawyers' table.

                    LAWYER
          Yes. Eugene Stewart representing Mr.
          McCoy.

                    DOC
          watching... taking it all in.

AT THE TABLE

The Man checks the papers before him.

                    CHAIRMAN
              (his voice a bored drone)
          Carter McCoy, one to five years sentence
          for armed robbery, first offense in the
          State of Texas, wanted by the State of
          Ohio for assault with a deadly weapon and
          armed robbery...

                    LAWYER
          The State of Ohio has waved jurisdiction,
          Mr. Chairman. They no longer seek Mr.
          McCoy in connection with that case.

                    CHAIRMAN
              (adjusting his papers)
          That is correct. Very well. Mr. McCoy has
          served four years of his sentence. Prison
          record satisfactory. Applied for parole
          on September 5th of this year...

The Chairman lowers the paper, looks across to the lawyer.

                    CHAIRMAN (CONT'D)
              (continuing)
          Remarks?




                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                           3.
CONTINUED:


                    LAWYER
          We would only again like to call the
          committee's attention to Mr. McCoy's
          satisfactory behavior as a prisoner.

                    CHAIRMAN
          Notice is taken.

He looks down the table at the dark-suited men.

                    CHAIRMAN (CONT'D)
              (continuing)
          The Board met in closed chambers last
          week... have you reached a decision
          regarding Mr. McCoy's request for parole?

                    DOC
          His face is taut.

AT THE TABLE

A Second MAN looks across to the Chairman.

                    SECOND MAN
              (seated near Beynon)
          Request for parole is denied. The
          prisoner may re-apply in one calendar
          year.

                    DOC
          lowers his eyes, then looks up at his

          he shuffles the papers in front of him,
          begins stuffing them into his briefcase.

AT THE TABLE THE CHAIRMAN FLIPS HIS PAPERS TO A NEW PAGE

                    CHAIRMAN
              (still totally without emotion)
          Very well. The next request for parole is
          from John Doty. Is legal counsel present?

                    VOICE (O.S.)
          Yes.

                    CHAIRMAN
          Mr. Doty is serving five to twelve years
          for embezzlement of corporate funds.

picture of an attractive woman, several battered paperbacks.

Doc continues looking at the bridge... then suddenly begins
smashing it to pieces with his right fist.

INT. PRISON - VISITING BUNGALOW - DAY

DOC IS SEATED... WAITING. CAROL enters the darkened room and
seats herself opposite Doc. They are separated by a wide
table and net of wire meshing that springs upward from mid-
point between them.

                    CAROL
              (big smile, she wants the
               moment to be an upper)
          Hello, Doc.

He simply stares back at her. Carol's finely honed features
compliment a face that at first glance is pretty,at a second
glance shows willful strength. Doc continues looking at
Carol.

                       CAROL (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry.

Doc is silent.

                    CAROL (CONT'D)
          It's been raining a lot the last few
          days.

Doc is silent.

                    CAROL (CONT'D)
          We'll try again.

                    DOC
          No way. I've got to get out now.

Get to Beynon, tell him I'm for sale. His price.

She looks at him.

                       DOC (CONT'D)
          Do it now.

She hesitates, tries to touch him through the mesh. Gets up
and leaves. Doc remains unmoving.

EXT. COUNTRY COURTHOUSE - SAN MARCOS, TEXAS - DAY

                                                             6.



CAROL MOVES TO THE BACK OF THE LARGE BTJILDING AND UP A REAR
STAIRWAY TOWARD THE OVERHEAD OFFICE.

INT. COURTHOUSE

CAROL ENTERS A LEGAL OFFICE, WEARING A SOFT BILLOWY dress.
She looks very good.

A middle aged SECRETARY looks up at Carol. A short balding
man (THE ACCOUNTANT) in his forties works at a large desk
across the room from the Secretary. He seems totally occupied
with his bookwork.

NEAR THE ACCOUNTANT THREE MEN ARE SEATED ON A DAVENPORT

They are dressed casually; by the look of them they might be
anything at all but all three have commonality; they are
professionals.

HAYHOE - Thirty years old, buck teeth and blue eyes, a bitter
ender.

CULLY - Well padded strength, large hands and wrists that pop
out of his buttoned shirtsleeves...

SWAIN - a little older and a little smarter than the other
two, his narrow features allow no warmth.

                                              AFTER A MOMENT:

SECRETARY Yes?

                    CAROL
          I want to see Jack Beynon.

The Accountant nods to the Secretary, she points Carol
towards a door leading to an inner office.

                    SECRETARY
          Go right in, Mrs. McCoy.

DOC AND CAROL - PACES, PARTS OP BODIES, EMPHASIS ON HANDS, in
bed... his hand touching the soft white skin beneath her
stomach.

BACK WITHIN THE OFFICE THE THREE MEN LOOK AFTER CAROL

                    CULLY
          Class - regular?

                    SWAIN
          No. Doc McCoy's old lady.


                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                              7.

Cully looks startled.

                    CULLY
          Jesus. Carol Ainsley?

                    SWAIN
          The very same.

                    CULLY
          The Doctor took out McGovern for her.

                    SWAIN
          She only rides winning - Class easy
          class.

                       ACCOUNTANT
          Shut up.

INT. BEYNON'S OFFICE

CAROL ENTERS.

A WOMAN'S LIPS - FLASH CUT

pressed against a man's neck. She kisses, then bites a tiny
portion of skin.

BACK TO BEYNON'S OFFICE. HE IS POURING A DRINK.

                    BEYNON
          How are you, Mrs. McCoy?

CAROL APPROACHES BEYNON'S DESK WITH A NERVOUSLY

DETERMINED STRIDE

                    CAROL
          Ready to talk about my husband, Mr.
          Beynon.

                     BEYNON
          So the good Doctor comes up again.
              (then)
          Please sit down.

                    CAROL
          He's asked me to come and see you.

Beynon looks at her... then lets their eyes meet.

                    BEYNON
              (handing her a drink)
          Why? Can I help?

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                              8.
CONTINUED:


                    CAROL
          Yes, I think you can.

A MAN'S FINGERS STARING AT THE ANKLET ON THE WOMAN'S LEG then
drawing an imaginary line upward... a woman's hand wearing a
wedding ring comes up to meet it.

INT. SANDERSON PRISON OFFICE CORRIDOR - DAY

A UNIFORMED GUARD LEADS DOC DOWN THE HALLWAY, they turn a
corner and go into a small private room, Doc is now dressed
in civilian clothes.

Doc catches sight of himself in a small mirror. He stops
looking uncertainly at the image... and then moves on with
the guard.

EXT. PRISON - DAY

DOC EXITS THE PRISON AND STANDS WAITING NEAR THE AUTO GATE.
He looks down the two-lane blacktop road that runs along the
edge of the penitentiary... Doc turns, looks again at the
prison... four years is a long time.

A dark Caddy is parked down the road.

INT. CADDY - DAY

THE ACCOUNTANT OR SWAIN SITS BEHIND THE WHEEL. He stares at
Doc. Doc crosses to him.

                    ACCOUNTANT
          Mr. Beynon will see you the day after
          tomorrow 12:30 at the River Walk.

He gestures and drives away.

                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

DOC IS STILL WAITING

He leans against a low stone wall that lines the entrance
way... The duffel bag rests beside him.

A late model Ford approaches, stops near Doc... the passenger
side door opens from the inside... Carol is driving... Doc
and Carol look at one another, their eyes holding several
moments.

INT. FORD - DAY

                                                              9.



BOTH CAROL AND DOC ARE VERY TENSE.

                     CAROL
           Hello, Doc.

                        DOC
           Hi.

                        CAROL
           You okay?

                      DOC
                (big smile)
           I'm a lot better off than I was an hour
           ago.

They look at each other for a moment. Carol leans forward...
Doc, inhibited by the closeness of the prison walls, kisses
her lightly, but with affection...

                     CAROL
           You want to drive?

                     DOC
           My license expired, let's get out of
           here.

                        CAROL
           Sure...

She starts the car, slips it into gear.

EXT. HIGHWAY

THE FORD MOVES ALONG THE DESERTED ROADSIDE, crossing the
border and passing into the State of Texas.

INT. THE FORD

DOC ALTERNATELY STARES AT THE PASSING SCENERY, THEN BACK to
Carol.

                     CAROL
           I'm sorry I was late... I got my hair
           done... the girl was slow.

                     DOC
           It looks fine.

A pause.

                        CAROL
           Feel good?

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                            10.

                    DOC
          Yeah.

                    CAROL
          Where do you want to go?

                    DOC
          I want to take a walk.

He smiles, then reaches over and gently touches a strand of
Carol's hair.

EXT. RIVER - GRASSY BANK - SERIES OP ANGLES - DAY

THEY PARK THE CAR AND EXIT. DOC MOVES A LITTLE AHEAD OF
Carol. He sits on the bank watching the kids play.

YOUNG BOYS SWING ON A ROPE THAT HANGS OVER THE PALLS

COLLEGE KIDS, SOME ARE SWIMMING, SOME STUDYING, SOME just
grooving.

AN OLDER COUPLE SIT ON THE BANK, THEIR FEET IN THE WATER

CAROL SITS DOWN NOT TOO CLOSE. DOC IS SILENT FOR LONG
moments. Carol starts to speak but doesn't. He is
preoccupied, lost in his own thoughts.

Finally he stands, looking down at her. He slowly takes off
his coat, folds it, lays it on the grass, then turns and
starts walking towards a tree.

Suddenly he takes off his shoes, breaks into a run and dives
for the rope.

CAROL IS ALREADY ON HER FEET, HER SWEATER OFF, SHOES kicked
aside, she runs after him and hits the water with an awkward
splash. She is a brief second behind him.

THEY COME UP TOGETHER, AND HE LAUGHS WITH THE PURE JOY of
being free and alive. She joins him, in his laughter and with
their arms around each other, they turn as they are swept
down stream.

INT. EL OSO CONDOMINIUM - NIGHT

THROUGH AN OPEN WINDOW A PORTION OF THE EXTERIOR BUILDING CAN
BE SEEN... The interior is cozy and Carol. Carol has lived
here almost two years. On the wall there is a poster (which
will be on the wall of every room that they stay in from now
on).



                                                    (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


Around the room are drying clothes. Carol is ironing with a
steam iron.

Doc is sitting at a table with a Colt .45 in front of him and
a .32 automatic. He is field stripping. There is a bowl of
peaches on the table.

                    DOC
              (pointing to the poster)
          It doesn't look like that.

                    CAROL
          What do you mean? You've never been
          there.

                    DOC
          I've been there every day for the last
          four years.

She crosses to him and gives him a hug, then returns to her
ironing.

                    DOC (CONT'D)
          What's Beynon got set up?

                    CAROL
          Small town, small bank, big money.

She holds up some 11 by 14 photographs in front of him.

                    DOC
          Where did you get those?

                    CAROL
          I've been doing my homework.

                    DOC
          Just like old times?

                    CAROL
          Better than old times.

                    DOC
          I hope so. I am not looking forward to
          another stretch.

                    CAROL
          I made a mistake. I'll never make another
          one.

                    DOC
              (after a moment)
          Where did you get them developed?

          Good.

RAFTER A MOMENT)

How much is the score?

                    CAROL
          Half a million.

                    DOC
          That Beynon's got a long arm.

                    CAROL
              (after a moment)
          What do you want for dinner?

                    DOC
          Whisky and a peach.

She laughs softly, and goes to a cupboard and takes out four
bottles of whisky, four glasses and a bowl of ice. Doc smiles
at her and begins sampling.

                    CAROL
              (as Doc eats a peach with a
               sharp knife)
          How does it taste?

                    DOC
          Just the way I remembered.

Doc reaches across the table and touches her hand gently.

          You been okay?

                    CAROL
          Pretty good... Made a quick trip to
          Oregon, saw my brother and the kids.
          Figured it would be my last chance,
          unless they wanted to travel.

          That's not all of it.

                    CAROL
          No. It's been a long time.

A pause. He continues stroking her arm.

                    DOC
          You go out much?

                    CAROL
          After four years and now the question
          comes up.

                    DOC
          Couldn't handle it then. Now I can.

                    CAROL
              (with warmth and a smile)
          I'm still here, Doc.

He stands, kisses her gently. She stands and they move toward
the stairs.

INT. BEDROOM

THEY ENTER THE BEDROOM AND SIT SIDE BY SIDE ON THE DOUBLE
bed. They both sit rigidly. Doc's eyes are on Carol, she
stares vacantly expectant.

Doc begins to unbutton her blouse, it comes undone with
agonizing slowness... Carol pulls her shoulders back helping
Doc drop the garment down to her waist.

Doc hesitates, then carefully touches her shoulder... her
hair... he kisses her... Doc gently eases himself away from
Carol.

                    DOC
              (he is very tight)
          Oh Christ...

He again moves close... Doc reaches around to unsnap her bra
as Carol places both of her arms around him, holding him
tightly...

CONTINUED:

Doc unsnaps the top fastener, the second one catches, remains
unyielding... He closes his eyes for a second... The pressure
of the moment is again too intense for Doc. Once more he
pulls gently away from her. Carol looks at him, her eyes very
reassuring.

                    DOC (CONT'D)
              (continuing)
          I guess I'm kind of...

          It's just been a while.

                    CAROL
          We've got time. We've got a lot of time.
          I can help you.

She stands, begins to remove her skirt.

          Wait... give me a minute.

                    CAROL
          Sure.

She sits beside him again, takes his hand in hers...

          I'll be okay.

                    CAROL

They look at one another. A pause. He kisses her; their
embrace pulls them back across the bed.

              (continuing)
          Let me make you feel good, Doctor.

But she has little chance as he begins to make love to her.

Pedal boats cut through the water in the background.

          clock-face on the bomb against his
          wristwatch... with a quick, dexterous
          movement, he places a bomb into the two
          large grocery bags at his feet. After
          burying the explosives within each sack,
          he covers the bombs with crumpled
          wastepaper.

             The grocery bags are then gently shoved
             forward, resting against the wheel well
             of the truck.

As Doc looks at Carol...

INT. A '65 BUICK - RUDY

PARKED ALONG A SECLUDED PATHWAY, facing the highway which
lies a quarter of a mile away.

He has on a trench coat buttoned to the neck and his sailor's
watch cap... he stares at the highway.

THE PANEL TRUCK SLIDES BY...

EXT. HIGHWAY

A FULLY-LOADED HAY TRUCK RUMBLES DOWN THE ROAD .

INT. CAB - HAY TRUCK

JACKSON IS DRIVING, HE WEARS A DARK RAINCOAT AND WATCH CAP.

INT. BUICK

RUDY CHECKS HIS PISTOL. He shoves the pistol into the side
pocket of his raincoat. Rudy starts the engine... then slides
the car into gear...

EXT. MAIN STREET - BEACON CITY, TEXAS - DAY

A sleepy, traditional municipality...

A DAPPER GENTLEMAN IN HIS EARLY FIFTIES WALKS ALONG THE
SIDEWALK. He is the PRESIDENT of the First Bank of Beacon
City -- nodding to a few passersby, he stops at the front
door of the bank, knocks twice. A BANK GUARD opens the door
and the Bank President moves inside.

VISIBLE ON THE GLASS DOOR

sign that reads:

FIRST BANK OF BEACON CITY

Founded 1911 Hours: 9:00 AM to 2:00 PM Weekdays Only

INT. THE BANK

THE PRESIDENT SNAPS ON A BANK OF IRRIDESCENT LIGHTS. Several
TELLERS have begun setting up for the day's commerce...

                                                            27.



INT. PANEL TRUCK

DOC SHIFTS HIS POSITION SLIGHTLY, THEN   PULLS HIS .45 OUT from
beneath his jacket. Doc breaks out the   clip, examines it,
snaps it back to position. He replaces   the gun under his
jacket -- the gesture seemingly more a   mannerism than a
precaution.

A huge pair of tongs and the massive wire cutters rest on the
floor of the truck near Doc, along with a black leather
suitcase.

CAROL IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT, Beacon City appears on the
horizon through the windshield...

INT. BANK

THE PRESIDENT BEGINS TURNING THE COMBINATION on the massive
door as the vault begins to open...

RUDY - IN THE BUICK - DRIVING DOWN THE ROADWAY near the
outskirts of town. A Texas Highway Patrol car passes, moving
in the opposite direction...

JACKSON - IN THE HAY TRUCK - PULLS ON A PAIR OF BLACK GLOVES,
then checks his watch.

A WATCH FACE SHOWS THE TIME AT 8:56.

THE WATCH BELONGS TO DOC. He looks expectantly towards Carol.

THE PANEL TRUCK is now within the commercial district of
Beacon City. Rudy's Buick is visible a hundred yards behind.

THE HAY TRUCK drives off Main Street and into an open field
near a corner of the town.

Jackson jumps down out of the cab of the truck and crosses to
the sidewalk.

Rudy's Buick pulls over and Jackson gets into the passenger
seat. The Buick then cruises back out onto Main Street...

CAROL - IN THE VAN - APPROACHES AN INTERSECTION. Through the
truck's window a traffic signal appears.

RUDY PULLS THE BUICK OFF THE MAIN DRAG and onto a side
street. Another turn and he again moves parallel to the Main
Street...

                                                           28.



INT. BANK

THE BANK PRESIDENT LEAVES THE VAULT, allowing the heavy door
to stand open.

A LATTICE-WORK BARRIER made of wrought-iron is pulled across
the vault opening... the Bank President snaps the latch-lock
closed.

CAROL - IN THE PANEL TRUCK. She pulls the van carefully to a
stop at the intersection as the stoplight blinks red... She
turns her eyes back to Doc...

DOC, CATCHES HER LOOK, then instantly springs into action. He
reaches down, pulls a hatch-like cover up from the floor of
the truck, revealing the road below... a portion of a manhole
cover is visible.

                      DOC
                (barking the words)
            Two feet forward...

CAROL ROLLS THE TRUCK SLIGHTLY FORWARD

ON THE STREET - SEVERAL CARS can be seen moving up behind the
panel truck.

DOC GRABS THE TONGS, inserts the ends into the manhole cover
notches. He lifts the tongs and slides the manhole cover
forward. Doc drops down through the truck hatchway and into
open manhole, carrying the huge cutters with him. As he
disappears from sight...

98 RUDY DRIVING ON THE SIDE AVENUE, still moving parallel 98
to Main Street. The Buick is now geographically well forward
of the panel truck. Jackson stares at his watch.

                      JACKSON
            Now!

Rudy makes a sharp left. The car accelerates, its wheels
begin to quietly whine.

Main Street comes back into view...

CAROL WATCHING THE SIGNAL... still red...

A MAN IN A PONTIAC eases to a stop behind the panel truck. He
watches the signal.

DOC STANDING IN THE SEWER PIPE. He turns on a flashlight,
moves ahead. His feet slosh through the six-inch-high murky
water.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                             29.
CONTINUED:

Doc shines the light on several ankle-thick conduit lines
that run along the sewer wall... He moves down the dark oval
corridor...

EXT. THE BANK

THE GUARD OPENS THE FRONT DOOR, allowing the morning PATRONS
to enter.

INT. THE BANK

THE PRESIDENT SMILES UPON SEEING THE CUSTOMERS. He looks over
to the wood-frame clock on the far wall.

THE CLOCK READS 9:00 EXACTLY

RUDY - IN THE BUICK - MAKES ANOTHER LEFT TURN, now back onto
Main Street.

THE BANK APPEARS A HALF-BLOCK AWAY through the car window.
Rudy and Jackson pull their watch caps down over their faces;
the holes cut into the caps are wide enough to recognize a
disparity between their features...

MAIN STREET - THE TRAFFIC SIGNAL has now blinked to green.

CAROL IS GRINDING AWAY AT THE DEAD ENGINE of the panel
truck...

THE MAN IN THE PONTIAC leans on his HORN... other cars behind
him begin to HONK.

CAROL LEANS OUT OF THE CAB OF THE PANEL TRUCK and gestures
for the cars to pass her. She again GRINDS away at the
engine.

DOC'S WATCH - SHOWING 9:01.

DOC STANDS AT A MASSIVE CONNECTING BOX where four 112 strands
of the conduit intersect. He puts the wire cutters to the
first conduit, grasps the insulated handles and with a
crunching POP, he cuts through the conduit with one bite. Doc
immediately starts on the next strand.

CAROL - ON MAIN STREET - trying to start the engine.

THE BUICK SLAMS TO A STOP IN FRONT OF THE BANK. Rudy Il4 and
Jackson pull open the car doors.

DOC CUTTING THE LAST AND LARGEST CONDUIT.

                                                             30.



INT. THE BANK

THE BANK GUARD is placing a local high school basketball
schedule and display into position.

SEVERAL PATRONS have formed small lines and are transacting
business with the Tellers.

The wall clock shows the time at 9:02.

RUDY AND JACKSON BURST THROUGH THE GLASS DOOR. They stand
shoulder to shoulder, guns extended the full length of their
arms. Beneath the mask Rudy's smile is visible.

THE BANK GUARD LOOKS UP PROM THE BASKETBALL DISPLAY. His eyes
widen... both guns are leveled directly at him...
simultaneously the lights go out...

THE BANK PRESIDENT DESPERATELY PUSHES THE ALARM BUTTON near
his desk. (INSERT: Button and bell.) Nothing happens.

CAROL - ON MAIN STREET - trying to start the engine.

INT. A DENTIST'S OFFICE

THE D.D.S. TORTURES A BALDING PATIENT with a drill. The
PATIENT groans, lifts one leg in the air from the pain.

When the power goes, the Dentist quizzically raises the drill
and examines it. The Patient pants in relief.

                    DENTIST
          Superior technology, my ass.

AN ELECTRIC WEATHER/TIME INDICATOR - above the town square...
as the bulbs dim...

DOC RUNNING DOWN THE SEWER; stopping at the manhole he
scrambles up the permanent ladderway, tossing his wire
cutters up into the truck parked over him.

CAROL - IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT - again she tries to start the
engine.

DOC PULLING HIMSELF BACK UP INTO THE VAN with a gymnastic
thrust he quickly slides the manhole cover with the tongs.

CAROL - the engine still won't start.

DOC DROPS THE HATCH DOOR back down into place on the floor of
the truck...



                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                             31.

                       DOC
                 (snapping his look to Carol)
             Okay.

CAROL TURNS THE IGNITION SWITCH BACK ON...

CAROL - AS THE ENGINE ROARS TO LIFE she engages the
gearshift. The truck begins to move forward. Suddenly, the
motor does STALL.

DOC'S PACE TIGHTENS. The cars behind the van continue
HONKING.

CAROL - AGAIN GRINDING AWAY AT THE ENGINE. Her lips are
compressed into a thin line... After a moment... the motor
catches, the truck again moves forward.

DOC PICKS UP THE LARGE BLACK SUITCASE from the floor of the
panel truck, then begins to move toward the cab and Carol.

THE PANEL TRUCK WHIPS OFF MAIN STREET and onto a side avenue.
Carol pulls the van up to the curbway, jerking to a stop.

DOC IS NOW IN THE FRONT SEAT BESIDE CAROL. He pulls the truck
door open, then hesitates. He touches her arm, their eyes
meet briefly, both their faces warming for a moment. Doc
gives her a casual wink then quietly exits the truck.

ON THE SIDEWALK

DOC TURNS AND BEGINS WALKING toward an open alleyway. Behind
him the panel truck pulls smoothly away.

WALKING UP THE ALLEY - DOC PULLS ON A PAIR OF BLACK GLOVES.
He turns again, now moving down a totallydeserted side alley.

The alley opens at one end onto a back street; the opposite
end is bounded by a large brick building. Doc removes his
pistol from his coat pocket, then approaches a doorway along
the side of the brick building. At the last moment he pulls
down the watch cap mask.

INT. BANK

RUDY DISENGAGES THE LATCH on the side door.

EXT. ALLEY

DOC KICKS THE DOOR OPEN with a violent jerk of his leg.

                                                            32.



INT. THE BANK

RUDY'S GUN IS TRAINED PROM THE BACK OF THE BUILDING over the
Tellers and Patrons, spread-eagled across the floor. Their
heads are down; several of them are trembling.

DOC STANDS HOLDING THE .45 IN ONE HAND, suitcase in the
other. He moves into the building, shutting the door behind
him.

RUDY IS NOW STATIONED NEAR THE FRONT DOOR, ready to intercept
any incoming bank patrons -- he covers the room from the end
opposite Jackson.

Rudy stands near the Bank Guard's outstretched right hand --
The Guard's head is bloodied from Rudy's pistol whipping. His
gun has been kicked against the wall. A short distance away
Rudy is watching.

THE BANK PRESIDENT lies face down on the floor, directly
under the arc of Jackson's gun... who is continually turning
to watch the Guard.

DOC QUICKLY CROSSES THE DISTANCE between the side door and
the vault, passing the Bank President. He slips the .45 into
his jacket side pocket, sets down the suitcase, then either
cuts the lock or picks it.

                    RUDY
              (looking at his watch)
          19 seconds.

CAROL - IN THE VAN - She has stopped the panel truck near the
deserted lot where the hay truck is parked.

She drops the bomb-laden grocery bag inside the truckbed. She
moves back towards the van...

IN THE BANK

DOC FINISHES,, RIPS THE DOOR OPEN, lifts the suitcase and
moves into the vault.

RUDY LOOKS AT THE BLOODIED GUARD, notes the distance
separating the man from his gun. Though unconscious, the
Guard's head begins to move.

JACKSON HOLDS HIS GUN HAND FULLY EXTENDED. Again he takes a
brief moment to glance nervously over to the open vault and
at the Guard.

ANGLES AND INSERTS - THE VAULT is lined with safety deposit
boxes and large cabinet drawers.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                             33.
CONTINUED:


A metal table stands off-center, the black suitcase resting
on its surface. Doc opens the satchel. He then pulls open one
of the cabinet drawers nearby and begins tossing banded money
pads into the open suitcase.

THE BANK PRESIDENT LIES NEAR THE OPEN VAULT. He listens to
the SOUNDS of Doc at work. He slightly cranes his neck,
trying to get a look at the thief inside the vault.

RUDY WATCHING THE FRONT DOOR. A PATRON enters; Rudy gestures
with the gun... she hits the deck.

JACKSON IS GETTING MORE NERVOUS by the minute...

DOC continues working within the vault.

THE WOMAN, now on the floor, quietly crying.

JACKSON watching the Guard.

RUDY watching Jackson. Calling out time.

THE BANK GUARD, glassy-eyed, but conscious; he has the look
of a prizefighter who has just suffered a knockout, but is
ready for one more round.

THE BANK PRESIDENT in his prone position. He looks at
Jackson, then to the vault.

THE PANEL TRUCK - now at the other end of Main Street.

CAROL EXITS THE VAN, carries the second sack to a large
rubbish bin in front of an empty store. She deposits the
grocery bag...

DOC WORKING. The suitcase is now filled. He snaps the
fasteners shut .

DOC EXITS THE VAULT after withdrawing his .45 from his coat
pocket .

JACKSON SEES DOC LEAVE THE VAULT. He edges around the side of
the tellers' cages toward the front of the bank.

DOC MOVES TOWARDS JACKSON'S OLD VANTAGE POINT NEAR THE SIDE
DOOR. He passes the bank president.

RUDY NOW WATCHES DOC

DOC CARRIES THE HEAVY SUITCASE IN HIS LEFT HAND. He gestures
to Rudy and Jackson with his pistol while moving towards the
side door.


                                                   (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


JACKSON HALF RUNS PASSING RUDY ON HIS WAY TO THE FRONT
ENTRANCE still watching the Bank Guard.

THE BANK GUARD STILL PUNCH DRUNK PULLS HIMSELF UP TO HIS
HANDS and knees... the Guard looks at his pistol.

DOC STOPS AT THE KICKED IN SIDE DOOR. HE COVERS THE ENTIRE
bank with his gun.

THE BANK GUARD BEGINS TO CRAWL WITH AGONIZING SLOWNESS
towards his pistol.

RUDY EYES STILL ON DOC

JACKSON NOW AT THE FRONT DOOR IS PARALYZED WATCHING THE
GUARD.

DOC GESTURES TO RUDY AND JACKSON TO GET MOVING.

EXT. STREET - DAY

CAROL PARKS THE VAN, CROSSES TO A FORD, GETS IN, DRIVES AWAY.

INT. BANK

THE GUARD HAS MORE THAN HALF CLOSED THE DISTANCE TO THE .38.

JACKSON LEVELS HIS .44.

DOC AND RUDY. BOTH SEE WHAT IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN.

                      DOC
                (shouts)
            Just pick it up.

                      RUDY
            Don't!

JACKSON PULLS THE TRIGGER THREE TIMES.

THE BANK GUARD'S BODY turns end-over-end from Jackson's
bullets. Some of the bank Patrons SCREAM, others SOB with
fright.

DOC - His eyes are furious.

RUDY AND JACKSON - Rudy shoves Jackson out the front door.

DOC COVERS THEIR EXIT, then slips out the side door and into
the alley.

                                                             35.



EXT. MAIN STREET

RUDY GUNS THE BUICK FORWARD, the wheels tearing at the
asphalt. Jackson's shoulders rock back as the big car
accelerates.

                    THE ALLEY
          DOC, GUN AND SUITCASE IN HAND, nears the
          end of the alleyway.

CAROL - IN A FORD - suddenly pulls up, filling the roadway
opening.

DOC TOSSES THE SUITCASE into the back of the car... then
slides the pistol under his coat and slips behind the wheel
as Carol slides over to the passenger seat.

INT. THE FORD

DOC PULLS OFF THE WATCH CAP MASK; his face taut.

THE FORD SMOKES OFF as Doc kicks it into gear...

MAIN STREET BEACON CITY A SERIES OF ANGLES

THE BUICK STREAKS DOWN THE CENTER OF THE ROADWAY... Two bombs
detonate into fireballs... The Hay truck blazes upward, bales
instantly igniting.

The grange at the opposite end of town becomes an orange-
flame inferno...

Traffic stalls on the boulevard; Drivers and Pedestrians gawk
at the twin blazes.

RUDY ZIG ZAGS THE BUICK ALONG. Maneuvering through the
stopped traffic.

DOC SLIDES THE FORD THROUGH A RIGHT AND LEFT TURN, emerging
onto smoke-covered Main Street.

The speeding Ford avoids a halting car, then suddenly spins
out of control, jumps across the sidewalk, splinters a wood
bench, and finally slides in a complete circle across the
grass of a small park.

INT. FORD '

DOC LOOKS MORE THAN A LITTLE EMBARRASSED AS CAROL STARES

AT him.

POLICE CARS ROAR BY THEM.

                                                           36.



EXT. SMALL PARK

DOC ZIPS THE CAR OFF THE GRASS AND BACK ONTO THE TRAFFIC
CLOGGED ROADWAY.

RUDY DRIVING THROUGH THE BEDLAM. Suddenly a gun appears in
his right hand, aimed at Jackson. The pistol roars bucks,
roars, bucks again. Jackson is shot through the head twice.

THE FORD IS SEVERAL BLOCKS BEHIND RUDY. DOC DOWNSHIFTS
avoiding stalled cars. Carol grasps at both the seat and the
dashboard handholds to maintain her balance.

THE BUICK EMERGES THROUGH DENSE PLUMES OF SMOKE. Fire licks
along the one edge of the sidewalk.

RUDY IN THE BUICK HAS NOW ALMOST CLEARED THE TOWN. He tears
along the highway... sweating a little but becoming cool. He
is a pro. His watch cap is now removed.

ON THE CURVE - Jackson's body is kicked out of the automobile
and bounces across the pavement.

DOC IN THE FORD POWERS ALONG. He approaches the flaming
building, then hits the brakes as ...

A BIG DIESEL TRUCK AND TRAILER is coming in the opposite
direct ion,, jack-knifes across the road, desperately trying
to avoid the cars stopped in the middle of the street .

DOC, AS THE TRUCK AND TRAILER SUDDENLY APPEAR THROUGH the
smoke in front of him, throws the car broadside into a four
wheel drift. Now sideways, then straight, he bumps across the
sidewalk, over a patio of a house, knocking down two pillars,
through a parking lot, taking with it a large cleaners sign,
then bores back onto the road.

RUDY IN THE BUICK STROKING ALONG THE OPEN HIGHWAY. Looks in
the rear view mirror.

RUDY'S POV - THROUGH THE BUICK'S REAR WINDOW, BLACK smoke is
visible billowing skyward.

DOC AND CAROL IN THE FORD NOW DRIVING CALMLY THROUGH the
countryside. A police car with light turning and siren
wailing passes them, heading for the conflagration in Beacon
City. Doc's eyes follow the Patrol Car until it disappears
from sight.

THE BUICK - SERIES OF ANGLES - IT pulls off the highway and
bumps down a dirt road. Rudy strains to hold the big car on
the rutted pathway.


                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                             37.
CONTINUED:


The dirt road becomes a lane.

A farm house and barn appear at a clearing. Rudy powers the
car up a fairly steep hill, the crest of which is occupied by
a seemingly abandoned and dilapidated house barn.

RUDY JUMPS OUT OF THE BUICK, trots to the front of the barn
and pulls the double-doors open. A station wagon with wooden-
panel or the usual painted panel sides can be seen within...

THE FORD SWEEPS OFF THE HIGHWAY and onto the dirt road.

WITHIN THE FORD - DOC IS DRIVING. Carol peels off her
sweater. She has worn a faded blouse underneath... She pulls
a ribbon; her hair falls changing her appearance.

RUDY - IN THE BARN - The Buick is now parked near the Station
Wagon. Standing in the shadows, he intently reloads his gun,
then moves towards the large doors of the barn.

CAROL - IN THE PASSENGER SEAT OF THE FORD - she watches as
Doc drives up the lane...

RUDY stands outside the barn as the car approaches.

DOC STUDIES RUDY THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD, watching him wipe
his face with a soiled rag as the car pulls closer...

INT. BARN

DOC PULLS THE FORD TO A STOP just within the double doors. He
passes Rudy, leaving a clear exit pathway for the getaway
station wagon.

DOC JUMPS OUT OF THE FORD AS SOON AS the ignition switch is
cut; Carol a beat behind him on the opposite side.

Rudy moves into the archway created by the barn's open doors.
He stands almost in silhouette as the bright sunlight breaks
around him.

Doc snaps open the door of the car, his back turned to Rudy.
He reaches into the back seat and grasps the black suitcase,
not by the middle handle but by each end, as if it contained
a great weight.

                      DOC
                (speaking over his shoulder,
                 not looking at Rudy)
            Where's Jackson?

Rudy withdraws the pistol from under his raincoat.


                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                             38.
CONTINUED:


                    RUDY
              (pointing his gun lazily at
               Doc, supremely confident)
          He didn't make it, Doc... you didn't
          either.

Doc straightens, still holding the suitcase. He starts to
turn to Rudy, eyes wide, helpless. Carol fumbles for the gun
in her purse.

Rudy extends his arm, ready to begin the execution. Doc
swings the suitcase around slowly, seemingly ready to face
Rudy's bullets... then he shoots Rudy in the middle of the
chest, Doc's .45 slug driving him backward.

Doc has concealed the pistol in his hand with the satchel. He
drops the suitcase with his first shot, FIRES again, blasting
Rudy in the middle. Two large holes now show at the chest of
Rudy's raincoat.

Rudy is knocked back over the hillock, tumbling down the
precipice and into a grassy meadow below. Doc stands at the
crest of the hill. He looks down as Rudy's body stops
turning. Doc shifts the .45 to his right hand.

Rudy's body lies still.

DOC TURNS QUICKLY AWAY PROM THE HILLTOP, not giving Rudy's
body a second glance. Carol, gun in hand, stands outside the
barn, transfixed.

                    CAROL
          How did you know?

Doc doesn't answer, motioning her into the car... the getaway
car... as she starts to change clothes... he reloads. Doc
takes a long look at Carol.

THEY GET IN THE CAR AND LEAVE.

EXT. BOTTOM OP HILL - DAY

CAROL IS DRIVING., tooling comfortably along a country road.
Doc is beside her, the suitcase resting in the back seat.
After several moments of silence:

                    CAROL
          What about the bank?

                    DOC
              (after a moment)
          Jackson panicked and nailed the guard.


                                                   (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


Carol takes a deep breath,, then turns her look at the side
window.

                    CAROL
          Oh, Christ.

Doc leans forward., snaps on the radio.

EXT. ABANDONED FARM - DAY

RUDY BUTLER STUMBLES BACK OVER THE CREST OP THE HILLOCK and
onto the pathway in front of the barn. His figure is slightly
grotesque; the raincoat shows two holes from Doc's .45 slugs,
along with considerable dirt and grass stains picked up on
his ass-over-tea kettle trip to the bottom of the hill. He is
obviously in some pain, his walk is a half-lurch.

EXT. SIDE OF THE BARN - DAY

RUDY TURNS ON A RUSTED TAP which sends all-pocketed water
gurgling down into a mold-covered trough. Rudy pulls off the
yellow raincoat, revealing the fact he has worn one of the
padded bullet-proof vests. Rudy undoes the vest, lets it fall
to his feet. A huge crimson stain shows at his collarbone.

RUDY TOUCHES THE BLOOD WITH HIS RIGHT HAND, then looks at his
hand. Breathing heavily he kneels down and begins to splash
the purling water across his face and then he laughs.

INT. STATION WAGON - DAY

DIALOGUE COMES ON THE RADIO DESCRIBING THE ROBBERY. $750,000
stolen.

                    DOC
          We got between four and five.

Carol starts to open the bag and count.

Doc flicks off the radio then cracks open the windwing. Doc
reflectively studies the roadside ahead. They are heading
along a comfortable tree and meadowlined thoroughfare that
carries only a sparse amount of traffic.

Doc's eyes suddenly narrow on the road ahead.

                    CAROL
              (now noticing the road)
          Doc...

ON THE ROAD AHEAD HIGHWAY PATROLMEN HAVE FORMED a traffic
barricade. Several cars and trucks are being waved through
the check-point. Wearing sunglasses and Stetson hats, the
Uniformed officers make a cursory glance into each passing
vehicle.

DOC ANALYZES THE SITUATION WITHOUT CHANGING EXPRESSION He
slips the station wagon up behind a pickup truck in the line
of slowly-passing vehicles.

She turns, starts to reach into the back. Doc gently catches
her arm, preventing her from moving further.

                    DOC (CONT'D)
          They're looking for three men...
          remember?

A YOUNG OFFICER looks into the cab of the pickup, then
glances at the empty flatbed. Another PATROLMAN flanks the
other side of the truck, repeating the procedure. Several
Patrol Cars, fully loaded with additional OFFICERS, are
parked nearby. The pickup truck is waved through. The station
wagon rolls up to the check-point.

DOC ROLLS DOWN HIS WINDOW. He smiles and nods to the Young
Patrolman.

                    DOC (CONT'D)
              (big smile)
          What's the problem?

CAROL STUDIES THE OFFICER on her side of the car through the
closed window... the Officer peers back at her then into the
rear seat.

THE STATION WAGON is waved ahead without a second glance by
the Patrolman; Doc accelerates away from the roadblock...
After a moment, Doc leans forward, snapping on the radio.

EXT. THE FARM - RUDY - DAY

Inside the barn, behind the wheel of the panel truck, Rudy's
matted black hair is in contrast to his blanched face. He
starts the engine, painfully bringing it to a ROAR. The panel
truck leaps crazily forward, careening across the barn floor,
SMASHING through the edge of the wooden doors as it bursts
out into the sunlight.

EXT. SMALL TOWN - DAY

The station wagon rolls down the main street and stops near
an outdoor phone booth at a filling station.

The wagon continues moving down the road.

EXT. A NARROW DIRT ROAD - LATE AFTERNOON

TWO HOURS BEFORE SUNSET. A CHILL SOUTHWEST WIND is blowing.
The station wagon appears, moving slowly down the roadway,
bouncing along its rutted surface.

AT A SMALL INTERSECTION TWO MAIL BOXES STAND CLOSE to one
another. The name Beynon is printed in black paint on one of
the letter bins. Doc stops the wagon momentarily, looks at
the box, then turns down the indicated road.

EXT. THE STATION WAGON - LATE AFTERNOON

THE STATION WAGON clears the crest of a sage brush hill and
passes camera.

INT. STATION WAGON - LATE AFTERNOON

DOC PARKS THE WAGON UNDER A GNARLED COTTONWOOD TREE in front
of the house. As he shuts off the engine, he pulls the .45
out of his coat pocket and shoves it into his waistband.
Carol watches the gesture. Doc starts to open the car door,
then hesitates.

                    DOC
          You can wait here... I'll wrap it up
          fast.

DOC STEPS OUT OF THE WAGON, then pulls the leather suitcase
out of the back. He quietly shuts the car door and moves
around the side of the house, toward the barn/garage at the
rear.

HE LOOKS CAREFULLY around the area, his eyes searching for
signs of Beynon's men. Nothing seemingly amiss, he moves
toward the front door, tries it, moves away.

Doc crosses to the back screen door of the house. After
another moment, Doc quietly opens the screen door and enters
the house.

INT. HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

DOC MOVES THROUGH THE SERVICE PORCH/PANTRY and into the
kitchen.

                                                          44.



INT. KITCHEN - BEYNON - LATE AFTERNOON/NIGHT

BEYNON SITS AT THE LONG KITCHEN TABLE] head on hand, eyes
slightly glared... on the checkered oilcloth in front of him
is a quart bottle of Jim Beam, now half full. He's drinking
the sour mash straight with a water chaser.

DOC LOOKS STEADILY AT BEYNON for a moment,, sets the suitcase
down on the floor, then crosses to the sink, picks up a glass
and sits down at the table. Doc pours himself a drink, takes
a sip.

                    BEYNON
          Hello, McCoy.

              (swishing the drink)
          News said two persons killed.

Except for a faint thickness of speech, Beynon seems quite
sober. Beynon wears a .38 Detective Special C.T.G. in a worn
leather belly holster.

Doc looks at Beynon, notes his gun, then continues stacking
the money.

          What about your wife?

          No way. I always do my own work.

Beynon smiles and slops three fingers of whiskey into Doc's
glass.

                    BEYNON
          Here. I understand the way you feel. As a
          matter of fact, you and I might share a
          great many feelings...

Beynon drinks from his glass. Doc continues counting the
money.

              (snaps the words)
          I'm in a hurry.

          operator you are.

                    DOC
          No applause!

Beynon pauses a moment. Doc looks steadily across the table
into BeynonTs eyes. Prom beyond there might be the quiet
sound of a screen door opening. Beynon gets out of the chair,
stands beside the table.

          robber serving a long sentence in prison.
          Three, a man with political influence, a
          man who can easily get a parole for a
          convict... why should he?

Beynon sips his glass slowly. Doc's hand edges down toward
his waist band.

                    BEYNON (CONT'D)
              (continuing)
          A simple reason, McCoy. The obvious

          strings I pulled.

          I bet.

Doc senses a movement from the shadows behind Beynon. Turning
his head slightly, Doc can see Carol standing at the entrance
to the kitchen. She holds a .32 automatic... the pistol seems
to be pointed directly at Doc.

                    BEYNON
          You wouldn't have come here when you were
          eight3 Mr. McCoy.

As the gun continues to be pointed directly at Doc.

                    BEYNON (CONT'D)
              (continuing)
          Don't think too badly of her... After

              (riding over Beynon's words)
          Get it over with...

CAROL FIRES the automatic. The big gun belches the full slip
in a stuttering EXPLOSION... the slide remains back and in an
ejected position.

BEYNON is driven back to the kitchen wall. He SHRIEKS aloud,
the noise strangely like laughter... his body flattens
against the surface, slips downward^ riddled by the big bore
slugs... Doc stands momentarily frozen against the overturned
table. He looks up from Beynon's crumpled body. Carol takes
two steps forward, then drops the automatic, sending it
clattering and spinning away across the floor.

DOC looks at Carol, their eyes find each other. He turns,
moves to the sink, splashes water across his face, then fills
a glass of water from the tap ... drinks it; he looks back at
her.

CAROL stands watching Doc, tears scream down her cheeks.

DOC crosses to Carol, takes her arm, picks up the gun, spent
shells and the suitcase, then leads her out of the kitchen
toward the back door. Beynon's body has slipped from sight,
only a few traces of blood show along the white wall.

                                                             48.

them into a trash bin without missing a stride.

INT. TRAIN STATION - MORNING

CAROL IS STANDING IN A TICKET LINE THAT MOVES slowly foward.
She struggles, clutching the heavy, money laden suitcase and
her oversize purse between both arms. The line of ticket
buyers moves forward .just fast enough to make it impractical
to set the suitcase down. The station is ancient, vaultlike.
Baggage lockers line the perimeter of the lobby and extend
off into clumped rows within the wings of the station.

CAROL APPROACHES THE TICKET WINDOW. She places the suitcase
flush against the base of the counter and holds it tightly in
place with one leg. Carol pops open her purse... a clumsy
item in itself... as she lifts her wallet and the elderly
ticket-seller looks across to her.

                    CAROL
          Two day coach tickets -- on the Flyer.

                    TICKET-SELLER
          Thirty-four fifty-six with tax leaves in
          forty-five minutes, gate three.

Carol pays the tariff, places the tickets into her purse
along with the change. Wearily, she labors the satchel back
into her hand, then turns and begins to slowly walk down the
seemingly acres-wide station promenade.

NEAR A PORTICO WITHIN THE MAIN LOBBY, Carol sits
uncomfortably on a shiny wooden bench -- the suitcase rests
on the floor pressed tightly between her ankles. She glances
across the promenade walls, her eyes finding:

A CLOCK READING: 9:40

ON A LOBBY BENCH - LATER

CAROL STARES ACROSS THE ROOM at the scattering of passengers
waiting on the wooden seats opposite from her.

Carol's nervous boredom increases; she looks down at her lap,
pretends to find something wrong with her nails and begins
rubbing the cuticles. Carol finally rises impulsively from
the bench, immediately reaching for the brown leather
satchel.

CAROL WALKS BACK DOWN THE PROMENADE while carrying   the
suitcase. As other baggage-laden passengers scurry   around

in that direction.

approaches, an elderly WOMAN deposits a coin in one of the
numbered lockers, opens the metal door and places a small
suitcase inside. Closing and re-locking the door, the Woman
quickly moves away. Having noted the woman and more than
tired of hauling her burden around the station, Carol steps
to the end locker, takes a quarter out of her purse, then
studies the time scarred operating instructions on the face
of the locker. She slips the quarter into the slot and opens
the locker door. As Carol bends to pick up the suitcase, the
locker door swings closed... She tries to open it but the
door has re-locked itself... Carol quite disgusted with her
predicament, again sets the suitcase down and pulls a quarter
out of her change purse. As she again reads the numbered
directions, a YOUNG MAN appears at her shoulder.

THE MAN IS A PROTOTYPE OF URBAN SLEAZINESS, Doberman Pinscher
features are broken by a weedybrown moustache, a cheap
corduroy suit is set off by an oddly matched bow tie. The
Man's appearance suggests a kind of drug store dapperness.

                    DAPPER MAN
          Kind of tricky, isn't it?

She turns, startled by his sudden proximity. In one smooth
movement the Dapper Man plucks the quarter from Carol's hand,
deposits it in the slot and swings the locker door open.
Setting the heavy suitcase inside, he closes the door, tests
it to show that it

has been re-locked, then removes the key from the lock and
puts it into Carol's hand. She is intimidated momentarily by
the Man's sudden appearance and forcefulness, as well as his
intentions.

                       CAROL
          Thank you.

                    DAPPER MAN
              (toothy grin)
          No trouble lady.

Stepping backward, his canine features disappear into a
welter of station activity. Carol watches his receding figure
for a moment, then simultaneously placing the key into her
purse, she turns and begins moving towards the Cocktail
Lounge.

                                                            52.



INT. BARN - DAY

EMPTY CAGES STACKED ALONG A WOODEN WALL

A YOUNG KITTEN IN A CARDBOARD BOX wrestling with the barrel
of a .44. A thick veined hand gently rubs the gun over the
fur along the cat's neck and backbone.

RUDY BUTLER IS PREOCCUPIED WITH THE CAT, giving little
attention to the thirtyish Man standing nearby.

HAROLD CLINTON puts away a large syringe then snaps shut the
medical bag. Rudy lies across a cot in one corner of the barn-
like Animal Hospital. The large room is lined with stalls,
cages and pens, many of them vacant.

The wonded criminal is bare-chested. A plaster cast has been
attached to his left arm and shoulder.

FRAN CLINTON SITS ON A HIGH WOODEN STOOL opposite   Rudy. Five
years younger than her husband, tight sweater and   skirt,
bright scarlet fingernail polish, well-built, her   face
suggests sensuality. Fran's bare, milk-white legs   are crossed
under her rumpled skirt.

                    RUDY
              (to Harold)
          What's the damage?

                    HAROLD
          Collar bone is broken. No infection
          yet... the bandages should be changed
          twice a day.

                    RUDY
          I got a nurse in mind.

                    HAROLD
              (going along, oblivious to the
               implication)
          The glucose will begin working in half an
          hour. You'll feel better then...

                     RUDY
              (flashing a grin despite the
               pain)
          The three of us are going to do some
          traveling. We're going to take your car
          to El Paso.

                    HAROLD
          That's not possible. We can't leave
          here... we've got all this.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                           53.
CONTINUED:


Rudy smiles at Mrs. Clinton. He's never met Fran before, but
he's known her for years.

                    RUDY
          Is it possible, Mrs. Clinton?

                    FRAN
              (scared, but trying to be
               friendly)
          Just... tell us what you want.

Rudy looks back down at the gun and cat. The following
silence is like a scream. Finally:

                    RUDY
          What kind of car do you have, Harold?

                    FRAN
              (cutting in)
          A Ford... We have a Ford.

                    RUDY
          That's good. That's very good. Now
          Harold, you go out and gas up the Ford,
          check the oil and tires, we don't want
          any problems on the road. One more
          thing... If anybody but you comes back...

He points the gun at Mrs. Clinton.

                    RUDY (CONT'D)
              (continuing)
          She gets her clock fixed right away...
          You understand that, Harold?

A long pause.

                    FRAN
          You do what he says, Harold.

                    RUDY
          After you come back I'll listen while you
          make some phone calls, tell a few friends
          you've got to leave for a week or two...
          You have to call another Vet about the
          animals. You tell him to come over and
          take good care of them starting
          tomorrow... no slip-ups on that. They got
          to be looked after...

                    HAROLD
          We really don't have too many friends.


                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                             54.

          They don't think he married well.

                    RUDY
              (smiling)
          That makes things a little easier for us
          then, doesn't it?

INT. TRAINS STATION BAR - DAY

Carol sits in the bar. A young SOLDIER approaches and sits
down at the counter next to her. She is finishing a vodka
gimlet.

                    SOLDIER
              (to a bartender)
          Beer.

Carol glances at her watch.

                    SOLDIER (CONT'D)
              (continuing - begins with the
               obvious)
          Guess you have to catch a train?

                    THE SOLDIER
          pink-cheeked and freckle-faced, he has to
          shave maybe twice a week; twenty-one
          years old, not good-looking (his best
          feature is his gentle, easy grin) and not
          a hustler. He just wats to meet a girl.

                    CAROL
              (not too patronizing)
          That's right.

                    SOLDIER
          Me, too. Got twenty-four days of furlough
          and I'm goin' home.

The soldier's beer arrives.

                    CAROL
          Where's home?

                    SOLDIER
          Utah, the Bee-Hive state. I'm from Orem,
          right near Salt Lake ... Say, you
          wouldn't happen to be a Mormon, would
          you?




                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                          55.

                    CAROL
              (chuckles)
          No, I'm not.

                    SOLDIER
          Me, neither. There's about twelve people
          in the state that aren't Mormons and I'm
          one of them.

                     CAROL
          That certainly makes you kind of
          special...

                    SOLDIER
              (awkward)
          Yeah... I guess it does.

Carol pushes aside her glass.

                    SOLDIER (CONT'D)
              (c ont inuing)
          You wouldn't be taking the train to Salt
          Lake, would you?

                    CAROL
              (smiles across to him)
          No, I'm afraid not.

                    SOLDIER
          I never have any luck.

Carol smiles at the soldier. Her features suddenly freeze as
she glances toward the entrance to the bar.

AT THE DOORWAY

DOC STANDS LOOKING AT CAROL and the soldier.

                    CAROL
          STANDS AND PAUSES FOR A MOMENT.

                    CAROL (CONT'D)
          I really hope you have a nice trip.

                    SOLDIER
          Thanks. I hope yours is okay, too.

Carol moves towards the exit.

The soldier quietly sips his beer, his face a bit grim.

AT THE DOORWAY

                                                             56.



CAROL STOPS NEAR DOC.

They look at each other...

                    DOC
          Where's the suitcase?

Carol continues looking at Doc for a moment.

Then, suddenly moves past him, leading him out into the main
lobby.

                                       BACK WITHIN THE PROMENADE

SERIES OF ANGLES

CAROL EMERGES FROM THE COCKTAIL LOUNGE followed by Doc.

They cross to the lockers.

She retrieves the key from her purse and thrusts it into the
proper slot. It doesn't turn. Puzzled she tries again, then
forcing the key, shakes the lock violently.

Her eyes widening into a quiet panic, she next looks at the
locker number and then the number on the key. Her features
are now totally ashen.

She walks up the bank of lockers... puts the key in another
locker, the door opens, the compartment is empty.

Carol turns away from the locker, eyes glazed with fear...
Doc at her shoulder.

                    CAROL
          A man helped me open it...

                    DOC
              (deceptive calm)
          And switched keys.

                    CAROL
          He must have.

                    DOC
              (angrily)
          It isn't another boyfriend, is it?

Carol winces, containing her anger.

                    DOC (CONT'D)
              (continuing - icily)
          How long ago.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                            57.

                    CAROL
          Fifteen minutes.

                    DOC
          Sure?

Carol nods.

                    DOC (CONT'D)
              (continuing - with quick
               calculation)
          He'd figure you for longer, enough time
          to try another hit. He's probably still
          in the station.

As Doc pushes Carol forward.

                    DOC (CONT'D)
              (continuing - lashing out)
          There better be a guy with the

                    CAROL
              (lashing back)
          You bastard...

Walking at a rapid pace, they start through the station, Doc
forcing their speed, clutching Carol under her elbow. They
reach the main concourse after moving down the length of the
promenade... eyes straining.

CAROL STOPS SUDDENLY. SHE STARES DOWN THE LONG CORRIDOR her
eyes finding the thief. He stands near another bank of
lockers, the black suitcase at his feet.

THE THIEF LOOKS UP AT CAROL - virtually within the same
moment that she spots him. His expression never changes. He
takes a step towards her, smiling... Then, with a movement
that is both abrupt and casual, he snatches up the money bag
and disappears behind the constant traffic of train patrons.

DOC HAS SEEN THE THIEF. Recognizing the suitcase he moves
immediately after him. Carol follows Doc but is unable to
keep up. She watches as Doc vanishes behind the row of
lockers.

CAROL ROUNDS THE LAST LOCKER IN THE ROW but both men have now
disappeared from view. She sags back against the edge of the
metal compartments, exhausted, fearful.

                    LOUDSPEAKER VOICE
              (indistinct above the roar of
               the station)
          Attention please.

                    LOUDSPEAKER VOICE (CONT'D)
          The Flyer now boarding at gate three. The
          Flyer now boarding at gate three.

Carol again raises her eyes. Still breathless, her face glows
with moisture.

INT. THE CLINTON'S BARN - (MORNING)

FRAN IS STILL SEATED ON THE STOOL. Rudy stares at her from
the cot. Harold is now absent.

                    FRAN
          I don't think you have to worry much
          about Harold. He won't do anything.

                    RUDY
              (he speaks very politely)
          That right?

                    FRAN
          You can trust him...

                    RUDY
          How long have you been married?

                       FRAN
          Two years.

                    RUDY
          Can he trust you?

                    FRAN
              (smiles)
          That's what matters, isn't it?

Rudy continues looking at her.

                    RUDY
          Come over here a minute...

He gestures with his gun. Fran crosses the distance slowly,
moving with apprehension.

                     FRAN
          Look, I'm not going to be any trouble to
          you either, fact is, this may sound
          funny, but maybe you and I could be close
          friends...

Rudy gestures her closer...

                                                             59.

          You don't always have to have your gun
          out. I'll get whatever you want. Really,
          I will...

Fran smiles. She is now standing over the cot, looking
directly down at Rudy. He jerks her down.

                    RUDY
              (still polite)
          Get rid of that nail polish, I don't like
          it, and when I tell you to come over here
          you move fast. You and I are going to get
          along because I've known a lot of people
          like you, so don't tell me about it
          because I got your ticket going in. Now
          get up and get that paint of your
          fingers... okay?

Rudy smiles.

INT. TRAIN STATION - A SERIES OF ANGLES - DAY

DOC MOVING LIKE A GUN DOG ON THE HUNT between the rows of
lockers; catching sight of the thief momentarily, he closes
in.

After a series of criss-crossed movements among the banked
locker corriders, Doc again loses sight of the thief as the
slender criminal dodges off onto a main passenger concourse.
Doc is faster and more agile than the thief, but the station
is unfamiliar territory to him. Both Doc and the Thief move
carefully, they must not arouse enough attention to make
themselves conspicuous, thus risking police interference.

THE THIEF HURRIES ALONG THE MAIN CONCOURSE weaving between
the incoming and departing passengers that dot the long
corridor.

DOC IN PURSUIT DOWN THE CONCOURSE, he passes several sealed
off departure/arrival gates.

THE THIEF STEPS OFF THE CONCOURSE INTO GATE THREE, an open
stairway winding downward.

DOC FOLLOWS HIS QUARRY DOWN THE STAIRWAY to the train area
where he immediately skips over the winding ramp and onto the
loading platform. Emerging from the short tunnel, Doc isn't
surprised that the Thief is again nowhere in sight. Doc steps
behind a pillar -- he waits watchfully... After a moment or
two, the Thief edges out from behind another column and
starts back up the platform towards the concourse.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                             60.
CONTINUED:

Doc moves quickly to intercept his opponent but, as the Thief
spots his approach, he turns and Joins several passengers
scurrying toward the awaiting train...

THE FLYER STANDS GLEAMING AT TRACKSIDE, perpendicular to the
boarding gate. Two doors to the train stand open, one in the
pullman section, the other entrance admitting day coach
passengers.

CAROL - ON THE MAIN CONCOURSE - MOVING ALONG WITH THE FLOW of
about-to-depart passengers... the Flyer comes into sight,
visible on the next level below.

THE CONDUCTOR - AT TRACKSIDE - STANDS SMILING BROADLY by the
coach entrance. He grins at the boarding PASSENGERS as he
speaks to a nearby BRAKEMAN. The Thief skirts around a
baggage-laden elderly COUPLE and moves up the two-step and
into the rail car passageway.

DOC MOVING QUICKLY AGAIN. He sees the Thief slip past the
conductor and into the train.

THE THIEF IS NOW INSIDE THE DAY COACH. He heads toward the
forward compartments.

DOC EXPERTLY SQUIRMS THROUGH THE BOARDING THRONG and
disappears past the conductor up into the passenger car
vestibule.

ON THE CONCOURSE

CAROL WATCHES AS A BLONDISH MAN in a grey suit skips aboard
the Flyer standing below. She is unable to get a clear look
at the man, and is unsure as to whether or not it was Doc.
She hesitates, then moves forward to Gate Three which will
take her down to trackside...

Carol stands at the edge of the gate -- the last of the crowd
having already passed through. She hesitates again, staring
down at the shining train.

INT. FLYER - DAY COACH

THE AISLE IS CLOGGED WITH PASSENGERS. People hesitate over
their selection of seats, put baggage into overhead racks,
clumsily remove their overcoats... The Thief continues to
move forward, squirming around the passengers at a hurried
but controlled pace.

                                                             61.



AT THE END OF A PULLMAN

DOC ENTERS, THREADING HIS WAY FORWARD, scanning faces. He is
one car behind the Thief and losing ground, due to the fact
that Doc must carefully note the occupants of each seat as he
passes. Doc is further delayed by a WOMAN blocking the aisle.
She struggles painfully, trying to fit a suitcase into an
overhead carriage.

Doc, with the most forced of smiles, reaches up to help her.

30? THE THIEF MOVES THROUGH ANOTHER VESTIBULE and into an 30?
empty car -- now unobserved, he immediately breaks into a
run.

DOC LOOKING, MOVING NIMBLY INTO ANOTHER VESTIBULE AND CAR.
The passengers have become fewer and fewer as he nears the
front of the train.

THE THIEF RUNS THROUGH ANOTHER VESTIBULE AND INTO A SMOKER.
This car also deserted, he maintains his trotting pace,
swinging the heavy suitcase as he goes... reaching the end of
the smoker, he enters the next vestibule and attempts to move
into the following car, but the Thief is brought to a halt by
the sudden dead end of the passageway. The next car holds
only baggage. He has reached furthest forward passenger car.
The Thief desperately tries to open the vestibule door,
hoping to escape by jumping off the train, but the doors are
tightly locked. He begins to retrace his steps.

DOC MOVES CAREFULLY INTO THE NEXT CAR FORWARD, still
unknowingly two cars behind the Thief.

THE THIEF PASSES BACK TO THE VESTIBULE AT THE REAR OF THE
SMOKER, his eye suddenly catching the Men's Lounge. He tries
the door -- locked. The Thief snaps out a pen knife, picks
the lock with a deft movement. Passengers are visible behind
him as he works, filtering into the pullman car following the
smoker. None of them notes his activity. The restroom door
swings open.

INT. MEN'S LOUNGE

The Thief immediately snaps the bolt-lock shut behind him,
crosses the small, murky room and tries to lift the window.
He strains mightily but the glass remains hopelessly
jammed...

DOC ENTERS THE FINAL PASSENGER CAR, notes the half 313 dozen
travelers and continues moving forward, going next into the
smoker.

THE SMOKING CAR IS EMPTY, although several Passengers and a
PORTER enter it moments after Doc leads the way. Doc passes
through the length of the car, moves into the vestibule and,
like the Thief a few moments before, finds his passage
blocked by the baggage car. Doc hesitates, then turns and
begins going back in the opposite direction.

DOC STOPS AT THE MEN'S LOUNGE -- staring hard at the door for
a moment. He tries the handle. The door remains firmly shut.

                       PORTER
                 (appearing suddenly at Doc's
                  shoulder)
             Be open five minutes out of the station.

Doc nods and moves away, continuing to retrace his steps
toward his point of entrance onto the train.

THE THIEF, HAVING ABANDONED THE JAMMED WINDOW, is now undoing
the snaps and straps holding the suitcase closed. The lid
pulls upward and stacks of money appear under his hands. The
Thief grabs a money pad, runs his thumb over it, then shoves
the stack of greenbacks into his coat's inside breast pocket.

DOC MOVES WITH DETERMINATION back through the passenger cars.

INT. MEN'S LOUNGE

THE THIEF HAS AGAIN CLOSED THE SUITCASE. He nervously looks
about his tight-walled sanctuary, then crosses back to the
window and stares out through a corner of the pane. He pulls
the shade lower.

EXT. TRACK

METAL WHEELS GRIND AGAINST THE RAILS, the train SHUDDERS,
then begins to move forward.

THE THIEF IS WATCHING THROUGH THE MEN'S ROOM WINDOW as the
train edges forward. His body suddenly tightens. He sees Doc
outside the train, walking slowly between a narrow passage of
moving passenger cars and several parked tinders.

                       THIEF'S POV
             DOC GLANCING BETWEEN PARKED PASSENGER
             CARS, walking cautiously ahead. As the
             Flyer continues to move slowly forward,
             Doc disappears from view.

THE THIEF ALLOWS HIMSELF A QUICK SMILE. Turning away from the
window he picks up the suitcase, unbolts the lock and steps
back out into the vestibule.


                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                             63.
CONTINUED:


AT THE BACK OF THE SMOKER, the Thief seats himself next to a
window and places the suitcase on the cushioned chair
opposite from him. In the forward position of the car, well
behind the Thief's back, a dozen Passengers are scattered
about the lounge chairs. A Conductor appears at the end of
the smoker opposite the Thief and begins to collect and punch
tickets.

As the train begins to pick up speed, the Thief lifts an
abandoned copy of the newpaper off the cushion next to him.
He glances at the front page, then unfolds the width of the
paper. As a precaution against regaining poverty, the Thief
rests one foot against the suitcase. All seems secure. Then,
Doc sits down next to the Thief.

DOC COMPANIONABLY SLIDES AN ARM BEHIND THE BACK OP THE
THIEF'S NECK, pulling him close.

                    DOC
              (softly almost gently)
          When you pop a lock don't mark it.

The Thief's knife instantly flashes into his hand, but before
he can bring it into play, Doc catches his arms.

THE KNIFE IS TIGHTLY WEDGED INTO THE THIEF'S HAND. Doc's
fingers are vise-like at his wrist.

THE OTHER PASSENGERS REMAIN PRE-OCCUPIED AT THE OTHER end of
the car, taking no note of the quiet encounter.

THE CONDUCTOR IS STILL AT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE CAR from
Doc and the Thief. He continues collecting and punching
fares.

INT. STATION GATE - DAY

CAROL IS EXITING. THERE IS AN ANNOUNCEMENT OVER THE

LOUDSPEAKER -- the train has left.

INT. TRAIN - DAY

THE CONDUCTOR AS SEEN BY THE THIEF'S WIDENING EYES. He
methodically punches the tickets, never looking more than two
seats ahead.

THE THIEF'S EYES BULGE AS DOC CHOPS HIM ON THE WINDPIPE. The
Thief goes out. Is he dead?

DOC CHOPS HIM AGAIN. IF HE ISN'T DEAD HE LOOKS IT.

Doc pulls the Thief's hat down over his head.

                                                            64.



INT. STATION - DAY

CAROL CROSSES INTO THE STATION, TAKES A DEEP BREATH.

Sits... waiting. The soldier comes by, stops. She doesn't
recognize anything.

INT. TRAIN - DAY

THE CONDUCTOR ARRIVES AT THE LOUNGE CHAIRS WHERE DOC AND THE
thief are seated. He stops in the aisleway, expectantly
leaning in Doc's direction.

                     CONDUCTOR
          Tickets?

As Doc takes out his wallet, peels a fifty out and gives it
to him.

                    DOC
          End of the line. Two.

                     CONDUCTOR
              (grumpily)
          All right.

The conductor cuts the fare receipt and begins to make
change.

THE THIEF SITS FACING THE WINDOW LOOKING VERY DEAD

INT. CLINTON'S FORD - DAY

RUDY SITS IN THE BACK SEAT AS HAROLD CAUTIOUSLY MOTORS

DOWN the highway. With his one good arm, Rudy cares for the
kitten resting in the cardboard box on the back seat.

                    RUDY
          Talk a little, Harold, loosen up... good
          for you.

Harold works his jaw, his grip tightens on the wheel.

                    FRAN
              (chuckling at Harold)
          Something ought to loosen him up ... how
          comes we're going to El Paso, Rudy?

                    RUDY
          I Just want to find a suitcase.

                                                             65.



INT. KITCHEN - BEYNON'S RANCH - DAY

BEYNON'S BODY REMAINS OUT OF SIGHT behind the overturned
kitchen table... a small trickle of blood oozes out from
under one of the table legs.

The Accountant stands with Cully, Hayhoe and Swain staring
down at Beynon's body.

                    ACCOUNTANT
          They may still be going to Nogales.

                    SWAIN
          What about Laughlin in El Paso?

                    ACCOUNTANT
          Cover both, get someone down there...
          either Rudy and McCoy's got half a
          million.

                    SWAIN
          They've got to switch cars.

                    ACCOUNTANT
          Put out the word.

                    HAYHOE
              (looking back at Beynon)
          What about Jack?

                    ACCOUNTANT
          Tonight... take him out in the country,
          throw him down a dry well, if you can
          find one.

INT. PULLMAN CAR - DAY

AS DOC THUMBS IDLY THROUGH THE NEWSPAPER. He is suddenly
showered with spurting water. He lowers the paper and looks
to the aisle, seeing:

A SEVEN YEAR OLD BLACK PANTHER, dressed appropriately and
holding a water pistol.

                    KID
          Stick 'em up!

Doc looks at the brat.

                    KID (CONT'D)
              (continuing)
          I'm gonna shoot you...


                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                            66.
CONTINUED:


He squeezes the pistol's trigger, two bursts of water land on
Doc's shirt front. Doc continues staring at the boy. The kid
looks hard at Doc, not giving an inch.

                    DOC
          Come here a second...

Doc takes the boy's arm, gently pulls him closer.

                    DOC (CONT'D)
              (continuing)
          Look, I'm sure you're a nice kid and that
          your mother's nearby...

Now you better get back to her real quick or I'm going to
break your little arm... okay?

Doc releases the boy. The kid looks at Doc for a moment then
bursts into tears and retreats at a dead run back down the
passenger car aisleway. Doc again lifts the paper, turning to
the sports page.

INT. STATION - DAY

CAROL WAITS IN THE STATION. (A SERIES OP ANGLES AND
DISSOLVES)

INT. PULLMAN - DAY

DOC LIFTS THE SUITCASE AS THE CONDUCTOR APPEARS at the
vestibule at the opposite end of the car and announces the
next stop. Doc prepares to get off. The passenger car remains
sparsely populated. No one occupies the seats near the
corpse.

EXT. FIRST TRAIN CONCOURSE - SERIES OF ANGLES AND DISSOLVES -
EARLY MORNING

CAROL SITS WATCHING THE PEOPLE -- she gets up, doesn't know
where to go... sits down again... fear and anticipation on
her face... stands up... ready to go where? Ready to sit down
again, she looks up.

DOC CROSSES SLOWLY TO HER CARRYING THE SUITCASE. Carol
reacts... pleased to see him... pleased that he's back...
until.

                    DOC
              (steely)
          Your kind of mistakes are going to land
          me back in Huntsville.

                    CAROL
              (nailing him)
          I wouldn't worry Doc. I can always get
          you out... I'll screw every prison
          official in Texas if I have to.

                    DOC
          Texas is a big state.

                    CAROL
          I can handle it.

                    DOC
          I'll bet you can.

                     CAROL
          You'd do the same for me, wouldn't you,
          Doc?
               (rising tone)
          If I was caught, wouldn't you?

Doc is silent. After a long pause.

                     CAROL (CONT'D)
              (continuing - quietly)
          When we had trouble before it was
          different.

                    DOC
              (nodding)
          You don't like the way things are, I
          don't like the way things

                    CAROL
          What do you want to do?

                    DOC
          Maybe we should split up... I'll cut the
          money with you.

                    CAROL
          Do you mean that?

                       DOC
          I mean it.

A long pause. Maybe she wonders; what if he is lying but what
if he isn't? Temptation? She makes up her mind.

                    CAROL
          No... I don't want to leave.

                                                           68.



INT. PASSENGER TRAIN - EARLY EVENING

DOC AND CAROL WATCH THROUGH THE DOUBLE WINDOWS AS THE train
yard lights of a town go strobing by.

EXT. SECOND TRAIN CONCOURSE.

DOC AND CAROL COME DOWN OUT OF THE GANGWAY OF ANOTHER train
and turn up the pavement toward the main part of the depot.
Doc continues holding the suitcase as they walk.

                    DOC
          We'll grab a room for tonight then you go
          out tomorrow and buy yourself some new
          clothes, pick some up for me... Grab some
          food now, paper bag it, we eat in the
          room.

                    CAROL
              (cutting in)
          You've got all the answers. What about
          when they find the body on the train?

                    DOC
          When they find it, they find it.

To the cops a description's only good if there's a channel
for it, and there's no connection between that stiff and the
robbery.

                    CAROL
          You've got it all figured.

                    DOC
              (looking at Carol and thinking
               about Beynon)
          No... there's a couple of things I'm
          still working on.

                       CAROL
          Like what?

But Doc doesn't answer.

INT. TRANSIT HOTEL - NIGHT

DOC LIES NEXT TO CAROL. Carol is eating a hamburger wrapped
in wax paper. She passes one over to Doc along with some
greasy french fries and a couple of napkins .

The Suitcase has been placed on the small writing desk across
the room. Doc silently munches his hamburger.

Doc glances at the poster rolled up. Carol hasn't put it up
on the wall yet.

INT. FIRST TRAIN - NIGHT

THE TRAIN GOES CLICKETY CLICK THROUGH THE NIGHT, the young
panther is stalking and prowling among the sleeping
passengers. His Mother catches him, takes him back to his
seat.

INT. TRANSIT HOTEL - NIGHT

CAROL IS BUSY UNBANDING THE MONEY PADS. A LARGE STACK OF
discarded wrappers have been placed in a metal trash can near
her leg. Behind her, Doc, now in his undershirt, reads a
Texas newspaper.

CAROL CONTINUES TO LOOSEN THE GREENBACKS. She is surrounded
on the double bed by stacks of money. She lights a match,
drops it into the wastebasket. The money bands quickly burst
into flames, consume themselves, then die back into crinkly
ashes.

                    DOC
              (not looking up)
          There may be a hunting party.

                    CAROL
          Why, there's nothing on the news?

                    DOC
          I didn't mean police.

He continues thinking. Carol watches him for a moment.

                    CAROL
          Tell me about it.

Doc looks across at her.

                    DOC
              (calmly)
          Loredo is out. I've been thinking about
          Rudy. If he was on his own, we're okay.
          If Beynon bought him out...

Doc looks at her.

                    CAROL
          What?

          If Beynon bought him out, and he talked
          then maybe Beynon's boys will be waiting
          for us in El Paso.

Rudy knew about Laughlins.

                    CAROL
          You're full of ifs.

                    DOC
          I think you liked it with him.

I think he got to you.

          Maybe. At least I got to him.

          El Paso.

INT. FIRST TRAIN - NIGHT

A WATER PISTOL APPEARS AROUND THE CORNER   OF AN EMPTY
PASSENGER CHAIR. The seven year old brat   squeezes off several
plumes of water. The Thief is hit by the   gun's spray, water
runs slowly down his ear and the back of   his neck.

                     KID
          Bang!

THE BOY WATCHES THE IMMOBILE MAN. He fires again, once again
there is no reaction. The brat steps forward... smiling, he
pushes the thief's arm, pushes harder.

THE THIEF'S BODY SUDDENLY FALLS BACK ACROSS THE CHAIR. His
eyes roll upward... staring at the panther. His neck is
bruised, he pushes his hat back slowly.

                    THIEF
              (very hoarsely)
          Get me a doctor.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

CAROL SLEEPS ON HER STOMACH, her head resting across one arm.
Doc lies beside her, eyes open. He looks over at Carol a
moment, noting the long strands of hair that move
rhythmically back and forth from her gentle breathing. After
a moment Doc quietly stands, moves to the writing table and
stares at the black suitcase.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

He opens the valise and lifts the large stack of greenbacks
into a shaft of light coming through a crack in the drawn
shade. Still holding the money, Doc looks back at Carol.

INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

A PLAINCLOTHES OFFICER HOLDS A SIMILAR MONEY PAD with his
handkerchief. The Panther is sitting with his mother on a
nearby seat. Still dressed in his panther suit, but no longer
a brat. His face reflects both fear and shock.

THE THIEF IS WITH THEM, BANDAGED AROUND THE THROAT

                    PLAINCLOTHES OFFICER

INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

CAROL COMES IN. SHE IS WEARING A NEW SUIT, SANDALS It looks

Doc looks at her outfit and opens his. They are too flashy.

          Thanks.
              (as Carol starts to speak)
          You look great, just great...

They could pick you up for soliciting in ten minutes.

          And that could be all for you., baby.

Carol suddenly angered slaps him.

Doc immediately delivers her a stinging blow.

Carol hits the wall then stands stunned as he quietly ties
his laces and pulls on his jacket. Doc stuffs the Colt .45
into the flapped outside pocket along with 2 clips. He turns
to the bed and picks up the suitcase.

Carol continues looking at Doc.

                    DOC (CONT'D)
          Now you learn3 this time it could be the
          chair for both of us.

Doc doesn't answer. He turns and exits. She follows.

INT. AUTO COURT MOTEL - MORNING

RUDY REACHES OVER TO THE NIGHTSTAND AND SHUTS OFF the radio.
His eyes stare vacantly ahead for a moment.

HAROLD CLINTON IS TIED SECURELY INTO A CHAIR, his mouth
tightly gagged.

RUDY BEGINS TO SMILE. FRAN IS NEXT TO RUDY WITHIN THE bed,
wearing only a bra, sleeping, one arm wrapped around Rudy's
middle.

                    RUDY
          How you doing over there, Harold? You
          sleep okay last night? Good. I'm glad to
          hear it. Did you listen to the news? That
          means we don't have to drive so hard
          today, Harold... we're gonna be
          travelling a lot faster than they are...
          We got a lot more time than I figured.




                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                          74.

Rudy continues smiling. He pulls the sheet away from Frank,
then allows his hand to reach down, cupping her breast from
inside the bra. Fran half awakens, pulls herself closer to
Rudy.

INT. ACCOUNTANT'S OFFICE - DAY

HAYHOE, THE ACCOUNTANT and the rest of the boys are sitting
in the office waiting.

INT. CAR - DAY

RUDY IS DRIVING NOW, Fran and Harold are not speaking.

INT. CAR - DAY

DOC AND CAROL. DOC IS DRIVING. They are also silent.

INT. LAUGHLIN HOTEL - EL PASO - MORNING

CANNON (one of the Accountant's boys, whom we have not seen
before) ENTERS THE DARK NEARLY DESERTED LOBBY and approaches
the reception desk. The large room is populated by
overstuffed and threadbare furniture.

LAUGHLIN looks very much like Dub Taylor and speaks Spanish
just about as badly. He flashes a quick grin from behind the
counter as Cannon draws near. At the switchboard behind
Laughlin, CARMEN, maybe 35, sits next to the telephone jacks
(all of them idle) readinc a movie magazine.

                    CANNON
          You Laughlin?

                    LAUGHLIN
              (Mr. Friendly)
          Yes, sir, and that's my wife and that's
          Junior.

Laughlin indicates a seventeen year old BELLBOY sleeping in
one of the overstuffed chairs.

                    CANNON
          Congratulations. I need a room.

                    LAUGHLIN
          No trouble. You came to the right place,
          one thing we got is a lot of rooms. What
          else can I do for you?

                                                             75.



INT. DOC AND CAROL'S CAR - DAY

AS IT MOTORS DOWN THE TEXAS HIGHWAY. The black suitcase is
propped up between Doc and Carol in the front seat. Doc,
seated on the passenger side, bangs the car radio with his
hand. The radio is obviously not working as he turns the
dials and pushes the buttons.

                    DOC
              (cajoling it)
          C'mon workl I
              (almost pleading)
          C'mon.

We hear garbled words for a moment, pleasing Doc... and then
the radio conks out again. This time Doc hits the radio hard.

                    DOC (CONT'D)
              (angrily to the radio)
          Give me the news!!

When it is clear that the radio won't work:

                    DOC (CONT'D)
          You can't trust anything these days.

                    CAROL
          I'll tell you something, Doc. One day
          you're going to have to trust somebody...

DOC SLAMS THE BRAKE, GRABS THE WHEEL as the car veers over to
the side of the road.

                     DOC
          I trust...
              (he opens the black suitcase)
          Want to see what I trust... In God we
          trust...
              (he pulls out a bill and points
               at it)
          The word's on every bill!!!

                    CAROL
              (slamming the suitcase closed)
          You keep it up and it won't matter how
          far we get away, because it's going to be
          all over between you and me. Do you
          understand that? There won't be anything
          left.

She starts the car up again, and continues driving, her
knuckles tightening around the steering wheel.

                                                          76.



INT. CLINTON'S FORD - ANGLES - DAY

AS IT LEISURELY MOVES ALONG THE ROADWAY BORDERED BY MILES OF
SAGEBRUSH. Harold drives, Fran is again in the front seat
beside her husband... a scrunched up sack of food beside her.
She wipes her mouth with a napkin, shoves it inside the paper
bag, then turns to watch the passing scenery. Rudy sits in
the back, eating spareribs. He suddenly throws a just
finished bone at Fran, hitting her on the shoulder.

                    RUDY
          Have a bone, baby.

He throws another sparerib at Fran.

                    FRAN
              (shouts)
          Oh, Christ, you wrecked my blouse.

God damn it, Rudy, what did you do that for? Jesus.

                     RUDY
              (laughing)
          I'll tell you why I did it... it makes me
          feel good.

He laughs and again throws another bone at Fran. She suddenly
catches his mood and begins laughing herself ... tossing a
bone back at Rudy.

HAROLD CONTINUES DRIVING. His knuckles whiten around the
steering wheel as a sparerib bounces off the window in front
of him.

THE KITTEN IS SLEEPING WITHIN the cardboard box, oblivious to
Rudy and Fran's laughter. (That will be the day.)

EXT. SMALL TEXAS TOWN - DAY

THE CHEVY MOVES ALONG with the light mid-day traffic, passing
various roadside business establishments, then pulls up
before a radio/TV repair and sales shop.

INT. RADIO/TV STORE - DAY

ALL THE LATEST MODEL RADIOS are stacked on shelves around the
small room... a television display featuring several models
is in one corner of the shop. Another TV is playing near the
counter and the PROPRIETOR'S desk.

                    DOC
          A portable.


                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                            77.
CONTINUED:


                    PROPRIETOR
          Transistor?

                    DOC
          Yeah.

The Proprietor moves to a shelf.

THE SCREEN. As Doc's picture suddenly flashes onto the tube,
with appropriate dialogue.

DOC STARING AT THE TELEVISION, then he quickly reaches over
and snaps the set off.

THE PROPRIETOR BRINGS OUT SOME RADIOS, seemingly oblivious to
Doc's action.

                    PROPRIETOR
          15 to 55 dollars -- take your pick.

DOC TURNS, then looks at the corner of the small shop.

ALL THE TELEVISION SETS have Doc's picture on them.

DOC TURNS BACK TO THE PROPRIETOR -- the man is looking at him
not at the sets.

                    DOC
              (paying)
          Fifty --

Taking a set, he exits.

                    PROPRIETOR
          You have change.

But he doesn't answer.

INT. CAR - DAY

CAROL TURNS AS DOC STICKS HIS HEAD through the open door,
hands her the set.

                    DOC
          We got trouble. Let's take a walk.

DOC AND CAROL WALKING UP THE SIDEWALK OP THE SMALL TOWN. They
turn into a Sporting Goods Store. The Chevy is behind them, a
block away.

                                                             78.



INT. RADIO/TV STORE

THE PROPRIETOR LOOKS CAREFULLY OUT THE WINDOW AT THE empty
car, then turns and grabs his telephone.

INT. SPORTING GOODS STORE

CAROL REMAINS BY THE FRONT WINDOW, PRETENDING TO

EXAMINE some fishing equipment as she keeps her eye on the
street.

Doc moves to the counter at the rear of the store. An
ATTENDANT moves up to help Doc.

                    SALESMAN
              (with a smile)
          Can I help you?

                    DOC
          Sure can. I'd like an Invicta 12-gauge
          pump with the twenty-inch barrel.

                    SALESMAN
          All right. Shells?

                    DOC
          Two boxes of double-ought buck.

                    SALESMAN
          Gonna knock down a wall?

                    DOC
              (big smile)
          Might try that.

The Salesman puts a form in front of Doc then goes to the gun
rack behind him, lifts off a short-barreled shotgun and
begins to wrap it.

                       SALESMAN
          Sign here.

CAROL, AT THE FRONT OP THE STORE, WATCHES THE STREET INTENTLY

EXT. THE STREET

THE RADIO-REPAIRMAN EXITS THE SHOP AS A POLICE CAR comes down
the street and makes a U-turn... stopping near the Chevy.
After a brief conversation the Radio-Repairman goes back
inside his store and the police car pulls forward, down the
street from the Chevy.

                                                             79.



INT. POLICE CAR

THE TWO COPS LOOK LIKE HOMER AND JETHRO. Both men stare hard
at the now staked-out Chevy.

CAROL -- WATCHING PROM THE WINDOW OP THE SPORTING GOODS STORE

AT THE COUNTER THE SALESMAN LAYS OUT THE GUN AND THE BOXES OF
SHELLS. As Doc empties the loose shells into his coat pocket:

CAROL TURNS, LOOKS AT DOC, THEIR EYES MEET. Doc reads her; he
knows that the police are in the street.

AT THE COUNTER THE SALESMAN PUTS A STRING AROUND THE BROWN
PAPER

                    SALESMAN
          Be one hundred and eighty-five thirty-
          two.

Doc quickly pays the man.

                    DOC
          Much obliged.

Doc turns as the Salesman drifts over to another Customer --
he approaches Carol at the store window.

                    CAROL
          Only one car.

                    DOC
          Let's do it.

Carol moves ahead of Doc,, exits the Sporting Goods Store and
starts up the sidewalk.

DOC WATCHES HER FOR A MOMENT, THEN HEADS FOR THE DOOR HIMSELF

EXT. SIDEWALK

CAROL WALKS ALONE BACK TOWARDS THE CAR.

INT. POLICE CAR

HOMER AND JETHRO CONTINUE STARING AT THE CHEW. Their car is
pointed towards the Radio Store, its back to the Sporting
Goods house.

DOC LEAVES THE SPORTING GOODS STORE, CROSSES THE STREET and
begins walking up the opposite sidewalk, back towards the
Chevy.

                                                             80.



CAROL PASSES THE POLICE CAR AND NEARS THE CHEVY

INT. POLICE CAR

THE TWO RURAL COPS MOVE INTO ACTION; their car pulls forward
and parks diagonally across the street, partially blocking
the roadway as xvell as nearly obstructing the Chevy.

CAROL STANDS FROZEN AS HOMER AND JETHRO HOP OUT OF THE POLICE
car, guns drawn.

DOC CROSSES THE STREET BEHIND THE COP CAR

HE LEVELS HIS big gun...

Doc FIRES the shotgun through the "brown wrapping paper point
blank into the squad car, caving in one side of the machine
and blasting the radiator into a steaming wreck.

Homer and Jethro hit the ground, paralyzed with fright as
their car EXPLODES behind them.

With three more BLASTS Doc blows most of the top off the
police car then calmly reloads.

                    DOC
          Slide those guns!

The two cops send their guns clattering across the pavement.

CAROL HAS INSTANTLY MOVED BACK INTO THE CHEVY, started the
engine and begun maneuvering it out onto the street. She
makes a U-turn, then pulls up near Doc.

DOC STEPS FORWARD, KICKS THE TWO PISTOLS BACK UNDER the
police car near the gas tank.

He walks to the back of the car.

Carol throws open the passenger door of the Chevy.

Doc SHOOTS the gas tank of the squad car, it instantly
ignites.

Walking calmly around the burning police car Doc then starts
to climb into the Chevy.

Carol REVS the engine.

Doc pauses a moment, looking back at the prone police
officers and the blazing automobile.

CONTINUED:


Carol guns the car forward -- Doc, unprepared for the Chevy's
sudden movement, falls flat on his face across the pavement.

CAROL THROWS THE CHEVY INTO REVERSE, AND ROARS back to pick
up Doc.

DOC, A LITTLE CHAGRINED, PICKS HIMSELF UP, GRABS his gun and
jumps into the Chevy. He slams the door closed, Carol again
tears forward -- tires peeling down the pavement.

HOMER AND JETHRO RAISE THEMSELVES. With very long faces they
study the burning remains of their once proud squad car.

EXT. HIGHWAY

THE CHEVY SPEEDS OUT OF TOWN,, onto an open stretch of road.

INT. CHEVY

DOC JAMS ONE MORE SHELL INTO HIS PAPER-WRAPPED gun -- Carol
grips the wheel tightly concentrating on the road... the
Chevy continues to accelerate.

EXT. HIGHWAY

THE CHEVY CROSSES THE ROAD'S BROKEN WHITE LINE and passes a
lumbering Greyhound bus.

DOC, STARING AT THE HIGHWAY BEHIND THEM; the bus fades off
into the horizon...

                       DOC
                 (finally)
             Here.

THE CHEVY PULLS OFF THE HIGHWAY, MOVES UP A DIRT road for
twenty yards then pulls into a cornfield of a well laid out
farm, smashing through the six foot high stalks. Well out of
sight, the Chevy slams to an abrupt halt.

DOC AND CAROL, RUNNING THROUGH THE CORNFIELD AND BACK UP THE
DIRT road toward the highway. Doc still carries his gun in
the brown wrapping paper. Carol labors with the suitcase as
she runs.

ON THE HIGHWAY DOC STANDS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD, waving
both arms overhead. The Greyhound bus comes to a lurching
halt, Doc and Carol scramble aboard.

INT. BUS

DOC BUYS TWO FARES FROM THE SCOWLING GREYHOUND DRIVER. The
bus again moves forward.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


DOC AND CAROL SITTING TOGETHER ON THE BUS, Doc hold- 4l4 ing
his camouflaged gun. They lean back on their padded seats as
the bus jostles along the road.

Suddenly... Two Police Cars pass the bus, SIRENS screaming,
lights turning...

Doc and Carol's eyes meet...

One more Black and White passes the bus and races on down the
road.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. TEXAS TOWN - AFTERNOON 4L

DOC WEARS A SUNBEATEN LEATHER JACKET, READING A NEWSPAPER,
while leaning against a hot dog stand. One foot rests on the
suitcase. The Invicta has been re-wrapped in a laundry bag.
The paper is filled with news of the robbery and a mug shot
of Doc.

A GREY MERCURY PULLS UP NEAR THE DOGGIE DINER. Carol is
driving. Doc walks up to the window of the car.

INT. MERCURY

DOC LEANS IN THROUGH THE WINDOW.

          El Paso.

Doc opens the door and moves into the driver's seat.

                      DOC
          How much?

                    CAROL
          Twenty eight hundred.

As she looks at him, he smiles:

                    DOC
          Are you hungry?

                      CAROL
          Not now.

He drives off.

EXT. HIGHWAY - TEXAS - MIDNIGHT 4L

A FRONTAGE ROAD BORDERING THE EDGE OF A GOOD-SIZED TOWN.
Carol now driving,, pulls off the highway and into an "Oasis"
drive-in restaurant.

THE MERCURY COMES TO A STOP WITHIN A ROW OF CARS FACING the
indoor portion of the restaurant.

DOC AND CAROL - INSIDE THEIR AUTOMOBILE AS THE CAR HOP - a
skinny girl, wearing a brown jacket and slacks, approaches
the car carrying two menus. She arrives with a smile. Doc
leans forward, looking past Carol at the waitress, he lifts
his hand, not accepting the bill of fare.

                    DOC
          That's okay, honey. Two cheeseburgers;
          two coffees and a milkshake.

                    GIRL
          How about fries?

                    DOC
              (big smile)
          Why not?

The Car Hop walks back across the raised cement sidewalk
towards the kitchen area...

INT. MOTEL - NIGHT

HAROLD IS TIED TO A CHAIR, RUDY IS LYING ON THE BED, half-
clothed, eating chicken, drinking a beer, while Fran slowly
strips down to bra and panties.

INT. MERCURY AT THE DRIVE-IN RESTAURANT

serving tray onto the car-door window.

                    GIRL
          Could you roll it up part way?

          Sure thing.

The girl clamps the tray to the window. The Car Hop narrows
her features, looking at Doc and Carol then smiles and turns
and heads back toward the kitchen.

DOC REACHES UP AND CASUALLY ADJUSTS THE REAR VIEW MIRROR

THE MIRROR HAS BEEN TURNED TO REVEAL THE HIGHWAY AND THE
ENTRANCE TO THE DRIVE-IN'S PARKING LOT

CAROL BEGINS TO EAT, she looks casually at the mirror.

DOC SLOWLY EATS HIS CHEESEBURGER, TAKES A SIP OF MILKSHAKE

CAROL REACHES FOR HER COFFEE, spills it and then reaches for
the light switch knob on the dashboard.

THE MERCURY'S HEADLIGHTS BLINK ON

THE CAR HOP AT THE PICK-UP STAND, notes the lights 429 then
turns her head the opposite direction, pretending not to see.

DOC WATCHES THE WAITRESS TURN AWAY

THE CAR HOP STARES AT THE CEMENT PAVEMENT. Within the kitchen
behind her the cooks all look toward the parking lot... their
faces expectant.

DOC WATCHING THE WAITRESS

                    DOC
          She made us.

Carol looks into the rear view mirror. Across the wide lot a
police car appears, cutting in off the highway.

Doc goes into the back seat, Carol kicks the engine over,
jams the stick into gear. All this is accomplished while
staring into the rear view mirror.

DOC LIFTS THE LAUNDRY BAG-COVERED SHOTGUN onto his lap.

THE POLICE CAR cruises slowly along the line of autos...

INT. POLICE CAR

TWO OFFICERS SCAN THE PARKING LOT. THE PASSENGER COP CRADLES

THE SQUAD CAR PULLS TO A STOP FIFTEEN FEET behind the
Mercury, seemingly blocking the way.

                    DOC
          Now.

CAROL STANDS ON THE ACCELERATOR. THE MERCURY GOES screaming
forward, as Doc shoots out the back window. Then, as the
terrified cops duck to the side, he shoots out their front
windshield. The Mercury bounces up across the sidewalk as the
empty plates and glasses topple off the serving tray and roll
across the concrete. The car slams back down through a vacant
space on the opposite side, and moves around in a semicircle
across the asphalt, heading for the highway exit.

DOC SMASHES OUT THE REAR WINDOW with the butt of his shotgun.

THE BLACK AND WHITE NOW IN REVERSE, ZOOMING BACK, trying to
get between the Mercury and the highway.

CAROL BRINGING THE CAR AROUND, SHE CAN SEE THE SQUAD CAR
streaking backward. She pulls the wheel to the right and
brings her car across the front of the still stopping Police
Car.

THE OFFICERS TRY TO BRING THEIR GUNS INTO PLAY AS THE Mercury
streaks in front of them.

DOC FIRES THE SHOTGUN TWICE

THE POLICE CAR EXPLODES. THE HOOD IS LIFTED OFF THE CAR. Both
Officers jump out of the vehicle, pouring shots after the
retreating Mercury.

CAROL - SCREAMING AS THE FRONT AND BACK WINDSHIELDS SHATTER
around her.

THE MERCURY, BADLY RIDDLED, PULLS OUT ONTO THE HIGHWAY

ANOTHER SQUAD CAR COMES SPEEDING UP in the opposite
direction. The Driver hits the brakes, the tires smoke along
the street as the Black and White SCREAMS to a stop.

CAROL PULLS THE MERCURY BY THE SQUAD CAR

DOC FIRES ANOTHER TWO BURSTS...

THE POLICE CAR - THE FRONT AND BACK FENDERS ARE HIT; the
wheels disintegrate - the impact of the shells rocks the
Black and White upward.

THE SECOND PASSENGER COP, FIRING A .38 OUT HIS BACK WINDOW at
the Mercury as it streaks down the road. Three holes open up
on the trunk of the auto.

DOC CAN SEE BOTH OFFICERS JUMP OUT OF THE SECOND Black and
White through the rear window. Carol makes a quick turn off
the highway.

THE MERCURY ROARS DOWN THE DARK STREET INTO THE CITY'S
COMMERCIAL SECTION, suddenly slow, makes another sharp turn -
this time through a red light.

DOWN A SMALLER STREET FILLED WITH SHOPS - CAROL ROUNDS THE
CORNER, whips up to the curb - Doc and Carol jump out of the
car. She carries the suitcase, he hangs onto his big gun.

DOC AND CAROL, MOVING DOWN A DESERTED SIDEWALK; the SOUND of
sirens. They round a corner, then quickly move into an alley.

THE ALLEY IS NARROW, DESERTED. DOC AND CAROL pull back into
an alcove as a prowl car goes SCREAMING down the street and
off into the night. They continue down the alley.

THE OPPOSITE ENTRANCE TO THE ALLEY IS BLOCKED BY a large
metal garbage container, and the DRIVER empties two cans of
garbage into it. Then he starts across the narrow street
beyond in order to grab several others.

DOC LOOKS BEHIND HIM, THEN GRABS CAROL'S ARM. They run for
the container. Doc tosses the suitcase into the container,
jumps in, reaches back, pulls Carol in beside him. SIRENS
again sound close by.

AFTER A MOMENT, A LARGE GARBAGE TRUCK PULLS UP, lifts the
container with hooks and dumps the garbage and Doc and Carol
into the truck.

A SERIES OP ANGLES AS A CRUSHER BEGINS TO MOVE TOWARDS THEM
INSIDE THE TRUCK. Doc and Carol start to panic, but they have
room enough.

WITHIN THE TRUCK DOC WIGGLES HIS .45 out of his jacket and
into his hand. He, Carol and the suitcase are crushed tightly
amongst the garbage. A moment after Doc frees his gun, a load
of garbage descends on their shelter, partially obscuring
them.

THE TRUCK PULLS OUT

DOC AND CAROL SWEATING... BREATHING HARD. Again the SOUND of
sirens... the truck lurches forward.

THE TRUCK MOVES ALONG THE EMPTY STREETS, passing several
prowling squad cars.

EXT. STREETS - SERIES OF ANGLES - SUNRISE

THE GARBAGE MAN DRIVING THE TRUCK, MAKING STOPS, throwing in
more refuse. The truck continues along.

DOC AND CAROL - THEIR FACES COVERED WITH PERSPIRATION and
flies... buried within their enclosure under the moist
garbage.

A GARBAGE DUMP - MORNING

THE TRUCK GROWLS ALONG THE RUTTED PATHWAY surrounded by acres
of open trash. Areas within the dump reveal the slow,
smouldering fires...

THE TRUCK BACKS UP TO A HUGE CRATER HALF-FILLED WITH REFUSE

THE DRIVER REVS THE ENGINE, PULLS THE BED LIFT GEAR

THE TRUCK BED RISES AND TILTS FORWARD, as the load of trash
tumbles down the face of the crater.

DOC AND CAROL SLIDE DOWN THE MOUNTAIN OF FILTH, and stumbling
forward they climb into a large cardboard box.

THE DRIVER GETS OUT OF THE CAB, checks to see that the
garbage is gone from the truck bed. On his way back to the
cab he finds a magazine to his liking near a shredded auto
tire. With his newly-found prize, the Driver re-enters the
truck and drives away.

THE BOX LIES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CRATER AMONGST the broken
bottles, melon rinds, flashlight batteries, tin cans, used
tires.

DOC SAWS AT A CORNER OF THE CARDBOARD BOX with his penknife.
The matted paper gives away, allowing them more room within
the box.

                    DOC
          Okay?

                    CAROL
          I think so... I don't know.

Doc puts his hand to her face, wiping away a thin trace of
blood from a scratch.

                    DOC
          It's not deep.

Carol tries to smile for the first time in quite a while.

                       CAROL
          No scars?

                       DOC
          No scars.

Doc looks across the garbage through the open end of the
crate.

THE HEAT AND THE FLIES HAVE BECOME UNBEARABLE. Carol begins
to scratch her leg.

                     DOC (CONT'D)
          Don't scratch it, just rub, you'll get an
          infection.

Carol ignores him, she is in bad shape.

                    DOC (CONT'D)
              (continuing)
          Do what I tell you, it's not a game.

                    CAROL
          It's all a game, don't bother me.

Doc stares at the garbage around them.

                    DOC
          We better stick here till tonight.

                       CAROL
              (down)
          Yeah.

Doc smiles, trying to get her to smile again.

                    DOC
          We're going to make it.

                    CAROL
              (further down)
          Sure...

Carol rubs one hand along her now terribly soiled, tweed
suit.

She looks away from Doc. Doc stares at her mussed hair and
tear-stained cheeks.

                    DOC
          I want to say something.

               (quiet defeat)
           I don't want to hear it.

                     DOC
               (softly)
           Listen to me. It's hard enough.

Carol turns back, faces Doc. Their eyes find one another.

                     DOC (CONT'D)
               (continuing)
           Look, what you said yesterday... I guess
           that was right. It isn't worth anything
           if we don't make it together.

                     CAROL
           I don't think we can any more... If we
           ever get out of here, maybe I should take
           off...

                     DOC
           We got this far.

                     CAROL
           We've come a lot of miles. But we're not
           close to anything.

                     DOC
           I guess you're right.

A pause.

                     CAROL
           I always thought jails make people hard.
           Not you. You're just not tough enough to
           forget about Beynon. I chose you, not
           him.

                     DOC
           Either we pick it up or else we leave it
           right here. We got to go one way or
           another.

                     CAROL
               (setting the condition)
           No more about Beynon.

          I don't see how.

A long moment.

                    CAROL
              (finally talcing Doc's arm)
          Okay.

          We get to Mexico, we can have a life.

                    CAROL
          That's all I want... It's the only thing
          I have ever wanted.

As she pulls herself against him:

                    DOC
          I'm going to try and get it for you.

They pull each other closer, tightly holding one another.

RUDY IS LYING IN BED READING A NEWSPAPER PILLED WITH DOC AND
CAROL. The fact that they have been seen in the North. He
smiles.

Fran is in the bed beside him asleep naked under the sheets.

                    RUDY
              (calling softly)
          Harold, you've had ten minutes, get out
          of there.

No answer. Rudy gets up and crosses to the bathroom.

                                                             91.

INT. FOURTH FLOOR CORRIDOR LAUGHLIN HOTEL - MORNING

LAUGHLIN LEADS RUDY AND FRAN down the dark-walled hallway,
stopping before room number 4l8. Laughlin turns the key in
the lock, opens the door.

                    LAUGHLIN
          It's hard to figure. There's something
          about the composition of the track at
          Pimlico... You can't go by the clock, any
          speed horse, take a second off any other
          track in the country.

INT. ROOM 418

                                                          92.



AS THE GROUP ENTERS.

                    LAUGHLIN
              (continuing)
          ... but a speed horse is the only thing
          that consistently holds form. They got to
          let 'em run, dumb God damn trainers try
          to rate 'em, just breaks their heart.

Rudy kicks the door shut with a slam, grabs Laughlin's
shoulder, spins him around, hits him full in the stomach. As
Laughlin begins to fall Rudy catches him, wallops him again
in the mid-section, then throws him back into a ratty
armchair. Rudy instantly pulls out his .44 and shoves it hard
against Laughlin's mouth.

                    RUDY
          Okay, sweetpea, you get two choices. Live
          or die.

                    RUDY (CONT'D)
          Do what I tell you, you not only get to
          live, but maybe you'll pick up some
          money.

                    LAUGHLIN
              (still breathless)
          Just tell me.

                    RUDY
          First things first. Main thing, you work
          for me, otherwise I get you. If I don't,
          six months from now one of my friends
          will.

          It's all there, departure, arrival -
          everything except the $500.

Doc pays him, looks closely into his eyes. Jimmy hasn't
changed and it's set.

          Then you do it.

                    LAUGHLIN

Doc gives Laughlin a half-pissed look, then crosses to the
elevator and pulls the cage door open.

LAUGHLIN WATCHES THE RICKETY, self-service elevator move
upward. He reaches for the desk phone.

Doc shuts the door and slips his arms around Carol, revealing
his .45 automatic in one hand.

CAROL IS IN THE SHOWER, STEAM HANGS IN THE AIR as she
vigorously soaps her body, cleansing herself of the residue
left from their cross-country flight.

DOC IN THE MAIN ROOM IS STANDING AT THE LARGE windows facing
across to the building next to Laughlins. The fire escape is
one story beneath him. Doc crosses, throws the suitcase on
the bed, undoes the straps and snaps, lifts the lid open. He
stares at the huge amount of money for a moment, then digs
into the suitcase, reaching down to the bottom. He withdraws
his hand, holding four visas.. He puts two of them on the
bureau drawer top... the other two he begins to tear into
sections and places them into a large ashtray. He touches a
match to the scraps.

                (hard)
            Get your clothes on, move your butt.

She looks at him, doesn't move.

                       CAROL
            Sorry. Look, I'm clean. I want to get
            some rest.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

She is interrupted by a hard knock on the door. Doc drops his
shirt to the floor. He quickly reaches down, lifts his .45.
Doc gestures to Carol... she moves towards the door.

                     CAROL (CONT'D)
              (continuing; now at doorway)
          Who is it?

INT. HALLWAY

Fran stands at the door to 318. Rudy is at her shoulder; he
has taken out his revolver.

                    FRAN
          It's your food, I brought up your
          sandwiches...

                    INSIDE 318
          Carol standing near the door., looks at
          Doc. He mouths and half-whispers:

                    DOC
          Stall.

Doc whips his pen knife out of his pocket, crosses the room
to the locked door of an adjoining hotel room. He begins
forcing the lock.

                    CAROL
          Just leave it outside the door... I'm not
          dressed right now.

After a moment:

                    FRAN
          I can't do that, ma'am. You have to pay
          now so I can pay back the boy that went
          out and got the food...

DOC working on the door; his .45 shoved into the waistband of
his pants.

CAROL thinking hard...

                    CAROL
          All right. You'll have to hold on a
          minute, my husband's in the shower...

DOC breaks the lock and opens the door -- he quickly crosses
the dark apartment, moves to the front door, slips out his
automatic, then gingerly cracks the door. His eyes tighten in
amazement as he sees:


                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                             99.
CONTINUED:


RUDY STANDING SLIGHTLY BEHIND FRAN, his .44 held tightly up
to the door jamb, ready for instantaneous use. Rudy and Fran
are 15 feet down the hallway from Doc's slightly opened door.
They both have their backs turned to him in three-quarter
fashion.

DOC BAREFOOTED., BARE-CHESTED; he decides on a course of
action. The door swings quietly open.

WITHIN THE HALLWAY, DOC CLOSES THE DISTANCE between himself
and Rudy in two swift strides, Rudy turns,, swinging his gun,
too late, as Doc's .45 crashes against his head. Rudy drops.
Fran screams. Rudy looks at Doc, still smiling, eyes glazed.

He falls abruptly. Doc stands over the fallen body. Fran
continues to scream. Doc finally turns away from Rudy,
looking now at the screaming woman. He flattens her with a
left hook to the jaw. Fran drops to the floor as if she had
been shot. Suddenly everything in the corridor is silent.

RUDY'S HEAD IS BLOODIED. He lies without movement.

DOC NOW SLAMS AT THE DOOR OF 318

                    DOC
          Open it up, it's me.

Carol swings the door open. Doc bursts back into the room,
grabs his shirt, begins to button it.

                    DOC (CONT'D)
              (continuing)
          Come on, come on.

                    CAROL
          Who was it?

                    DOC
          Just get your clothes on...

THE FOURTH FLOOR CORRIDOR

AS DOC AND CAROL COME BACK OUT OF 318 they step over the
fallen bodies and start toward the waiting elevator.

Carol stops as she recognizes Rudy. Doc pulls her along,
forcing her to keep moving. Carol again carries the brown
suitcase, Doc holds the shotgun. They go down the back (or
front) stairs.

                                                           100.



INT. LOBBY

THE ACCOUNTANT STANDS AT ONE CORNER OP THE RECEPTION COUNTER
IN THE LOBBY OF LAUGHLINS. Within an alcove behind and to one
side of the desk (the area serving as an office) Cully, Swain
and Hayhoe have stretched Laughlin across the pine desk. The
Accountant eyes both the empty lobby and the entrance to the
hotel3 acting as lookout.

CULLY INSIDE THE ALCOVE LIFTS A SNAPPED OFF LEG of the heavy
chair to use as a club. The thug turns back to the desk where
Swain and Hayhoe have Laughlin pinioned.

                       CULLY
             Just tell us the room number.

LAUGHLIN LOOKS BACK AT CULLY. He is very frightened but says
nothing.

CULLY SLAMS THE WOODEN CLUB DOWN ON LAUGHLIN KNEECAP

                       CULLY
             Now you want to tell me?

                       LAUGHLIN
             McCoy's in 318., the other guy's in 420.

                       CULLY
             Sure about that?

He again whacks Laughlin's knee.

INT. LOBBY STAIRS

DOC AND CAROL EMERGE,, MOVING QUICKLY FOR THE. main entrance.
They get five steps before simultaneously seeing the
Accountant.

                       CAROL
             Doc !

Doc and Carol freeze for an instant.

The Accountant snaps his fingers twice.

Cully lowers his club, looks to the Accountant, as do Swain
and Hayhoe. The Accountant smiles, staring at Doc and Carol.

                       ACCOUNTANT
                 (calmly to his men)
             Out here.



                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                           101.
CONTINUED:


CULLY, SWAIN AND HAYHOE APPEAR FROM THE ALCOVE BEHIND the
Accountant. They look over his shoulder toward the rear of
the hotel, their eyes finding Doc and Carol.

INT. WITHIN THE MAIN LOBBY

DOC HAS ONE HAND IN HIS OUTSIDE COAT POCKET, WRAPPED

around the .45. Carol continues to hold the suitcase up in
front of herself, almost like a shield. The distance between
Doc and Carol and the hotel entrance has been effectively cut
off by the four opponents standing near the reception desk.
Carol edges backward a few steps, toward the massive wooden
staircase.

                    ACCOUNTANT
          Just have her set it down.

Doc's hand comes out of his coat pocket, a slow gesture
revealing that his palm is empty.

                    DOC
          You want it? Come and take it.

THE ACCOUNTANT NOW PLANKED BY THE THREE MEN

                    ACCOUNTANT
              (quietly)
          Get him.

As the three men reach for their guns.

DOC MOVES MUCH PASTER. HE DUCKS TO   THE RIGHT, levels the
disguised shotgun and fires in the   same movement. The
reception desk near the Accountant   splinters from the blast
and he is hit painfully. The other   three men duck away from
the sudden burst of fire power.

DOC AND CAROL JUMP FOR THE STAIRS

HAYHOE LEVELS HIS PISTOL AT THE RETREATING COUPLE Another
shot from Doc's riot gun... this one breaking open the floor
at Hayhoe's feet and cutting him down at the knees. Cannon,
Cully, Swain and Max open fire as they dive for cover. They
miss their shots, digging up walls, stairs and flooring.

ON THE WINDING STAIRWAY DOC AND CAROL FLEE UPWARD She
struggles with the heavy suitcase, Doc transfers the riot gun
to his left hand, pulls out the more accurate .45 to use with
his right.

                                                         102.



WITHIN THE LOBBY THE SIX MEN SPLIT FORCES

Cully and the Accountant run to the elevator, enter it, pull
the door shut. Swain and Hayhoe, limping, and Cannon and Max
start for the stairwell in direct pursuit of Doc and Carol.
All the men, save the Accountant, now have guns in their
hands.

SWAIN AND HAYHOE CAUTIOUSLY GOING UPWARD. Still below the
first level landing, their eyes search overhead. The SOUND of
Doc and Carol's pounding feet can be heard.

HAYHOE LEANS OUT OVER THE BANISTER, points his gun directly
up and fires.

DOC AND CAROL BETWEEN THE FIRST AND SECOND FLOOR landings as
Hayhoe's bullet tears by, ripping through the wooden banister
supports.

INSIDE THE ELEVATOR THE ACCOUNTANT AND CULLY WATCH the arrow
indicator pass "Two."

DOC AIMING HIS .45 RESTING IT ON THE BANISTER He fires two
shots back down the stairwell.

SWAIN AND HAYHOE MOVING UP THE STEPS TWO AT A TIME Suddenly
Hayhoe's leg buckles as a .45 slug tears through his hip, the
other bullet ripping the plaster wall near his shoulder.

SWAIN IS NOW BESIDE THE BANISTER, he points his 54l revolver
straight up... empties it.

DOC AND CAROL AS SWAIN'S BULLETS BREAK AROUND THEM. Doc pulls
Carol down, lifts the riot gun and fires down the stairwell
with a huge roar.

THE STAIRCASE TEN FEET IN FRONT OF SWAIN IS SMASHED by Doc's
blast. Swain has to climb over the uprooted planking to
continue moving upward. Cannon following.

THE ELEVATOR INDICATOR STOPPING AT "THREE"

CULLY PULLS OPEN THE DOOR, MOVES OUT INTO THE corridor. The
Accountant remains within the elevator.

SWAIN ON THE STAIRWAY FIRES HIS PISTOL UPWARD

CAROL, ON THE STAIRWAY ABOVE, AS THE SHOTS SMASH PAST, runs
ahead of Doc by three steps. They pass the second landing,
keep moving upwards towards the third.




                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                           103.
CONTINUED:


Doc's focus of attention is downward. He knows that he and
Carol are being pursued up the stairwell, but he isn't aware
of the fact that the gunsels have split their forces.

RUDY ON THE THIRD FLOOR AGAIN RISES LIKE LAZARUS FROM THE
DEAD. His head bloodied from Doc's heavy pistol, he slowly
wobbles to his feet. Rudy looks down at Fran... she sobs
violently, her back leaning against the wall. Rudy picks up
his .44 then stumbles into the open door of Doc and Carol's
room. He unsteadily crosses to the bathroom, closes the door.

CAROL FRANTICALLY MOVING UPWARD, DOC HAS NOW FALLEN five
steps behind.

DOC FIRES THE .45 DOWN THE STAIRWELL AT

SWAIN ON THE THIRD FLOOR

Cully walks cautiously down the corridor, pistol raised. He
moves toward the landing, having covered one quarter of the
distance from the elevator. The Accountant is still within
the elevator.

Carol comes up the stairwell and looks back for Doc. The
SOUND of Swain's pistol and Doc's answering .45. Carol senses
a movement; she turns and sees Cully's gun leveled at her. As
Carol screams:

Doc dives onto the landing facing the corridor... his plane
of movement knee high.,, the riot gun in his left hand, .45
in his right.

CULLY IS HIT IN THE CHEST BY BUCKSHOT. The killing wounds
fling him upward as he fires his own gun... his aim destroyed
by the death blows,, the bullets stray above Carol, high of
their mark.

DOC FIRES THREE TIMES MORE AT THE ELEVATOR CABLE

THE CORRIDOR WALL NEAR THE ELEVATOR IS SMASHED BY ONE OF the
riot gun's jumbo shots, as is the top of the elevator. The
plaster flies away revealing further damage. The cables are
smashed, the elevator breaks loose and plummets downward.

THE EMERGENCY CABLE, INSIDE THE SHAFT

THE MECHANISM TRANSFERS OVER, line catching within the pulley
housing. The line snaps taut - halting the speeding car.

WITHIN THE LOBBY

                                                           104.



AS THE ELEVATOR SLAMS TO A WRENCHING STOP FIVE FEET

ABOVE the floor level. The Accountant bounces from the floor
of the car to the ceiling, then back to the floor.

Laughlin leans across the reception desk in great pain. He
sees the suspended car through the iron grill door.

The Accountant lies completely still on the floor of the
elevator. His head and neck twisted at an oblique angle.

DOC ON THE THIRD FLOOR LANDING

HE JAMS SEVERAL SHELLS INTO HIS RIOT GUN WHILE HOLDING his
.45 ready for an appearance by Swain. Reloading completed, he
stands, with Carol. He again begins to move upward.

SWAIN FIRES FROM THE STAIRWELL

DOC STOPS, SETS BOTH THE RIOT GUN AND THE .45 on 562 the
banister... He waits... on the winding staircase below him
there is a dark movement.

DOC FIRES BOTH GUNS

THE STAIRWELL AROUND SWAIN DISINTEGRATES. The thug is
obliterated by the firepower.

DOC CANNOT SEE THE EFFECT OF HIS SHOTS. He again resumes his
flight upward.

INT. DOC'S BATHROOM

RUDY HOLDS HIS BLOODY HEAD IN THE SINK BOWL, DUMBLY splashing
water over himself. Carol's underwear is still present.
Rudy's pistol lies on the soap tray.

THE LANDING AS DOC AND CAROL COME POUNDING INTO VIEW. No
further avenues open, they turn down the corridor. Doc grabs
Carol and pushes her into the room, past Fran; he kicks the
door shut.

INT. THE ROOM

DOC GRABS THE SUITCASE, RUNS TO THE WINDOW, TEARS off the
shade, lifts the frame, looks. The drop is too far. He grabs
Carol and runs into the hallway.

INT. CORRIDOR

THEY RUN DOWN TWO DOORS AND BREAK IN. Over the door is the
sign "Fire Escape."

                                                         105.



INT. FIRE ESCAPE ROOM

DOC HELPS CAROL OUT ONTO THE FIRE ESCAPE. He aids her with
his left hand, the riot gun now clutched tightly in his
right. He motions, she hands him the suitcase and follows.

EXT. FIRE ESCAPE

THEY DESCEND THE FIRE ESCAPE. They reach the end. The fire
escape stays rigid.

Doc cautiously steps on to the tilted steps. He turns and
with the suitcase crosses to the end. Throws the bag and the
shotgun across the 6 foot gap to the retaining wall,
preparing to jump.

RUDY COMES OUT OF THE ROOM ONTO THE FIRE ESCAPE holding his
.44. He looks down at Doc, then slowly raises his gun. Carol
screams.

DOC JUMPS. RUDY FIRES. DOC IS HIT IN THE SIDE (flesh wound).
In the air he spins and lands. Rudy fires again and again as
he runs down the fire escape. Doc rolls, picks up the shotgun
and fires.

RUDY'S TIME HAS COME. THE JUMBO CHARGES MASH HIM BACK against
the wall and off the fire escape.

CAROL RUNS ALMOST STAGGERING AND GETS READY TO JUMP the six
feet.

THE FIRE ESCAPE. BEGINS TO SINK. CAROL LOOKS AT DOC mutely,
as she sinks beneath the retaining wall.

                    DOC
              (his hand out)
          Jump!

And she does. He catches her and pulls her up.

They look at one another for a long moment, then he stands
and helps her to her feet, and leaving the shotgun behind
they walk into the alley.

RUDY LIES DEAD BEHIND THEM

IN A PARKING LOT AT THE END OF THE ALLEY, SLIM, a tough,
grizzly Western is about to pull out. Doc opens the back door
and Carol gets in. Doc opens the front door as Slim turns and
looks at him.

drop to the sidewalk and into and off a car and into the
street.

The car pulls forward as the light blinks to green.

EXT. STREET

AS THE CAR PASSES AN INTERSECTION, SEVERAL POLICE cars can be
seen arriving at the front of Laughlins.

The car continues moving up the street, then makes a right
onto a larger boulevard.

Doc half turns to Carol.

At the white line a Mexican CUSTOMS OFFICER emerges from the

Slim steps out of the car, Carol moves into the front seat as
Doc slides behind the wheel.

          Thanks. Hope you do too.

          By the way, you're getting a hell of a

              (laughs)
          Well, I paid a hell of a price. Now for

The car pulls forward. Slim waves goodbye, then turns and
begins walking back down the highway.

Carol snaps on the radioj the voice of a Mexican announcer is

THEY ARE WALKING ALONG THE HIGHWAY, THE EDSEL IS now a dot in

     A Christmas card vista is spoiled by a black line of
     railroad tracks stitched onto the snowy landscape like a
     scar pointing north to icy desolation. A phone rings -

     An elderly man who lives alone in this rustic cabin -
     a retired policeman - regards the phone, both expecting
     and dreading the call. He picks up the receiver.

                             MORELL

     Henrik Vanger - at 82, even older than Morell - listens
     to the silence from his end of the line in a wood-paneled
     room as baronial as the policeman's was spartan.
                             VANGER
               I can't take it anymore.
                             MORELL O/S
               I know. I'm sorry, Henrik.

     There's nothing more to say. Vanger sets the receiver
     down and regards a dried white flower in a 6" x 11" frame
     resting on the brown paper it was wrapped and mailed in.
     It's somehow ominous, like the dark storm clouds that now
     burst outside -

     Mikael Blomkvist - 40's - regards the gauntlet of
     reporters he'll have to pass to get out of the building.
     As he strides toward them, microphones and cameras swing
     in his direction. Without stopping -

                             BLOMKVIST
               What is this, the media event of the
               year?
                             REPORTER 1
               Don't try to play it down, Mikael, it
               won't work.

                             BLOMKVIST
               Don't try to play it up, that won't
               either.

     Feeling a bit like he's fleeing the scene of a crime,
     which in a way he is, Blomkvist steps outside opening his
     umbrella. A couple of the reporters come out after him -

                             REPORTER 2
               Will you appeal?
                             BLOMKVIST
               I'll appeal to you, Viggo:   Find a
               real story to cover.
     He hurries off in the rain.

                             NEWSCASTER V/O
               Financial journalist Mikael Blomkvist
               was found guilty today on 16 counts
               of aggravated libel against financier
               Hans-Erik Wennerstrom.

5    INT. CAFE - STOCKHOLM - DAY                                   5

     At a table with a pre-made sandwich and cup of coffee,
     and a long court judgement, Blomkvist watches himself
     fleeing the reporters on the cafe's TV. He's the only
     one there who watches it - no one else is interested -
     which only makes it worse.
                                                            3.
                                                             3.
    

                            TV NEWSCASTER
              In an article published earlier
              this year, Blomkvist claimed
              Wennerstrom - founder and president
              of The Wennerstrom Group - used State
              funds intended for industrial
              development in Poland for an arms
              deal with the right-wing Ustashe in
              Croatia.

    The report cuts to a shot of Wennerstrom outside the
    courthouse in an Armani suit, surrounded by his legal
    team, confidently addressing the reporters -

                            WENNERSTROM ON TV
              I have nothing against Mr.
              Blomkvist. He's a good journalist
              who I don't believe is guided by
              malice. But what he wrote was
              inaccurate, and inaccuracies can't go
              unanswered. He - all journalists -
              have to accept like the rest of us,
              actions have consequences.

    Done with his sandwich, Blomkvist goes to the counter.
                            BLOMKVIST
              Marlboro Red ... and a lighter.

    He comes out tamping the pack. Extracts a cigarette.
    Tosses the pack in a sidewalk trash bin. Flicks at the
    lighter but can't get it to fire in the wind and rain.
    Hunches his body around it, coaxes it to life.

                            TV NEWSCASTER V/O
              Blomkvist was ordered to pay 600
              thousand SKE in damages and all court
              costs, which could be significantly
              more.

    He takes a long drag that dizzies him. A wonderful
    feeling. He regards the trash bin. Fishes around it,
    finds the pack, puts it in his coat pocket.

    He comes through past Christmas decorations and a mostly-
    young staff. They try not to regard him as a dead-man-
    walking, but aren't entirely successful. He enters the
    editor's office.

mini-skirt.

          I have.    Who else?
                        ERIKA
          Everyone who's ever wanted to see
          you humiliated.
                        BLOMKVIST
          You've been on the phone all day
          then.

                        ERIKA
          I'm as much to blame for this as you.

                          BLOMKVIST
          You are?    You wrote it?
                          ERIKA
          I read it.    I ran it.

                          BLOMKVIST
          Not the same.
                        ERIKA
          Our credibility isn't dead, Mikael.

                          BLOMKVIST
          Mine is.
They regard each other in another silence.      Then -
                                                             5.

                             BLOMKVIST
               I'm tired. I feel like climbing
               under a duvet and sleeping for a
               week.
                             ERIKA
               Alone?
     He thinks about it ... shakes his head `no.'

                             ERIKA

     Dragan Armansky, 40's, who looks more like a boss of a

               I'm afraid that doesn't mean much.

               I don't understand.

                             ARMANSKY
               No one here likes her. So it's
               better if she works at home.
                             FRODE
               But you told her I wanted to meet
               her.

                             ARMANSKY

     pierced eyelid - tattoo of a wasp on her neck; probably
     several more under her black leather jacket - black t-
     shirt, black jeans, black Caterpillar boots.

     Frode is only middlingly successful in concealing his
     initial reaction to her. This isn't punk fashion. This
     is someone saying, Stay the fuck away from me.

                             ARMANSKY
               Lisbeth, Mr. Dirch Frode.
                             FRODE
               How do you do?
                                                           7.
                                                            7.
   

She doesn't shake Frode's hand, but does address him:

                        SALANDER
          Something wrong with the report?
                        FRODE
          No. It seems quite thorough.
          There's a wealth of data here. But
          I'm also interested to know what's
          not in it.

                        SALANDER
          There's nothing not in it.

                        FRODE
          Your opinion of him isn't.

                        SALANDER
          I'm not paid to give my opinion.

                        FRODE
          So you don't have one?

Salander sends Armansky a weary look. His look back
begs her not to say anything unpleasant. Eventually -
                         SALANDER
          He's clean.   In my opinion.

                        FRODE
          He's - excuse me?

                        SALANDER
          He's honest. He's who he presents
          himself to be. In his business,
          that's an asset.

                        FRODE
          There's less in his asset column
          after his conviction today.
                        SALANDER
          That's true. He made a fool of
          himself with that. If it happened
          that way.
Frode looks at Armansky.    What's that supposed to mean?

                        SALANDER
          If he made up the story, that's
          out of character. So is giving up
          without a fight. People don't do
          things that are out of character.

                        FRODE
          Are you saying he was set up?
                                                        8.
                                                         8.


                        SALANDER
          That wasn't part of my assignment.

And, apparently, she has no opinion on it either.
                        FRODE
          You're quite right he made a fool of
          himself professionally. How big of a
          fool did he make of himself
          financially?

                        SALANDER
          The judgement will just about empty
          his savings.
This seems to please Frode more than anything else that
has been said, and Salander sees it.
                        SALANDER
          May I go?

                        FRODE
          Your report is light in another
          area. His personal life. Anything
          you chose not to include?
                        SALANDER
          Nothing that warranted inclusion.

                        FRODE
          I'm not sure if that means yes or no.

                        ARMANSKY
          I think what Ms. Salander means, and
          I agree, is that everyone has a right
          to a certain amount of privacy, even
          when they're being investigated.

                        FRODE
          Not in this case. I have to know
          if there's anything about him I might
          find unsavory - even if she doesn't.

Armansky's look to her at once apologizes for Frode, and
encourages her to speak. She finally relents but puts no
more spin on it than any other piece of raw data -
                        SALANDER
          He's had a long sexual relationship
          with his co-editor. It wrecked his
          marriage, but not hers. Her husband
          accepts it. Sometimes she sleeps at
          Blomkvist's, sometimes at home.

Frode thinks about that, perhaps imagining how much
simpler his own life would be with such an arrangement.
                                                              9.
                                                               9.
      

                              FRODE
                You were right not to include that.

                              SALANDER
                I know.
                              FRODE
                Anything else?
                              SALANDER
                No.

                              FRODE
                Please think before you say no.
                              SALANDER
                I did.
                              FRODE
                I don't want to be surprised by
                something later.

      Salander offers nothing more.

                             FRODE
                So. Nothing else. In the personal
                department. You're sure.

                              SALANDER
                     (pause)
                He likes sandwiches.

      Blomkvist isn't sentimental, but does have a few framed
      snapshots: his daughter, his sister, and one with Erika -
      in their 20's - in which he's wearing a black leather
      jacket.

      She wakes up alone in his bed. Pads to the darkened
      living room to find him typing on his laptop, a half-
      eaten sandwich and glass of water next to it.

                              ERIKA
                Usually when I wake up in a cold
                bed, it's at home.

                              BLOMKVIST
                Sorry.

                              ERIKA
                What are you doing?
                                                              10.

                 Writing the press release.

                               ERIKA
                 Saying -
                               BLOMKVIST
                 You're taking over as publisher.
                 You're sorry for any nuisance
                 Wennerstrom was caused. I can't be
                 reached for comment.

                               ERIKA
                 You're giving up.
                               BLOMKVIST
                 Just taking a few steps aside.
                 For you.
                               ERIKA
                 This makes me sick.

      Salander sits alone at a table waiting for someone with
      a coffee and a gift haphazardly wrapped with a Christmas
      bow, the price tag still on it, a paperback book - My 60
      Memorable Games, by Bobby Fischer. She notices the price
      tag is still on it. Peels it off. Dials a call on her
      cell. Hangs up when it goes to voice mail.

      She knocks on a door. Hears classical music playing
      softly inside, but no one answers. She tries the door.
      It's unlocked. The gift in hand, she pushes it open.

      She comes into an apartment which looks like it could
      belong to a professor. Sees a chess piece on the floor.
      Then a trail of them that lead her to an overturned chess
      table and, next to it, a body.
      The gash on the old man's head could have been caused
      by a fall into the corner of the table, or from a blow to
      it. She quickly tries to determine if he's breathing.
      Calls for an ambulance.

19    INT. BLOMKVIST'S APARTMENT - STOCKHOLM - EVENING          19

      It's doubtful there's a stranger Christmas gathering
      going on anywhere in the world. Standing around with
      eggnog are:
                                                          11.
                                                          11.
  

Blomkvist; his teenage daughter Pernilla; his sister
Annika and her Italian husband; Erika and her weirdly
understanding artist husband Greger, whose arm is around
her waist; a few other friends (and perhaps lovers).
                        GREGER
          You needed a better attorney.       You
          needed your sister.
                          BLOMKVIST
          She offered.

                          ANNIKA
          He declined.
                          BLOMKVIST
          As she hoped.
                        ANNIKA
          Never a good idea mixing family and
          business.

                        BLOMKVIST
          And I still would have lost.

                        GREGOR
          Did you have ... anything on him.

                          BLOMKVIST
          I had a lot.    It just wasn't any
          good.

                        ERIKA
          It wasn't even about Mikael. It
          was Wennerstrom sending a message to
          the press as a whole - and the FSA:
          Don't ask questions.

Blomkvist's daughter seems concerned for him.
                        BLOMKVIST
          I'm fine, Nilla. You don't have to
          worry about me.

                        PERNILLA
          Mom's worried.
                          BLOMKVIST
          About me?

                        PERNILLA
          About all that money.
                                                               12.

     Outside the ICU, Salander sits on the floor like a dog
     who won't leave the spot its master told it to wait. For
     the first time since we've met her, she looks vulnerable.
     The doors swing open. A doctor steps out. Salander gets
     up to hear his report -

                              DOCTOR
                You're Mr. Palmgren's daughter?
                               SALANDER
                His ward.   He doesn't have a
                daughter.

     The doctor isn't sure then if he should talk to her.
                               SALANDER
                Please.

     Not allowed to go inside, she peers through glass at
     Palmgren, who is unaware of her, or the nurse attending
     him, or even himself. A spiderweb of tubes emerge from
     his neck and wrists; oxygen tubes from his nostrils.

                              DOCTOR V/O
                He's had severe cerebral
                hemorrhaging. Either from the
                fall itself, or a stroke that led to
                the fall. His blood pressure is
                still high. I'm hopeful he'll regain
                consciousness, but that's not
                assured. And it's possible, if he
                does, there will be neurological
                damage.

     They're around the dinner table now, passing platters
     around. Blomkvist notices his daughter's head is bowed
     in silent prayer.

                                BLOMKVIST
                Nilla?    What are you doing?

          I don't want to talk about it since
          I know you won't approve.

                        BLOMKVIST

          Light of - what?
               (she doesn't repeat it)
          What is that?

                        PERNILLA
          You think it's all senseless but it
          isn't. It's more natural to believe
          in something than not to.

She begins eating. Blomkvist stares at her, feeling a
little sick. A cell phone rings. No one can tell - as
you never can - whose it is, and so all pull them out.
It's Blomkvist's.
                        BLOMKVIST
          Excuse me.
Looking back at his daughter with some concern, he steps
away to take the call.

                        BLOMKVIST
          Hello.
                        FRODE O/S
          Mr. Blomkvist?

                        BLOMKVIST
          Yes.

                        FRODE O/S
          Forgive me for intruding on your
          Christmas. My name is Dirch Frode.
          I'm an attorney. I represent Henrik
          Vanger. Perhaps you've heard of
          (him) -

                        BLOMKVIST
          Of course.
                        FRODE O/S
          He'd like to speak to you about a
          private matter.
                                                               14.

                              BLOMKVIST
                You know, you're calling at an
                awkward time.

                              FRODE O/S
                I'm sorry. I'm about to sit down to
                Christmas dinner myself.
                              BLOMKVIST
                That's not what I mean.

                              FRODE O/S
                You're referring to your recent
                legal trouble. That has provided Mr.
                Vanger with some entertainment.
                               BLOMKVIST
                Excuse me?

                              FRODE O/S
                He doesn't care for Wennerstrom
                either.

      Frode, in his polite, deliberate way, is reeling
      Blomkvist in like a perch.

                              BLOMKVIST
                Have him call me.
                              FRODE O/S
                He'd like to meet in person if that's
                okay. Up north. Hedestad.

                               BLOMKVIST
                No.   Sorry.

                              FRODE O/S
                He's much too old to make a trip to
                Stockholm, Mr. Blomkvist. Please.
                If you'd be so kind as to consider.

      Blomkvist isn't sure what to do, or say.
                              FRODE O/S
                Hedestad is lovely in winter.      Like a
                Christmas card.

23A   INT. METRO - MOVING - STOCKHOLM - MORNING                 23A

      Salander rides a crowded underground train, but feels
      even more cut off from the people around her than usual;
      completely alone.
                                                              15.
                                                              15.
      

24    EXT. NORRLAND COAST - DAY                                 24

      A passenger train, barely visible in a severe snowstorm,
      makes its way north. This is no Christmas card.
24A   INT. SJ TRAIN - MOVING - DAY                             24A

      Blomkvist stares out at the bleak, northern landscape.
25    EXT. TRAIN STATION - HEDESTAD - DAY                       25

      Blomkivist disembarks to find Frode - who he can only
      assume is Frode - beyond a veil of snow, waving to him
      from outside a Mercedes. Unlike Blomkvist, he's dressed
      for this God-awful weather in a fur-collared topcoat.

26    INT/EXT. MERCEDES / HEDESTAD - DAY                        26
      Frode's Mercedes comes across a long bridge linking the
      old industrial town to a rocky island.
                              FRODE
                First time in Hedestad?

                              BLOMKVIST
                And last, I'm sure.
                              FRODE
                It's lovely in the spring.

                              BLOMKVIST
                You said it was lovely in winter.

                              FRODE
                This is unseasonable.

                              BLOMKVIST
                I'll be on the 4:30 train back to
                Stockholm.

                              FRODE
                Unless we get snowed in ... I'm
                joking. You'll be home tonight, if
                that's what you wish.

27    INT/EXT. MERCEDES - HEDEBY ISLAND - DAY                   27
      The car comes up a long, bare-tree-lined drive, leading
      to a stately manor. As Frode and Blomkvist climb out, a
      distant gunshot echoes, but neither Frode nor the old man
      who appears at the front door of the manor pays it any
      attention; just someone hunting.

                               VANGER
                Welcome.   Come inside.    It's warm.
                                                               16.
                                                               16.
       

28   INT. VANGER MANOR - DAY                                     28

     It is warm inside. There are fires in the fireplaces.
     And Vanger himself is warm in nature, yet speaks quickly
     as they come through the house -
                             VANGER
               Thank you for coming way out here.
               Anna, take Mr. Blomkvist's
               insufficient coat. Would you like to
               freshen up? We'll be having dinner
               later. For now, hot tea is waiting.
               Unless you'd like a drink instead.
               What would you like?

                             FRODE
               Mr. Blomkvist would like to be on the
               4:30 train back to Stockholm.

                               VANGER
               What?

                             BLOMKVIST
               I can't stay for dinner.

     Vanger looks thoroughly disappointed.      Or hurt.

                            VANGER
               Oh. I guess I'd better be quick
               then. Thank you, Dirch. Mikael,
               this way.
29   INT. VANGER'S STUDY - DAY                                   29

     Tea service and pastries on a coffee table separate
     Blomkvist from Vanger, whose elderly frame is in danger
     of being swallowed up by a wing-back chair.

                             VANGER
               What do you know about me?
                             BLOMKVIST
               That you used to run one of the
               biggest industrial firms in the
               country.

                              VANGER
               Used to.   That's correct.

     There are framed black and white photographs on a wall -
     factories and trains figuring into all of them.
                                                              17.
                                                              17.
      

                               VANGER
                 My grandfather forged the tracks
                 the 4:30 train will take you home on -
                 and most of the other pre-state-owned
                 rail lines.   We stitched this
                 country together. We made the steel
                 and milled the lumber that built
                 modern Sweden.
                      (pause)
                 You know what our most profitable
                 product now is?
                      (Blomkvist doesn't)
                 Fertilizer.

      Blomkvist imagines he's meant to offer a wistful shrug.
                               VANGER
                 I'm not obsessed with the declining
                 health of the company, but I am with
                 the settling of accounts - and the
                 clock is ticking. I need your help.

                               BLOMKVIST
                 Doing.

                               VANGER
                 Officially, assisting me with my
                 memoirs. But what you'd really be
                 doing is solving a mystery. And
                 you'd do that by doing what you do so
                 well - this recent legal mishap of
                 yours notwithstanding. You'd be
                 investigating thieves, misers,
                 bullies, and malcontents - the most
                 detestable collection of people
                 you'll ever meet ... my family.

      She exhumes an unwashed bowl from a sinkful of dirty
      dishes, fills it with tap water without rinsing it, dumps
      a packet of ramen noodles in, puts it in a microwave.

      She takes a Coke can from an anemically-stocked fridge
      to a desk in her so-called living room, a clutter of full
      ashtrays, fast food wrappers, empty soda cans, paperwork,
      unwashed laundry.

      The only things of any value here are her MacBook and
      several external hard drives.

      NOTE:   Changes below are INSERTS only:

     She types Dirch Frode in the search window. Clicks on
     the top result which takes her to Frode's bio on Vanger
     Industries' site with its distinctive V.I. logo.

     His official company photo accompanies his profile:
     Uppsala University Law School ... Assistant Counsel,
     Vanger Industries, 1965-1972 ... Head Counsel, 1972-
     present.

     She types in another search - Hans-Erik Wennerstrom.
     Clicks on his Wikipedia page, which shows a photo of him
     alongside his bio. She skims it -
     President of the investment firm, Wennerstrom-gruppen ...
     personal wealth of 12 billion dollars (80 billion kronor)
     ... 82-foot yacht, villa on the island of Varmdo ...

     She does a third search, types:
     Wennerstrom+Vanger Industries - and hits the `cached'
     option -

     There are only a couple of results that include both
     terms. She goes to one of them, a body of text of some
     old page with the cached terms highlighted in yellow and
     blue, and reads -

     ... Hans-Erik Wennerstrom, CPA, Vanger Industries
     Accounting Dept., 1971-1972 ...
     Hmmm.

     incompetents" play on a beach. A shutter blinks freezing
     a 12-year-old girl in foreground in black and white -

                             VANGER V/O
               This is Harriet. The granddaughter
               of my brother Richard.

32   INT. VANGER'S STUDY - DAY                                 32
     The same photograph of Harriet in a photo album Vanger
     shows Blomkvist.
                             VANGER
               Richard, who I may as well start
               with to get it out of the way, was a
               Nazi of the first order - joining the
               Nationalist Socialist Freedom League
               when he was 17.
                                                         19.
                                                         19.
 

A page in the album turns to reveal a photo of a young
man in a uniform with a Nazi pin.

                         VANGER
           Isn't it interesting how fascists
           always steal the word freedom.
                (Blomkvist checks his watch)
           The 4:30. Yes. Okay. Anyway,
           Richard died a martyr to the Nazi
           cause in 1940 - missed all the real
           excitement - but not the opportunity
           to regularly beat his wife Margareta
           and their son, Gottfried.

We see photos of Gottfried, a handsome young man.

                         VANGER
           Now, Gottfried - Harriet's father -
           was what people used to call a Good-
           Time-Charlie.

                         BLOMKVIST
           They're still called that.
                          VANGER
           Are they?   Okay.
INSERT:   Close on a photo of Gottfried.

                         VANGER
           He was a charmer, a ladies man, a
           drunk. In other words, a born
           salesman - which is what he did for
           the company - traveling around,
           taking clients out to dinner and so
           on.

                         BLOMKVIST
           Someone has to do it.
                        VANGER
           That's right. Anyway, he died in
           1965. Drowned. Drunk. Here on the
           island.
A studio photo: Gottfried with his wife and two children.

                         VANGER
           His wife Isabella - who was pretty
           much useless before as a parent -
           became even more so after his death -
           which is when I began looking after
           their children - Martin - who runs
           Vanger Industries now that I'm
           retired - and Harriet.

     A photo of a much younger Vanger and 15-year-old Harriet.

                              VANGER
                She was bright and curious, a
                winning combination in any person.
                              BLOMKVIST
                And beautiful.
     Vanger nods as he regards the photo ...

                              BLOMKVIST
                Something happened to her?

     Vanger nods again; is silent for several moments ...
                              VANGER
                Someone in the family murdered
                Harriet and for the last forty years
                has been trying to drive me insane.

                It was September 21st, 1966.    A
                Saturday. Harriet was 16.

36   EXT. VANGER ESTATE - DAY - 1966                           36

     Three generations of Vangers dot the grounds.

                              VANGER V/O
                My brothers - along with their
                wives, children and grandchildren -
                had gathered here for our loathsome
                annual board meeting and dinner. It
                was also the day the Yacht Club held
                its Autumn parade.

37   EXT. HEDESTAD - DAY - 1966                                37

     And we see the parade, and, among the spectators lining
     the town's main street, Harriet with other teenage girls.
                                                             21.
                                                             21.
     

                             VANGER V/O
               Harriet and a couple of school
               friends had gone into town to watch
               it. She returned a little after two
               o'clock.
38   INT. VANGER'S PARLOR - DAY - 1966                         38

     A clock in the room reads, 2:10.    Vanger and a few family
     members sip afternoon cocktails.    Harriet appears.

                             VANGER V/O
               She came to the parlor. She asked
               if she could talk to me. I honestly
               don't remember what I was doing that
               I thought was more important, but I
               told her to give me a few minutes.
     She leaves.   He returns to the others in the room.

                             VANGER V/O
               But in a few minutes, before I could
               go upstairs to talk to her, something
               else occurred.

39   EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - DAY - 1966                           39
     A car and a fuel truck, both going too fast, collide on
     the bridge. The truck rolls onto its side crushing the
     car and spewing gasoline.
                             VANGER V/O
               The accident had nothing to do with
               Harriet - and everything.

     Vanger and the others react to the noise of the crash.
     Out the large window they can see the bridge and many of
     those on the grounds trotting down to get a closer look.

                             VANGER V/O
               It was chaos as everyone dropped what
               they were doing.

41   EXT. THE BRIDGE - DAY - 1966                              41
     People and vehicles converge on both sides of the bridge.

                             VANGER V/O
               Police, an ambulance, fire brigade,
               reporter, photographer and onlookers
               quickly arrived from town, as those
               of us on the island - the family -
               hurried to the bridge from our side.
                                                              22.
                                                              22.
      

      The truck driver has managed to climb out of his cab, but
      the other motorist is trapped.

                               VANGER V/O
                 The driver of the car - a Mr.
                 Aronsson - was pinned and severely
                 injured. All we could do was try to
                 pry him out with our hands - since
                 metal tools could spark.

      A local newspaper photographer and another man, snap
      pictures as Vanger and others try without success to pry
      the injured driver from his car. As the chaos ensues -

                               VANGER V/O
                 About twenty minutes after the crash,
                 Harriet was in the kitchen. Anna
                 herself saw her.
42    INT. KITCHEN - VANGER MANOR - DAY - 1966                  42

      Anna glances to Harriet as she comes in, then back out
      the window to the bridge. Harriet passes a clock that
      reads 2:35, steps outside, walks toward the woods ...

43    EXT. THE BRIDGE - DUSK - 1966                             43
      As the sun sets, Vanger and the others on the bridge make
      progress extracting the driver from the car. A young man
      coming from the town side takes off his jacket to help.
                               VANGER V/O
                 We finally got poor Aronsson out of
                 his car and off to the hospital, and
                 those of us on our side drifted back
                 to the house.

44    INT. VANGER MANOR - NIGHT - 1966                          44

      The family has assembled at a long dining table.

                               VANGER V/O
                 The sun was down, the excitement
                 over, we sat down to dinner. That's
                 when I noticed Harriet wasn't there.

      Vanger considers an empty chair as everyone else,
      including the young man from the bridge, his jacket
      draped on his chair, passes platters of food around.

                               VANGER V/O
                 And she wasn't there the next
                 morning. Or the next. Or the next
                 forty years.

45    INT. VANGER'S MANOR - DUSK - PRESENT DAY                 45

      Vanger has the same look of concern on his face now as he
      leads Blomkvist up some stairs.

                              VANGER
                What was she going to tell me? Why
                didn't I make time for her? Why
                didn't I listen?

                              BLOMKVIST
                She couldn't have run away?

                              VANGER
                Not without being seen.

45A   EXT. THE BRIDGE - NIGHT - 1966                           45A
      The crews continue their work under lights.

                              VANGER
                Firemen stayed on the bridge all
                night pumping out the gasoline. And
                no one swam across, or took a row
                boat. All of them were still tied up
                on this side Sunday. Believe me, we
                checked.
45B   INT. VANGER MANOR - DUSK - PRESENT DAY                   45B

                              BLOMKVIST
                She couldn't have fallen and drowned?

                              VANGER
                The currents aren't strong here.
                Anything that falls into the water
                turns up nearby. Like her father.
                His body didn't drift more than ten
                meters when he drowned the year
                before.
      Vanger's pauses at a landing to steady himself and his
      labored breathing.

                              VANGER
                No. Someone killed her, Mr.
                Blomkvist. Someone on the island
                that day. Someone close enough to
                know what she used to give me each
                year on my birthday.
      He unlocks the door of the attic and pushes it open to
      reveal a cluster of nine dusty framed dried flowers on a
      wall.
                                                             24.
                                                             24.
     

                             VANGER
               These were from her.

     And, on another wall, forty similarly-framed flowers -
                             VANGER
               These, from her killer.
     Blomkvist regards the forty ...

                             BLOMKVIST
               Who knows about these?

                             VANGER
               Me, the police, the murderer ...
               and now you.




46   EXT. STOCKHOLM - DUSK                                     46
     It's raining as an elegantly-dressed woman slows before
     a luxurious apartment building. Salander approaches from
     the other direction. Passing, she notes the four number
     tones the woman keys in the code lock.

     The door buzzes open and the woman disappears inside.
     Salander doubles back and keys the same four number tones
     in the Milton Security lock.
47   INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - STOCKHOLM - CONTINUOUS          47

     Opulent foyer. Security camera. Antique elevator cage
     whose cables pull the woman upstairs. Salander comes to
     an unlocked service door and takes stairs to a basement
     machine room. Examines tangles of phone lines, meters,
     Wi-Fi routers. Photographs them with a digital camera.
     She climbs the stairs back up to the foyer. The front
     door buzzes, and a man in a suit on the sidewalk pushes
     it open, sees her, holds it wide enough for her to pass.

     The man is a driver/bodyguard. He continues to hold the
     door for his employer who now emerges from the back of an
     idling car and crosses to it in the rain ... Wennerstrom.

48   EXT. VANGER'S MANOR - NIGHT                               48

     The rain here is icier and more punishing.

                             VANGER V/O
               When the police investigation petered
               out, I kept at it -
                                                            25.
                                                            25.
    

49   INT. VANGER MANOR - NIGHT                                49

     They're eating dinner now in the dining room.

                             VANGER
               - studying their reports and
               interviews, all the information there
               was, and it's a lot. I've spent half
               my life examining the events of a
               single day.
     And for all that, he's no closer to the truth.

                             BLOMKVIST
               I understand your frustration.
               But what you're asking me to do is
               a waste of money.
                             VANGER
               We haven't discussed your fee.
                             BLOMKVIST
               We don't need to. I can't find
               something you haven't been able to
               in forty years.

                             VANGER
               You don't know that. You have a
               very keen investigative mind.

     Blomkvist wonders why he ever agreed to come here as
     Vanger refills his wine glass.
                             VANGER
               Here's what I propose: You come
               stay on the island. I have a nice
               little cottage by the water you can
               use. You study the material I give
               you. You find something I've missed
               - or you don't.

                             BLOMKVIST
               You want me to set aside my life
               and career for something that's a
               complete waste of time.

                             VANGER
               Think of it as a well deserved
               vacation. A way of avoiding all the
               people you want to avoid right now.
                    (nothing from Blomkvist)
               As for compensation, I'll pay you
               twice your salary for as many months
               as it takes. I'll quadruple it if
               you solve the mystery.
                                                             26.
                                                             26.
     

                              BLOMKVIST
                Mr. (Vanger) -

                              VANGER
                I'm not done. I'll throw in one
                more thing - even though you're a
                terrible negotiator. It's what you
                want more than anything else and it
                can't be bought at any price. I'll
                give it to you ... Hans-Erik
                Wennerstrom.

      He pushes toward Blomkvist a plate: the carcass of the
      fresh-killed and cooked duck they've been eating. It and
      the mention of Wennerstrom's name clouds, at least for a
      moment, Blomkvist's memory of the train he missed.
                              VANGER
                He began his career working for me.
                And I've followed it with interest,
                shall we say, ever since. You were
                right about him. You just couldn't
                prove it.

50    INT. PLAGUE'S APARTMENT - STOCKHOLM - NIGHT                 50

      Salander climbs a flight of stairs in a building that
      couldn't be more different than Wennerstrom's. Knocks
      on a door, waits, listens to some dead-bolts unlocking.

      It opens, but remains impassable by a figure weighing
      over 300 pounds. He offers her no greeting. Fades back
      into the shadows of his dark apartment.

                              PLAGUE
                Would you like to sit? I could
                possibly clear a place if necessary.

      It's hard to imagine how he or anyone might accomplish
      that. The place is like a junkyard. Even the unmade bed
      is covered with stuff.
                              SALANDER
                Did you make it?
                              PLAGUE
                Have you something for me?

      She takes some cash from a pocket, hands it to him.    He
      counts it and is unimpressed with its total.

                              PLAGUE
                I'm on welfare; I don't administer
                it. This isn't enough.
                                                              27.
                                                              27.
     

                              SALANDER
                I had to pay three months back rent
                and eat a little bit. It's all I
                have right now.
                              PLAGUE
                I find that so poignant.
      So much so that he does nothing more than look at her.
      She reaches to take the money back, but he pockets it and
      moves across the dark room to a work table where high-end
      computers fight for space with debris. Finds and gives
      her a small homemade electronic box, which she turns over
      in her hands.

      While it's clear both these people are deficient in
      behavior that governs polite society, it's hard to tell
      which lacks it more.

                              PLAGUE
                No `thank you?'
51    INT. MILLENNIUM OFFICE - EARLY MORNING                    51

      Erika, first to arrive this morning, or so she thinks,
      comes through the empty offices with a Wayne's Coffee to-
      go cup - but Blomkvist is already there, packing supplies
      from his desk, books from his shelf. A second suitcase,
      presumably full of clothes, sits on the floor.
                              ERIKA V/O
                You can't be serious -

51A   INT/EXT. MILLENNIUM'S OFFICES - EARLY MORNING - LATER    51A
      He zips the suitcase with the supplies in it closed and
      gathers the rest.

                              ERIKA
                We're in our worst crisis ever and
                you're writing a memoir?
                              BLOMKVIST
                You fired me; I need something to do.
                              ERIKA
                You fired you; I need you here, not
                the North Pole. You know what this
                is going to look like.

                              BLOMKVIST
                Like I've been gutted. Like I'm
                running away. I am.
      They cross through the building, he with his cases, she
      with her coffee cup.
                                                            28.
                                                            28.
    

                             BLOMKVIST
               Wennerstrom wants to see me waving
               a white flag, not a red one. And the
               more it looks like there's a problem
               between you and me, the more it'll
               satisfy him.

                             ERIKA
               There is a problem between us. He
               won't be satisfied until he shuts us
               down, and you're leaving me to fight
               him alone.

     He kisses her but gets back no more than he would from a
     statue - and steps outside.
                             BLOMKVIST
               It's four hours by train.   It's not
               the North Pole.
52   EXT. TRAIN STATION - HEDESTAD - DAY                      52
     The depot thermometer reads 0. Blomkvist disembarks with
     two suitcases. This time, Frode isn't there to meet him.
     He struggles with his luggage through the snow to a taxi
     stand.
53   INT. TAXI - MOVING - DAY                                 53

     As a taxi passes a gas station by the bridge, Blomkvist
     regards the Middle Eastern driver's eyes which regard him
     in the rear view mirror.
                             BLOMKVIST
               Think this snow's going to let up
               anytime soon?

                             HUSSEIN
               This is the North Pole.

54   EXT. COTTAGE - HEDEBY ISLAND - DAY                       54

     The taxi deposits Blomkvist outside a cottage. From here
     he can see Vanger's manor and couple other houses. The
     taxi drives off and disappears into the snow.
55   INT. COTTAGE - DAY                                       55
     Two rooms. Fireplace. Pile of wood. A realtor would
     call it cozy. In truth it's just tiny and freezing cold.

     Blomkvist unpacks. Puts clothes in a wardrobe, sets out
     books, note pads, pens, CD's, a CD player, his laptop and
     a small printer.
                                                               29.
                                                               29.
       

     He flips open his cell phone to make a call. Gets no
     reception bars. Hears a faint, plaintive cry and traces
     it to a window, beyond which, on the sill outside, stands
     a cat peering in. He opens the door, and the cat heads
     straight for the kitchenette. Then looks at him.
                                BLOMKVIST
               What.   Milk?

     He opens the old fridge.    No milk.    Nothing.
56   EXT. COTTAGE - DAY                                          56

     He comes out into falling snow holding his cell phone
     out in front of him like a dowser divining ground water.
     Moves around trying to get a signal. Can't.
57   INT. MARKET - HEDESTAD - DUSK                               57

     He purchases milk, butter, a loaf of sliced bread, some
     packaged lunch meats and a few cans of cat food.
58   EXT. HEDESTAD - DUSK                                        58

     He walks along the street through wind-whipping snow,
     cradling the grocery bag, cell out in front of him again.
     Any of the locals could tell him he could do this forever
     - there are no cell towers anywhere around here.

59   EXT. HEDESTAD - DUSK                                        59

     Grocery bag at his feet, he dials a call with fingers he
     can no longer feel on the gas station pay phone by the
     end of the bridge. It goes to Erika's voice mail.

                             BLOMKVIST
               It's me. I'm here. It's fucking
               cold and I'm on a pay phone. If you
               tried to call, the reception sucks,
               and if you tried to email, there's
               none of that either, so - so - I'm
               here - and - I can't even speak it's
               so fucking cold.

     He hangs up, open the same pack of cigarettes from
     before. Eighteen in there. Struggles to get one lit in
     the wind and snow, hurries off toward the bridge.

60   INT. COTTAGE - NIGHT                                        60

     As the cat laps at milk on a plate, Blomkvist tries to
     get a fire going using pages ripped from a book. It's a
     struggle he's going to lose; he's no Boy Scout.
                                                             30.
                                                             30.
     

61   EXT. WENNERSTROM'S BUILDING - NIGHT                       61

     Salander appears and keys in the four lock tones.
62   INT. WENNERSTROM'S BUILDING - NIGHT                       62
     In the machine room again, she pulls one cable away from
     the others and wires to it to Plague's electronic box.
63   EXT. HEDESTAD - DAWN                                      63

     The bell in the church tower clangs -

64   INT. COTTAGE - DAWN                                       64

     But it's a knock that draws Blomkvist awake. Having
     forgotten where he is, he regards the cat sleeping with
     him, then the room, and groans. He pads to the door in
     the freezing cold. Opens it to find a rugged older man
     on his doorstep with a handcart loaded with file boxes.

                              NILSSON
               I'm Gunner.   The caretaker.
65   INT. COTTAGE - LATER - DAWN                               65

     As Gunner expertly builds a fire in the fireplace for
     him, Blomkvist works at unpacking the boxes - documents,
     fat police reports, notebooks, folders, photo albums.

                             NILSSON
               You're an author.
                             BLOMKVIST
               I'm writing a biography of Mr.
               Vanger, yes.

     Nilsson nods, but isn't sure he believes it. Maybe he
     took a look inside the boxes before he brought them down.
                             NILSSON
               I saw you on television.
                             BLOMKVIST
               That's unfortunate.

                             NILSSON
               Bit of trouble, I guess.

     Blomkvist nods and hopes that's enough to put an end to
     the subject. It isn't.

                             NILSSON
               No jail time, though. That's good.
               Cost you a lot of money though, yeah?
                                                             31.
                                                             31.
    

     Blomkvist shares his annoyance with the cat. Nilsson
     dusts himself off, satisfied with the fire he's made.

                                NILSSON
               There.
66   EXT. VANGER ESTATE - DAY                                  66

     Vanger has ventured outside to show Blomkvist around
     the estate. Smoke from chimneys rise into bitter cold
     grey skies, weather for which Blomkvist, unlike the old
     man, is inadequately dressed.

                             VANGER
               The island is owned by my family.
               Your closest neighbor is my brother
               Harald, another Nazi if you can
               believe. Two in the family. He's
               detestable to put it nicely, but
               you'll probably never see him. He's
               a recluse.

                             BLOMKVIST
               He was there that day?

                             VANGER
               Indeed he was.

     Vanger's look to Blomkvist adds, `so consider him a
     suspect.' He indicates another house on the grounds -
                             VANGER
               That's his daughter Cecilia's house.
               They don't speak.

                             BLOMKVIST
               Does anyone speak to anyone on this
               island?

                             VANGER
               Actually, Isabella - Harriet's mother
               - who lives there -
                    (points)
               - she speaks to Harald - which is one
               of reasons I don't speak to her.
                    (points)
               Cecilia's brother Birger lives there.
                             BLOMKVIST
               Who doesn't he speak to?
                             VANGER
               You, probably. Not that you'd want
               him to. He can be as unpleasant as
               Harald.
                                                        32.
                                                        32.


                        BLOMKVIST
          I'm quickly losing track who's who.

                        VANGER
          Oh, how you'll wish were it always
          so. Soon you'll know us all only too
          well - with my apologies.
               (points)
          Out there is my nephew Martin's
          house; Harriet's brother.

It's a modern house - lots of glass - out on the point.

                        BLOMKVIST
          Who speaks to him?
                        VANGER
          I speak to him. He runs the company
          now, as I think I told you.

They hear a distant rifle crack and echo.     It startles
Blomkvist a bit, but not Vanger.

                        VANGER
          Someone shooting their dinner.
          Gunner probably. The caretaker.
                        BLOMKVIST
          I just met him.
                        VANGER
          He was 19 when Harriet disappeared.

Old enough, Blomkvist gathers, to be considered a
suspect. Vanger points off -
                        VANGER
          He lives over there.

Shivering in the cold, Blomkvist turns.
                        BLOMKVIST
          And you live here.

                        VANGER
          Sorry?
                        BLOMKVIST
          Your house.

For a moment, Vanger isn't sure what Blomkvist means.
Then he is, and is pleased by it.
                                                                    33.
                                                                    33.
     

                              VANGER
                Yes, you're right. The man who
                hires the detective should always be
                kept on the suspects list.

67    INT. PALMGREN'S APARTMENT - DAY                                 67

      A nurse takes a tray away, leaving Salander alone with
      Palmgren, separated by the chess table they won't playing
      a game on. She wipes his mouth with her sleeve.

                              SALANDER
                I got a call from social welfare.
                I've been assigned a new guardian.

      It's unlikely he understands what she has said.        It's
      unlikely he even knows she's there.

68    INT. COTTAGE - NIGHT                                            68
      Tacked to a wall, a map of the island on which Blomkvist
      has written the names of the living Vanger family members
      and staff in the approximate locations of their houses.
      Next to it - 3x5 cards and photos - a Vanger family tree -
      which doubles as a suspects list. On some of the cards
      is the word, `deceased.'
      He makes a sandwich. Refills a coffee cup. Begins
      reading the police reports. The first is a photocopy
      of a note when the call from Vanger came in: "Officer
      Morell informed by telephone of situation, 10:19 p.m."

69    EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - NIGHT - 1966                               69

      Gustaf Morell stands at the bow of a patrol boat slowly
      motoring past the bridge where the fire brigade works to
      pump the gasoline from the overturned truck.

      INTERCUT: Blomkvist reads, "Morell on site, Hedeby
      Island, 11:42 p.m."

70    INT. VANGER MANOR - NIGHT - 1966                                70
      Morell, feeling like he's entered an Agatha Christie
      locked room mystery, regards the extended Vanger clan
      sitting in the living room looking suitably worried.

                              MORELL
                I'd like to see the girl's room.

                              VANGER
                It's down the hall.
                                                              34.

                             MORELL
               I thought this was your house.

                               VANGER
               It is.    She lives with me.
                             MORELL
               Are her parents alive?
                             VANGER
               Her mother is.

     Vanger points Isabella out. Slender, overdressed and
     smoking a Sobranie, she immediately strikes Morell as a
     woman as venomous as she is beautiful.
                              VANGER
               This way.
     Morell follows Vanger down a hall -

     INTERCUT: Blomkvist reads, "Approx. 12:05, inspected
     missing girl's bedroom. Found - "
71   INT. HARRIET'S ROOM - VANGER MANOR - DAWN - 1966           71

     A purse on the desk in Harriet's room. Morell carefully
     removes the contents: Comb, pocket mirror, handkerchief,
     wallet containing a few kronor, her ID, and her address
     book. He leafs through this.
                             DET. MORELL
               I want to speak to everyone here.
               That'll take all night so you might
               want someone to put some coffee on.

                             YOUNGER VANGER
               What about the search?

                             MORELL
               First thing in the morning.
                             YOUNGER VANGER
               No. We should do it now. She could
               be hurt out there.

     Vanger is either a good actor or has nothing to hide.
                              VANGER
               Please.   I beg you.
     INTERCUT: Blomkvist reads, "authorized our patrol boat
     and two volunteer craft to begin 12:20 a.m. - G. Morell."

      The weird tableaux of characters, awaiting their
      interviews with Morell. At the moment, he's across the
      room with Harald Vanger, taking notes, drinking coffee.

      Search parties crisscross the island, wade through
      ditches, check old barns, shine flashlights up chimneys.
      Woodsmen with blood hounds comb through woods.

                               MORELL V/O
                 We searched for days ...

      A train bisects the landscape.   Blomkvist looks out.
                               MORELL V/O
                 Eventually, much to his dismay - and
                 mine - I had to talk to Henrik about
                 calling it off -

      As the search continues, Morell, looking like he hasn't
      slept - which he hasn't - peers down a rocky cliff to the
      water. Somehow he knows they're never going to find her.

                               MORELL V/O
                 The fact that I never found a body
                 didn't surprise me. You can't dig

      The same face - forty years older - the man who spoke to
      Vanger on the phone about the dried flowers - now speaks
      with Blomkvist as he scrapes out the bowl of his pipe.
                                                         36.
                                                         36.
 

                          MORELL
          But   I also couldn't find a motive.
          Was   it spontaneous? Was it planned?
          Did   she know something someone wished
          she   didn't? Was it about business?
                         BLOMKVIST
          Business?   She was sixteen.
                        MORELL
          And very bright. Henrik told me he
          could easily imagine her running the
          business someday, which would mean
          someone else wouldn't.


                        BLOMKVIST
          She was with some friends that day.
          At a parade. You must have talked to
          them.

                        MORELL
          She told them she wasn't feeling
          well. She left early. But they also
          said she kept secrets from them, too.
          The main thing I learned talking to
          them for hours is that teenage girls
          are complicated.
                         BLOMKVIST
          I have one.

                        MORELL
          So you know.
               (Blomkvist does indeed)
          Did you bring the last gift Henrik
          received?

                        BLOMKVIST
          It's at the National Forensic Lab.

                        MORELL
          I can tell you what their report
          will say now: It's a flower common
          to Europe. All of them are. No
          prints. No DNA.
He lights the pipe.   Blomkvist watches the tobacco glow.

                        BLOMKVIST
          I wanted to ask you about this.

He produces an old address book from his jacket pocket.
Of course, Morell has seen it before, and handles it
delicately. The decades have dried out its pages.
                                                       37.
                                                       37.
                       Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ

                        MORELL
          She received this from Henrik the
          Christmas before. I studied it more
          times than I can say. I know every
          page of it.
                        BLOMKVIST
          It's the last page I'm curious about.
                        MORELL
          As was I.

                        BLOMKVIST
          The only names not alphabetized.
Morell nods that he knows that only too well as he turns
to that last page. On it, in neat handwriting:
Magda 32016 Sara 32109 R.J. 30114 R.L. 32027 Mari 32018

                        MORELL
          They're local Hedestad phone numbers.
          The first belonged to a woman named
          Margot, whose mother was Magda, who
          claimed she didn't know Harriet. The
          fourth, R.L., belonged to Rosemarie
          Larsson, an elderly woman who died a
          few years before. The other three
          were unconnected in any way that I
          could find.
He hands the address book back. It, and everything else
about the case, clearly trouble him still.

                        BLOMKVIST
          I've reminded you of things you'd
          rather forget. I'm sorry.

                        MORELL
          I can't forget it. It's my Rebecka
          Case.

Blomkvist isn't sure what that means.

                        MORELL
          Every policeman has at least one
          unsolved case. Back then it was old
          Torstensson. Year after year he kept
          returning to one - taking out the
          files - uselessly studying them. As
          young men, we had to laugh.
                        BLOMKVIST
          Was this also a missing girl case?
                                                             38.
                                                             38.
    

                             MORELL
               No, that's not why I mention it.
               The Rebecka Case is something that
               happened before Harriet was born.
               I'm talking about the soul of a
               policeman. Poor Torstensson could
               never solve it, and could never let
               it go.
     And neither can poor Morell with his Harriet case.
78   EXT. STOCKHOLM - DAY                                      78

     An unexciting social welfare building.

79   INT. BJURMAN'S OFFICE - DAY                               79

     As a man behind a desk reviews   a thick file, Salander
     reviews him: About 50; spends    money on suits, thinking
     that might disguise his public   servant status; no wedding
     ring; typical creep, as far as   she's concerned.

                             BJURMAN
               How's Mr. Palmgren doing? I was
               told he had a stroke of some kind.
                    (nothing from Salander)
               Terrible.

     It is, but she can tell he couldn't care less.     He leafs
     through her file -
                             BJURMAN
               What exactly do you do at this
               security company?

                             SALANDER
               Make coffee and sort mail.

                             BJURMAN
               But not full-time. Not even part-
               time consistently. They somehow got
               along without coffee or mail in July
               and August?

     Nothing from her.
                             BJURMAN
               How much do you earn there?

                             SALANDER
               Enough.

                             BJURMAN
               How much is your rent?
                                                       39.
                                                       39.
                       Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ

                        SALANDER
          I pay my rent.

                        BJURMAN
          When's the last time you were late?
                        SALANDER
          Never.
                        BJURMAN
          Do you think that ring in your eyelid
          makes you attractive?

Salander, who's had to suffer insufferable officials all
her life, doesn't dignify the question with an answer.
                        BJURMAN
          Here's the problem. There a
          discrepancy between the obligation of
          Mr. Palmgren's guardianship and the
          management of your finances.

                        SALANDER
          It isn't a discrepancy or a problem.
          It was clear to him I could manage my
          own finances.
                        BJURMAN
          But that's not clear to me.
                        SALANDER
          I'm not a child.

                         BJURMAN
          No.  You're not.
                (looks at her too long)
          But you were. And between then and
          now -
                (indicating the files)
          - two years in the locked ward at
          St. Stephens, for violent aggression -
          failure to adapt to four foster homes
          and seven schools - arrested twice
          for intoxication, twice for narcotics
          use, and most recently for assault:
          a bottle smashed into a man's face.
          You may have conned Mr. Palmgren into
          thinking you've improved, but looking
          at this -
                (the file)
          - not to mention how you're looking
          at me now - I can see you haven't.
          So the Good-Old-Mr-Palmgren-Days are
          over. Starting now, you'll be given
          a monthly allowance. You'll provide
          me with receipts for your expenses.

                                                              40.
     
                              BJURMAN (CONT'D)
                If the numbers don't balance, I'll
                have to assume the difference is
                going to drugs.

                              SALANDER
                I've been on my own since I was
                twelve.
                              BJURMAN
                No. You've been a persistent burden
                to the State since you were twelve.

      She won't look at him any more - not that there's
      anything even remotely interesting to see if she did.
                              BJURMAN (CONT'D)
                Ms. Salander? Please look at me.
                Because this is important.
      She does ... in a way that says, I'd like to kill you.

                              BJURMAN
                This behavior you're displaying
                right now is elaborately documented
                here -
                     (in the file)
                - so it would come as a shock to no
                one if I chose an alternative to the
                lenient arrangement I just outlined.
                Is that what you're saying with your
                silence? You'd prefer
                institutionalization?
79A   INT. BJURMAN'S OFFICE BUILDING - DAY                     79A
      Salander steps into the elevator, hits the down button.
      As the doors close -

80    EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - EVENING                              80

      Martin's house didn't look so far away, but the road
      Blomkvist has to climb to reach it, and the fact he, like
      all writers, is out of shape, taxes him. A car driven by
      an attractive woman in her 30's pulls alongside him.
                              LIV
                Mikael?
                     (he manages a nod)
                We're going to the same place.
                Hop in.

81    EXT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - EVENING                             81

      Martin, wearing an apron, opens the door to find both his
      dinner guests on the porch.
                                                             41.
                                                             41.
     

                             LIV
               I found him at death's door halfway
               up the hill.

                             BLOMKVIST
               I'm afraid I'm a bit out of shape.

                             MARTIN
               No, it's a climb for anyone. I
               should've warned you. Come on in.

     Blomkvist puts a bottle of aquavit in Martin's hand.
82   INT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT                               82

     The place is far cry from Vanger's manor. It's modern.
     Martin, Liv and Blomkvist work on the dinner Martin has
     prepared. Soft jazz music issues from somewhere.
                             LIV
               I used to work in the company's
               petrochemical division in Goteborg.
               When it was sold, I went with it.
                             MARTIN
               A dark day.

                             LIV
               I live in Hong Kong now, but come
               back to Stockholm for family events,
               and when I do, I drive up to spend a
               couple days with Martin.
                             MARTIN
               She comes for the moose steak.

                             BLOMKVIST
               Is that what this is?

     They all glance away to a sound: A soft, strange,
     wailing wind. Martin drains the last of a bottle of wine
     in Blomkvist's glass and gets up.
                             MARTIN
               Something's open. You like this one,
               or would you like to try something
               else?

                             BLOMKVIST
               That one's good.

     Martin heads off to the kitchen. Blomkvist and Liv,
     left with each other, seem unsure what to talk about.
                             LIV
               I saw you on Sky News a while ago.
                                                             42.
                                                             42.
  

                        BLOMKVIST
          That was a dark day.

                        LIV
          Sorry to remind you of it.
                        BLOMKVIST
          It's okay. There are worse things
          than libel - though I can't
          immediately think of one in my
          business.

                        LIV
          You're writing a book now, Martin
          said.
                        BLOMKVIST
          Henrik's biography.
                        LIV
          I love Henrik. He's fascinating.
          Martin, too. Together they're the
          Old Sweden and the New.

                          BLOMKVIST
          They are.
                        LIV
          You know about Harriet, right?

Blomkvist doesn't say.    The sound of the wind stops.
                          LIV
          You don't?

                          BLOMKVIST
          I do.

Martin emerges from the cellar with a bottle of wine in
hand and returns with it to the dining room.
                        LIV O/S
          The family doesn't like to talk about
          it, but it can't just be swept under
          the rug.

          What can't.

                          LIV
          Harriet.

Martin doesn't comment.    Just nods.    Silence.   Then -
                                                       43.

                        BLOMKVIST
          Maybe we could talk about that
          later.

                        MARTIN
          We can talk about it now.
               (Blomkvist glances to Liv)
          Liv knows everything about my crazy
          family. Which is why she'll never
          marry me.

                        LIV
          That's one reason.

She holds up her left hand. A wedding ring is on it.
The couple seems very comfortable with each other, not
unlike Blomkvist and Erika.
                        MARTIN
          Don't put that in your book.
          Anything else is fine. Harriet
          certainly. Everything changed after
          that. Not just the family, but the
          company.

                        BLOMKVIST
          How so.

                        MARTIN
          We're not Nordea or Ericsson, but
          we're still the largest family-owned
          company in the country. At the
          height, we had 40,000 employees. We
          have about half that now, and that
          downward slide - anyone can tell you -
          began after my sister's death. It
          broke Henrik's entrepreneurial
          spirit, and his heart.

And Martin's, too, clearly.    Blomkvist dares to ask, as
innocently as possible -

                        BLOMKVIST
          You were here that day?

                        MARTIN
          Everyone was here, though I didn't
          get in until after the accident on
          the bridge. The 4:30 train.

                        BLOMKVIST
          I know it well.
                                                              44.
                                                              44.
      

                             MARTIN
               It was a terrible day. And the days
               after - searching and not finding her
               - were even worse.
     Liv sets her hand atop her boyfriend's.

                             MARTIN
               This event, Mikael, has to be a
               big part of your book.

     Blomkvist promises him with a nod that it will.
83   INT. STOCKHOLM METRO - DAY                                 83

     As Salander moves with a crowd toward the doors of a
     subway car, someone behind her roughly yanks the strap of
     her messenger bag from her shoulder -
     She gives chase, pushes past people, catches up with the
     junkie, grapples with him. He slugs her. She goes down,
     but doesn't give up. Catches up with him on the
     escalator, throws him back down it. The bag slams onto
     the metal stairs, too, but at least she has it now.

     She doesn't run. She waits at the top and watches the
     junkie drag himself up and think about trying again. He
     wisely decides to let it go, hops to the down-escalator
     and disappears into the underground station.
84   INT/EXT. COTTAGE - DAY                                     84

     Blomkvist sifts through a box containing some of
     Harriet's personal belongings: school papers, textbooks,
     a Bible, the address book, her wallet and ID ...

     A knock on the door. He puts the box in a closet on top
     of others, kicks it closed, opens the front door to find
     a not unattractive woman in her 50's on his porch.
                            CECILIA
               Hi. I thought I'd come over and say
               hello. I'm Cecilia.

85   INT. COTTAGE - DAY                                         85
     Cecilia regards Blomkvist's Vanger family tree on the
     wall. Wherever he only has an old photo, there's a Post-
     It next to it that reads: Recent Photo?
     INSERT of Cecilia's photo, taken when she was a teenager,
     and a Post-It with her name on it.

                             CECILIA
               We're all uncomfortable with the
               idea of a chronicle of our family.
                                                          45.
                                                          45.
  

                         BLOMKVIST
           It's not about the family. It's
           about Henrik and the company.

                          CECILIA
           Like I said.

                         BLOMKVIST
           It's not my intention to present a
           malicious portrait of anyone.

                         CECILIA
           Unlike the one that landed you in
           court.
                         BLOMKVIST
           Unlike that one. Correct.
                         CECILIA
           So, what you're saying is, you're
           not really here to look into what
           happened to Harriet.

Silence.   Then -

                         BLOMKVIST
           I can't ignore such a dramatic event,
           but no, that's not by any means my
           focus.
                         CECILIA
           So all those boxes Gunner carted
           down here - which are where? - in the
           closet now? - weren't Henrik's
           private investigation.
                (Blomkvist can't think fast
                 enough to respond)
           I wonder sometimes who's crazier - my
           Nazi father or my obsessed uncle.
INSERT of the photo of Young Harald in his Nazi uniform
on the wall.

                         BLOMKVIST
           Since we're talking about it, since
           you brought it up, what was Harriet
           like?

                         CECILIA
           I'm sure Henrik has told you.
                         BLOMKVIST
           He was my age then, and so couldn't
           know what was really going on with a
           teenager any more than I can with my
           own daughter. You were her age.
                                                             46.
                                                             46.
     

                           CECILIA
             Actually, my sister Anita was closer
             to her in age.

INSERT of the photo on the wall of Anita, taken when she
was about 17 years old.

                           CECILIA
             She knew Harriet better than anyone -
             certainly better than I did. You
             should talk to her.

                           BLOMKVIST
             I'd love to, where is she.
                           CECILIA
             If I had to guess - London.
                           BLOMKVIST
             You don't know where your own sister
             lives?

                           CECILIA
             I haven't seen her in years.       We
             never really got along.
                           BLOMKVIST
             I'm getting used to that comment.

                           CECILIA
             That's the way it is when you're
             always after the same boys.

                           BLOMKVIST
             People generally get over that sort
             of thing at a certain point.

                           CECILIA
             Oh, I'm long over it, and won't
             ever have to worry about it again.
             She hates this place even more than
             I do. She left, moved to London and
             that was it. You couldn't pay her to
             send a Christmas card, much less
             visit.
                           BLOMKVIST
             I'll try to track her down for you.

                             CECILIA
             Don't bother.
                           BLOMKVIST
             For myself then.

He smiles.    She studies him.      Maybe he's not so bad.
                                                               47.
                                                               47.
       

                             CECILIA
               If you do, and try talking to her
               about us, don't be surprised if she
               tells you to fuck off.

     Salander against the store window, cell phone to her ear.
                             SECRETARY V/O
               I'm sorry, he's booked all day.

                             SALANDER
               It'll take five minutes.      It's
               important.

                               SECRETARY V/O
               Hold, please.
     Salander waits. Watches people stare at her like they
     always do. The secretary comes back on.

                             SECRETARY V/O
               Seven o'clock.

88   INT. OFFICE BUILDING - STOCKHOLM - NIGHT                    88

     Salander comes past a janitor waxing a long, otherwise
     empty corridor. At the far end, she opens her new
     guardian's office door.

89   INT. BJURMAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT                               89
     As Bjurman reviews a McJesus invoice, Salander waits.
     The thick atmosphere reminds her of all the others she
     has sat in with school principals, shrinks and cops.

                             BJURMAN
               Have you ever had an STD?
                    (nothing from her)
               When's the last time you were tested
               for HIV?

                        BJURMAN (CONT'D)
               (nothing)
          How many partners have you had in the
          last month?
               (nothing)
          How many were men?
That last one seems to amuse him; none amuse her.
                        BJURMAN
          I'm required to ask you these things.
          It's a matter of health.

                        SALANDER
          Write down anything you want.
Bjurman sighs. Sets the form aside and looks at the
McJesus invoice again.
                        BJURMAN
          Why do you need such an expensive
          computer?

                        SALANDER
          For work.

                        BJURMAN
          Making coffee and sorting mail.

                        SALANDER
          I shouldn't even have to ask. I
          should have control of my money like
          before.

                        BJURMAN
          And you will. Once you show me you
          can be sociable and get along with
          people. Can you do that?
               (nothing from her)
          Shall we start with me?
               (pause)
          Shall we start now?

As he comes around the desk, she eyes a sharp letter
opener sticking out above some pens in a coffee mug a
child has painted with the word, `daddy.'
                        BJURMAN
          If you're nice to me, I'll be nice to
          you. That's how normal people are.

He stands in front of her, his crotch at her eye level.
                        BJURMAN
          You've done this before.   You know
          what to do.

                    (she doesn't do anything)
               Do you want this computer or not?

     He takes her hand and places it on the crotch of his
     trousers.
                             BJURMAN
               You feel that? That's gaberdine.
               Unzip them.
                    (she does)
               And ...

               And ...
                    (she doesn't move; he smiles)
               I like the reticence. I prefer a
               whore who pretends she isn't. It's
               almost convincing.
     He grabs her hair and roughly pulls her head toward him.

     Salander eats some toothpaste in Bjurman's private
     bathroom. When she returns to the office, she finds him
     calmly writing a check.
                              BJURMAN
               Here you go.   As promised.

     He holds it out to her, but when she reaches for it,
     pulls it back a little.

                             BJURMAN
               I know you're not thinking about
               telling anyone about our date. Enjoy
               your computer games.
     She takes the check and leaves.

     He sprays Binaca in his mouth. Then, careful to look
     both ways, crosses the street to an investment bank.

     Blomkvist approaches a desk.       The brass name plate on it
     reads, Anita Vanger.
                             BLOMKVIST
               Excuse me. I'm sure I should have
               made an appointment.

                               ANITA
               It's fine.    Please.     Have a seat.

     The accent is all British. She's been here much longer
     than her home country. No trace of Swedish anymore. He
     offers his hand -

                                BLOMKVIST
               I'm Mikael.

                              ANITA
               Mikael.   How do you do.

     As he sits, she regards him a little more carefully ...

                             ANITA
               You're looking for investment
               counseling, Mikael?
                             BLOMKVIST
               I would if had any money to invest.

                                ANITA
               Excuse me?

                             BLOMKVIST
               I'm writing a biography of your
               uncle Henrik. That's why I'm here.
     She stares at him. He waits for the response Cecilia
     predicted, but it doesn't come.

                              BLOMKVIST
               Good.   Engaging. I like him.

     She does, too.
                                             51.
                                             51.
             Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ

              ANITA
I haven't seen him in over 30 years.
Or my sister. Or anyone else in my
family.
              BLOMKVIST
Most of what I'm writing about
predates that, so your recollections
are valid.

              ANITA
I wouldn't know where to start, if
that was a question.

              BLOMKVIST
I can narrow it. I've gotten up to
the 1960s. To the event that altered
everything in Henrik's life.
              ANITA
Harriet.
     (he nods)
Everything I knew about that I told
to - whatever his name was - that
policeman - when it happened.
             BLOMKVIST
Morell.

              ANITA
My recollections then were a lot
better than they are now.

              BLOMKVIST
I'm not speaking of the crime itself.
I'm trying to get a clearer sense of
what Harriet was like. Particularly,
toward the end.

              ANITA
She was messed up. Like all us
Vanger kids. Crazy mother. Drunken
father. At least hers wasn't a Nazi
like mine.

              BLOMKVIST
Was he abusive?

             ANITA
Mine?
             BLOMKVIST
Hers.
                                                            52.
                                                            52.
    

                             ANITA
               I never saw it myself, but you could
               tell something was going on. One day
               she'd be withdrawn. The next she'd
               be putting on makeup and wearing the
               tightest sweater she had to school.
               The next she'd be studying a Bible
               like a nun - no Vanger was ever
               religious - can you imagine?
               Obviously, she was very unhappy.

                             BLOMKVIST
               She never confided in you what about,
               specifically?
                             ANITA
               There was no specifically. It was
               everything. It was being part of
               that family. Henrik's the only
               decent person in it.

                             BLOMKVIST
               What do you think happened to her?

                             ANITA
               Everyone knows what.
                             BLOMKVIST
               But you have no ... thoughts about
               why, or who.
                             ANITA
               All I know is I always felt sorry
               for her. Even more than for myself.
               I got out of there when I was 18 and
               never went back. She would have done
               the same but didn't make it to 18.
96   EXT. STOCKHOLM - DAY                                     96

     Salander, on a park bench, debates with herself if she
     wants to make the call on the cell in her hand. She
     scrolls to "NB" and hits send. It connects.
                             SALANDER
               Mr. Bjurman, please. It's Lisbeth
               Salander.
                    (the call is put through)
               ... I'm fine. I'm sorry I missed
               our appointment. I had a lot of work
               ... no, nothing to be concerned about
               ... I need another advance on my
               allowance. Can I come to your office
               tonight? ... I don't need a pen,
               what's the address?
                                                                 53.
                                                                 53.
         

97    EXT/INT. HEDEBY ISLAND - TAXI - MOVING - DUSK                97

      The taxi that first brought him here to the island,
      crosses the bridge. Again, Blomkvist regards the Middle
      Eastern driver, who regards him in the rearview mirror.
98    EXT. BJURMAN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT                    98

      Outside the building's entrance with a backpack slung
      over her shoulder, Salander presses an apartment button.
      As she waits, she notes there's no security camera.

                                 BJURMAN O/S
                   Yes?

                                 SALANDER
                   It's me.

      The door buzzes.     She pushes it open.
99    INT. BJURMAN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT                    99
      She moves along a hallway with both purpose and dread.
      Knocks on his door ... It opens, revealing him in a robe.
                                 BJURMAN
                   Come on in.

100   INT. BJURMAN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS                       100

      She takes in the layout quickly: living room, dining
      area, kitchen, short hallway to a closed door.

                                 BJURMAN
                   Like it?

                                 SALANDER
                   It's nice.

                                 BJURMAN
                   It's home.
                        (pause)
                   So, what do you need money for this
                   time? Grand Theft Auto 5?

                                 SALANDER
                   Food.
      He smiles.    Steps toward her.    Lifts her chin.
                                BJURMAN
                   How are you? Been thinking about
                   last time? Decided you wanted to see
                   me again?
                                                                54.
                                                                54.
       

                               SALANDER
                 I just want my money.

                               BJURMAN
                 Well, let's see if I can help you out
                 with that.

       He walks to the hallway. She doesn't. He holds out
       his hand. She finally joins him. As they step into the
       bedroom, he roughly pushes her toward the bed.

                               SALANDER
                 Wait.

       She puts her backpack and leather jacket on a chair.
       Sits on the edge of the bed. He stands over her. She
       knows what she's supposed to do, but seems unable to.
                               BJURMAN
                 Is there a problem?

                               SALANDER
                 I just want to know, am I going to
                 have to do this every time I need
                 money to eat?
                               BJURMAN
                 It's so cute when you do that surly
                 thing. Take my hand
       She reaches out to it and before she can react, there's
       a handcuff around the wrist. He quickly cuffs the other
       to his own wrist. This is bad. She tries to get out.
       He gets her in a strangle hold and chokes her into
       unconsciousness.
100A   INT. BJURMAN'S APARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT                 100A

       She comes to, on her stomach, sees her wrists cuffed to
       the headboard posts, her ankles secured to the foot posts
       with silk ties, and scissors slicing her jeans off. She
       starts to scream and he stuffs her mouth with her
       underwear.
                                BJURMAN
                 Please.   I have neighbors.

       He lights a couple candles.   Switches on some New Age
       music.

                               BJURMAN
                 What we're going to do now is teach
                 you the value of money.

       He watches her struggle. But she's not going anywhere.
       He tears open a condom package with his teeth.
                                                                 55.
                                                                 55.
         

                               BJURMAN
                 I forget - did I ask you before if
                 you liked anal sex?

       He crams a pillow under her stomach and climbs on top
       of her. She keeps fighting but there's not much she can
       do handcuffed. Eventually, she retreats to another place
       inside herself. She's had to go here before in her life;
       it's the only place to go in such situations.

101    INT. COTTAGE - NIGHT                                       101

       The cat turns its head to a sound Blomkvist can't hear.
       He has Harriet's box of belongings out again and looks at
       photos of her school friends in her wallet. Then picks
       up the Bible. Handwritten on the inside cover is Harriet
       Vanger. He opens it at random. Hebrews:

                               HARRIET V/O
                 Faith is the assurance of things
                 hoped for, the evidence of things not
                 seen. Through faith we understand
                 that the world was created by the
                 word of God - and that what is seen
                 was not made of things that are
                 visible ...

       He sets it down. Rubs his eyes. Everything - his
       daughter, his life, this cabin, the word of God - is
       depressing.
101A   INT. BJURMAN'S APARTMENT - DAWN                           101A
       Dawn light outside the living room window.

       Bjurman, at his dining table with a glass of orange
       juice, writing out a check.

       In the bedroom, Salander slips on her leather jacket,
       shoulders her backpack, hobbles out to the living room.
                               BJURMAN
                 I'll drive you home.
                               SALANDER
                 I can get home on my own.

                                 BJURMAN
                 Are you sure?

       It's bizarre: his manner seems to be one of genuine
       concern. She nods. He hands her the check. Then opens
       the door for her like a perfect gentleman.

                               BJURMAN
                 So, next Saturday, here?
                                                               56.
                                                               56.
       

      She nods.   Leaves.   The door closes.

102   EXT. STOCKHOLM - DAWN                                     102

      A lone figure hobbles through the empty streets.
103   INT. SALANDER'S APARTMENT - DAWN                          103

      She sets a check down. On the memo line he's neatly
      written, "for food." She takes a bottle of water from
      the fridge and drinks.

104   INT. SALANDER'S APARTMENT - DAWN                          104

      Shower water hits the dragon tattoo on her shoulder
      blade and runs down past several others. By the time the
      water reaches the drain it has turned red.
105   EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - DAY                                  105

      Coming through trees with a bag of groceries, Blomkvist
      sees a BMW parked outside his cottage.

106   EXT. COTTAGE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY                        106

      Blomkvist taps on the car's fogged-up driver's window.
      A hand inside wipes at it, revealing Erika. She lowers
      it a crack.

                                ERIKA
                  Is it any warmer inside?
                                 BLOMKVIST
                  No.

107   INT. COTTAGE - DAY                                        107

      As he tries to get some logs in the fireplace going,
      using more pages torn from one of his books, Erika wraps
      herself in a blanket. The cat, who has no trouble with
      the cold, naps on the paperwork on the desk.
                                BLOMKVIST
                  What have I missed besides you?
                                ERIKA
                  The steady exodus of two-thirds of
                  our advertisers.

                                 BLOMKVIST
                  Seriously?

                                ERIKA
                  Is that hard to believe? Sitting up
                  here in Lappland with your cat?
                                                                57.
                                                                57.
        

                               BLOMKVIST
                I'm not.   I'm working.

                                ERIKA
                I can see.
      What she can see is the Vanger research covering the
      walls and table surfaces, and that the threads of the
      family tree lead to a photograph of Vanger at the top.

                              BLOMKVIST
                Would you like to meet him?

                              ERIKA
                Maybe in about an hour.      If you're
                interested.

      He is.
108   INT. VANGER MANOR - EVENING                                108

      Vanger and Martin all but ignore Blomkvist as they chat
      with Erika over dinner. They seem charmed by her.

                              VANGER
                I apologize if you're having
                financial problems at the magazine
                in Mikael's absence.
                              ERIKA
                We'll work through them.
                                VANGER
                Are you sure?

      Erika looks at Blomkvist, but he hasn't talked to them
      about this.

                              MARTIN
                How long do you think you can hang
                on? Six months or so?
                              ERIKA
                That sounds about right.

                              VANGER
                     (cheerfully)
                You know, I used to be in the
                newspaper business. We owned six
                dailies back in the 50's.
                              MARTIN
                We still own one. The Courier, here
                in town.
                                                          58.
                                                          58.
  

                         VANGER
           I let my nephew Birger run it since
           he can't run anything else.

Erika nods politely.
                         MARTIN
           So what do you say to taking on a
           partner?

                         ERIKA
           We've never considered it before.
           We value our independence.

                         MARTIN
           Your independence is dependant on
           advertisers - if we're being honest.
           However much you think that is, you'd
           retain. We don't care about content.

Blomkvist suddenly feels like someone coming late to a
party.

                          BLOMKVIST
           Excuse me.   Did I miss something?
                         VANGER
           We're talking about an investment in
           the magazine.
                           BLOMKVIST
           I gather.    Why would you want to do
           that?

                         MARTIN
           Not for the return, that's for sure.

                         VANGER
                (to Erika)
           I feel bad that I've take Mikael
           away from you at the worst possible
           time. This is the right thing to do.
           The moral thing. That's one reason.

                          ERIKA
           And.
                         VANGER
           The enemies of my friends are my
           enemies. I hate Wennerstrom as much
           as you hate what he's done to you.
Silence.

                         VANGER
           So what do you say?
                                                                 59.
                                                                 59.
         

      Erika half-shrugs to say she'll consider it.

                                VANGER
                  Is that a maybe?
      She nods.

                                 VANGER
                  Wonderful!   More wine, Anna.

      Blomkvist looks at Erika, but she glances away to Vanger.



                                VANGER
                  I think Mikael is adapting well to
                  rustic life, by the way.
                                ERIKA
                  Have you seen him try to make a fire?

                                VANGER
                  Put the logs on end, like this.

      He makes a teepee shape with his hands, like praying.
109   INT. COTTAGE - LATER - NIGHT                                109

      Erika lights a teepee of logs in the fireplace.
                                BLOMKVIST
                  How long have you been discussing
                  this with them?
                                ERIKA
                  I haven't been. They asked me to
                  come up yesterday.

                                BLOMKVIST
                  Why didn't you tell me?
                                 ERIKA
                  Why would I.   You live in the woods.
                                BLOMKVIST
                  So I deserve to be treated like an
                  idiot?

                                ERIKA
                  I wanted to hear what they had to
                  say. You would've said no before
                  they could.
                                BLOMKVIST
                  I'm saying it now. It's not a good
                  idea.
                                                             60.
                                                             60.
     

                              ERIKA
                You heard me tell them we could
                hang on for six months. I was lying.
                Without their money we'll be out of
                business in three.
                              BLOMKVIST
                You don't know this family.   They're
                crazy.

                              ERIKA
                We're not marrying into it.

                              BLOMKVIST
                We are if we do this. It's exactly
                what we're doing.

                              ERIKA
                You want to say no? Let's say no.
                Instead of 50 percent of something,
                let's own 100 percent of nothing.

      The logs crackle as flames climb them. She gets up,
      comes past him, unbuttoning her shirt as she disappears
      into the bedroom. He stares at the fire.
                                 ERIKA O/S
                Mikael?

                                 BLOMKVIST
                What.

                              ERIKA O/S
                I'm leaving this God-forsaken island
                in the morning.
                                 BLOMKVIST
                So?

                              ERIKA
                So are you coming to bed or not.

110   INT. TATTOO PARLOR - DAY                                110

      Salander regards a selection of forearm tattoos: barbed
      wire, Celtic bands, strings of leaves and flowers.
                              TATTOO ARTIST
                You thinking one arm or both?
                              SALANDER
                Wrists and ankles. But none of
                these. Just a plain band, like
                handcuffs.
                                                               61.

                It's sensitive there. Particularly
                the ankles. It's gonna hurt.

      That doesn't bother her in the least. She rolls up her
      sleeves and watches him ready the tattoo gun.

                              SALANDER
                How much do one of those cost?

                Petrochemical manufacturer Vanger
                Industries has acquired a controlling
                interest in Millennium magazine which
                according to analysts has been in
                financial trouble since last December
                when its cofounder Mikael Blomkvist
                was found guilty of libel against
                Hans-Erik Wennerstrom -
111   INT. MILLENNIUM'S OFFICES - DAY                           111

      A news crew has crammed itself inside Erika's office,
      where a reporter interviews her -

                              ERIKA
                We made a serious mistake last year,
                and we regret it. But we're moving
                forward, and this is the first step.

                              REPORTER 2
                You wouldn't say the first step was
                your sacking of Mr. Blomkvist?

                              ERIKA
                That's inaccurate. Read the original
                press release, Viggo. I didn't fire
                him. He's on sabbatical.
                               REPORTER 2
                Where.

                              ERIKA
                I'm not sure, to be honest with you.

      He's at his desk, the cat in his lap, reviewing the
      album of photos taken on the day Harriet disappeared.
                                                                62.

      They're arranged chronologically, and Vanger has noted
      the approximate time of day of each.

      The first several were taken on the manor grounds, by
      family members of each other. The next couple taken in
      town of the parade. Then dozens taken on and around the
      bridge of the dramatic accident. He hears the sound and
      glances out to see a television news van driving toward
      Vanger's manor -
113   EXT. VANGER MANOR - DAY                                    113

      A crew is set up in the yard by the water, interviewing
      Henrik and Martin. Under his suit jacket Henrik wears a
      cheerful yellow shirt. Birger unhappily looks on.

                              MARTIN
                Millennium is an excellent magazine.
                We also think it's undervalued right
                now, which is good business for us.

                              REPORTER 3
                Is any magazine really undervalued
                today. How many will be around
                tomorrow?

                              VANGER
                There's another reason.      I don't like
                bullies.
                              REPORTER 3
                Are you referring to Mr. Wennerstrom?
                              VANGER
                I'm referring to anyone who tries
                to sue their enemies into submission.
                If Mr. Wennerstrom would like to try
                it again, he'll find himself fighting
                a company that can afford to fight
                back.

                Already it's the most fun I've had in
                years.

114   INT. HARDWARE STORE - STOCKHOLM - DAY                      114

      As a clerk rings up the   items Salander is buying -
      bright yellow duct tape   and a plastic protective mask -
      she watches a shot on a   TV here of Wennerstrom being
      interviewed outside his   offices -
                                                                63.

                              WENNERSTROM ON TV
                I've always admired Henrik Vanger.
                He's a titan - and a gentleman. But
                he's also quite old now - which may
                explain how he could be taken in by
                a convicted liar.

      The report segues to another story.     The clerk hands
      Salander her receipt.
115   INT. SALANDER'S APARTMENT - LATER                          115

      Her hardware store purchases, along with some fresh DVD-
      R's, a couple of plastic bottles of ink, and McDonald's
      Kids Meal wrappers, sit by her laptop.

      She's not typing on its keyboard, but characters are
      appearing nonetheless as someone somewhere else, writes
      an email:
      The From box reads:   h wennerstrom 

      The To box reads:   l jansson 116 INT. COTTAGE - DAY - CONTINUED 116 Blomkvist has returned to the accident photos. Pauses on a blurry one of the fire crew, the focus inadvertently on the background - Vanger's manor. What caught his attention is a figure in one of the upstairs windows. He checks a scribbled floor plan of the manor and sees that it's Harriet's bedroom. But he's not sure if it's Harriet. The figure is too soft to identify - even with a magnifying glass - but is wearing a light-colored dress and has light hair. He glances to the family tree on the wall - the teenage Vanger girls' photos - Three INSERTS: Harriet ... Cecelia ... Anita ... They all have light hair, and, frankly, all look alike. He moves on to the parade pictures. To the one Vanger said before was the last picture taken of Harriet alive. It's not really of her. 64. 64. It's a wide shot of the parade itself - but she can be seen in the background across the street with her friends, watching a float - atop which some women in harem outfits dance - pass by. He slips it from its corner-fasteners and turns it over. There's a Hedestad Courier copyright printed on the back. He turns it over again and looks at the photo itself. 117 EXT. HEDESTAD - DAY 117 Guided by the photo, he walks along the town's main street to the approximate place from which it was taken - outside a haberdashery window - but it's still not right. The photo was shot from a higher than street level angle. He looks to a second story window above the store. Then crosses the street to where Harriet was standing when the picture was taken. Looks back at the haberdashery where, now, the owner peers out at him. 118 EXT. HEDESTAD - LATER - DAY 118 On the pay phone outside the gas station - BLOMKVIST I want to look at what the paper has in its archive on the parade. VANGER V/O You already have what it has. In the album. BLOMKVIST I don't think so. VANGER V/O Why. BLOMKVIST Because no photographer at any newspaper in the world takes just two photos of anything - especially after having to climb a flight of stairs. VANGER V/O The bridge accident happened during the parade. He rushed over. BLOMKVIST Maybe. Silence. Then - VANGER V/O Mikael, what have you found? 65. 65. BLOMKVIST Nothing probably. But I know photographers. They're the most insecure people on earth. If it's out of focus, or they don't like the framing, they bury it. A119 EXT. HEDESTAD COURIER - ESTABLISHING A119 119 INT. HEDESTAD COURIER - DAY 119 Blomkvist follows the paper's youngish photo editor up narrow stairs to an attic. PHOTO EDITOR The current archive is on CD's, naturally. The older stuff, still negatives. What general period are you interested in? BLOMKVIST September, 1966. She glances back at him. The date means something to her, but she chooses not to comment. 120 INT. COURIER ATTIC - DAY 120 She pulls four thick binders off a shelf from September 1966 alone, proving Blomkvist's point about photographers - and piles them up next to a light-box and scanner. BLOMKVIST Thank you. He waits for her to leave. She seems reluctant to ... PHOTO EDITOR Is this about Harriet Vanger? BLOMKVIST You're too young to know about that. PHOTO EDITOR Everyone here grows up knowing about her. It's how we're taught about strangers. 121 INT. BJURMAN'S APARTMENT - STOCKHOLM - NIGHT 121 The door opens revealing Salander. Bjurman seems a little surprised to see her at his doorstep. BJURMAN My dear Lisbeth, how are you? 66. 66. SALANDER I need more money. I need to pay my rent. She looks like a schoolgirl with her little backpack over her shoulder. How did he ever get so lucky? BJURMAN Come on in. She steps inside. He takes her hand and leads her toward the bedroom. Her other hand slips into her jacket pocket. BJURMAN Since we're still figuring out what you like, I went shopping for some new toys. SALANDER Me, too. BJURMAN You, too? What did you buy? She pulls a Taser from her pocket and jams it under his chin, firing off 75,000 volts - 122 EXT. COTTAGE - NIGHT 122 Set down on the rugged landscape under an almost moonless night sky, the cottage looks vulnerable. 123 INT. COTTAGE - NIGHT 123 The cat, curled up on a chair, jerks its head up at a sound neither we nor Blomkvist can hear, and stays absolutely still, listening. Blomkvist scrolls through the Courier negatives he has converted into positives and has loaded into Photoshop. He was right. Many more parade pictures were shot that day. Several at street level - a marching band, floats, children with balloons, some in better focus than others. He reaches the first of the higher-angle shots from the floor above the haberdashery, scans the crowd lining the street. Harriet isn't in it. But in the next she appears at the edge of the frame with her school friends. In the next, she's further into frame. And the next, standing in the same spot he stood earlier today. 124 OMIT - INT. BJURMAN'S APARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT 124 67. 67. 125 INT. COTTAGE - NIGHT 125 Blomkvist selects all 18 of the high-angle parade photographs, transfers them to an iPhoto file, and reopens them as a `slide show.' The first few, accompanied by the default music, Minuet in G, dissolve at two-second intervals. Too long. Too distracting with the music. And too wide. He adjusts the size function - closer on Harriet gets rid of the dissolve effect and music and reduces the time- interval to make the transitions as quick as possible. He hits `play' again and watches a short jerky `silent film'- a kind of electronic flip-book: Harriet arrives with her friends. Moves along the street. Stops and faces the parade. Says something to her friends. Laughs. Watches the float with the harem girls on it. Smiles. Sees something to her left. Turns her head slightly toward it. Her eyes widen in fear. She looks down. She moves off. Her friends look after her confused. And then she's gone. Blomkvist backs up to the frame of Harriet looking off with fear in her eyes, and for the first time believes without a doubt what Vanger has believed for 40 years: She was murdered. Whoever she saw across the street followed her and killed her. The cat watches him. 126 INT. BJURMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 126 Bjurman slowly comes to. SALANDER Good. You're alive. It takes him a moment to realize it's true. Another to realize it might be better if he wasn't since he's naked on the floor, face-up, wrists and ankles bound. He tries to cry out and realizes he's also gagged. She emerges from the shadows, stands over him, and he sees that her eyes are ringed in black mascara like some kind of ghoulish raccoon. She looks insane. As she steps out of his field of view, and his hands struggle against the restraints. SALANDER Recognize this? He cranes his neck to see she's by her backpack that's resting on a chair. 68. 68. SALANDER I had it with me last time. I set it here. Remember? (he doesn't) See this snap? It's not a snap. It's a wide-angle micro-lens. She takes a DVD-R from the backpack, puts it in his player, flips his plasma TV on with a remote. She got it all - what he did to her - the rape - in HD. SALANDER This shows you sodomizing a mentally impaired girl. If it's ever seen outside this room, who'll be institutionalized then? He starts to whimper. SALANDER Here's what's going to happen. Pay attention. He can't. He can't even look at her. His life is over. He weeps into the gag. SALANDER Look at me. He won't. She strides to her backpack. Takes out a large dildo. Gets on her knees, and works it into his ass. She can only get it about halfway up. She has to stand up and kick it the rest of the way with her boot. He howls into the gag. SALANDER Do I have your attention now? She does indeed. He vigorously nods his head, now, and after everything she says - SALANDER When you can walk again, which I admit could be a while, we're going to my bank. You'll tell them I alone have access to my account. After that, you'll never contact me again. Each month you'll write a report of a meeting we won't have. You'll describe how well I'm doing, how sociable I'm becoming. Then you'll negotiate with the court to have my declaration of incompetence lifted. If you fail, this video will spread across the Internet like a virus. (he stares in horror) (MORE) 69. 69. SALANDER (CONT'D) If something happens to me - if I get hit by a car - if you hit me with a car - same thing, it uploads automatically. She fishes his apartment keys from his trousers. Shows him that she has them. SALANDER I'm taking these with me. I'll be checking on you. If I ever find anyone in here with you, whether she came of her own free will or not - His eyes dart to the TV as he nods that he understands. SALANDER No. Not the video. She kicks him. Then straddles his fat gut and looks him in the eye. SALANDER I will kill you. And he knows she means it. SALANDER Do you doubt anything I've said? (he shakes his head no) Do you doubt what's in the reports about me? What do they say when you sum them up? They say I'm insane. (he shakes his head no) No, it okay. You can nod because it's true. I am insane. She gets up off him, rummages through her backpack again. SALANDER I know it'll be hard for you to abide by my rules. Especially no more sex. I'm going to make it easier for you. She puts on a plastic surgical mask. He fears the next thing he'll see is a pair of scissors in her hand, but it isn't. It's something else he doesn't recognize. She straddles him again. He squirms under her weight. SALANDER Lie still. I've never done this before. 70. 70. He sees that the thing in her hand is some kind of surgical device, a shiny stripped-down gun with a sharp point and a plastic ink bottle where the bullets would go. SALANDER There will be some blood. He struggles to twist his body away, but it's useless. She digs the tattooing gun's needle into his chest and begins dragging it back and forth. He screams as dots of blood spatter her plastic mask ... A127 EXT. BJURMAN'S APARTMENT - DAWN - ESTABLISHING A127 127 INT. BJURMAN'S APARTMENT - DAWN 127 The job has taken her all night. The sky outside the living room window is beginning to lighten. She drinks a glass of water in the kitchen, wipes her prints from it. She crosses to the bedroom where Bjurman's toys have been wiped cleaned and put back in the dresser. Picks up her backpack. Looks at him. He's unconscious. She sets handcuff key next to a dark stain on his stomach. We stay on the key as she leaves the room. Hearing the front door open and close, we rise up to see his entire naked body on the bed. Tattooed into his skin in big letters, from his nipples to his groin, is: I AM A RAPIST PIG 128 OMIT: EXT. HEDESTAD - DAWN 128 129 OMIT: INT. COTTAGE - DAWN 129 129A EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - DAY 129A Returning from a walk and a smoke, Blomkvist sees - sitting outside the cottage, petting his cat - Harriet. Of course it can't be her, but it is a teenage girl who resembles the old pictures of her. Seeing him, she waves. It's his daughter. PERNILLA Hi. BLOMKVIST Hi. What are you doing here? PERNILLA On my way to Skelleftea. I can only stay a couple hours. He arrives and gives her a hug. 71. 71. BLOMKVIST What's in Skelleftea? PERNILLA Light of Life Bible Camp. Blomkvist tries to hide his dismay. 129B INT. COTTAGE - DAY 129B He's made them some coffee, and, of course, sandwiches. Patiently waits for her to finish her silent prayer, and smiles bravely. PERNILLA They're not dangerous. BLOMKVIST It's fine, Nilla. Whatever you want to do is fine. Everybody needs something. PERNILLA Just so long as it's not God. BLOMKVIST I didn't say that. As they eat in silence, Blomkvist can't help but think about Harriet and what Vanger said about not giving her his attention when she needed it. BLOMKVIST I'm not around enough to know everything that's going on with you, and I apologize for that. But I'd never want you to not tell me something, even if you think I might not want to hear it. PERNILLA (smiles) That's what I'm doing. 129C EXT. TRAIN STATION - HEDESTAD - DAY 129C The afternoon train is boarding. It's not crowded. BLOMKVIST It should have been me visiting you. I'm sorry. PERNILLA It's okay. Everything's good. 72. 72. He nods but doesn't believe it any more than she believes he's okay with Bible Camp. She climbs aboard. Waves. PERNILLA Bye. BLOMKVIST Bye. The train begins to move. PERNILLA Don't go too hard on the Catholics. BLOMKVIST What? PERNILLA The article you're writing. BLOMKVIST What are you talking (about) - PERNILLA The Bible quotes on your desk. BLOMKVIST What? The train clears the platform. He watches after it. What was she talking about? He glances absently to the taxi stand. Hussein points to his taxi. Ride? 130 INT. COTTAGE - LATER - DAY 130 Blomkvist comes in, goes straight to his desk, sifts through the paperwork on it, then sees the Xerox of the last page of Harriet's address book - the unknown phone numbers - he taped to the lamp - Magda 32016 Sara 32109 R.J. 30114 R.L. 32027 Mari 32018 It could be a coincidence they're Bible names - Magdalene, Sarah, Mary - or maybe not. He digs through Harriet's personal things for her Bible. Since all the number sequences begin with `3,' he goes to the third chapter - Leviticus - notices that its first facing page is faintly dog-eared - finds R.J's verse - 1:14 - on it: HARRIET V/O If a dove is the sinner's offering, the priest shall wring off its head, cleave its wings, and burn it upon the altar. 73. 73. 131 EXT. COTTAGE - DAY 131 Pinching a cigarette in a shaking hand, Blomkvist pokes numbers on his cell phone. Instead of ringing he hears a beep. "Retry?" appears on the cell screen. 132 EXT. HEDESTAD - DAY 132 Back across the bridge by the gas station, he makes the call on the pay phone. BLOMKVIST Detective Morell, it's Mikael Blomkvist. MORELL O/S How are you? Not still in Hedestad I hope for your sake. BLOMKVIST The Rebecka Case you mentioned. What was her last name if you recall. MORELL O/S Of course I do, but what would it have to do with anything? BLOMKVIST Nothing probably. As Blomkvist glances to the last page in Harriet's address book, to R.J. 30114 - MORELL O/S Jacobsson. Rebecka Jacobsson. BLOMKVIST How was she killed? MORELL O/S Decapitated. Arms cut off. Burned. Like the Leviticus dove. A siren. Ambulance coming past, headed for the bridge. MORELL O/S But this happened in the 1940's - BLOMKVIST Hang on a second. He watches the ambulance speed across the bridge. 74. 74. BLOMKVIST I'm going to call you back. MORELL O/S What have you (found) - Blomkvist hangs up and takes off at a trot toward the bridge - 133 EXT. VANGER MANOR - LATER 133 He reaches the manor just as the ambulance is leaving and Martin is climbing into his Range Rover. He looks undone. BLOMKVIST What's happened? MARTIN We were talking. He started rubbing at his arm. Then collapsed. BLOMKVIST Is he (conscious) - MARTIN I can't talk, Mikael, I have to (go) - BLOMKVIST Go. Martin pulls out to follow the ambulance to the hospital. Blomkvist watches after them. 134 INT. COTTAGE - EVENING 134 The cat naps while Blomkvist looks up the other Leviticus quotes from Harriet's list in her dog-eared Bible - HARRIET V/O The daughter of any priest who profanes herself by playing the harlot, profanes her father, and shall be burned with fire - HARRIET V/O A woman who is a medium or sorcerer shall be put to death by stoning - There's a knock. He tucks the list in the Bible, sets aside and answers the door. Frode comes in. FRODE The good news is he survived. How he does now, we have to see. He's in ICU. Can I have one of those? 75. 75. He points to the table. BLOMKVIST A sandwich? FRODE A Scotch. Blomkvist pours him one, and another for himself. BLOMKVIST I don't want to be indelicate. But Henrik promised me something when I agreed to do this. FRODE Wennerstrom. BLOMKVIST (nods) I need to know what he has on him. Now. In case. FRODE In case he dies? That is indelicate. BLOMKVIST And I apologize. FRODE I don't know what he has on him, if you're asking me. And he can't tell you in the condition he's in. So ... is that it then? Silence. Blomkvist drinks. Eventually - BLOMKVIST We also never discussed who I'd report to if something happened to him. FRODE You'd report to me, but does it matter? We both know nothing's going to come of this. BLOMKVIST I'm not so sure. Frode looks at Blomkvist a little more intently. FRODE What do you mean? 76. 76. BLOMKVIST I may have found something. FRODE (pause) You're joking. (Blomkvist isn't) What did you find? Now it's Blomkvist who studies Frode. He's not sure he wants to tell him. And even less so the longer he looks. BLOMKVIST The last time I reported something before I was sure of it, it cost me my savings. Frode studies him again - wondering perhaps if Blomkvist suspects him. BLOMKVIST I need a research assistant. Can you authorize that? FRODE Yes. Do you have one? BLOMKVIST I can find one. FRODE I know a good one. She did the background check on you. BLOMKVIST The. FRODE Do you think we'd hire anyone for something like this without doing one? Blomkvist's brain tries to quickly inventory his life, pausing at its darker recesses. Frode nods. FRODE Yes, it was quite thorough. BLOMKVIST I want to read it. FRODE That I couldn't authorize. 77. 77. Blomkvist isn't sure how to play this. Then he is. Sets his napkin down, gets up and begins taking things down from the wall. Frode watches. Then sighs. 135 EXT. STOCKHOLM - DUSK 135 Only a few lights on in the Milton Security building. 136 INT. ARMANSKY'S OFFICE - DUSK 136 It isn't often a subject of an investigation shows up in his office, but is always awkward when one does. BLOMKVIST Mr. Frode was kind enough to share your report with me. (it rests on his lap) The investigator's name is on it, but I can find no record of her, and I'm pretty good at that sort of thing. ARMANSKY Would it really matter what her name is? BLOMKVIST It would if I wanted to speak to her, which I do. ARMANSKY Against policy. BLOMKVIST You sure? ARMANSKY Just like your sources. You understand. BLOMKVIST Let me give you a name then. He jots "Annika Giannini" on one of Armansky's Post-Its. BLOMKVIST My sister. She's a lawyer. (gestures to the report) There's information in here that could only have come from one place. I think you know what I mean. Silence. Armansky tries not to look sick. Then - 78. 78. ARMANSKY The reason you can find no record of her is because her records have been sealed. She's a ward of the State. BLOMKVIST What does that have to do with anything. ARMANSKY She's had a rough life. Can we not make it rougher on her? Blomkvist just sits there, the picture of calm ... 137 INT. THE MILL - STOCKHOLM - NIGHT 137 Cacophony of loud techno and a fringe clientele. Alone at a table drinking, Salander seems comfortable with the noise and her dateless status, but doesn't avoid a glance from an Asian girl at the bar, and doesn't tell her to go away when she comes over and motions to the empty chair. 138 INT. SALANDER'S APARTMENT - MORNING 138 Salander and the girl from the club, asleep in bed, entwined like snakes. Salander wakes, disentangles herself, and is padding to the bathroom when there's a knock on her door. She stares it. No one ever knocks on her door. But someone knocks on it again. She crosses to it, wrapping herself in a blanket. SALANDER Who is it? BLOMKVIST O/S Mikael Blomkvist. Her mind races, as Blomkvist's did to the news someone had invaded his privacy. She unlocks the door. Cracks it enough to see him. He smiles, but it's disconcerting. She's not sure it's a harmless one. BLOMKVIST May I come in? SALANDER Actually I'm not really up (yet) - BLOMKVIST That's okay. 79. 79. He pushes the door enough to pass. Has a paper bag and satchel with him. Takes in the place, including the girl in the bedroom, in a glance as he heads for the kitchen. BLOMKVIST I assumed you wouldn't have had breakfast yet so I brought some bagel sandwiches. And tomato juice. Good for hangovers. Where do you keep the coffee? SALANDER Hey. Hey - (he stops; looks back) Who do you think you are? BLOMKVIST I'm the guy you know better than my closest friends do. He opens cabinets looking for the coffee. She stares. BLOMKVIST We have a lot to talk about, so why don't you take a shower, put on some clothes and get rid of your girlfriend. 139 INT. SALANDER'S APARTMENT - LATER 139 Blomkvist, plunging a French press, watches as the girlfriend lets herself out. In the bedroom, Salander finishes getting dressed, sticks her Taser in the back pocket of her jeans and comes out to find a table setting that's more formal than she, or anyone who lives alone, is used to. BLOMKVIST You're awake. Good. Breakfast is ready. He pours her, and then himself, coffee. BLOMKVIST I guess I alarmed you showing up like this. SALANDER If you touch me, I'll more than alarm you. BLOMKVIST That won't be necessary. He smiles. His eyes are not unkind. As he helps himself to one of the bagels - 80. 80. BLOMKVIST Your report on me was quite detailed but for me not very entertaining. A copy of it sits next to his plate. SALANDER It wasn't meant to be. BLOMKVIST When I write about people, I try to entertain the reader. SALANDER Wennerstrom wasn't entertained. Blomkvist lets it go. BLOMKVIST Your boss Armansky tells me you only work on things that interest you. I guess I should be flattered. He also says you're the one he goes to for jobs that are, `sensitive' is the word he used. I'll use `illegal,' since that what it was when you hacked into my computer. (they study each other) I'm not going to do anything about that. I could but I won't. What I'm going to do is tell you a story. If it entertains you, maybe you'll decide to help me research it further. If it doesn't, I'll wash the dishes and leave ... Are you going to even touch your food? SALANDER What kind of research? BLOMKVIST Lisbeth - may I call you Lisbeth? I want you to help me catch a killer of women. 140 INT. SALANDER'S APARTMENT - LATER - DAY 140 He's arranged some of his research on the floor, and watches Salander kneeling before it, her eyes passing over photographs of the Vanger clan, the accident on the bridge, Xeroxes of the Leviticus list and verses. BLOMKVIST I've identified R.J. Her name's Rebecka Jacobsson. (MORE) 81. 81. BLOMKVIST (CONT'D) I have no idea who the others are - or how they're connected to the death of a 16 year old girl - but they have to be. His eyes settle on her blue-black "handcuffs" as hers settle on a copy of an old Hedestad Courier front page: the article about the grisly murder of Rebecka Jacobsson. BLOMKVIST We need to somehow figure out who they are, what happened to them, what the Leviticus verses have to do with (anything) - She gets up, goes to her desk, begins jotting something down, ignoring him. BLOMKVIST What are you doing? SALANDER Getting started. You can keep talking if you want. Blomkvist, slightly taken aback, picks up the Leviticus Xerox from the floor. BLOMKVIST Would you like this? SALANDER Got it. That's what she's jotting down, from memory: the names, initials and Leviticus numbers. She wakes her laptop - 141 EXT. THE BRIDGE - NIGHT 141 Hussein's taxi brings Blomkvist across to the island. 142 OMIT - INT. COTTAGE NIGHT 142 143 EXT/INT. COTTAGE - NIGHT 143 He gets out with his satchel. Whistles for the cat - BLOMKVIST I'm home. He picks up the bowl of food he left on the porch, unlocks the door, goes inside, and sees the cat napping on his desk. He stares at it. Then at the door he just came through. Then the windows: all shut. 82. 82. Nothing has been disturbed as far as he can tell, but someone has been in here. 143A OMIT - 143A - 161A 143A 161AA INT. SALANDER'S APARTMENT - DAY 161AA A window on Salander's laptop shows a map of Sweden divided into its 21 counties: Stockholm, Vasterbotten, Uppsala, etc. She starts with Skane. Hacks *however one does that* into its police department's crime database (or various county newspapers' databases). She fills in the year field with - 1947-1966 - and continues to types quickly. When we see what that is, she's in the middle of typing this filters list - Homicide Female Rape Decapitation Dismemberment Fire Altar Priest Prostitute Unsolved Mari Magda Sara R.L. The search produces a screen showing matches to some of the filter words - the rest of the case synopses greyed out. But also, with all of them, there's this message: Full Police Report Not Digitized 161AB INT/EXT. COTTAGE - DAY - (PLACEMENT CHANGE ONLY) 161AB Blomkvist watches a Hedestad locksmith install a dead- bolt on his front door. 161AC EXT. STOCKHOLM - NIGHT 161AC Salander comes out of her apartment building onto an empty street. Everyone is asleep. No lights on. It must be about 3am. She ties a duffel bag down, climbs onto the motorcycle, kick-starts it, races off into the night. 83. 83. 161AD EXT. VARMLAND - SWEDEN - DAWN 161AD Salander's Honda races past a pastoral agricultural landscape. 161B EXT. POLICE STATION - ESTABLISHING - MORNING 161B 161C INT. POLICE STATION - KARLSTAD - MORNING 161C An old police detective considers Salander's driver's license, her Milton Security ID, and a letter signed by the giant security firm's CEO, Dragan Armansky. DET. ISAKSSON No one's asked me about Magda in over 40 years. No one here even remembers her. He waits for her to say something, but she doesn't seem to understand conversational dynamics, so it's up to him. DET. ISAKSSON Why would a young lady like you want to know about such a brutal killing. SALANDER It interests me. DET. ISAKSSON Does it. She nods. He's not sure which he finds stranger - her appearance or her sincerity. He touches his own neck to indicate the tattoo on hers. DET. ISAKSSON What's that. A wasp? SALANDER A friend of mine calls me that. DET. ISAKSSON So you tattoo it on your neck? He'd be horrified if one of his grandchildren did that, but she just shrugs like it's no big deal. DET. ISAKSSON Who's this friend? SALANDER My trainer. DET. ISAKSSON Aerobics? 84. 84. SALANDER Boxing. Hard for him to picture. But, upon reflection - DET. ISAKSSON I have a feeling you're pretty good at that, even though you weigh - what - ninety pounds? (nothing from her) Float like a butterfly ... SALANDER What? DET. ISAKSSON (smiles) Come with me, Muhammad. 161D INT. KARLSTAD POLICE FILE ROOM - DAY 161D The old man rummages through an old file cabinet. DET. ISAKSSON Her husband was our first suspect - the husband is always the first suspect, and usually the last - but not this time. We moved on to a neighbor. Then a vagrant - He pulls a thick, yellowed folder out and sits with it and her at a table. DET. ISAKSSON Once you get to strangers, it's only a matter of time before you get to gypsies, and you know you're never going to solve it. And that troubles him still, that he never solved it. SALANDER How exactly was she killed? DET. ISAKSSON Miss - I'm sorry - SALANDER Salander. DET. ISAKSSON Miss Salander, if you don't mind my asking, when's the last time you ate? 85. 85. SALANDER I have a high metabolism. I can't put on weight. DET. ISAKSSON That's not why I ask. I ask because it's better to look at what I'm about to show you on an empty stomach. He pushes the folder across the table to her ... 161E OMIT - 161E - 161I 161E 161J INT. HEDESTAD HOSPITAL - DAY 161J Blomkvist comes in to find - like Morell did 40 years ago - a strange tableaux of suspects - two of whom he's only yet seen in photographs on his cottage wall - Birger, Cecilia, Frode, Martin, Gunnar, Anna, and, looking like an aging overdressed vampire, Isabella, smoking a cigarette. BLOMKVIST (to Frode) How is he? Frode takes Blomkvist aside. FRODE He needs surgery and there's no DNR. So it's up to the family to decide to resuscitate or not, and they're not good at decisions. He glances over to them. Isabella's staring back. FRODE How'd it go with Ms. Salander? BLOMKVIST She said yes. Isabella gets up to come over - BLOMVIST (to Frode) Can I see Henrik? FRODE He was asleep when I last looked in. We can check. 86. 86. ISABELLA No, you can't check. You can instruct him to pack his things and leave. MARTIN Mother - ISABELLA Don't use that tone with me. (to Blomkvist) This family's had enough tragedy without you dredging it all up again. FRODE Actually, Isabella, Mr. Blomkvist works for Henrik. ISABELLA And who do you work for, Dirch? Remind me who pays your salary? BIRGER We should put this to a vote. MARTIN Don't be an idiot, Birger. BIRGER It's a family decision like any other. Cecilia? CECILIA What. BIRGER Am I right? CECILIA You are so seldom right about anything, it's hard for me to say yes. But (yes) - MARTIN No. We should do what Henrik wants, and we know what he wants. ISABELLA Henrik - is in there fighting for his life. This - (points to Blomkvist like he's an object) - is the last thing he needs. A nurse chooses this - the absolute worst time - to approach Isabella. 87. 87. NURSE O/S Excuse me, Mrs. Vanger, you can't smoke in here. Isabella gives the nurse a look so hard it's almost frightening - calmly flicks an ash on the floor - waits for the nurse to leave - and looks back at Blomkvist. ISABELLA Go back to Stockholm. When we want a false chronicle of the family written by a libelist, we know who to call. 161K INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 161K As Frode guessed, Henrik is asleep, wired up to monitors, and doesn't stir as Blomkvist looks in on him. 161L EXT. YOUTH HOSTEL - NIGHT 161L Salander's motorcycle parked outside. 161M INT. YOUTH HOSTEL - NIGHT 161M As young travelers with huge backpacks try to sleep around her, Salander reads to herself from a Bible by flashlight. Leviticus 4:32 - HARRIET/PERNILLA If a man's offering is a lamb, it shall be a female without blemish. He shall lay his hand upon it's head ...slaughter it... empty it's blood on the base of the altar ... and he shall be forgiven. 162 EXT. UDDEVALLA- DAY 162 Another police station. 162A INT. KARLSTAD POLICE STATION - DAY 162A Det. Isaksson is on the phone - DET. ISAKSSON Forget what she looks like, I vouch for her - 163 INT. POLICE STATION - UDDEVALLA - DAY 163 Another old police detective has Salander's credentials and a phone in hand - DET. ISAKSSON O/S She's smart. And she's serious about this. 88. 88. The old Uddevalla detective regards Salander waiting at the counter. Into the phone - UDDEVALLY DETECTIVE (convinced but just barely) All right. Thanks. He hangs up. To Salander - UDDEVALLA DETECTIVE This way, Miss. He escorts her to the file room. A164 OMIT - EXT. POLICE STATION - FARSTA ESTABLISHING A164 164 INT. FILE ROOM - POLICE STATION - UDDEVALLA - DAY 164 Just like Isaksson, the Uddevalla detective pulls open an old cabinet drawer, finds a particular ancient folder in it and hands it to Salander. She begins flipping through the reports and crime photos inside it, but we don't see them. SALANDER Can I make copies? UDDEVALLA DETECTIVE I can make them for you if our machine's been repaired. SALANDER That's okay. She begins photographing the reports and crime scene pictures with her camera as the detective watches her, not without some kind of strange sense of admiration. 164A OMIT: INT. COTTAGE - EVENING 164A 165 INT. COTTAGE - EVENING 165 Blomkvist considers Birger's photo on his wall: Brother of Cecilia, son of Harald the Nazi, 21-years-old when his cousin Harriet disappeared ... 166 EXT. COTTAGE - EVENING 166 Blomkvist and Martin drink Skane. Martin's normally breezy demeanor seems to have suffered from his mother's public displays. Embarrassed by them and her, he's more serious now. MARTIN My family is impossible. It's why the company is such a mess. (MORE) 89. 89. MARTIN (CONT'D) Please accept my apology for my mother's behavior. BLOMKVIST It's all right. MARTIN It's not all right, she's unbearable. But it has nothing to do with you. It's between her and Henrik ... She lost it when my father died. The drinking - her state of mind - it all got so bad Henrik took me and my sister away from her, leaving her alone in our old house on the other side of the island like she was excommunicated. She's never forgiven him. And he seems as lost now as he must have been then. MARTIN You have to stay and keep working. You're Henrik's last chance at some kind of resolution. Put this to rest for him one way of the other, and I'll try to keep my mother away. But, please, do it as quickly as you can. BLOMKVIST I'll (try) - They glance off to the sound of a motorcycle. It appears, roars up, parks. Salander climbs off it and shoulders a duffel bag. Blomkvist seems surprised to see her. BLOMKVIST Lisbeth, this is Martin Vanger. MARTIN How do you do. SALANDER Fine. She comes past them without another word. Martin can't help noticing her wasp and handcuff tattoos. Looks after her as she disappears into the cottage. It's hard to believe, but he has to ask: MARTIN Girlfriend? 90. 90. BLOMKVIST Assistant. 166A INT. COTTAGE - MOMENTS LATER 166A Blomkvist comes in as Martin drives off. Salander is already unpacking her things - laptop, charger, change of clothes. What's she doing, moving in? BLOMKVIST Any trouble finding the place? SALANDER Everyone in town knows who and where you are. BLOMKVIST That's comforting. Are you hungry? Want a sandwich? SALANDER No. Busy setting up her laptop on his desk, starting it up, sitting down at it, she's all but ignoring him. BLOMKVIST I used to have a motorcycle. When I was 19. SALANDER I know. She hands him her own dog-eared Bible and a copy of the list of names and initials he gave her - SALANDER The five cases from Harriet's list. And five more she missed - three I'm sure about. Five more? Blomkvist stares at her but she's turned back to her laptop, bringing up police reports and crime scene photos. SALANDER Rebecka was the first, like you thought ... M.H., is Mari Holmberg - a prostitute in Kalmar - murdered in 1954. Leviticus verse 20, line 18. 91. 91. Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ BLOMKVIST (reading from it) "If a man lies with a woman having her sickness, he has made naked her fountain and she has uncovered the fountain of her blood." Blomkvist doesn't see a connection. SALANDER She was raped and stabbed, but the cause of death was suffocation with a sanitary napkin. R.L. Rakel Lunde, 1957 - Salander brings up more crime photos - SALANDER Cleaning woman and part-time palm reader, tied up with a clothesline, gagged, raped, head crushed with a rock. Leviticus 20:27. BLOMKVIST "A woman who is a medium or sorcerer shall be put to death by stoning." She's lit a cigarette and brings up the next photos - BLOMKVIST I only smoke outside. SALANDER (ignoring the comment) Sara Witt, 1964. Daughter of a pastor. Tied to her bed, raped, charred in the fire that burned down her house. Leviticus - BLOMKVIST 21:9. "The daughter of any priest who profanes herself by playing the harlot, profanes her father and shall be burned with (fire) - SALANDER (on top of his last word) Magda Lovisa Sjoberg, 1960 - Several photos of a dead woman and dead cow - SALANDER Found in a barn, stabbed and raped with farm tools. A cow in the next stall with its throat slit, its blood splashed on her, hers on it. 92. 92. BLOMKVIST Leviticus 20:16 - "If a woman lies with any beast, you shall kill the woman and the beast, their blood is upon (them) - SALANDER (again on his last word) Lea Persson, 1962 - A photo of a pretty girl in riding jodhpurs, petting a horse, and several more of her dead naked body on a wet cement floor surrounded by tropical fish. SALANDER Found by her sister in their pet shop - raped, beaten. The killer uncaged the animals, smashed the aquariums. There was a parakeet inside her. Leviticus 26:21/22. Before Blomkvist can find the verse, she's on to the next ones. More photos of murdered girls - SALANDER Eva Gustavsson, 1960. A runaway. Raped, strangled, a burnt pigeon tied around her neck. Lena Andersson, 1967, a student. Raped, stabbed, decapitated - BLOMKVIST Okay - SALANDER I'm not done - BLOMKVIST It's all right, we're looking for a serial murderer ... But what does it have to do with a 16-year-old girl on an island? Salander, as we know, is not paid to give her opinion. She's a hunter/gatherer, not an analyst. But Blomkvist asked, so she gives it - SALANDER She was looking for him, too. 167 OMIT - INT. COTTAGE - NIGHT 167 93. 93. 168 EXT. COTTAGE - LATER - NIGHT 168 The silence they just left has followed them out here. The island, more than ever, feels haunted as Blomkvist looks off, smoking. BLOMKVIST Rape. Torture. Fire. Animals. Religion. Anything I'm missing? SALANDER The names. They're all Biblical. The first woman, the whore, the Virgin Mary - Sara, Rakel - all from the Old Testament. BLOMKVIST Which means they're Jewish names. He glances off to Harald's dark house. BLOMKVIST If there's one thing the Vangers have more than their share of, it's Nazis. There's one of them. The Nazi's shadowy form crosses behind the shades ... 169 INT. COTTAGE - LATER - NIGHT 169 He pokes at embers in the fireplace to try coax some flames. BLOMKVIST I can see why Armansky values you so highly. Your work is very good. SALANDER It interests me. He takes a blanket from the back of a chair. BLOMKVIST I'll take the couch. You can have the bed. SALANDER I can sleep on a couch. BLOMKVIST So can I. She takes the blanket from him and sits with it on the couch. He watches her a moment. 94. 94. BLOMKVIST Okay. (heads off to the bedroom) Good night. SALANDER Night. She switches off the lamp. Then, in a moment, in the dark - SALANDER Harriet's name isn't. BLOMKVIST Isn't what. SALANDER Jewish. A170 EXT. COTTAGE - MORNING - ESTABLISHING A170 170 INT. COTTAGE - MORNING 170 Salander browses through an iPhoto album of old photographs of Blomkvist and the motorcycle he mentioned. In some of them, Erika is with him. In all of them, he's wearing a leather jacket not unlike Salander's. BLOMKVIST O/S What are you doing? He's just woken up in a tangle of blankets on the couch to see her at his laptop. She closes the album, leaving on the screen what she was looking at before: his iMovie of the parade and some annotated police files. SALANDER Going over your notes. BLOMKVIST They're encrypted. She gives him a don't-be-a-child look. SALANDER Have some coffee. BLOMKVIST I will. And then we'll have a talk about what's yours and what's mine. Blomkvist drags himself up, pours himself some coffee, adds some milk. 95. 95. Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ SALANDER It's amazing what you figured out from the parade photos. BLOMKVIST Thank you. SALANDER Too bad you don't have hers. BLOMKVIST Whose. She doesn't say. He comes over. She plays the iMovie, stops on a frame before Harriet turns her head. Points to a young couple standing among the people behind her. The woman has an Instamatic camera in her hand. SALANDER Her. She advances to the next frame: The woman has raised the camera to her eye. And the next: Harriet turning her head in foreground while in the background the flash cube atop the woman's Instamatic flares slightly. Blomkvist is stunned, by both the fact he didn't notice it before, and what it means: Though the woman is taking a snapshot of the parade, she could have inadvertently included in it whatever - whoever - Harriet saw at that moment across the street. BLOMKVIST Excuse me. He takes over his laptop from her, finds the later Courier photos he didn't include in his iMovie, after Harriet has left. In one, the couple is moving off the other way. In another, they're getting in a parked car to leave. He sharpens the Photoshop contrast. The rear license plate is partly visible, but too small for him to make out even by squinting. BLOMKVIST Can you read that? SALANDER A, C, Three - the rest is blocked. 96. 96. He focuses on a decal on the car's back window. The letters are even small and blurrier, but she thinks she can make out - SALANDER N, something, R, S, J - BLOMKVIST Norsjo. SALANDER Then something, K, something, R, I, F, something, I - BLOMKVIST Carpentry. (points below the letters) Is that a phone number? SALANDER Too small to read. He gets up. Heads for the front door to smoke his cigarette outside - BLOMKVIST (ADR) I'm going to have to go to Norsjo. He opens the door to leave and sees on the porch - The charred corpse of the cat. Its legs - sawn off and arranged in the shape of a swastika - lie in the middle of a dark circle of blood. He seems too startled to move, but when Salander sees it, she immediately gets her camera and begins framing close-ups of the cat parts, and its head resting atop the seat of her motorcycle. Blomkvist stares off at Harald's house ... 171 OMIT: EXT. COTTAGE - MORNING 171 172 OMIT: INT. FRODE'S HOUSE - DAY 172 172A INT. HEDESTAD HOSPITAL CAFETERIA - DAY 172A As Frode scrolls through the photos of the dismembered cat on Salander's camera, horrified by them, she regards at a table across the room: Birger, Isabella and Gunner. BLOMKVIST I wouldn't think Harald would sign his name like this, would you? 97. 97. FRODE I can't say I know how he thinks. He might. BLOMKVIST Has anyone spoken to him about me since I've been here? FRODE Maybe Isabella. No one else. BLOMKVIST Could she do something like this? Frode glances off to her. She's staring at Salander. And turns to Birger. ISABELLA Who's this creature now? Frode takes one more look at the photos before - FRODE I'm calling this off. BLOMKVIST No. You're authorizing me to rent a car. 172AA INT. HOSPITAL - LATER - DAY 172AA Blomkvist and Salander coming down a corridor on their way out. BLOMKVIST I'm sorry if that was uncomfortable. SALANDER They don't bother me. BLOMKVIST I'm sure they're not used to people who look like you. SALANDER They don't like you either. 172B EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY 172B A car and a motorcycle split apart at an interchange - the Volvo to the north, Salander's Honda to the south. 173 EXT. STOCKHOLM - DAY 173 Salander pulls her Honda into an underground garage. 98. 98. 174 INT. MILTON SECURITY - DAY 174 No one says hello to her - nor she to them - as she strides through the place to the tech room. INSERT: Cases snapped open revealing sophisticated surveillance equipment - several cameras, mounts, hand monitor, cables. TECH CLERK I can't give you any of this stuff without authorization from Mr. Armansky. SALANDER So call him. The clerk picks up a phone, but then sets it back down. Picks up the list again. TECH CLERK Next time, I'd prefer you fill out the proper paperwork. A175 EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY A175 A Volvo speeds along a rural highway, far from Hedestad and the Vangers. 175 INT. VOLVO - MOVING - DAY 175 On the passenger seat - INSERT: the car rental agreement - a print of the parade photo of the couple getting into the car he was looking at with Salander on his laptop - and a hand- written note that reads - NORSJO SNICKERIFABRIK 175A EXT/INT. HIGHWAY / VOLVO - DAY 175A A POV through the windshield of a highway sign alerts him the Norsjo exit is coming up. 176 EXT. NORSJO - DAY 176 The main street of a very small town. The Volvo pulls to a stop outside its only hardware store. 177 INT. HARDWARE STORE - DAY 177 An ancient place with narrow aisles crammed with stuff. CLERK 1 Can I help you? 99. 99. The clerk - for what Blomkvist needs - is too young. BLOMKVIST I'm waiting for the older gentleman, thanks. He gestures to a clerk in his 60's helping a customer. 178 INT. HARDWARE STORE - LATER 178 The older clerk looks at the parade photo of the couple. BLOMKVIST The carpentry shop is gone. I don't know if he worked there or not. If he did, maybe he used to buy hardware here. CLERK 2 I don't recognize him. Sorry. BLOMKVIST I had to start somewhere. Thanks. As he gathers up the photos to leave - CLERK 2 I'm no detective, but I think I would've started at the retirement home. Blomkvist looks up. Not a bad idea. 178A INT. SALANDER'S APARTMENT - STOCKHOLM - DAY 178A Salander checks a `mirror' of Bjurman's computer on her laptop. Skims one of the monthly reports she instructed him to write. A179 EXT. RETIREMENT HOME - NORSJO - ESTABLISHING A179 179 INT. RETIREMENT HOME - NORSJO - DAY 179 A group of elderly men and women in a rec room pass Blomkvist's photos around. One old man offers - FORSMAN This is Brannlund's kid. He was a contractor, the father. BLOMKVIST Brannlund. FORSMAN Assar. 100. 100. Blomkvist writes the name down. BLOMKVIST You wouldn't happen to know where I could find him, the son? FORSMAN Next to his father at the cemetery. He was killed in an accident on a job site years ago. But she might be alive - (the woman in the picture) His widow. A180 EXT. BRANNLUND HOUSE - ESTABLISHING A180 180 INT. BRANNLUND HOUSE - DAY 180 She is still alive, and sitting across from Blomkvist in her living room as he takes out his photos - BLOMKVIST In 1966, you were in Hedestad with your husband. He shows her one of the photos. MILDRED Oh, my goodness, there we are. Who took this? BLOMKVIST Photographer at the local paper. She smiles at the picture; it brings back good memories. BLOMKVIST You were taking pictures, too. Which I'd very much like to see if by some miracle you still have them. MILDRED It wouldn't be a miracle. We were on our honeymoon. But why? Blomkvist thinks about making something up. Decides not to. Indicates Harriet in the photo - BLOMKVIST This girl was killed that day, soon after seeing something across the street that frightened her. MILDRED How awful. 101. 101. Blomkvist nods; Mildred takes a closer look at the photo. MILDRED She does look terrified. Mildred gets up with purpose, goes into another room, returns with a photo album. Leafs past wedding photos, to honeymoon photos and stops on the only one she took of the parade. She hands the album to Blomkvist. The snapshot shows the float with the harem girls in foreground, and - in the background, across the street - several out of focus figures - BLOMKVIST Would you mind if I made a copy of this? 181 EXT. BJURMAN'S OFFICE BUILDING - LATE AFTERNOON 181 Establish. 182 INT. BJURMAN'S OFFICE BUILDING - LATE AFTERNOON 182 He gets in the elevator without really looking at the figure already in it. BJURMAN Ground, please. A finger presses it. The doors close and the elevator starts down. SALANDER How's your sex life? Bjurman, terrified, backs into a corner. She presses a button and the elevator jerks to a stop between floors. SALANDER I didn't care much for your last report. (which she has in hand) It felt perfunctory, like your heart wasn't in it. Let's see a little more enthusiasm for my recovery in next month's. BJURMAN I under(stand) - SALANDER Don't speak. I don't want to hear your voice. Just nod. He nods. 102. 102. SALANDER Start looking for a shrink you can bribe to swear under oath he can find absolutely nothing wrong with me. He nods. She gets the elevator going again and steps closer to him. He tries bowing his head like a dog being scolded. She lifts his chin like he did to her before he raped her. SALANDER And stop visiting tattoo removal websites or I'll do it again - right here. She touches his forehead. He backs away. The doors open and she steps out, leaving him in there, looking too frightened to move. The doors close. 183 INT. COTTAGE - LATE AFTERNOON 183 Having returned and scanned Mildred's snapshot into Photoshop, Blomkvist better defines on his laptop its background and the people in frame across the street from where Harriet was standing: INSERT: Couples, kids, a clown. INSERT: The watch repair shop clock that reads, 2:00. INSERT: A figure standing slightly apart from the other people. It's too blurry to make out his face or age, but he has light brown hair, dark slacks, and a dark blazer with some kind of patch on the pocket. 184 EXT. STOCKHOLM - LATE AFTERNOON 184 Salander blasts onto the highway headed north. 185 INT COTTAGE - AFTERNOON 185 Blomkvist regards Isabella's two photos on the wall. In one she's a stunning young woman. In the other, the old wreck she's become. He glances to her husband Gottfried's photo. Where a second more current photo of him should go is a Courier article about his drowning in 1965. That's when Isabella changed - and this is where it happened - in this old house out on the point. He untacks the article - 103. 103. 186 EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - LATE AFTERNOON 186 The boathouse hasn't fared well. Neither has the dock Blomkvist has to walk on to reach it. He glances inside - no boat, just dark water slapping against the pilings - looks back to the shore at the long-uninhabited cabin. 187 INT. CABIN - LATER - LATE AFTERNOON 187 No electricity but enough light spills through the open door for him to see the neglected, shadowy interior: Beds with bare, or no, mattresses. Sticks of furniture. Old water-stained books strewn around. Beer bottles and other debris left by intrepid Hedestad teenagers. It's creepy, even if you weren't alone in it, knowing what you know. He kneels to look at some of the books. Mickey Spillane, a bird guidebook, something called The Evil Empire about the USSR, a children's book. He opens this last one and sees "Harriet" scrawled in a very young child's hand. 188 EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - LATE AFTERNOON 188 Having climbed the cliff above the cabin, he finds himself at the highest point on the island. Stops to rest at the ruins of a fort. A piece of the stone wall next to his head suddenly erupts. As fragments tear into his scalp, he hears the delayed crack and echo of the rifle shot - He throws himself to the ground. Crawls desperately around and behind the ruins. Sees his shirt is bloody but can't feel a wound under it. Touches his face and finds the blood is coming from his forehead. He can see no one, and is almost relieved since if he could it would mean they were walking toward him, which would mean he would soon be shot dead, point blank. He has to get out of here before that happens. Behind him - the rocky cliff he just climbed. Ahead of him - a clearing leading to woods. Really only one choice - He runs for the trees. Dives through a curtain of thicket and stinging nettles that tear at his arms and hands. Crawls the rest of the way to the woods on his elbows and toes like an infantryman. Safe for the moment, he figures, hidden in the woods, he looks at the sun low in the sky, and decides to wait. 104. 104. 189 INT/EXT. COTTAGE - EVENING 189 Salander, returned from Stockholm, moves around the cottage - inside and out - installing the equipment she brought from Milton Security: Motion detectors - security cameras - software that bisects a PC screen into quadrants showing night-vision views of each corner of the cottage. 190 OMIT: EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - EVENING 190 191 INT/EXT. COTTAGE - NIGHT 191 A figure appears on a quadrant of Salander's surveillance PC. Comes past the motorcycle and nearly reaches the porch before she hears - BLOMKVIST O/S It's me. She opens the door to see him covered in blood, pressing a torn piece of his shirt to his bleeding head - and almost gasps. BLOMKVIST It's that bad? 192 INT. COTTAGE - NIGHT 192 She turns the bathtub's hot water tap - BLOMKVIST Is it still bleeding? (touches the wound) It's still bleeding ... why is it still bleeding ... She pulls a length of dental floss from its case - BLOMKVIST (ADR) Is that dental floss? SALANDER Yes. Splits it in two thinner lengths with her chewed finger nails - Feeds one of the lengths of floss through the eye of a needle - BLOMKVIST What is that - (he can see it's a needle) Is that necessary? 105. 105. SALANDER Yes. BLOMKVIST We can't just tape it? SALANDER No. She perches on the edge of the tub where he sits - still in his pants - half-submerged in tepid water - bottle of vodka in his hand. BLOMKVIST Did you sterilize that? SALANDER No. BLOMKVIST You didn't? She splashes some of the vodka on the needle. Most of it goes in the water. Hands the bottle back to him. SALANDER Drink some more. He takes a swig from the vodka bottle. She reaches to his face with the needle and floss - BLOMKVIST Careful, it's my eye. SALANDER Don't move. It takes all he's got not to move, and even that isn't enough as she first sticks the needle through the flesh. He pulls away with a groan. She just looks at him. Waits for him to take another swig of vodka to steel himself. She pierces him a second time, draws the floss through the skin. And after that it doesn't seem to be so bad. As she works, his eyes glance to hers with a mixture of dread and gratitude, but hers are focused on the work. Hers then briefly glance to his, but now his are down. 192A INT. COTTAGE - A FEW MINUTES LATER - NIGHT 192A He comes out of the bathroom in his soaking wet pants and collapses on the bed. She works to pull his pants off. 106. 106. BLOMKVIST What am I doing here ... why did I ever come up here ... He touches the wound and looks at his fingers - BLOMKVIST It's too dark to see ... did it stop bleeding ... I think maybe it has ... it still fucking hurts ... 192B INT. COTTAGE - A FEW MINUTES LATER - NIGHT 192B She regards the surveillance monitor, the night-vision views of the cottage. She can't believe it but she feels vigilant more for his sake than her own. She goes to a window and looks out. Sees her own reflection in the glass and studies it. Then kicks her boots off. 193 INT. COTTAGE - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT 193 She comes into the bedroom in her t-shirt and underwear. He's still muttering without looking at her. BLOMKVIST It wasn't an accident ... Somebody was shooting at me ... It's insane ... these people are insane ... SALANDER No one's shooting at you now. She pulls her t-shirt over his stitched-up head, cocooning it against her breasts. Silence. Then - BLOMKVIST I'm pretty sure this isn't a good idea. SALANDER Why. He extracts his head from the cocoon and looks at her. BLOMKVIST Apart from the fact that I'm old, we work together. SALANDER You work with what's-her-name. That's worked out for you. He nods. That's true. Then - 107. 107. BLOMKVIST I have some standards of behavior, believe it or not. SALANDER You need to stop talking. She climbs on top of him. 194 INT. COTTAGE - LATER - NIGHT 194 Afterwards. She opens his dwindling pack of cigarettes. Lights one. Glances over to him lying next to her. He's not looking at the smoke but rather the startling tattoos on her bare legs and arms. Eventually - SALANDER You want me to open a window? He shakes his head no. Reaches for the cigarette. Takes a drag. Hands it back. 195 INT. COTTAGE - MORNING 195 He wakes. Comes out to find a proper place setting on the table. Sits with Salander. Listens to that awkward, but not altogether unpleasant silence you always hear in this situation the next morning. She breaks it - SALANDER I like working with you. BLOMKVIST I like working with you, too. 196 OMIT - INT. HOSPITAL CAFETERIA - DAY 196 196A EXT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - DAY 196A Establish. 196B INT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - DAY 196B Frode and Martin stare at Blomkvist's unprofessionally sutured head wound; Salander near him like an emaciated bodyguard. FRODE People hunt on the island, Mikael. Gunner's out there shooting something almost every day for his dinner. It could have been a stray shot. MARTIN Not from Gunner. If he wanted to shoot him, he'd have shot him. 108. 108. FRODE We get poachers. They're not always such great shots. MARTIN Or he's right, Dirch. What if he is? This has to stop. Frode regards Blomkvist. FRODE Do you want to stop? BLOMKVIST I have police reports, photos, Henrik's notes, my own notes, and Lisbeth's research. What I don't have are Vanger Industries records. That's what I want. FRODE Why? Blomkvist doesn't say. Only - BLOMKVIST Will you authorize it? FRODE I could but why on earth would I? BLOMKVIST Because I'm asking. FRODE The private corporate records. (Blomkvist nods) How far back? BLOMKVIST All the way. Frode exchanges a look with Martin. BLOMKVIST Henrik said I have access to everything I need. This is what I need. FRODE That's not what he meant. BLOMKVIST Let's ask him. 109. 109. FRODE He's not well enough to ask. BLOMKVIST I'd be happy to sign a nondisclosure statement, if that helps you. FRODE Excuse us a moment. Frode and Martin step away to confer in private. MARTIN I think Henrik would say yes. FRODE That's why he has me. To protect him from himself. This is insane. MARTIN What do we have to hide? FRODE Over the course of 120 years of doing business? Plenty. MARTIN If he needs this to do his job, he should have permission. This goes against every privileged, confidential bone in the lawyer's body. He can only stare at Blomkvist and Salander across the room, wondering why he hired either one of them. 197 EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - LATER - DAY 197 Blomkvist and Salander walk down the road from Martin's house. SALANDER What am I looking for? BLOMKVIST Any connections between the company's holdings and the towns where the women were killed ... and everything about Frode. 198 EXT. HEDESTAD - DAY 198 Vanger Industries' corporate archives are kept in the oldest building in the town's warehouse district. The rumble of Salander's motorcycle announces her arrival. 110. 110. 199 INT. COTTAGE - SAME TIME - DAY 199 Like someone visiting a relative they never liked, Blomkvist reviews yet again the photos from `that day' - scrolling through the bridge accident shots - He stops. One of the figures has something in his hand he hadn't noticed before. It and the figure are somewhat blurred in movement - but it looks like a gun. He sharpens the contrast to reveal that the gun is in fact a Hasselblad-type camera. Looks at the man's face - then at his wall of Vanger family photos - unhappy to see it matches Harald ... 200 INT. VANGER INDUSTRIES - LATER - DAY 200 Carbon-copied or original documents from the 50's and 60's surround Salander like the water around the island: Financial analyses, annual reports, internal memoranda, trade union agreements, brittle news clippings, corporate staff photographs, one of which she's regarding now: A much younger Frode, posing against a wall of law books. 200A INT. COTTAGE - DAY 200A The photo of Harald in his Nazi uniform on the wall. BLOMKVIST V/O Your father was taking pictures that day no one has seen. 201 INT. CECILIA'S HOUSE - DAY 201 Cecilia looks at the blurred bridge photo of Harald with the camera in his hand. Then at Blomkvist, coolly. BLOMKVIST I'd like to if I could. CECILIA So ask him. BLOMKVIST I was wondering if you could do that. CECILIA I don't speak to him, as you know. BLOMKVIST You couldn't make an exception in my case. He gives her his most disarming smile. It usually works with women, but doesn't seem to have much affect on her. 111. 111. CECILIA Are you afraid to be in the same room with him? I'm not saying you shouldn't be. BLOMKVIST You won't help me? CECILIA Sorry. 202 INT. VANGER INDUSTRIES - DAY 202 Salander gets up and crosses to an anteroom where an unhappy older woman - the archive manager - seems to be doing nothing but waiting for the strange girl to leave. LINDGREN Are you finished? SALANDER No. I need to know where all the factories, offices and projects were from 1949 to 1966. LINDGREN You already have everything. SALANDER I don't. Nothing on subsidiary corporations, partnerships, or suppliers. LINDGREN Then you'll have to do without. SALANDER Mr. Frode said I have access to whatever I need, and I need this. LINDGREN He said you have access to this floor. SALANDER Call him. The woman stares at her for a long moment, then picks up the phone. 203 INT. ARCHIVES - DAY 203 Stairs lead them to a higher floor. The woman climbs a step-stool. Pulls a couple of large binders from a high shelf. Salander doesn't help her off the stool and the woman looks at her even more unhappily than before. 112. 112. 204 INT. HARALD'S DEN - DAY 204 The blinds, as usual, closed. Couple of lamps throw shadows on the walls which display hunting and military trophies - wild game heads, sabers and vintage firearms - some of Harald's dearer photographs - some photographs in dusty frames. Blomkvist, alone in the room, looks at them: Swedish Nazi leader in the 1930's. HARALD Sven Olof Lindholm. The 92-year-old comes into the room from the kitchen, followed by a housekeeper with a tea tray. Indicates the younger man in the photo, also in a Nazi uniform, that Blomkvist is looking at. HARALD Me. Blomkvist nods. Has no idea what to say. But Harald waits for more of a response. Finally - BLOMKVIST Handsome. HARALD (taps another) Birger Furugard. Me. (and another) Per Engdahl. (and another) Me. Blomkvist's eyes shift to a bolt-action Mauser infantry rifle displayed on a shelf ... HARALD But your interest is in my more candid photographic work. 205 INT. ARCHIVES - DAY 205 Spread out on the desk: A map of Sweden showing the factory sites and other Vanger holdings - and one she made earlier where the nine women were murdered. Dots appear at the same locations on both. On a handwritten list of the victims, she puts a check next to Rebecka Jacobsson, 1949, Hedestad - moves on to Mari Holmberg, 1954, Kalmar - begins sifting through the mountain of Vanger Industries clippings from that year - 113. 113. 206 INT. HARALD'S DEN - DAY 206 A bony Nazi pouring tea in a shadowy room with you is bad, but the rabbit-print tea cozy only makes it worse. Blomkvist tries to ignore him settling back in his worn leather chair with his chipped cup, and sifts through an old shoebox of unsorted photographs: A holiday at Lake Como, early 1950's judging from the cars; a Vanger family gathering long ago; some men posing by a slain wild boar dangling from a rope. Harald holds out a pack of cigarettes. Blomkvist comes over, pulls one out. HARALD Blom ... kvist ... (lights the cigarette) With an `o' - or a `u.' BLOMKVIST `o.' HARALD An `o.' Blom - kvist. Harald doesn't say it, but his nod means, `not Jewish then. Good' Blomkvist returns to the photos, glancing up occasionally to the smoke curling up past Harald's face as he examines the journalist at work. HARALD I'm not a recluse. I don't close my door to anyone. They just don't visit. BLOMKVIST Perhaps if you redecorated. HARALD Hide the past like they do. Under a thin, shiny veneer. Like an Ikea table. (Blomkvist shrugs) I'm the most honest of all of them. BLOMKVIST The family. HARALD Sweden. Blomkvist opens another shoebox. Lying on top is a photograph of the bridge accident, and, under it, a few more. He takes them out and angles them toward a lamp. 114. 114. HARALD Two point eight. BLOMKVIST Pardon me? HARALD The Zeiss Tessar on my Hasselblad. Excellent lens. Blomkvist tries to nod appreciatively, but the bridge photos don't tell him anything he doesn't already know. He finds several more that appear to be a hunting expedition - men and blood hounds - but then sees Morell in one, more policemen, and a stricken Henrik in boots and raincoat, and realizes this is the search party. Off to the side, a young man, head turned half away, wearing a dark blazer with a gold patch, which that 2.8 Zeiss lens makes clear is a prep school insignia. A lion. HARALD Landscape? Some nice landscapes there. BLOMKVIST No, it's - I can't tell who it is from this angle. He takes the photo over to the Nazi who only has to glance at it a moment to recognize his late nephew's son: HARALD That's Gottfried's boy. BLOMKVIST Martin? Harald nods, hands it back, smokes. It's not unusual Martin would have joined the search party - it would be unusual if he hadn't - it's his sister that's missing - but this blazer he's wearing troubles Blomkvist - HARALD Handsome but useless young man, Martin. Like his father. 207 INT. ARCHIVES - DUSK 207 The archive manager shoulders her purse, locks her anteroom, and approaches Salander. LINDGREN We're closing. 115. 115. SALANDER (without looking up) Nowhere near finished. LINDGREN I'm not staying late. SALANDER I am. And I need access to all the rooms, including any that are locked. (nothing from the woman) Call Frode. 208 INT. HOSPITAL - DUSK 208 As Henrik naps and Martin clears his dinner tray, Frode listens to the caller on the room phone - LINDGREN V/O She wants to look at everything. I don't like her and I don't trust her. There's something wrong with her. FRODE Hang on a second - (to Martin) I'm going to let you decide. It's Ms. Lindgren again. MARTIN (takes the phone) Yes, Ingrid, what's the problem? LINDGREN V/O This girl wants a set of keys now. To my room as well. It's outrageous. MARTIN It's fine. Just tell her to make sure to leave the keys with security when she's done. 209 INT. ARCHIVES - DUSK 209 Having found nothing of interest in the 1954 files, Salander moves on to the 1957 killing of Rakel Lunde. The older woman comes back. Drops a set of keys on the desk. LINDGREN Stay all night if you want. Leave the keys with the guard. The woman leaves. Her footsteps echo and fade. Salander reads a yellowed clipping from a Landskrona newspaper: 116. 116. It's about Vanger Industries hiring a local contractor, Carlen Construction, to build a plant. Gottfried Vanger - here to sign the contract. But all that really interests Salander is the date. The article was published one day after the paper printed the story of the discovery of Rakel's battered naked body. Salander flips through the handwritten notes she made during her talk with the retired detective in Landskrona - and finds that part-time palm reader Rakel's main job was as a cleaning woman for Carlen Construction. The detective interviewed her co-workers, but no one from Vanger Industries, including that firm's representative in town for a few days, Gottfried Vanger. Gottfried Vanger ... which one was he again? Salander brings up on her laptop photographs she took of the wall of the cottage: the Vanger family tree. Gottfried Vanger, Son of Margareta & Richard the Nazi Husband of crazy Isabella, Father of Martin and Harriet Of all the Vangers - at least back in 1950 when Harriet was born - Gottfried was the most handsome. Clark Gable good looks. She puts a check next to Rakel's name and returns to Mari Holmberg and the 1954 Vanger files. 210 INT. COTTAGE - EVENING 210 Blomkvist flips through one of Morell's reports stating everyone's whereabouts on the day Harriet's disappeared. INSERT: Across from Martin Vanger's name it reads: "Arrived on 4:30 train." He brings up the Photoshop-enhanced Brannlund parade photo on his laptop - INSERT: The figure with the blazer and pocket patch standing near the watch repair clock, which reads: 2:00. And the photo Harald let him take with him of `Gottfried's useless boy' - INSERT: Young Martin with the search party, the emblem clearly visible on his blazer pccket. He shuffles through copies of articles in Salander's victims' files. Looks at the last one, Lena Andersson, 1967. The photo is a school wallet photo - 117. 117. INSERT: She's wearing a sweater with the same Uppsala Prep School lion emblem as Martin. He looks at Mildred's parade photo of the figure standing near the watch repair clock. It reads, 2:00. And the photo Harald let him take with him of `Gottfried's useless boy' with the search party. In it and the parade photo, he's wearing the same blazer. He shuffles through copies of articles in Salander's victims' files. Looks at the last one, Lena Andersson, 1967. The photo is a school wallet photo - in a sweater with the same Uppsala Prep School lion emblem as Martin. 211 INT. VANGER ARCHIVES - EVENING 211 Knowing what she's looking for now, Salander finds it fairly quickly: A clipping about a timber company Vanger Industries bought in Kalmar and an interview in its local paper with Gottfried, two days after Mari's murder. She jumps to 1960 - Magda Lovisa Sjoberg - Karlstad - and an article in its local paper - this time with a photo of Gottfried - about a union dispute at its factory there. 212 EXT. COTTAGE - EVENING 212 Blomkvist comes out with his cell phone, tries to make a bar or two materialize on it. Dials but only gets a beep that asks him if he wants to `retry.' He doesn't. Instead, under the darkening sky, he looks off to the point. Martin's house is small in the distance, but he can see there's no car in the driveway and no lights on. He stares at it for a long time ... 213 INT. VANGER ARCHIVES - EVENING 213 Salander pulls a 1962 Uddevalla paper from the files. Same day this time, the same page of the newspaper: Lea Persson's horrific murder and an story quoting Gottfried about an expansion project to the town's harbor. She regards Gottfried's newsprint photo: His face looks more than 8 years older than the one in Kalmar but that's what drinking to excess, and murder perhaps, does to you. 214 INT. COTTAGE - EVENING 214 Blomkvist lays the Lena Andersson article - and the photograph of the figure at the parade - atop the rest of the junk on the desk - and quickly scrolls through photos on his laptop, leaving on the screen for Salander to see when she returns: Martin's recent Vanger Industries PR portrait ... 118. 118. 215 INT. ARCHIVES - NIGHT 215 Salander has hit a snag. Gets up. We stay to have a look at the problem she leaves: the victims list - now with "Gottfried" jotted down next to all but one name: 1967 - Lena Andersson - Uppsala Next to it, the newspaper article about the murdered girl, with a school photo. And, next to that, the reason there's no "Gottfried" notation: his obituary in a Hedestad Courier clipping: 1965. We listen to the fading echo of Salander's footsteps - 216 INT. ARCHIVES - SAME TIME - NIGHT 216 As annoying as the older woman was, it was less creepy with her around. Salander is alone in the old building now, wandering through it looking for vending machines. She finds some. Drops coins in one. A cup fills with coffee. She gets a candy bar from another. The coffee machine finishes. The place again plunges into silence. She starts back with her snack down a hallway - 217 EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - NIGHT 217 Trying to look like he's just out for a stroll, Blomkvist walks past Martin's dark house, then turns around, walks up the front path to the porch and makes a show of knocking on the door, just in case anyone on the island can see him, which is doubtful in this darkness. He tries the door. Locked. Comes down off the porch as if leaving, but then veers off the path and walks around to the side of the house. He peers through a floor-to-ceiling window, but can't see much inside. Comes around to the back and looks in another window. Tries the back door. Unlocked. 218 INT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 218 He can't see a lot in the dark, but doesn't dare switch on any lights. He crosses through the kitchen, but we stay behind to regard a closed basement door ... We pick him up again as he comes into the living room, follow him to a wall of glass. It's pitch black outside. We follow him down a hallway - but stop at a bedroom doorway as if this is as far as we care to go. We stay at the threshold and watch him go in and look around. As he begins rummaging around the recesses of a closet - 119. 119. 218A EXT. THE BRIDGE - NIGHT 218A A pair of headlights comes across the bridge. 218B INT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT 218B Blomkvist comes back to the wall of glass. Still no lights out there. Heads off to the hall again. 218C EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - NIGHT 218C The car parks fifty yards from Blomkvist's cottage. The headlights blink off. Someone climbs out. 218D INT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT 218D Blomkvist comes into a study. Lots of books and framed photographs. He begins looking around. 218E EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - NIGHT 218E The headlights come up the road leading to the point. 218F INT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT 218F Blomkvist approaches a gun case in the study. Hunting rifles. Three of them - and an empty space for a fourth one. The trees outside the study window flare with light. A moment later, Blomkvist hears a sound of tires on gravel. Martin is back, and Blomkvist is in his house. We rush back down the hall with Blomkvist. Hopefully Martin will enter through the front door because we're going to try to get out the back one - Blomkvist trips over something in the dark and we go down with him. Then up again - through the kitchen - past the basement door - grabs a knife from a drawer - shoves it in a back pocket - hurries out the rear door - 219 EXT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 219 Blomkvist tries to steady his breathing as he slinks around the side of the house. As he passes a window, it lights up - and we again hit the ground with him. He hurries across the yard, trips over something in the dark - a sprinkler? - and goes down again into wet muck. He gets up and starts down the road as if returning from a leisurely evening walk - which would be more convincing without the limp - not daring to look back as he goes. 120. 120. MARTIN O/S Hello? Mikael? Blomkvist stops. His heart pounds. Martin comes down his porch and walks toward his car. MARTIN Your evening stroll? BLOMKVIST Hi. How are you? Martin pulls a golf bag from his trunk and shoulders it. MARTIN I stopped at the hospital on my way home. Henrik asked me to ask you something. BLOMKVIST What. MARTIN Come on in, I'll make you a drink. Naturally, this is the last thing Blomkvist wants to do, but it would be more suspicious if he refuses. He heads back to Martin's house, trying not to limp. 220 INT. ARCHIVES - NIGHT 220 Finished with her candy bar and coffee, Salander opens the 1967 files, looks through the clippings for anything of note in Uppsala, where Lena was killed. She finds no news of factories opening there that year, but she does come across a PR newsletter about a winter retreat for fifty employees and their families. There's a photo of Henrik presenting someone with a Best Worker of the Year plaque. And another taken at a dinner for twenty guests and Vanger family members: The camera has captured Henrik presiding at the head of the table, putting on a brave face, raising a champagne flute - as everyone else does the same - except for the young man at the far right foreground. He looks sullen. But what teenager wouldn't at an event as boring as this. Salander would look even more sullen. She checks the caption and reads: ... far right, Martin Vanger (19), currently studying in Uppsala. 121. 121. Uppsala. Same place as Lena - though it's what young Martin is wearing that strikes her: an Uppsala private school blazer with a lion on its pocket - the same as on Lena Andersson's sweater in the photo of her in the article about her murder. 221 INT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT 221 It's not as eerie with the lights on - except for the fact there's a killer in it. Martin sets the golf clubs down and begins emptying a grocery bag in the kitchen. MARTIN What happened to you? BLOMKVIST When. MARTIN Now. Blomkvist's clothes. The fresh mud stains. BLOMKVIST I fell in the dark. MARTIN You don't have a flashlight? I'll give you one. BLOMKVIST I just wasn't being careful. Martin smiles, but Blomkvist isn't sure what he said warrants one. Martin begins rummaging through a drawer for a flashlight. The knife block - with one missing - is right there. MARTIN How's the investigation? BLOMKVIST Nothing new to report. Blomkvist notices a drop of blood from his pantleg on the stone floor and covers it up with his shoe. Martin, not seeming to notice, finds a mini-Maglite in the drawer. MARTIN Dirch says Ms. Salander is clever. Maybe she'll turn something up. BLOMKVIST Maybe. 122. 122. Martin hands Blomkvist the mini-Maglite. BLOMKVIST Thanks. 222 INT. ARCHIVES - NIGHT 222 Salander scrolls through laptop photos to the one at the parade taken by the Brannlund woman on her honeymoon; the people across the street and the blurry figure wearing the blazer with the "pocket square" ... SALANDER Hello, Martin. 223 INT. MARTIN'S KITCHEN - LATER 223 Martin pours Scotch. Hands one to Blomkvist. BLOMKVIST What did he say? MARTIN What? BLOMKVIST You said Henrik asked you to ask me something. MARTIN I just did. BLOMKVIST What? MARTIN How the investigation's going. That was his question. BLOMKVIST Oh. Blomkvist's eyes only dart to a rifle bag leaning against the wall next to a box of shells, but Martin follows them. MARTIN You hunt? We should go hunting together sometime. BLOMKVIST Sure. They drink. Listen to a silence. 123. 123. MARTIN Nothing at all? (Blomkvist doesn't know what he means) New. To report. BLOMKVIST No. Martin regards Blomkvist in another silence. Then - MARTIN I can see you're anxious. BLOMKVIST No. MARTIN To get home. After your walk. BLOMKVIST I suppose I am. MARTIN To have dinner. With your girlfriend. BLOMKVIST My assistant. Yes. MARTIN We'll have better luck with a gun. BLOMKVIST Sorry? MARTIN When we go hunting. Martin pulls open a bar drawer and takes from it a handgun. MARTIN A gun. Rather than a knife. He gives a little gesture with it to the handle of the knife protruding from a back pocket of Blomkvist's jeans. There are fresh drops of blood on the floor next to his shoes. MARTIN You just couldn't stay away, could you. Blomkvist doesn't know what to say. Martin's demeanor, even in this situation, remains cordial. 124. 124. MARTIN I want to show you something. Bring your drink. Leave the knife. Blomkvist's hope of getting out of here unscathed is pretty much gone now. He pulls the knife from his back pocket and sets it on a side table. 224 INT. VANGER ARCHIVES BUILDING - NIGHT 224 Salander strides past the napping night watchman without leaving the keys or bothering to tell him she's done. 225 EXT. VANGER ARCHIVES BUILDING - NIGHT 225 Crossing the empty parking lot, she tries Blomkvist on her cell. Gets his voice mail. Kick-starts her bike. 226 INT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT 226 Martin "leads" Blomkvist from behind back to the kitchen, switching off lights as they go. MARTIN You know what's harder than shooting someone? Just missing them. That was a very good shot up at the cabin. BLOMKVIST It didn't work. I'm here. MARTIN Mikael, it did work. You're here. They come through a pantry, at the end of which is a door. MARTIN Open it. Blomkvist does. Sees steps leading into darkness. As they descend Martin flicks a switch and bare fluorescent tubes flicker on to reveal: A furnace. Washer. Dryer. Old discarded furniture. And another door. A steel one. As they approach it, Martin presses a little remote and the lock on the steel door clicks. MARTIN Push it open. 227 INT. BASEMENT ANTEROOM - CONTINUOUS 227 As Blomkvist steps across the threshold - 125. 125. MARTIN Switch is on the left. Blomkvist flips it and a row of overhead fluorescent tubes flickers on - one after the other - revealing a subterranean torture chamber: Metal eyelets bolted to the concrete walls and ceiling and floor - table with leather straps - bed with leather straps - steel-mesh cage - work bench with handsaws and other tools - Blomkvist takes it in with one glance and immediately turns to try to smash the glass in his hand into Martin's face - which is covered now with a plastic oxygen mask he holds to it. Gas plumes down on Blomkvist from above; the glass comes out of his hand, shattering on the cement floor - 228 EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - NIGHT 228 The Honda's single headlight shudders as Salander comes across the bridge onto the island. 228A INT. MARTIN'S BASEMENT - CONTINUED 228A Blomkvist comes to on the floor, handcuffed to a chain that runs through a metal eyelet. He sees Martin behind a video camera on a tripod, focusing it - a shelf full of Betamax tapes - and a TV monitor on which his own image then appears. Note: the steel door if we were close enough to it to notice - which we aren't - is not locked. It's not even completely shut. Satisfied with the framing of the shot of his guest, Martin takes a seat on a comfortable armchair upholstered in clear plastic. It squeaks. He regards Blomkvist calmly. Sips his drink. Then almost sighs. MARTIN Why didn't you just go home. BLOMKVIST I assume you mean the opportunity for that has passed. Martin smiles, appreciating, perhaps, Blomkvist's "easy" manner in this dire circumstance. MARTIN How'd you do it? What did you find? 126. 126. Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ Blomkvist doesn't say. Martin looks like he has all the time in the world to wait, and does. Then - MARTIN We can talk or we can just get on with it. It's really up to you. Nothing from Blomkvist. Martin shrugs `okay,' gets up, goes to his workbench and takes a plastic shower curtain from it. As he's laying it on the floor around his victim, Blomkvist changes his mind - BLOMKVIST I found a picture no one had seen before. MARTIN Of. BLOMKVIST You. In your Uppsala prep school blazer. Martin doesn't see the significance, but is pleased Blomkvist has decided to "participate." He rewards him by suspending his shower curtain work to return to the chair. It squeaks again. MARTIN What does that say? BLOMKVIST That you lied about where you were that day. Or rather when. MARTIN Did I? If I did, so what. People lie all the time. BLOMKVIST It also said that Lena Andersson was a schoolmate. MARTIN Lena ... (he has to think back to remember her) Lena was a long time ago. (pause) Where's this picture now? With all the other junk on your desk? BLOMKVIST A print is. Digital copies are on a secure photo site. 127. 127. MARTIN That's a lie ... How much does the girl know? Blomkvist isn't sure how to play that question ... MARTIN Let's hope it's as much as you. That'll make it more fun. Where is she? BLOMKVIST Stockholm. She went there this morning. MARTIN And that's a lie. She's sitting in our offices looking at more old crap. Our archives manager called me - very perturbed with this girl. Lisbeth. I like that name. Lisbeth. When Lisbeth leaves I'll get a call from security, so I can be at your cottage to greet her when she arrives - He holds up the keys he took from Blomkvist's pocket when he was out cold. MARTIN I can't thank you enough for bringing her to me. 228B INT. COTTAGE - NIGHT 228B As Salander gets the door open with her key and comes in - SALANDER Mikael - ? He's clearly not here. She goes to the closet. Takes out the surveillance PC. Puts it on the desk - next to Blomkvist's laptop which is now displaying - not the photo of Martin he left for her - but the Apple default "light spider" screen saver. As Salander begins rewinding the captured surveillance images backwards at high speed to get to earlier in the day - 229 INT. MARTIN'S BASEMENT - CONTINUED 229 Martin reframes the video camera to include part of himself in the shot, sits again and crosses his leg like this is a talk show. 128. 128. Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ MARTIN So what would you like to know? There are so many things, but also no point, so Blomkvist says nothing. MARTIN You're the journalist, ask me something. Nothing from Blomkvist. Which is okay with Martin; he can do this alone - MARTIN What do I do with my guests? Is that the question? Well, before - I do what we're doing. Relax, have a drink, converse. I like that part a lot - having a chat when you both know one of you is going to die. After - I simply get rid of them. Out to sea - (points off) - unlike my father leaving them scattered all over the place like trophies. That's not smart if you ask me. That's just garish and loud. But he was a garish and loud man. Frankly, he got what he deserved. Nothing from Blomkvist, but he is wondering now what happened to Gottfried if the drowning wasn't accidental. MARTIN You can't be a sloppy technician like that. You can't drink to excess like he did. This takes discipline. It's a science of a thousand details. The planning. The execution. The cleanup. I'm sure I don't have to tell you you're going to make quite a mess. Nothing from Blomkvist, but Martin nods. ("How do you do this and still function in normal society?") MARTIN That's the interesting thing. Because most of the time I am just like everyone else. I just have a bigger secret. It's wonderful really - standing there waiting for a train - or on a street corner as people brush past me. You know what I mean; (MORE) 129. 129. Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ MARTIN (CONT'D) you have secrets. You had one when you came up here. It made you feel - special. Didn't it? Blomkvist doesn't say. Martin is a little thrown by Blomkvist's next unspoken comment - ("Yes, but my secrets aren't rape and murder") MARTIN No. I'm not a rapist. Of course I do that too - and at one time it was enough - but - (gathers his thoughts to explain it) A rapist, Mikael, gets off on domination. I need ... (discards a few other words before:) - destruction. Martin gets up and sets about the business of immobilizing Blomkvist further with a block-and-tackle contraption of chains and straps. MARTIN Can I ask you something? Why don't people trust their instincts? They sense something's wrong - someone's walking too close behind them - yet they don't cross the street. You knew something was wrong - you even knew what it was - but you came back into the house. Did I force you? Did I grab you and drag you in? I just offered you a drink. (pause) You'd never think the fear of offending could be stronger than the fear of pain - but you know what? It is. They always come willingly. It amazes him. It always amazes him. He keeps working. MARTIN And then they're here. They know it's over like you do - and still somehow think they have a chance. "Maybe if I say the right thing - if I'm polite - or I cry and beg - maybe I'll survive." (regards Blomkvist) And then the moment comes when they realize ... no, all hope is gone. (MORE) 130. 130. MARTIN (CONT'D) And when that happens - when I see the hope draining from their face like it is from yours right now - (whispers like it's just between them) - well, I feel myself getting hard just watching it. Silence ... MARTIN Say something. BLOMKVIST You are a sick fuck. MARTIN ... Is this an interview or an editorial? Blomkvist, of course, doesn't answer, or comment, yet Martin considers what the journalist hasn't said ... ("Martin, civilized people don't do what you do.") MARTIN You're right, this behavior is unacceptable. I know that. But we're not completely different. We both have desires. Satisfying mine just requires more towels. Martin regards Blomkvist in a silence. Then - MARTIN Anything else you want to know? (pause) You sure? (pause) All right. Whatever you say. He yanks a chain that feeds through the pulleys that lift Blomkvist up onto his feet - 230 INT. COTTAGE - NIGHT 230 Salander watches the surveillance images, forward - Blomkvist leaving the cottage and property on foot. Blomkvist returning to the cottage, going back inside. Blomkvist coming out and attempting a call on his cell. Blomkvist going back inside the cottage. Blomkvist coming out again and leaving the property. Blomkvist not coming back. Nothing but the sky darkening to night. Then - 131. 131. Headlights coming through frame. A figure appearing on foot at the front gate. The figure just standing there, looking at the cottage. The figure approaching it, and, as it's trying the locked front door, the motion detection light snapping on and illuminating Martin. Martin moving to the side, looking in a kitchen window, coming around front again, walking to the gate, turning around, looking back, then walking out of frame. 231 INT. MARTIN'S BASEMENT - NIGHT 231 Blomkvist hangs from the block-and-tackle rig, leather strap around his neck now, fed through a ceiling eyelet. With a big sewing scissors, Martin cuts through and removes Blomkvist's pants and underwear - MARTIN It might amuse you to know that while you were over here having dinner with me and Liv - who, by the way, finds me very conventional - Irina was down here in the cage. Who's Irina, you ask? A girl I met in Belarus. Just another girl. Another immigrant whore. Who misses them? He returns to his work bench to lay out various tools next to his gun and a desk phone. BLOMKVIST Your sister wasn't just another girl. Martin comes back quickly and yanks a strap that cinches the noose tighter around Blomkvist's neck as it lifts him onto his tiptoes. MARTIN What happened to her. BLOMKVIST You're choking me - MARTIN You found her? BLOMKVIST You killed her. Martin just stares at him confused. Then - MARTIN You useless fuckin detective. 132. 132. He lets go of the strap and Blomkvist's feet come back down to the floor. As Martin returns to his workbench, Blomkvist is not only scared to death, but confused now. Did Martin not kill her? Then Martin is back in front of him with a roll of cellophane, pulls on the strap again until Blomkvist is balancing on his tiptoes, and ties it off. MARTIN Too tight to talk? It is. Blomkvist can utter no sound but a gag. MARTIN Good. I'm tired of talking to you. He wraps Blomkvist's head in cellophane, completely cutting off his ability to breathe, and calmly watches him struggle. ... MARTIN Would you like me to do something about that? Blomkvist desperately nods as he's about to suffocate. Martin watches another several moments ... then pokes a finger through the cellophane into Blomkvist's gasping mouth. MARTIN See? I'm not a monster. He frames a wide shot of his naked prey. Turns on some music. Takes a moment to collect himself from all this strenuous work. Brushes back his hair like he wants to look presentable in the shot. Then smiles pleasantly - MARTIN You know, I've never had a man in here. I've never touched a man as a matter of fact. Except my father, of course. But that was my duty. Harriet's, too. The circulation to Blomkvist's head is being cut off by the strap. His fingers behind his naked back claw at the concrete wall to try to relieve some of the weight on the noose, but can't get a grip. Martin watches the struggle calmly, and just as calmly offers: MARTIN It's time. I don't want to be late for my date with our girlfriend. 133. 133. Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ He puts on a plastic rain poncho. A painter's mask. Plastic goggles. Surgeons gloves. Picks up a hunting knife. Steps up to Blomkvist. Looks at his eyes. Brings his own head close to his victim's - MARTIN Goodbye, Mikael. He pulls the strap, lifting Blomkvist's toes off the floor, closing off his air again ... and is about to gut him like a wild boar ... when he hears a sound like some kind of animal behind him ... He turns and sees her - coming at him from out of the shadows by the steel door - He darts for the gun he left on the workbench - Salander just as quickly swings a 5-iron - his 5-iron - like a baseball bat. Its metal-wedged end arcs through the gloom and slams into the side of his head, sending him tumbling to the floor. He struggles up to his knees, and she swings the club again, splitting flesh and crushing bone as he crumples the floor. She takes the gun from the bench and shoves it in her other back pocket. Grabs the hunting knife and shackles key and hurries over to Blomkvist who only witnessed part of the spectacle before losing consciousness - She saws through the leather strap around his neck. Unlocks the chain. As he sinks to his knees on the floor, blood rushes to his head, bringing him back to life just enough to see what she can't behind her - Martin, blood streaming from the gash in his head, getting to his feet. But he's not coming at them; he's trying to get out - Blomkvist tries to say her name to get her to look. Lifts a hand to try to point. She turns and glimpses the monster as he disappears out the steel door. Looks back at Blomkvist, still handcuffed on the floor, and, like a child asking a parent for permission - SALANDER May I kill him? Nothing in his life would allow him to agree to such a thing - until now. Now it's as if her years of violence and degradation have been passed to him. He nods. 134. 134. She puts the hunting knife in his hand. Pulls the gun from her back pocket, checks the clip, flicks off the safety, and turns to leave - BLOMKVIST He has more guns in the den - SALANDER I know. She comes up the basement stairs, leading with her gun. Distant thunder rumbles. She crosses through the kitchen to the living room, and down the hall to the study. She eases around the doorway - the room is empty - looks to the gun case - sees there are only two rifles there now. She hears an engine start outside. Hurries back through the house. Sees out the picture window the taillights of Martin's car receding fast down the road as clouds burst. She bangs out the front door. Runs halfway down the hill in the rain to where she left her motorcycle, jumps on and kick-starts it. 232 EXT. THE BRIDGE - NIGHT 232 She roars onto the bridge, chasing the taillights. Guns the bike to full throttle. Comes alongside him. He swerves to try to crush her against the railing - but she hits the brakes, avoiding the impact - She accelerates again and comes up on the other side of the car. He swerves again at her, but this time the bike pulls ahead of him. Now he's chasing her - He gains on her as they near the end of the bridge. As they race off it, he goes in for the kill, but she veers hard to one side, leaving him headed straight for the gas station Blomkvist makes his pay phone calls from - and the tanker truck parked there - Martin hits the brakes - hydroplanes into the truck - and its, or his own tank, or both, explode - Salander circles back. Regards the fire engulfing the car. The rain does nothing to dampen it. She could probably brave it to pull Martin out - but doesn't. As the flames burn his clothes, he manages to get his hands on the rifle he took from the den, turns its barrel to his bloody head - but before he can pull the trigger, she hurries over, yanks it from his grasp and stands back again. It's much more cathartic to watch him burn ... 135. 135. 233 INT. MARTIN'S HOUSE - LATER - NIGHT 233 She finds Blomkvist in the living room. Sitting in a chair, his coat wrapped around him. The hunting knife in his hand. Distant sirens echo. He can still just barely manage to speak - BLOMKVIST Where is he? SALANDER Dead. 234 EXT. HEDESTAD - DAWN 234 Reminiscent of the last photographs taken on the Hedeby Island bridge forty years ago, police and firemen finish up at the crash site. A winch drags Martin's charred black wreck of a car onto a tow truck. 235 INT. COTTAGE BEDROOM - MORNING 235 Blomkvist is asleep in the bedroom with what looks like a neck tattoo - the black and blue mark left by Martin's noose that nearly strangled him to death. He doesn't hear the knock at the front door, nor - SALANDER O/S It's open. Frode comes into the cottage looking shaken. Salander is the picture of calm, drinking a cup of black coffee. FRODE Where's Mikael? SALANDER Asleep. Coffee? There's no milk. Frode absently shakes his head no. FRODE I have some very upsetting news. Martin was killed in a car accident last night. SALANDER Sad. Frode isn't sure he heard right. Regards Salander sipping her coffee. FRODE What? 136. 136. SALANDER I said it's sad. FRODE (pause) What do you know about this? She doesn't say any more. Frode gets up and starts toward the bedroom - FRODE I have to talk to (Mikael) - SALANDER Let him sleep. It's not a request; it's a command. 236 INT. COTTAGE - LATER - MORNING 236 Frode is ashen as he leafs through a binder Salander brought from Martin's chamber of horrors late last night: A scrapbook of murder. A death book. Photos of women cowering in his cage, tied to the bed, dead on the table - along with souvenirs of painted fingernails and locks of hair - all carefully taped into the `album.' The older photographs are Polaroids; the newer ones digital prints. With little to no discernible emotion, Salander watches Frode wince as he turns the pages. Frode can't take it anymore. Closes the book before reaching the end. Just sits there. FRODE What are we going to do? SALANDER We're going home, Mikael and me. I don't know what you're going to do. FRODE I'm going to the police. SALANDER Show them the videos while you're at it. FRODE The - Salander points to a stack of video tapes. 137. 137. SALANDER Would you like to see them? FRODE No. 236A INT. COTTAGE BEDROOM - LATER - MORNING 236A Blomkvist half-wakes to find Salander lying next to him, fully-clothed, watching him. Is she actually there, or part of a dream? He looks at her a long moment, then tries out his voice - BLOMKVIST How is it someone who's 23 is a ward of the state? SALANDER I'm mentally incompetent and can't manage daily life. He smiles, thinking it's joke. It isn't, he realizes. BLOMKVIST Since when have they said that. SALANDER Since I was twelve. BLOMKVIST Something happened when you were twelve? She doesn't say. Just studies him ... BLOMKVIST It's all right, you don't have to tell me anything - SALANDER I tried to kill my father. I burned him alive. Got about 80 percent of him. BLOMKVIST (pause) Oh. Silence. Then - SALANDER We need milk. 237 OMIT - EXT. COTTAGE - LATER - DAY 237 138. 138. 238 INT. COTTAGE - DAY 238 She pours milk in her coffee from the carton she just bought. Pushes over two faded Polaroid photos. He picks them up: One shows a young girl about 14, naked from the waist up, head turned half-away from the camera. The second shows her on her stomach on a bed, completely naked, face turned to the photographer, frightened. BLOMKVIST Harriet? SALANDER I think so. Blomkvist can't look at the photos long. Sets them down. Something's troubling him - BLOMKVIST Martin didn't deny killing anyone. But when I mentioned Harriet, he was confused. He was angry - at me - for not being able to tell him what happened to her. (pause) He didn't kill her. And his father was dead the year before. (pause) What if she did somehow get away? Could she have done that? Could she have done it alone? He goes up to his wall of suspects. BLOMKVIST Is she's alive, there's only one person in this family who would know where she is. He takes the photo of Anita down from the wall. 239 INT. HOSPITAL - DAY 239 Henrik sits in one of the chairs. Blomkvist in another. Salander prefers to stand. Eventually - VANGER Poor Martin. Clearly, he hasn't been shown the death book, or been told the tale of Blomkvist's night in Martin's dungeon. 139. 139. BLOMKVIST I have to go away for a couple days. When I come back, I hope to have an answer for you. Such a possibility stuns the old man. He regards Blomkvist a moment. Then Salander ... VANGER Would the young lady mind giving us a moment of privacy. BLOMKVIST She's my partner, Henrik. She should stay. A tiny, tiny, tiny smile finds its way to her face at the mention of the word `partner.' VANGER What have you found? BLOMKVIST I'm not sure. VANGER Don't treat me like a child. Tell me. BLOMKVIST I can't. I don't know. I need a week. Vanger studies him. Then - VANGER I've waited forty years. I can wait another week. 240 INT. AIRLINE - IN FLIGHT - DAY 240 Blomkvist and Salander read magazines in a pair of coach seats. Across the aisle - occupying two seats - is one 300-lb. sleeping figure: Plague. 241 INT. PUB - LONDON - DUSK 241 They drink pints in an unpopular, almost-empty pub. A Cure song plays. BLOMKVIST I always liked this song. (nothing from her or Plague) You don't? 140. 140. SALANDER I don't like classical music. A strange-looking young man comes in, regards the strange- looking trio at the table, comes over. To the fat man - TRINITY Plague? PLAGUE Trinity. SALANDER Wasp. Blomkvist starts to offer his hand before realizing no one else has or will. BLOMKVIST ... Mikael. Trinity sits. None of these people have much experience with human interaction. They all look at Blomkvist, but he isn't sure why. SALANDER The money. Blomkvist takes an envelope from his jacket, hands it to Trinity. He begins counting it - 242 EXT. LONDON - NIGHT 242 Alone in the back of a parked van amidst electronic components he doesn't understand, Blomkvist anxiously stares out a tinted window at a dark row house. Headlights flare down the street. An approaching car. He hopes it passes, but it instead pulls up to the garage - waits for the door to go up - pulls in. BLOMKVIST Fuck me. He watches Anita Vanger get out of the car - the garage door come down - light go on inside the house - then dark figures hurrying along the side of the house: Trinity, Salander, and finally Plague. They climb into the van with their tools, firewires, a laptop. None speaks as they tether cables to computers in the van. Blomkvist just watches. Finally, to him - SALANDER It's your turn. 141. 141. 243 EXT. ANITA'S HOUSE - LONDON - NIGHT 243 Blomkvist knocks on the door. Anita pulls it open. BLOMKVIST It's me. Sorry to bother you. She doesn't invite him in, but doesn't shut the door in his face either. ANITA What do you want? BLOMKVIST No one's called you? ANITA About. BLOMKVIST Your cousin. She has two, but doesn't ask which - BLOMKVIST Martin. ANITA What about him? BLOMKVIST He died last Thursday. A car accident. I'm sorry. (nothing from her) There's going to be a memorial in Hedestad. I know you haven't been back there in a long time, but - ANITA I'm not interested in any memorial. BLOMKVIST I understand. ANITA What do you understand? BLOMKVIST That you don't really care for any of your relatives. Still, I thought you should know. ANITA Now I know. And now, she closes the door. 142. 142. 244 OMIT: INT. ANITA'S HOUSE - LONDON - NIGHT 244 245 EXT. ANITA'S HOUSE - LONDON - NIGHT 245 Blomkvist returns to the van. Climbs in. SALANDER How'd it go? BLOMKVIST Okay. I think. He sits and watches them monitor the phone and computer taps they installed earlier. One of the laptops, without anyone touching it, blinks on to a Google screen. TRINITY She's on. A screen name and password characters on a Gmail page type themselves. They expect her to go to "Compose," but she opens one of the messages - spam - deletes it - marks a couple more and banishes them as well. The only new thing left in the inbox is an eBay alert. Clicking it takes her to an auction for a triple-strand faux-pearl Jackie O necklace: 49 pounds. The cursor clicks the Buy-It-Now button. As the screen switches to Anita's Paypal account, Blomkvist and Salander exchange a confused glance. 246 OMIT: INT. HOTEL - LONDON - NIGHT 246 246A INT. HOTEL ROOM - LONDON - LATER - NIGHT 246A Salander's laptop is monitoring Anita's computer, her hard-line phone and cell. Blomkvist emerges from the bathroom, rests a hand on Salander's shoulder to peer over it at the screen: In one of the windows, cards are dealing themselves. BLOMKVIST She's playing solitaire? (Salander nods) And she still hasn't called anyone. SALANDER No. BLOMKVIST Do we have her cell, too? Salander points to one of the windows on the screen. His hand comes off her shoulder. 143. 143. BLOMKVIST I was so she'd lead us to her. SALANDER Put your hand back on my shoulder. He does. They watch the solitaire game together ... SALANDER There's only one reason she wouldn't call Harriet. She can't because Harriet is indeed dead. 247 INT. HOTEL ROOM - LONDON - LATER - NIGHT 247 It's strange perhaps, but he does some of his best thinking during sex - BLOMKVIST I was just thinking. What if - SALANDER Ten more seconds. That's fair. She finishes. They lie there. Then - SALANDER Okay, what. BLOMKVIST I was just thinking, there could be one other possibility. 248 OMIT: INT. HOTEL ROOM - LONDON - NIGHT 248 249 INT. INVESTMENT BANK - LONDON - DAY 249 Blomkvist taps on Anita's open office door. BLOMKVIST May I? ANITA What is it now. He comes in and sits. BLOMKVIST I want to show you something. He tugs his shirt collar low enough to reveal the black and blue "tattoo" around his neck. Anita is taken aback by the sight. It's hard to imagine how anyone would end up with a mark like that. 144. 144. BLOMKVIST Before he died, your brother hung me from a hook ... Harriet. 250 EXT. PARK - LONDON - DAY 250 They sit together on a park bench. BLOMKVIST Anita married in Stockholm in 1967. It's recorded in the Swedish General Register. But the family never knew, did they. (she confirms that with a shake of her head) I'm guessing she then came here on a passport in her married name, and you followed on her maiden name passport. HARRIET Actually, it was the other way around. She thought it safer for me to travel with Spencer myself. BLOMKVIST What did he think about that? HARRIET Nothing. Only that he loved her. She said, If you love me, you'll do this and not ask why. He never did. BLOMKVIST They both died twenty years ago. HARRIET A car accident. You found that, too. Blomkvist nods, reaches for something in his jacket pocket - changes his mind - changes it again and pulls it out. BLOMKVIST Is this you? He hands her the less graphic of the two Polaroids Salander found in Martin's basement - the young girl, face turned half-away from the camera ... HARRIET I was 14 the first time he raped me. BLOMKVIST Martin. 145. 145. HARRIET No, my father. He took this picture. Martin didn't start until he died. Blomkvist can't hide his horror even after all he's seen. BLOMKVIST Why didn't you tell someone? HARRIET I did. My mother. Blomkvist stares. Finally - BLOMKVIST Henrik would have done something. HARRIET Would he? I don't know. I almost told him. But I was afraid because of what I did. (pause) You still don't understand? He doesn't. She studies him, and perhaps sees in him what Salander did long ago - that he can be trusted. HARRIET A year after the first time - after many times during that year - my father got drunker than usual one night and started bragging about women he'd killed. He quoted from the Bible as he tore off my clothes. He wrapped a belt around my neck. He wanted to kill me. 251 EXT. GOTTFRIED'S CABIN - NIGHT - 1965 251 Harriet makes it out of the cabin in torn clothing, trying to get the belt around her neck off. Her father can heard inside ranting something from the Bible. HARRIET V/O I made it out of the house and down to the dock. He came staggering after me - Gottfried emerges from the cabin and stumbles down the hill in pursuit of his almost-naked daughter. HARRIET V/O I could never fight him off in a small room, but I was strong enough out in the open to deal with an old drunk. 146. 146. As he comes onto the dock, she waits for the moment, and smashes him in the head with the flat side of an oar. It stuns and sends him toppling off the dock into the water. He surfaces, reaches for the dock planks. As he takes hold of them to claw himself from the water, she brings the sharp edge of the oar down, burying it in his head like an axe. He stares up her, uncomprehending. His fingers slide away from the dock. His body goes limp and sinks out of sight beneath the water. HARRIET V/O When it was finally over I looked up, and Martin was standing there - She sees her brother up by the cabin looking down at her. HARRIET V/O With a little smile. 252 EXT. PARK - LONDON - DAY 252 HARRIET He dragged me back to the cabin ... All I'd accomplished was substitute one rapist for another. 253 EXT. HEDESTAD - DAY - 1966 253 Young Harriet and her school friends walk along the town's main street past crowds lining it, and we realize we're seeing what we've only seen in still photographs. HARRIET V/O A couple months later, Henrik sent him off to school in Uppsala. And I thought maybe - maybe - the nightmare was over. Until that day. The float with the harem girls comes past, and we watch the smile on young Harriet's face change to fear as she notices something off to the left. HARRIET V/O There he was - across the street - looking at me with that same little smile on his face. A clear shot of young Martin in his Uppsala blazer, standing by the corner, smiling at her. HARRIET V/O It wasn't over. 147. 147. 254 EXT. PARK - LONDON - CONTINUED 254 BLOMKVIST How'd you get away? Anita? 255 INT. VANGER MANOR - DAY - 1966 255 Anita, framed in the bedroom window - like in the photograph - looks out at the activity on the bridge. Behind her, Harriet packs a few items of clothing. ANITA Don't take anything. Harriet puts the clothes back. Picks up her purse. ANITA Leave that, too. 256 INT. VANGER MANOR - NIGHT - 1966 256 The dinner that night. Vanger noticing Harriet's empty chair. And Anita saying nothing, taking a bite of food. 257 EXT. HEDEBY ISLAND - DAY - 1966 257 The searchers scouring the island. The boats moving along the shoreline. The crane lifting the truck from the bridge. Anita climbs into her car outside her father Harald's house. Drives down the road toward the bridge. ANITA Stay absolutely still. The blanket covering Harriet on the backseat floorboard moves slightly, then is still. A policeman on the island side of the bridge waves the car across it. As it heads along the mainland service road toward the highway - HARRIET V/O She saved me. 258 EXT. PARK - LONDON - DAY 258 Silence. Then she gestures to Blomkvist's neck. HARRIET How did you get away? BLOMKVIST Someone saved me, too. 148. 148. He gestures off to the thin, strange girl sitting on another park bench too far away to hear them. Harriet does something she hasn't done since they met: smile. 259 EXT. VANGER MANOR - DAY - ESTABLISH 259 259A INT. VANGER MANOR - DAY 259A Blomkvist, Salander and Frode wait in Vanger's study. A tea service tray sits there untouched like the first time Blomkvist came here. Anna pushes a wheelchair into the room with Vanger in it. There's a file on his lap. BLOMKVIST How are you feeling? VANGER I'm fine. Thank you, Anna. Anna leaves. Closes the doors. Before Blomkvist can say anything else - VANGER I made you a promise. Whether you found out anything or not. He holds out the file. Blomkvist takes it and sees: INSERT: Wennerstorm's name typed on it, and a fairly recent photo of him clipped to it. VANGER Now. What do you have to tell me. 259B EXT. VANGER MANOR - DAY 259B A car pulls up the drive. Parks. The back door opens. Harriet climbs out. Looks at the manor. Then walks toward the front door - 260 INT. VANGER MANOR - MOMENTS LATER 260 Vanger propels his wheelchair down the main hall, but stops when he sees Harriet coming in the front door with Anna. He stares, trying to reconcile how she looks now compared to when he last saw her, or maybe to convince himself she's really alive. She sees him ... HARRIET Hi, Henrik. He begins to weep. She walks to him and places a hand on his hunched shaking shoulders. Frode, Blomkvist and Salander watch. One of them isn't particularly moved. 261 OMIT - INT. VANGER MANOR - DAY 261 149. 149. 261A INT. COTTAGE - LATER - DAY 261A As Frode leafs through the file that Blomkvist has already read - FRODE ... I don't even remember Wennerstrom working here, much less being fired ... BLOMKVIST Why would you. It was a long time ago. Which is more to the point than the money he embezzled. FRODE I don't think I'm seeing the point. BLOMKVIST Yes, you are. FRODE (another look at the paperwork) It happened in the 1970's ... Salander watches the two men from across the room ... FRODE (ADR) (regarding the documents) I swear I didn't know this was what Henrik had on him. If I had, I never would have let him bring you up here. But he wasn't trying to deceive you. BLOMKVIST Come on, he knows you can't try somebody for this 35 years later. I like Henrik, but he knows that. Frode disagrees - FRODE A man's reputation used to mean something - he still believes that. I'm sure he thought you could destroy Wennerstrom with this in the court of public opinion. BLOMKVIST The "court of public opinion," Dirch, makes celebrities out of girls who shop. Henrik promised me Wennerstrom's carcass on a plate. This isn't even the plate. I can't do anything with this. 150. 150. FRODE Of course you're right ... (pause) I'm sorry. 262 EXT. VANGER MANOR - LATER - DAY 262 Blomkvist and Salander sit out by the water, sharing the last cigarette in his pack. Her arm is draped over his shoulder, which strikes him as the most tender of gestures, coming from her. SALANDER Fuck these people ... BLOMKVIST Yeah ... SALANDER Harriet most of all. BLOMKVIST Excuse me? SALANDER If she'd done anything but run, Martin wouldn't have been able to kill all those women. BLOMKVIST She had no idea he was doing it. SALANDER She should have killed her father and him. BLOMKVIST That's what you would've done. Not everyone's you. She's not sure she likes the comment. Decides she doesn't. Takes her arm away from his shoulder. BLOMKVIST That was meant to be a compliment. Put your arm back on my shoulder. She doesn't. So he drapes his on hers. Then - SALANDER What happened with Wennerstrom. How did he get you? 151. 151. BLOMKVIST I was stupid. I got something from an anonymous source, who I'm sure now worked for him. It was fake. Which he easily proved in court. Not a good day, that. Then - SALANDER You were emphatic that the way I looked into your life was illegal and immoral. Would you feel the same about Wennerstrom? He regards her, uncertain what she means ... SALANDER I started investigating him on my own. Then you showed up and hired me. I haven't had a chance to look at it all - you and Harriet-fucking- Vanger have kept me busy ... but I may have something. BLOMKVIST (pause) On Wennerstrom. She nods. Then rests her head on his shoulder. 263 OMIT: EXT. TRAIN STATION - HEDESTAD - DUSK 263 264 INT. BLOMKVIST'S APARTMENT - MORNING 264 A new family tree on a wall here, more complicated than the Vanger's: The Wennerstrom Group, made up of dozens of companies in cities worldwide. As Erika looks at it - BLOMKVIST Wennerstrom's Swedish assets are genuine, but they're the only things that are. The rest is funneled through companies in Gibraltar, Colombia, and Macao. These companies produce no products and provide no services. They're shells. They launder money from arms and drug sales, and crime syndicates in Russia. And that money - which accounts for all but 5-percent of his holdings - ends up in accounts in the Cayman Islands. It's a completely illegal, criminal empire. ERIKA How do you know this? 152. 152. BLOMKVIST This time you don't want to know. ERIKA This time I do want to know. BLOMKVIST I have access to his computer, and his accountants' and lawyers'. She isn't happy to hear that explanation. ERIKA And how do you have that? BLOMKVIST I could have gotten it from a source inside the company. ERIKA But you didn't. BLOMKVIST But that's what you'll say. ERIKA But what will you say to me? BLOMKVIST That depends on if you really want to know. ERIKA I do. Who gave you access? What looks like 16-year-old tattooed runaway lets herself in with her own key. Crosses past Erika with a paper bag, takes out two bagel sandwiches, the same kind Blomkvist brought when he barged into her apartment. As she puts some water on for coffee, Erika looks at Blomkvist. He nods. Yeah. Her. 265 TV NEWS: 265 ANNOUNCER Journalist Mikael Blomkvist - who this time last year was convicted of libel in a Stockholm courtroom - doesn't seem to have learned from that experience. Or maybe he has - 266 INT. BLOMKVIST'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 266 The report continues on a TV in Blomkvist's bedroom - 153. 153. Dragon Tattoo Final 9/1/11 SZ ANNOUNCER In the current issue of Millennium magazine, he now charges the same company that successfully sued him - The Wennerstrom Group - of criminal activities on a global scale - backing it up with internal financial reports, bank records and emails - annotations almost as long as the article itself. The cover of the magazine features a head shot of Wennerstrom, and, rare for the magazine, a tabloid-style title: GANGLAND. Salander leafs through the article as Blomkvist brushes his teeth in the bathroom. BLOMKVIST He'll call it a personal vendetta but it won't work. FI can't ignore banking and securities fraud like this. The police can't ignore the organized crime stuff. They'll both have to investigate. SALANDER Then. BLOMKVIST We'll be back in court, but this time it'll cost him. That's probably it, though. These guys never to prison. Salander nods, but it's not really in agreement. Or maybe it is. In any case, she's not as enthused about all this as he is. BLOMKVIST What's wrong. SALANDER It's embarrassing. BLOMKVIST What. SALANDER I need to borrow some money. Blomkvist grins and reaches for his wallet. 154. 154. SALANDER 50,000. His grin stays stitched to his face a moment, then unravels. He puts his wallet away. SALANDER I have a chance to make an investment. It's a smart, safe investment. BLOMKVIST I don't know that I have that much. SALANDER You do. I'm sorry that I know that. You have 65 thousand in your two accounts. He's no longer shocked or dismayed by her knowing more about his personal affairs than he does. SALANDER You'll get the money back. I promise. 267 INT. SALANDER'S APARTMENT - DAY 267 Several pages torn from pages of fashion magazines: Models - all of them blonde - their beautiful faces - designer clothes - accessories - make-up tips. Applying makeup to the wasp tattoo on her neck and the "handcuffs" on her wrists, Salander pays no attention to the TV showing Wennerstrom under an umbrella, interviewed outside the building that bears his name - WENNERSTROM These allegations - like the last ones from this so-called journalist - are as ridiculous as they are untrue - 268 EXT/INT. CLOTHING STORE - STOCKHOLM - DAY 268 Salander purchases with cash expensive designer clothes she normally wouldn't be caught dead in. WENNERSTROM I'll be seeing Mr. Blomkvist in court again. I'm looking forward to it. 269 EXT/INT. LUGGAGE SHOP - STOCKHOLM - DAY 269 Here she's buying a high-end carry-on valise and portfolio briefcase. 155. 155. REPORTER What about his documentation? WENNERSTROM Fabricated. All of it. 270 EXT/INT. WIG SHOP - STOCKHOLM - DAY 270 Good wigs cost money - like the shoulder-length blonde one atop a black Lucite head Salander is purchasing. ANNOUNCER The Securities Fraud Office isn't quite as certain as Mr. Wennerstrom of that. 271 EXT/INT. SHOP - STOCKHOLM - DAY 271 A place that caters to transvestites who, among other things, require as Salander does, latex breasts. FSA OFFICIAL If even a fraction of what Mr. Blomkvist is alleging proves to be true, not only will there be a securities investigation, but an organized crime inquiry as well. 272 EXT/INT. SALANDER'S APARTMENT - DAY 272 Wearing the wig and a designer outfit she takes her own passport photo against a wall. She looks like Erika. REPORTER Mr. Blomkvist names no sources. FSA OFFICIAL And we can't force him to. But we can look for them. REPORTER Beginning where? FSA OFFICIAL Beginning with those closest to Mr. Wennerstrom. Only someone in the inner circle of a corporation like this could have access to this kind of information. 273 INT. PLAGUE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 273 Not wearing the wig now, she inspects a passport Plague has acquired for her featuring the crown of Norway, and some credit cards. 156. 156. On his TV, a pack of lawyers stand where Wennerstrom was standing before - outside the Group's corporate offices - under, as usual, umbrellas - LAWYER Mr. Wennerstrom isn't available for comment today, but as his legal counsel, I'd be happy to answer your questions. REPORTER Where is he? LAWYER At home, I imagine. REPORTER He isn't. Has he left the country? LAWYER I don't think so. 274 EXT. ZURICH - DAY 274 A plane touches down on a Zurich Airport runway. 275 INT.

SUITE - ZIMMERSTAHL - EVENING 278 Salander emerges from the bathroom without the wig on. Crosses through the suite in her underwear. Oddly - or perhaps not - she's also wearing a pair of white gloves. She opens the balcony's doors to let in some air. On the TV: ANNOUNCER With his failure to appear before a Security Exchange Commission panel, a warrant has been issued for The Wennerstrom Group CEO. 157. 157. An immigration official appears before the news cameras - IMMIGRATION OFFICIAL I can confirm that he left Sweden on a private jet that landed in Paris last week, but whether he's still there, we don't know. He could be anywhere by now. She sips at her room service coffee. 279 EXT. ZURICH - DAY 279 "Irene Nesser" enters Bank Hausen General under watchful security cameras. 280 INT. BANK HAUSEN GENERAL - ZURICH - DAY 280 Security cameras inside watch her and a banker at a desk in an area reserved for discreet transactions. SALANDER I have a number of accounts at Bank of Kroenfeld, Cayman Islands. I want to transfer those funds and convert them to bonds. As she writes an account number on a slip of paper from memory, Herr Wagner notices - as she intends - the pen she's using - from the venerable Zimmerstal Hotel. WAGNER Naturally, you have the clearing codes. SALANDER Naturally. WAGNER How many accounts will you be transferring? SALANDER Thirty. He glances at his watch, perhaps thinking about lunch. His faux-politeness - even his appearance - reminds her of Bjurman. WAGNER This will take some time. SALANDER For which you'll receive a 4-percent commission. 158. 158. WAGNER I will. SALANDER Then it won't be a waste of it. She offers him the Zimmerstal pen. WAGNER Thank you, I have one. He picks up one of his cheap pens. She hands him a long list of account numbers and clearing codes - 281 INT. SUITE - ZIMMERSTAL HOTEL - ZURICH - DAY 281 As she sorts through a stack of bonds, the TV shows a reporter in a colorful town square. REPORTER A Swedish tourist vacationing here in Barbados says he knows where fugitive financier Hans-Erik Wennerstrom is: Here in this Caribbean island's capital, Bridgetown. Police released this photograph, taken yesterday by the tourist, Jens Assur - A snapshot of Wennerstrom, or someone who looks like him - tropical shirt, hat and sunglasses - climbing into a car. REPORTER - and say they believe it is the disgraced billionaire. 282 INT. BANK DORFMANN - ZURICH - DAY 282 Sitting with a different bank manager now as security cameras keep silent watch, she opens her portfolio and turns it so he can see its contents. He glances up with a polite smile that's supposed to mask his surprise. HASSELMAN How many of these would you like to convert for deposit? SALANDER All fifty. Into five accounts. He works out the conversion to CHF and hands her the calculator: A "2" followed by more digits than we can count. SALANDER That looks correct. 159. 159. 283 INT. SUITE - ZIMMERSTAL HOTEL - EVENING 283 The remnants of a McDonald's kids meal on the desk with the wig and white gloves.

SALANDER'S APARTMENT - STOCKHOLM - NIGHT 290 Salander - looking like Salander - enters her apartment with only her laptop bag. Holds Irene's passport over a stove flame.

Only problems. (pause) I have some good news now. I've made a friend. I mean one that you'd approve of. (pause) I'm happy. One of Palmgren's hands manages to pull slightly away from the other, tries to reach for her, perhaps, but only makes it about an inch. She reaches over and holds it. 295 EXT.

BARISTA Sir? REPORTER ON TV Wennerstrom spent the last days of his flamboyant life in solitude and anonymity, locked behind the door of Room 3A - BLOMKVIST ... Coffee and a sandwich ... that one.

TAILOR SHOP - STOCKHOLM - DAY 296 A tailor brings out a garment bag bearing his exclusive insignia, drapes it across a table, returns to Salander the photograph she provided him with last week: It's of a much younger Blomkvist - at about Salander's age now - wearing the black leather jacket he loved and lost track of years ago. The tailor unzips the bag revealing an exact - though considerably more expensive - replica of the jacket. 164. 164. SALANDER It's perfect. TAILOR Your father? SALANDER A friend.

SALANDER'S APARTMENT - DUSK 297 A perfect Christmas card vista that actually turns out to be a Christmas card: A snowy rural landscape scene. It's stupid, but she's writing under the pre-printed "Merry Christmas" inside, a personal note that's more sincere than she thought herself capable. She blows on the ink, puts the card in its envelope, neatly writes "Mikael" on it, gets up - 298 EXT. STOCKHOLM - EVENING 298 Snow's falling, but unlike the brutal winter storms last year, it's just heavy enough to dust the city in white powder that reflects the Christmas lights in the trees. The beauty of her city pleases Salander as she rides through it on her motorcycle. Or maybe it's something she's feeling as she turns onto Blomkvist's street. She parks. Gathers the garment bag and card, walks under construction scaffolding toward his apartment building. From around the corner ahead, Blomkvist and Erika appear. He says something and she laughs, puts her arm around his waist and lays her head against his neck scarf. Salander stops mid-stride, ducks into an alcove under the scaffolding, waits as long as it should take them to get inside the building, then peers out again - They're not inside. They've stopped just outside the building's entrance. They're embracing. And the longer they stand there together, the sharper the pain stabs at Salander. Finally they separate, but only to allow Blomkvist to unlock the door. Erika takes his hand then, and they disappear inside. 165. 165. Salander can't move. Waits for the pain to subside - which it eventually does - but only to be replaced with a sense of helplessness. Then that subsides, replaced with a facade of insouciance. The richest girl in Sweden emerges from the alcove and walks back the way she came - tossing the garment bag and card into a construction dumpster - climbs onto her Honda - starts it - and drives off - Probably forever.

             EXT. A DITCH - NIGHT

             A light rain and crickets CHIRPING. Somewhere in the night,
             DANCE MUSIC is blaring, but here it's only a whisper with a
             beat.

             Water trickles out of a jagged pipe. Splashing up mud, the
             riverlet weaves through hamburger wrappers and sunbleached
             beer cans, spent condoms and an old Spin magazine.

             The tiny stream ripples past glass and trash and the body of a
             woman. Face up, breathing. Dead grass caught in her braids.
             Her name is RONNA MARTIN. She's eighteen and bleeding.

             Bleeding a lot.

             She tries to         push herself up, but the dirt around her crumbles.
             Her legs are         useless. Despite it all, there's a smile of
             perverse joy         to her face, like she's just remembered the
             punchline to         a favorite joke.

             Pitch black. We hear an ENGINE and ROAD NOISE.

                                          CLAIRE (V.O., CONT'D)
                               It's like, you get this box, and you're
                               sure you know what's in it.

             SPARKS. A cigarette lighter flares.

             We're in the trunk of a car with SIMON BAINES (22), a skinny
             Brit with surfer hair. He looks around, realizes where he is.
             Panicked, he starts POUNDING and KICKING.

                                          CLAIRE (V.O., CONT'D)
                               You shake it, you weigh it, and you're
                               totally convinced you have it pegged. No
                               doubt in your mind.

             The lighter goes out. It's black again.

                                                                             CUT TO:

    We keep tight on CLAIRE MONTGOMERY (19) as she talks to an
    unseen guest. Christmas lights blink behind her.

                          CLAIRE (CONT'd)
               But then you open it up, and it's
               something completely different. Bing!
               Wow! Bang! Surprise! I mean, it's like
               you and me here.

    She takes a sip of coffee, smiles. She has a bewitching smile.

                          CLAIRE
               I'm not saying this is anything it's not.

    A cash drawer slides shut.

    On the far side of the checkout stand, a STRINGY HAIRED WOMAN
    counts food stamps. Her eyes are sunken, black. She's got a
    screaming BABY on her arm and two rambunctious BOYS in the
    cart. They're wearing pajamas and raincoats.

    It's five a.m. and the store is almost empty.

    Containers of frozen orange juice spin endlessly on the
    conveyor belt. Ronna Martin -- the girl in the ditch -- is
    bagging groceries.

                          RONNA
               Paper or plastic?

    She wears a green apron with a red "Yule Save More" button.

                            RONNA
                 Paper or plastic?

    She's been working for fourteen hours, and it shows. Her
    intonation doesn't change at all.

                            RONNA
                 Paper or plastic?

                           STRINGY HAIRED WOMAN
                 Both.

    Finally satisfied she has all her stamps, the Woman starts
    looking through the receipt. In the cart, the boys knock gum
    from the stand.

                            STRINGY HAIRED WOMAN
                 You didn't double my coupons.

                           RONNA
                 They're at the bottom. In red. Where it
                 says, double coupons.

    She finishes one bag and starts another. The Woman is watching
    her carefully.

                            STRINGY HAIRED WOMAN
                 You can't do that. You can't put bleach
                 in the same bag as food. It's poison.

    Ronna fishes out the bleach and makes a big show of wrapping it
    in a plastic bag.

                            STRINGY HAIRED WOMAN
                 Don't think you're something you're not.
                 I used to have your job.

    Ronna puts the bag in the cart. Looks her dead in the eye.

                            RONNA
                 Look how far it got you.

    Ronna pulls off her apron as she heads for the back. In the
    BACKGROUND, the Stringy Haired Woman is bitching to an
    overweight STORE MANAGER.

6A   INT. SUPERMARKET STOCKROOM - DAY                                        6A

     Dark and dusty, packed floor to ceiling with crates and
     palettes. Offscreen, a SOAP OPERA plays on TV.

     Ronna comes around the corner, a thundercloud of anger and
     frustration. She passes by CLAIRE (19) and the British SIMON
     (21) at the phone, sorting through a crumpled list.

     Simon's eyes track Ronna as she passes.

                           CLAIRE
                   (low)
               Don't.

                          CLAIRE
               She's been on for fourteen hours.

     At her locker, Ronna misdials the combination. Frustrated,
     she POUNDS the locker, then re-dials.

     Simon approaches Ronna gingerly. Claire gives up on him,
     setting to work opening a box of expired cookies.

                           SIMON
               Ronna?

                           RONNA
               No.

     She trades her apron for her coat.

                          SIMON
               I haven't asked you yet.

                         RONNA
               Answer's still no.

     She slams her locker. She crosses to the time clock.

                          SIMON

                      (punches out)
                  Okay, Simon. In case you haven't heard
                  the buzz, the scoop, the word on the

                  So pardon me if I'm not in a holly-jolly
                  mood right now.

     Claire looks over, looks away. Ronna heads for the door
     leading outside.

                            SIMON
                  Ronna, they wouldn't evict you at
                  Christmas. You'd be ho-ho-homeless.

     He follows her out the door.

                  Is that why all the overtime? How much do

     Adam smiles. It's a nice smile. Even Ronna notices.

               So do you want the o.j. or not?

11   INT. MANNIE'S CAR / PARKING LOT - NIGHT                                11

     The Beast is Mannie's pride and joy,    a late-70's Toyota held
     together with duct tape and prayer.     It's outfitted for the
     season with Christmas lights lining    the windshield and back
     window. Santa has replaced Jesus on     the dashboard.

     Ronna climbs in the passenger door, counting a stack of 20's
     fresh from the ATM. Claire's in back.

                          CLAIRE
               You know that Simon's in Vegas.

                          RONNA
               I don't need Simon. I'm going to Todd.

                         MANNIE
               Todd GAINES?

                          CLAIRE
               Who's Todd Gaines?

                         MANNIE
               Simon's dealer.

     Claire sits forward in the seat, suddenly worried.

                          CLAIRE
               You can't do that, can you? I mean, go
               around Simon.

     She looks at Mannie. He shrugs, unsure.

                          RONNA
               Ok, listen up. If Simon were here --
               which he's not -- he would charge fifteen,
               when I know he gets it for ten.

                          CLAIRE
               Ronna, you shouldn't do this.

     Ronna pockets the cash. Mannie's about to say something when
     she stops him.

                          RONNA
               Both of you chill the fuck out. It's just
               once. When Simon gets back, we can still
               overpay for quarters if it makes you feel
               all warm and happy. But this is my deal,
               so just sit back and watch.

     Mannie and Claire remain unconvinced. Ronna reaches for the
     keys, CRANKING the ignition even though Mannie's driving. The
     ENGINE purrs.

                         RONNA (CONT'd)
               Besides, Todd likes me. This won't be any
               problem.

     A BUZZER sounds.

     Ronna stands by the intercom of a two-story walkup in
     Hollywood. Waiting, she looks back to the street, where The
     Beast sits idle at the curb.

                          INTERCOM VOICE
               Speak!

                         RONNA
               Todd! It's Ronna Martin. You know me
               through Simon.

     A long pause.

                          INTERCOM VOICE
               Yeah?

                          RONNA
               Can I come up?

     Another long pause. Ronna looks back at The Beast,
     embarrassed. Finally the door BUZZES and a latch CLICKS open.
     Stairs lead up.

     She motions back "five minutes" to The Beast.

                                                                            12.

     Three out of four lights are burned out in the hallway.

     A few feet ahead of Ronna, a door stands partly ajar. A weird
     red-and-green light spills out through the crack, along with
     an Alice in Chains SONG.


14   INT. APARTMENT / LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                                     14

     Ronna pushes the door open from the hallway.

                            RONNA
               Todd?

     Shades drawn, the room is completely insulated from reality.
     The light bulbs have been markered over, casting eerie pools of
     red and green light. Broken CD's dangle off a tiny Christmas
     tree by the stereo. Slacker seasonalism.

                          GAINES (O.S.)
               Don't let the cat out.

     Ronna closes the door behind her.

     TODD GAINES emerges from the darkened bedroom, tying the
     string on a pair of sweat pants. That's all he's wearing.

                          RONNA
               I didn't wake you up, did I?

                            GAINES
               Nah.

     He settles into an overstuffed couch and lights a Marlboro.
     Adjusts himself in the crotch. Motions for her to take a
     chair. She's more nervous than she wants to let on.

                          GAINES
               I thought you were still buying quarters
               off Simon. Least what Simon pretends are
               quarters.

                          RONNA
               I keep him honest.

                          GAINES
               At that level you're supposed to pinch.
               It's the economics of it.

     IN THE BACKGROUND

     A WOMAN with a ballerina's body comes out of the bedroom. She
     tucks an unrealistically large breast down into her tight top.

                            GAINES
                  You leaving?

     She leans over the back of the sofa for quick, tonguey kiss.
     In a sneak attack, she shoves a Santa's hat down to his ears.
     He bats the white pom out of his eyes.

                             GAINES
                  Be good.

     The woman is out the door without a word. Gaines looks back
     over at Ronna, not the least bit self-conscious about the hat.

                             GAINES
                  I take it this is not a social call.

                             RONNA
                  I need a favor.

                             GAINES
                  A favor? Wow. I didn't know we were such
                  good friends, Ronna. Because if we were,
                  you would know I give head before I give
                  favors. I don't even give my best friends
                  head, so the chance of your getting a
                  favor right now are pretty fucking slim.
                      (beat)
                  You might try just telling me what you
                  want to buy.

                            RONNA
                  Twenty hits of ecstacy.

     He takes a deep drag on the cigarette, looking at her. Blows
     the smoke out. He picks up a remote control. Aims it at the
     stereo.

     CLOSE UP

     The volume meter, climbing fast.
     Out of the green, into the red.
     The MUSIC is deafening.

     ON GAINES

     On top of Ronna, face in her ear. His hand wraps around her
     head, holding her tight. We can't HEAR what he's saying.
     Ronna's eyes betray her fear.

                                                                     (CONTINUED)

     He backs off. She looks confused.

     He nods. Do it.

     The MUSIC still BLARING, she stands and slowly unbuttons her
     shirt. Takes it off -- very self-consciously. Pulls her t-
     shirt off over her head. Just her bra underneath. He motions
     for her to turn around. She does, then back.

     Her hands are shaking. She holds them together.

     Gaines aims the remote at the stereo. The MUSIC retreats.

                          GAINES
               You come here out of the blue asking for
               twenty hits. Just so happens twenty is
               the magic number where intent to sell
               becomes trafficking.

                          RONNA
               Todd, I would never fuck you like that.

                          GAINES
               How would you fuck me? Would you strap it
               on?

     He climbs over the sofa to a dresser. In a drawer, he digs
     down through a pile of socks to find a wide-mouthed bottle.
     And an empty Tylenol bottle. Blows out the dust.

                          GAINES
               What's the occasion?

                          RONNA
               There's this big Christmas party thing.
               Warehouse, you know. A bunch of us are
               doing sort of a pre-party thing.

                          GAINES
               Friends of yours. You're not going to go
               and try to sell this on me, are you?

                          RONNA
               No.

                          GAINES
               You're not dealing.

                          RONNA
               Swear to God.

     He transfers pills from the big bottle to the Tylenol bottle.

               Here's the deal. There's 20 of us. I

     Gaines undoes the cap of the Tylenol bottle, starts pouring the
     pills back out.

               No, hear me out. This two-hundred is like

               is an accessory. You are just some chick
               who's sitting in an apartment. That's it.

     It's not just the matter at hand, but years of minor adjustment
     and one-upsmanship. Ronna finally drops the bravado.

                          RONNA
               Okay, no bullshit. I need this. I don't
               get this money, I get evicted. My ass is
               out the street.

                         CLAIRE
               You could...

                  go to. I am coming to you and I am asking
                  for your help. Please. Help me.

     A beat.

                            CLAIRE
                  Forty-five minutes. That's like eight
                  o'clock.

                             RONNA
                  We'll be back by eight, I promise.

     Ronna holds the door as Claire reluctantly steps inside.


17   INT. MANNIE'S CAR - NIGHT                                                17

     The clock on the dashboard reads 8:04.

                             RONNA (v.o.)
                  Is this it? Are you sure?

     ENGINE running, The Beast is parked along a residential street
     in Venice. In the driver's seat, Mannie looks for an address.

                            MANNIE
                  Six-forty-four. Jesus, next time ask for
                  directions.

     He kills the engine. Ronna does a quick face-check in the rear
     view mirror. She's out the door, moving a hundred miles an
     hour.

                            MANNIE
                  Ronna!

     She looks back in. Mannie shakes the Tylenol bottle she
     forgot. Tosses them to her.

                             MANNIE
                  You're a pro.

                             RONNA
                  I'm a top-seeded amateur.

     She pockets the bottle. SLAMS the door. Mannie tracks her as
     she circles the car.

                             MANNIE
                  And I'm a very happy man.

     In his palm, two tablets. He works up a good gob of spit, then
     swallows them both. They're bitter as hell.


18   INT. VENICE HOUSE / MAIN ROOM - NIGHT                                      18

     A beefy guy named BURKE HALVERSON reaches out a hand.

                             BURKE
                  Damn good to meet you, Rhonda.

                            RONNA
                  Ronna.

                             BURKE
                  Ronna. When I heard Philly got snowed in,
                  I thought we were fucked for sure. Glad
                  we found you.

     Her PAGER goes off, a shrill CRY. She quiets it, checks the
     number. Burke smiles.

                             BURKE
                  Work work work. Friday must be a busy
                  night.

                             RONNA
                  That was just a friend.

     Only now do we TURN to see Adam and Zack standing nearby,
     trying to look cool. Their house is spartan even by frat-boy
     standards, just goodwill furniture and as-is Ikea.

                            BURKE (O.S.)
                  Hey. What can I get you to drink?

                             RONNA
                  Some of that orange juice would be great.

     Burke does a hepcat swing through the kitchen door, leaving
     Ronna alone with Adam and Zack.

                             ZACK
                  So this party tonight sounds like it's
                  gonna be huge.

                             ADAM

                            ZACK
                  That would be a synonym for huge.

                            ADAM
                  Just backing you up.

                             ZACK
                  And I appreciate that.

                 Ronna hun, we are fresh out of o.j...

     Adam looks at Zack. Ronna catches it.

                           BURKE
                     (back thru door)
                 Cerveza?

     He hands her a beer.

                           ADAM
                     (to Burke)
                 Oh yeah. Hey. We bought a whole bunch of
                 orange juice. It's in the car.

     ANGLE ON RONNA

     watching them with a lion tamer's concentration. Burke looks
     back over at her.

                            BURKE
                 Now, Zack tells me you got 20 at 20, is
                 that right?

                            RONNA
                     (suddenly)
                 You got a bathroom?

                            ADAM
                 Down the hall on the right.

                            ZACK
                 Let me show you...

     He moves at Ronna strangely. It freaks her out.

                            BURKE
                 Maybe we could do this first.

     Burke shoots Adam a look. Ronna's already headed down the
     hall. They wait silently until Ronna's out of earshot.

                            ADAM
                 We said Chicago, you said Philadelphia.

19   INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT                                                  19

     CLOSE UP: Ronna locks the door.

     She leans back against the frame, panicking.
     She turns on both faucets.
     She checks the window.
     Nailed shut.

     She looks at herself in the spotless mirror.

     A KNOCK on the door.

     FLUSHES.

     standing with her beer, cool as an Eskimo.

     Ronna is headed for the front door. Following behind her,
     Burke waves at Adam -- BLOCK THAT DOOR!

     Adam steps in her way.

     The men just stand there, watching.

     BACK TO COLOR

     CLOSE ON Burke, dumbstruck. He nods at Adam.

     Adam steps away from the door.

     Ronna backs her way out the door, never taking her eyes off
     them. The door CLOSES.

     A BEAT. Adam and Zack await the fury. Burke looks back to the

29   EXT/INT. THE BEAST ON STREET - NIGHT                                     29

     The car is parked on the side of another residential street.

                             RONNA
                  I think it was Simon they were after. He
                  deals all the time out of the store. I
                  mean, he makes change out of the fucking
                  register.

                             MANNIE
                  They didn't know who was dealing, just
                  that it was someone at the store?

                             RONNA
                  They were fishing. I bit.

     Ronna's PAGER goes off with a shrill BEEPING. She checks the
     number.

                            RONNA
                  It's Claire. She paged me while I was in
                  there.

                             MANNIE
                  We go back to Todd. Tell him they didn't
                  show up, whatever. And then just swap the
                  pills for Claire.

                              RONNA
                  We can't.

                              MANNIE
                  Why not?

                            RONNA
                  They're gone. I flushed them.

                              MANNIE
                  Oh shit.

                             RONNA
                  Think of something. I need a hundred
                  bucks or 20 hits of X.

     A long silent beat as both put on their thinking caps. Mannie
     tries to beat down a smile that curls the edges of his lips.
     He clenches his jaw, trying to keep it in.


                                                                   (CONTINUED)

                            RONNA
                  What?!

     She turns his chin to hold his eyes to the light. They're wild
     and dilated. And his smile resurfaces despite his best
     efforts.

                             RONNA
                  You took one, didn't you? Fuck you,
                  Mannie! How could you do this to me? I
                  need you now.

     He sits quietly, a scolded dog.

                            RONNA
                  Drive.

                            MANNIE
                  Where?

                            RONNA
                  Just drive. I have an idea.


30   INT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT                                                 30

     A sign over the entrance reads "Yule Save More." Christmas
     MUSAK blares "Jingle Bell Rock" overhead.

     The automatic doors slide open to reveal Ronna and Mannie, who
     split up. We follow Ronna, who is now wearing Mannie's black
     trench coat. The store is almost empty, with STOCKMEN
     beginning to unload palettes.

     Ronna turns down an aisle marked "Soap/Shampoo/Drugs."


31   INT. AT THE MANAGER'S COUNTER - NIGHT                                    31

     Mannie scans his hand on a UPC register, watching the laser on
     his fingers, listening to it BWOOP. He smiles broadly at an
     idle REGISTER WOMAN, who doesn't even look up. He then ducks
     down behind the counter.

     A CRAPPY CD PLAYER
                                 |
     spins away. He presses the "| " button, then cranks the
     volume dial all the way up.

     The opening FLOURISHES of a Latinized Christmas classic BLAST
     through the PA system.

34   INT. DRUG AISLE - NIGHT                                                 34

     A COUPON-WIELDING WOMAN looks up, confused, but proceeds to
     push her cart around the end of the row.

     Ronna looks both ways. She's alone.

     She starts grabbing boxes off the shelf and shoving them into
     the pockets of Mannie's coat. Cold medicine. Allergy
     medicine. Every pill she can find.

     SWITTERMAN

     comes ROARING by behind her, heading for the front. She tries
     to duck away, but he's too steamed to even notice her.

     Ronna does a quick check to see if she got everything.
     Hurrying down the aisle, she swipes a bottle of Evian.

     The two stockboys give a wide-eyed, Spielberg           stare...

     We MOVE to the next aisle, where the Coupon Woman is staring at
     the same thing...

     We MOVE again to Ronna at the end of her aisle. She just now
     sees it...


36   INT. FRONT OF THE STORE - NIGHT                                         36

     ANGLE ON Mannie. He sticks his hand out.

     ANGLE ON the Register Woman. She sticks her hand out.

     Their palms meet. Their hips come together. And they dance.

     What starts as a tango, spirals into a STAR SEARCH-y routine of
     dips, spins and Arthur Murray nightmares. Torville and Dean on
     linoleum.

                                                                  (CONTINUED)

     The stockboys watch, horrified but transfixed. The Coupon
     Woman taps her shoe against the wheel of her cart.

     ANGLE ON MANNIE

     dancing his heart out. His face is red and dripping sweat.
     He's too out of it to notice.

     HIS POINT OF VIEW

     a JET ENGINE ROAR, swirling light. The MUSIC is stacked up on
     itself, overlapping and bizarre. For just a moment,
     horrifying.

     ANGLE ON MANNIE

     he stops mid-twirl. Holding himself against a magazine rack.
     Ronna takes him by the shoulder.

     MANNIE'S POINT OF VIEW

     Ronna leans into a fish-eye swirl. The ROAR grows louder,
     continuing as we

     Behind the wheel, Ronna's ripping open boxes of medication.
     Cracking open jars, she spills the tablets out on her hand.

                             RONNA
                  Were they round or oval?

                  Round. White. Like aspirin. Like baby
                  aspirin.

     She digs through the pockets of the coat, seeing what else she
     grabbed. Her BEEPER goes off. She hits it to make it stop.

     She pops an allergy pill out of its blister pack. Compares it
     to another pill, almost the same.

                            RONNA
                      (holding them up)

                  I wasn't really looking.

     Making a decision, Ronna starts popping the rest of the pills
     out of the blister pack, dumping them into the Tylenol bottle.

     Her BEEPER goes off again.

                            RONNA
                  Stop fucking paging me, Claire!

     Mannie nurses the Evian bottle.

38   INT. GAINES' APARTMENT - NIGHT                                              38

     Gaines picks up the receiver, clicking the remote to mute the
     CD player. He's still shirtless and wearing the Santa Claus
     hat.

                  Where's this party at?

     Claire is sitting in the corner, holding herself very still.

     She digs a postcard-ish invite out of her purse. He snaps his
     fingers. She hands it over.

               Look at me. I want to show you something.

     She looks back over at him. He slowly undoes the drawstring to
     his sweat pants. Starts to reach inside. Claire watches,
     revolted and disbelieving. A beat.

                         GAINES
               I'm kidding!

     His hand reaches between the cushions of the couch, where he
     pulls out a 9mm handgun.

     Ronna looks back to Mannie.

                          RONNA
               Don't say anything. And try not to look
               so stoned.

     He nods, wiping a finger across his forehead to squeegee off
     the sweat.


40   INT. GAINES' APARTMENT - NIGHT                                         40

     Gaines sits pensively on the edge of the couch, then smiles
     warmly.

                          GAINES
               That's no problem. These things happen, I
               understand that.

     Claire smiles, relieved. Mannie stands behind Ronna, his gaze
     carefully fixed on the wall.

                          GAINES (CONT'd)
               Let me just fill out a return slip here,
               and I'll have the manager give you a
               refund.

                          RONNA
               Todd, I'm trying to explain what
               happened. They had already gotten stuff
               from somewhere else. It was just a case
               of miscommunication, I thought...

     Ronna's VOICE fades to nothing as we PUSH IN on Mannie.

     A SIAMESE CAT

     lays down on a table in front of him, staring at him.

                          HUXLEY [SUBTITLES ONLY]
               I can hear your thoughts.

     Mannie squints, looks around. He and the cat are alone in the
     room.

     Mannie smiles.

     The cat curls itself.

                            HUXLEY [SUBTITLES]
                  You're going to die.

     Mannie snaps back, eyes panicked.

     It's a few minutes later. Everyone's in different places,
     different moods. Mannie hasn't moved at all.

                            GAINES
                      (handing back cash)
                  I'm keeping fifty. Call it interest.

                            RONNA
                  That's fine. Todd, I'm really sorry about
                  all this.

     Ronna steers Mannie towards the door, trying to keep his back
     to Todd. But at the last moment...

                               GAINES
                  Hey Ronna.

     A beat. Todd shakes the pill bottle.

                             GAINES
                  I just gave you a favor.

                             RONNA
                      (a smile)
                  And here I thought you just gave me head.

     They trade a look as she exits. Gaines picks up the cat, gives
     it a scratch. Silly humans.


41   EXT. FIELD PARKING LOT - NIGHT                                              41

     Mannie lies on the roof of The Beast, arms spread wide,
     cigarette in his fingers.

     Ronna and Claire stare at each other, a competition, neither
     wanting to exhale first.

                                                                      (CONTINUED)

     Hands waving, Claire struggles to keep herself from laughing
     and choking. Finally she gives in, coughing up smoke and snot.
     Ronna blows out a cool ribbon of smoke.

     She hands over a wreath of plastic holly.

                          RONNA
               Pin me.

     She leans down to let Claire pin the holly in a crown around
     and through her hair.

                          CLAIRE
               Okay, at the risk of sounding like. You
               know. Me. What are you going to do about
               getting evicted? You're still short,
               aren't you?

     Mannie's hand flops down to the window. Claire hands him the
     joint.

     From RONNA'S P.O.V., we see the floor is still littered with
     dozens of boxes of medicine.

     A beat. She picks up a box.

     An idea forming, Ronna sits back up. Smiles.

                         CLAIRE
               What? What?


43   EXT. FIELD / PARKING LOT - NIGHT                                       43

     Ronna and Claire weave through the densely packed lot, where
     RAVE-GOERS party in and around their cars, drinking and
     smoking.

     As they walk, Ronna pops allergy medicine out of a blister-foil
     pack. She tosses the box away. Scanning the lot, she points
     to a mini-van.


44   EXT. AT THE MINIVAN - NIGHT                                            44

     Ronna knocks on the window. A NERVOUS TEENAGER rolls it down,
     releasing a cloud of smoke. Ronna smiles.

                         RONNA
               Hi. I'm Kelly, and this is Donna. We
               were wondering if you might want to hang
               out.

                                                                            33.

45   INT. THE MINIVAN - NIGHT                                                 45

     Ronna and Claire are packed in tight with three VALLEY
     HIGHSCHOOL COUPLES. The guys are stoned, the girls uptight.
     They're all breaking curfew.

                          FILA GUY
               I think I feel something.

                         RONNA
               It's really smooth, isn't it? Donna's
               brother is a pharmacist. He got it for
               us.

     A look from Claire -- why are dragging me into this? But she
     goes for it.

                         CLAIRE
               Chip. His name is Chip. My brother.

                          NIKE HAT
               Is it like a wave, or is it like a zoom?

                          FILA GUY
               It's like floating. Like, "Hey down
               there, how's the ground and shit."

                         NIKE HAT
               I got it. Oh, fuck. Yeah, I feel it.

                          ANOREXIC GIRL
               Is it really that cool?

                          FILA GUY
               You gotta try it. Shit, I'll buy for you.

     He pulls out his wallet and hands Ronna a twenty. She gives
     the Anorexic Girl a tablet, who downs the pill with a swig of
     Diet Coke.

                          RONNA
               And you know what makes it even better?
               If you smoke a lot of pot. I mean a lot
               of it.

     Fila Guy nods, firing up the mini-bong again.

                                                                            34.

46   EXT. LINE OUTSIDE A WAREHOUSE - NIGHT                                    46

     Mannie leans against a wall, pale and out of it, a nauseated
     smile on his face.

                          CLAIRE
                   (low)
               I can't believe you are selling allergy
               medicine.

                          RONNA
               We're out of that. We're down to chewable
               aspirin.

     A SKATE-PUNK GUY comes up to them, money in hand.

                         SKATE-PUNK GUY
               Hey. People are saying you have some
               really good stuff.

     Ronna takes the money, looks him over.

                          RONNA
               Show me your tits.

     A beat. He pulls up his shirt to show his skinny white chest.
     Deeming him worthy, Ronna hands him a pill and sends him on his
     way. She adds the twenty to her stack.

                          CLAIRE
               How much have you made?

                         RONNA
               Four hundred.

     The opening RUMBLES of an industrial ANTHEM rise as we cut to:


47   INT. GAINES' APARTMENT - NIGHT                                           47

     MUSIC builds throughout.

     Standing at the dresser, Gaines cracks open Ronna's bottle.
     Pills spill out on a plate.
     He counts them, pushing them aside in groups with a card.
     Stops.
     Picks one up. Looks at it more closely...

     Pulls open a drawer full of socks.
     Digs out the wide-mouthed bottle.
     Shakes out a pill.

     Flicks on a desk lamp.
     Looks at both pills in his hand, comparing...

     Fuck.

     He flips over the card on the dresser.
     Mary Xmas.
     The invite Claire gave him.

     With a sudden RAGE, he WINGS the plate against the far wall.
     It SHATTERS.

     The music EXPLODES and we're...


48   INT. WAREHOUSE / MARY XMAS SUPAFEST - NIGHT                                48

     A grinding, sweating sea of humanity. In the mosh pit,
     SKINHEADS and coked-up POSEURS run in blind circles. A stringy-
     haired EYELINER BOY crashes into

     RONNA

     who had her own groove going. She shoves him back into the
     wheel, a foot on his ass.

     Claire, behind her, YELLS something in her ear. We can't hear
     a thing. Ronna downs the rest of her drink, hands Claire the
     cup. That's not what Claire meant -- she's a little pissed --
     but Ronna is oblivious.

     Both hands free, Ronna pushes her way deeper into the eye of
     the storm. She adjusts her holly crown. She's sky high and
     loving every minute of it.

     The line to get in is longer still, snaking down the wall.
     Fila Guy is talking to a friend in a SPIDER MARINE shirt.

                             FILA GUY
                  This girl inside. She and her friend have

     We look past Fila Guy to see Todd Gaines, who's been listening.
     Seething.


50   INT. BY THE ENTRANCE - NIGHT                                             50

     Sweating hard, Mannie is pressed back against a pole, shirt
     over his head. Two nose-ringed RIOT GRRRLS are drawing a
     Christmas tree on his chest and stomach with a fat magic
     marker.

     Looking over at the entrance, he watches some GAPSTERS move
     past the BOUNCERS. And behind them,

     TODD GAINES.

     Mannie's drugged eyes go wide with panic. He hunches down.
     Gaines starts looking around the edge of the crowd.

     Mannie works his way into the mob.

     STROBES fire overhead.

     Ronna dances on, oblivious...
     Gaines circles, searching...
     Mannie fights his way through the outer ring of MOSHERS...

     Through the crowd, we see Gaines looking in...
     Mannie grabs Ronna...
     She smiles, tries to kiss him...

     He YELLS in her ear. He has to repeat himself...
     She looks back over her shoulder...
     A space in the crowd...

     She sees Gaines. He sees her.

     The MUSIC STOPS. Dead silence.

     Ronna and Gaines trade stares for what feels like an eternity,
     until suddenly...

     The MUSIC BLASTS back, harder than ever. Like a shot, Ronna
     and Mannie are out of there. Gaines plows through the crowd,
     coming after them.


51   EXT. WAREHOUSE ALLEY - NIGHT                                             51

     A side door BLASTS open, Ronna dragging Mannie by the wrist.
     They race down the alley. A burly BOUNCER shouts after them:

52   EXT. DIFFERENT ALLEY - NIGHT                                              52

     Ronna pulls Mannie into a covered doorway, a niche set off from
     the alley. They hide back in the shadows as

     GAINES

     races past. Ronna kneels down to Mannie, who's hunched over
     his knees sweating and shaking.

                            RONNA
                  What's wrong? Mannie?

     She puts a hand on his sweating forehead.         His cheeks.

                  Jesus. You're burning up.

                  Listen to me. We're going to find Claire
                  and get out of here.


53   EXT. ALLEY / DUMPSTERS - NIGHT                                            53

     Ronna half-carries Mannie down the alley. He's too heavy to
     lift, and too out of it to go much further. He collapses to
     his knees. She can't get him back up.

     Without warning, he HEAVES. We hear the SPLASH on the asphalt.

     She props his head back against a dumpster. Wipes his face.

                             RONNA
                  Sweetheart. Mannie. I'm going to leave
                  you here. I'm going to get the car and
                  come back for you.

     She fishes the keys out of his pocket. Mannie grabs onto her
     arm, tight.


                                                                    (CONTINUED)

                             RONNA
                  I can't carry you! Mannie, just hide
                  here. Just like a little mouse, okay?
                  You're going to be fine. Ain't nobody
                  leaving.

     She pushes his legs into the shadows. He's crying.


54   EXT. FIELD / EDGE OF PARKING LOT - NIGHT (RAIN)                           54

     In the distance, we hear the RUMBLE of the music. Keeping low,
     Ronna works her way down a row, coming to Mannie's car. She
     tries one key, then another.

     We LOOK UP to see Todd Gaines watching her from the hood of a
     nearby car.

                             GAINES
                  How's it going, Ronna? How are sales?

     Her heart skips a beat. She drops the keys.

                             RONNA
                  Todd, I can explain.

                             GAINES
                  I'm not going to ask you to.

     He climbs off the car, approaching.

                             GAINES [CONT'D]
                  The thing is, it's not like I'm in a
                  highly ethical industry. But goddamn,
                  Ronna. You fucked me over for 20 lousy
                  hits.

     He pulls his gun from the back of his jeans. By instinct, she
     starts to move away.

     A red Miata moves down the row behind Ronna. She looks to it
     for help, but it's already passed.

                             RONNA
                  It's not what it looks like. I mean, it
                  sort of is, but it's complicated.

                            GAINES
                  Not really.

     He cocks the gun.



                                                                    (CONTINUED)

                             RONNA
                  I know I fucked up, but I can make it up
                  to you. Please, Todd.

                             GAINES
                  I'm the last fucking person you should be
                  expecting a favor from.

                             RONNA
                  I have the cash. I have more than I owe
                  you.

                             GAINES
                  So now you're an entrepreneur.

     At the last moment, Ronna bolts. She ducks around the corner
     of a van, only to see...

     A RED MIATA

     doing 20 in reverse. It brakes, but there's no time. It hits
     her hard.

     She flies up over the roof of the car, CRASHING down on the
     soft top. Her limp body starts to slip down the windshield,
     but finally sticks.

     PUSH IN ON GAINES

     seeing the hit. HEARING it. Stunned.

     A beat, then we hear the engine REV, pulling back again. That
     shakes Ronna loose, letting her drop over the headlights in
     front.

     Rolling down the slope at the edge of the field, Ronna topples
     ass-first into a drainage ditch. Her body lands with a
     sickening THUD.

     GAINES

     stands where he is, gun still in hand, dumbfounded.

     He looks to the Miata. It suddenly takes off, kicking up dirt
     and grass. For a moment, all is quiet.

     Finally, Gaines tucks the gun into his jeans. One last look
     around, then he starts working his way back across the parking
     lot. Disappears.

                                                                            40.

55   EXT. IN THE DITCH - NIGHT (RAIN)                                         55

     We stay on Ronna's body as we HEAR the Miata suddenly pull
     away. Somewhere in the distance, the Mary Xmas Supafest is
     still RAGING, but here it's only a WHISPER with a beat.

     With a sudden SPASM, Ronna moves. Turns herself over on her
     back. Each breath WHEEZES and GURGLES.

     She pulls the remainder of the holly crown out of her hair and
     tosses it aside. She tries to push herself up. Her legs won't
     move.

     Catching her breath, she looks to the top of the ditch, waiting
     for somebody to look in. No one does. Adjusting herself, she
     slides against a weathered magazine. Spin. Jane's Addiction
     on the cover.

     She collapses back, a new wave of pain.

     After a beat, she suddenly LAUGHS, until gradually it becomes a
     COUGHING. She pushes her hair back, streaking blood across her
     face.

                          RONNA
               Mannie!!

     There's no answer. The YELLING hurts. She won't do that
     again.

                          RONNA
               Mannie, I got it! I remembered who the
               fuck it was! Perry Farrell's dead
               girlfriend. Xiola Blue. X-I-O-L-A.
               Fuck, I knew there was one.

     A sudden spasm of pain. She winces, sobbing. It passes.

                          RONNA
               Don't you get it? I win.

     She COUGHS as she laughs, spitting out some blood. We PULL
     BACK, rising higher until we slowly

                                                                      FADE OUT.

      Offscreen, a SOAP OPERA plays. Simon is on the phone, a well-
      worn employee list in his hands.

                          SIMON (ON PHONE)
                No, no. Donde Miguel?                                             *
      Claire leans against the wall beside him, skeptical but
      amused. She turns a box of cookies over in her hands, reading
      the ingredients.

      Fuck. Simon hangs up the phone without saying goodbye. He
      continues down the list.

                           CLAIRE
                Simon, no one is going to take your shift.

      Ronna comes around the corner, zombie-tired. She heads to her
      locker. Simon watches her, an idea forming.


                                                                 JUMP CUT TO:

      A cigarette lighter. The flame finally catches and we see
      Simon. He feels around, touching the ceiling, the walls, the
      floor. He's locked in the trunk of a car.

                             SIMON
                   Shit. Shit!

      He starts kicking, hyperventilating. The lighter goes out.

                  Fucking let me out of here!

     The lighter burns his thumb. He switches hands. Listens for a
     second. The car isn't driving anymore.

     He tries to catch his breath, but keeps getting more panicked.
     A key SCRAPES in the lock.

     The trunk lid opens a crack. Bright daylight spills in.

     Simon KICKS the lid and pops up, ready to swing a tire iron.

     TINY (19) is not black, but thinks he is.

     Simon climbs out of the trunk and does a face-plant in the
     gravel. He's shit-faced drunk.

     A massive land yacht from the pre-Embargo era. SINGH (23) is
     driving, nursing a beer. Marcus reads a magazine. Tiny talks
     from the enormous back seat, where Simon is recuperating.

               It hits her in the eye. And her contact,
               it's like stuck on my dick.

     The passengers don't seem impressed.

                          TINY
               Her contact lens. It's stuck on the end
               of my dick.

                          MARCUS
               Was it hard or soft?

               Do you remember if it was a colored lens?
               That she used to have two blue eyes and
               now she had one blue and one brown?

               It matters because it happened to me. It

               year ago. The difference was, I knew

                  What nigger? This nigger?

                            TINY
                  My mother's mother's mother was black.

                  So you say, yet we have never seen a
                  picture of this Ebonic woman.

                            SINGH
                  Stop. Truce.

                             MARCUS
                  If you were any less black, you would be
                  clear.

                      (moaning)
                  Stop.

                  Look at your skin.

                             TINY
                  I see black because I know I am. Color is
                  a state of mind.

62   INT. SILVER STAR CASINO RESTAURANT - NIGHT                             62

     It's a dive, and nearly empty. The guys work their way down
     both sides of a self-service food bar. Simon is mostly
     recovered.

                          SIMON
               So what does Valentina do?

                          MARCUS
               She's a nutritionist. She also teaches a
               class at this college.

                         SIMON
               What class?

                         MARCUS
               Tantric sexuality for couples.

                         SINGH
               She teaches people how to fuck?

                          TINY
               Man, I taught myself.

                         MARCUS
                   (to Simon)
               You shouldn't eat shrimp. It's loaded
               with iodine.

                          TINY
               This shit is expensive. You're paying
               five bucks for lettuce and seeds and shit.

     Tiny up-ends the rest of the shrimp cocktail onto his plate.
     Pissed, Singh scoops away a handful for himself.

     AT THE TABLE

     The guys eat. Tiny tries to make a sandwich out of the various
     foods on his plate, but the bread keeps crumbling.

                          MARCUS
               Thing is, most people really don't know
               how to make love. They just put it in and
               move it around until they get off. What
               tantra teaches you is how to prolong and
               deepen the experience, bring it to a
               higher level. If one man in ten were
               having the sex I'm having, there would be
               no war.

                  What's the longest you and her ever did
                  it?

                            MARCUS
                  Fourteen hours.

                               SINGH
                  Holy shit!

                  How many times you shoot?

                               MARCUS
                  Not once.

                             SIMON
                  Fourteen hours, you didn't go once. Not
                  even at the end?

                            MARCUS
                  You redirect the orgasm inside.

     He's greeted with skeptical looks.

                             MARCUS (CONT'd)
                  How long does your orgasm last? A couple
                  seconds? I've had orgasms that lasted an
                  hour and a half.

                               SIMON
                  Bullshit.

                             MARCUS
                  Swear to God. And I do mean Allah.

                             SINGH
                  When was the last time you got off? I
                  mean like, wet.

                             MARCUS
                  I haven't ejaculated in six months.

                            TINY
                  Six months!

                            MARCUS
                  Anyone can do it. All it takes is
                  discipline.

                             TINY
                  You are some kind of Obi Wan Kenobi

     Singh agrees. Simon, however, is still intrigued.

     We hear slot machines CHIMING in the distance. Marcus picks a
     gold card up from the counter.

                         MARCUS
                   (reading)
               Todd Gaines. The drug dealer.

                          SIMON
               He gets a discount. He let me use it.
               He's a good guy.

                          MARCUS
               He's the good drug dealer. I get
               confused.

                          SIMON
               We'll pay cash anyway. This is just to
               get the room.

     The Desk Woman returns with their keys.

                          SIMON
               Could you answer a question...
                   (checks nametag)
               ...Rachel? Hypothetically, do you think a
               man could make love to a woman for 14
               hours without ever achieving climax?

                          DESK WOMAN
               I think my manager would be better able to
               answer that question. Would you like me
               to call him over?

     Doubled over, Tiny BANGS on the bathroom door. Singh emerges,
     pale and sweating. He steps over Tiny, who crawls in. Hanging
     up his clothes, Marcus waves away the smell.

     Singh MOANS, lying down on a bed.

                          MARCUS
               Did I tell you not to eat the shrimp?

                          SINGH
               I have something for you. Where did I put
               it? Oh, it's right here.

     He gives him the finger. Simon is on the phone by the window.

                          SIMON
                   (over action)
               Todd, it's Simon. What's up?...I'm in

               name of the place you said we should
               go...The Crazy Horse. What are you doing
               tonight?

     Marcus neatly unfolds his clothes, hanging them up in the
     closet.

                         SIMON
                   (on phone)
               You're going to a wedding?...What is it, a
               rave?

     From the wall, KNOCKING. Simon and Marcus look to a door by
     the window.

               No, I know Claire...Are you going to fuck
               her?

     Simon points at the KNOCKING door. Marcus finally opens it to
     reveal a 12 year-old BOY in the adjoining hotel room.

               Oh my God!

     Her kleenex is on fire, flames in each nostril. Hands waving,
     she stands up. Snorts hard. The plugs shoot out, landing on
     the carpet, which begins to smolder. Simon stamps the flames
     out.

                         REBECCA
               You're fine. You're fine.

     Becky is crying.

                          REBECCA
                   (to Simon)
               Tell her she's fine.

                         SIMON
               You're beautiful.

     He kisses her. After a moment, her panic subsides. She kisses
     him back.


71   INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER                                                71

     Simon slides between the two Beckys, three naked bodies
     clenching and releasing.

     CLOSE ON SIMON

     breathing harder and faster, faster, until he suddenly stops.
     The expression on his face is agonizing, like a tightrope
     walker about to lose his balance. The Beckys stop to watch
     him, worried he might be hurt.

     Finally, he breathes again.

                                                                 (CONTINUED)

                             BECKY
                  Did you go?

     He shakes his head.

                             BECKY
                  Why not?

                            SIMON
                  Tantra, baby.

     LATER

     A new position, Rebecca on top and sweating. Next to Simon,
     Becky is passed out and SNORING. It's only as we look over
     Rebecca's back that we see

     THE CURTAINS ARE ON FIRE.

     On the bed, Simon lies motionless in aching nirvana.            His head
     turns. He sees the flames. And does nothing.

     Rebecca reaches climax with an inhuman series of MOANS. It's
     on the third of these that the smoke alarm suddenly BLEATS. It
     settles into a piercing WHINE.

     Becky falls out of bed, disoriented. Sees the fire and
     SCREAMS. Rebecca climbs off Simon to attack the flames with a
     pillow, beating them down. Holding her head together, Becky
     tries to reach the smoke detector itself.

     Amid the chaos, Simon feels for his shoes.


72   INT. HALLWAY / ELEVATOR BAY - NIGHT                                    72

     In the elevator on the right, Simon jabs at the button while
     getting his jeans on. As his doors slide closed, the left
     elevator opens, revealing hotel SECURITY.


73   INT. CASINO MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT                                         73

     Gentle Christmas MUZAK.

     At the sinks, Marcus wets his fingers to fix his hair. An OLD
     TEXAN washes his hands at the next sink, looks around for a
     towel. Marcus takes two from the dispenser, hands them over.

     When he's finished, the Texan sets the crumpled towels on the
     counter, along with a dollar bill. He taps his hat and leaves.



                                                                 (CONTINUED)

     A beat before Marcus sees the bill and makes the connection.
     He shouts to the closed door...

                             MARCUS
                  I am not a bathroom attendant!


74   INT. BY THE ELEVATORS - NIGHT                                            74

     Not breaking his stride, Simon catches Marcus coming out the
     restroom.

                            SIMON
                  Hey. We're leaving.

                               MARCUS
                  Fuck yeah.


75   EXT. HOTEL ENTRANCE - NIGHT                                              75

     Seething, Marcus joins Simon in line for a cab. A white
     Ferrari pulls up to the curb beside them. The FERRARI MAN
     tosses the keys at Marcus, who can't help but catch them.

                             FERRARI MAN
                  Keep it close and there's an extra ten
                  bucks for you.

     He slips Marcus a five as he rushes into the casino. A beat.
     Simon is cracking up. As we REVERSE, we see the valets are
     wearing the same yellow sportcoat as Marcus.

                            MARCUS
                  Get in. Get in the car. Get in.


76   INT. THE FERRARI / DRIVING ON FREEWAY - NIGHT                            76

     Top off, wind whipping. Marcus downshifts, letting the engine
     RACE as he passes another sports car. The STEREO is blasting.

     Pale and dazed, Simon tries to light a cigarette. It blows out
     of his fingers. It was his last. He adjusts himself in his
     seat, uncomfortable.

                             SIMON
                      (shouting over noise)

                            MARCUS
                  No. Never. Redirect the energy, but you
                  never hold it in. Haven't you ever gotten
                  blue balls? Hurts like a bitch.

                             SIMON
                      (nodding)
                  Sort of a dull ache.

                               MARCUS
                  Exactly.

     Marcus looks over to Simon, who is trying to get his breath.


77   INT. FERRARI / DRIVING DOWNTOWN - LATER                                  77

     Empty intersections, no traffic to speak of. Marcus is looking
     for a cross-street. They're lost.

                             MARCUS
                  See if there's a map.

     Simon goes through the glove compartment. Amid the condoms and
     parking tickets, he finds one.

                            SIMON
                  Orange County.

     He throws it out. He tries to shut the compartment, but it's
     caught on something. He reaches in...

                               SIMON
                  Holy shit.

     Marcus looks over. Simon gently pulls out a 9mm Baretta.
     Fascinated, he turns it over in his hands. Marcus tries to
     keep an eye on the road.

                            MARCUS
                  Don't point it at me!

                             SIMON
                  How do I know if it's loaded?

                            MARCUS
                  First, you stop pointing it at me.

     Simon aims the other way, out the window. As they drive
     through an intersection, they pass a car full of LOCALS.

                            MARCUS
                  Floor. Floor!

     Simon throws the gun to the floor. Marcus flinches, expecting
     it to go off. It doesn't. He checks the rear-view mirror. No
     trouble. Simon picks up the gun again.

                            SIMON
                  I've never held a real gun before. It's
                  heavier than I thought.

                             MARCUS
                  Great, put it back.

                  I want to know if it's loaded. How do
                  I...

     He starts pulling and pushing on it, trying to get the clip
     out. He's not going to stop until he does it or shoots himself
     trying.

                             MARCUS
                  Hold the wheel.

     Marcus removes the clip, hands it over. Simon counts the
     bullets.

                             SIMON
                  I hold ten men's lives in my hand.

                             MARCUS
                  It's a nine millimeter. It doesn't have
                  stopping power.

     At a pull-up payphone, Marcus is looking through the map in the
     phone book. Simon is still fondling the gun.

                             SIMON
                  This is why I came here. This is America.

               Champagne means you want a private dance.
               You can't afford it, neither can I. But

                             MARCUS
                  Nothing.

     At the door, Marcus stops Simon before he goes in.

                             MARCUS
                  We have one word, champagne. You can
                  order anything you want, anything, as
                  long as it's not champagne.


82   INT. THE CRAZY HORSE - NIGHT                                             82

     Pitch black except for tiny Christmas lights. To Simon's left,
     a skanky MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE plays video poker. At the bar,
     Marcus SHOUTS to the BARTENDER -- the MUSIC is deafening.

     Out of the shadows, two dancers approach. They split up,
     blonde HOLLY taking Simon, while brunette NOELLE heads for
     Marcus.

     Holly offers Simon a hand, they shake. She leans close to talk
     into his ear. He smiles.

     Noelle taps Marcus on the shoulder, ducks to the other side
     playfully. Takes a sip of his drink.

     Simon points to Marcus. Holly nods, feeling the fabric of his
     shirt.

     Noelle laughs at something Marcus said.

     Holly measures her hand against Simon's, rubs it against her
     neck. He is staring at her magnificent breasts.

     At Noelle's urging, Marcus flexes his bicep. Noelle flutters.

     We come in CLOSE as Holly leans over to say something. Simon
     speaks first...

                             SIMON
                  I'd like to buy your most expensive bottle
                  of champagne.


83   INT. SHORT HALLWAY - NIGHT                                               83

     A curtain at the end, blue light overhead. Holly leads the way
     with a bottle of champagne. Noelle follows with glasses.
     Behind them, the guys.

     Marcus gives Simon a look. Simon shrugs it off.


                                                                   (CONTINUED)

     The curtain parts, letting the women through. From the
     darkened space beyond, a giant BOUNCER steps out -- massive
     even compared to Marcus. He's sucking on a lollipop.

                             VIC JR.
                  I need a major credit card.

     Marcus looks to Simon, who hands over the gold card. Vic Jr.
     reads them the boilerplate...

                             VIC JR.
                  This is a gentlemen's club. You are
                  expected to behave as gentlemen. I will
                  be giving you one rule. If you break this
                  rule, I will break your arm. Are we
                  clear?

                             MARCUS
                  Yes.

                             VIC JR.
                  The ladies can touch you. You cannot
                  touch them. At any point, for any reason.
                  Is this clear?

                             SIMON
                  Crystal.

                             VIC JR.
                  Enjoy your evening.

     He pulls back the curtain.


84   INT. PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT                                                84

     A mirrored ball spins overhead, stars racing across the black
     paneling. Holly nudges Simon into his chair. He and Marcus
     sit back to back.

     As the champage POPS, we move into a series of overlapping
     shots:

     Noelle licks the foam from Holly's fingers.
     Holly rubs the bottle against herself, pours.
     Noelle and Holly dance together, a tinsel ribbon around them.

     Simon adjusts himself in the crotch.

     Noelle lights a cigar for Marcus as Holly dances alone.
     Holly lifts her miniskirt to reveal a g-string.
     Simon cranes his neck back, banging heads with Marcus.


                                                                   (CONTINUED)

     Noelle takes a puff off the cigar.
     Holly straddles Simon, rubs against him. He shudders. His
     hands start to rise. She gently pushes them back down.

     Marcus whispers something to Noelle.

     Noelle comes up behind Holly, moving with her as she rubs
     against Simon. Marcus turns to watch.

     Enraptured, Simon watches the four-armed woman on top of him.

     His fingers start to twitch.

     Noelle kisses the edge of Holly's neck.
     Simon's hands rise, reach...
     Holly MOANS...

     And suddenly...

     Simon grabs Noelle's ass.

     It's Heaven.

                            NOELLE
                      (yelling)
                  Hands! Hands!

     Noelle and Holly both get off him. Holly kicks his leg. From
     behind the curtain, Vic Jr. charges in. He heads straight for
     Marcus.

                             NOELLE
                  The other one!

     Simon tumbles off his chair, scrambling.

                             VIC JR.
                  What the fuck did I tell you!

     He kicks Simon in the ass.

                           MARCUS
                  Yo. Yo! He fucked up, he lost control.

                             VIC JR.
                  Am I talking to you? I'm talking to your
                  faggot friend here.

     He kicks Simon again. Holly and Noelle stand in the corner.
     This has happened a hundred times.

                            MARCUS
                  We're leaving.

     Vic Jr. kicks Simon again.

                             MARCUS
                  Enough! Stop kicking him.
                      (no effect)
                  I said to fucking stop kicking him.

     Vic Jr. turns on Marcus. A beat. He shoves him, hard.

                             MARCUS
                  I'm not trying to throw down here.

                             VIC JR.

                  I don't want to try.

     Vic Jr. WHACKS Marcus, an old-fashioned bitch slap. A beat.
     Marcus tries to keep the rage down. Feels his nose bleeding.

     He backs away, but Vic Jr. keeps coming. Suddenly...

     A GUNSHOT.

     SCREAMS.

     For a beat, no one's sure what happened. We look around to
     Marcus. Vic Jr. Holly. Noelle. Then finally Simon.

     He just fired. The gun is steady in his hand.

     Marcus checks his shirt. A spray of blood.

     Vic Jr. checks his arm. It's bleeding.

     We HOLD for a moment, the mirrored ball still spinning
     overhead.

                            SIMON
                  Everybody back the fuck away.

     They do. Marcus holds his place.

                            MARCUS
                  Oh, man. Fuck.

     Blood is squirting out of Vic Jr.'s arm. He holds it,
     dumbfounded.

                         HOLLY
               Behind you.

     A fire escape door. Simon motions for Marcus to come. Pushing
     the bar, no alarm sounds. They back out, into the night. The
     door swings shut.

     A beat.

     Suddenly, an MAN charges in with a silver .45. He is Vic Sr.,
     60, owner and proprietor. You don't fuck with Victor.

                         VICTOR
               What happened!

                          HOLLY
               They shot Vic. They went out the back.

     Victor KICKS the door open, ready to fire. The alley is clear.
     The BARTENDER comes through the curtain.

                   (handing off gun)
               Find them.

     The man races out. Victor looks at his son's arm. It's
     bloody, but he'll live. Holly SHOUTS down the hallway.

                           HOLLY
               Call 911.

                         VICTOR

85   EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT                                               85

     The Ferrari SCRAPES as it takes the curb too fast.

     From the alley, the Bartender chases after it, finally
     stopping to squeeze off three SHOTS. None seem to hit. The
     Ferrari tears down the street.

     Taking a left, Marcus slows down a little. We're on an empty
     street well away from the Crazy Horse. He dabs at his bloody
     nose.

                                                                 (CONTINUED)

     In the passenger seat, Simon looks at the gun in the hand. He
     suddenly throws it out.

                             MARCUS
                  What are you doing?

                            SIMON

     Marcus slams on the brakes.

                             MARCUS
                  It has your fingerprints on it.

                             SIMON
                  Oh shit.

     Craning around, Simon looks for it in the street. Marcus backs
     the car up. Suddenly, a phone RINGS. Lights flicker on the
     car phone.

                             SIMON
                  Do we answer?

     Marcus brakes again. The phone keeps RINGING.

                             MARCUS
                  It's probably Orange County asking where
                  the hell his car is.

                             SIMON
                  It's a cell phone. They can trace where
                  we are even if we don't answer.

                             MARCUS
                  Get the gun. Go. Find it.

     Simon climbs out and starts looking, crouching to look under
     cars.

     In the Ferrari, Marcus sits back and kicks the phone with his
     boot, over and over until it stops, dead.

     For a moment, silence.

     Then the car's ALARM starts going off.     Marcus SCREAMS with
     frustration. He punches buttons on the     keychain, but nothing
     will quiet it. He tries the key in the     ignition. It won't
     turn over. Climbing out of the car, he     kicks it with all his
     might.

     Simon finds the gun, crawling under a truck to get it.

     Using his jacket, Marcus starts frantically wiping off the
     inside and outside of the Ferrari. Simon joins him. The whole
     time, the alarm is still WAILING.

     Satisfied, Marcus motions that they're done. He and Simon take
     off running down the street.

     A bent needle pierces two flaps of skin, drawing a line of
     blood with the thread.

     Victor ties another stitch in Vic Jr.'s arm. He's had practice
     at this. In the background, the Bartender and Noelle are
     watching. Victor's tirade is directed at all of them.

                  gonna die. You're gonna kill us off. But
                  you'll never be dinosaurs. You're little
                  fucking rats and that's all you're ever
                  going to be.

     Holly looks in, holding a gold card. Victor motions, "well?"
     She hands it over.

                             HOLLY
                  They said they were from Los Angeles.

     Noelle nods.

                             VICTOR
                  Then they must be staying somewhere,
                  isn't that right Noelle?

     Noelle nods harder, crying again.


88   INT. HOTEL ROOM BATHROOM - NIGHT                                         88

     Pale and dehydrated, Tiny sits on the toilet. He HUMS the
     theme to "I Dream of Jeannie."


89   INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                                                  89

                  Once Karen learned these simple rules,
                  she discovered blackjack was as easy as it
                  was fun.

     Singh is propped up on one of the beds. He's just this side of
     death. Toilet FLUSHING. Tiny comes out of the bathroom, takes
     the other bed.

                            ANNOUNCER [V.O.]
                  Steve decided to try his hand at craps.

     Tiny resumes HUMMING. After a few beats, Singh joins in with
     the theme to "Bewitched." The melodies blend surprisingly
     well. Just into the second chorus, the phone RINGS.

                            TINY
                  Yo! Mmmhmm. Room 875.

     He hangs up.

     In the passenger seat, Vic Jr. flips a cell phone shut. He was
     working through the yellow pages.

                             VIC JR.
                  They're at the Riviera.

     Victor changes lanes. He SLAMS on the horn, SHOUTING at the
     car that cut him off.

     Simon is already running down the sidewalk.

     Simon furiously pounds the elevator button. With a DING, doors
     finally open. He and Marcus get on. The doors shut.

     In the same shot, we WHIP BACK to look at the lobby, where
     Victor and Vic Jr. have just entered. They walk calmly but
     quickly.

     Victor presses the `8' button. The mirrored doors close. Half
     a beat later, they open again.

     A PLEASANT RETIRED COUPLE get on. Press `4.' The doors don't
     close. The Woman presses the `Door Open' button.

                             THE MAN
                  The other one, honey.

     She sees her mistake. The doors finally close. In the
     reflection, the Man looks back at Victor and Vic Jr. Smiles.

                             THE WOMAN
                  Sure is a fun way to spend Christmas,
                  isn't it?

     No answer. The doors open.

                             THE WOMAN
                  This isn't our floor.

     The Man steps out of the elevator, looking around.

                            THE MAN
                  Maybe we're five.

                            THE WOMAN
                  Or six. We'll try both.

     She reaches for the panel. Victor grabs her hand. She GASPS,
     startled. Without saying a word, he shoves her off the
     elevator, BANGING on the door close button until it finally
     responds.

     Marcus and Simon burst in like a cyclone. Marcus grabs his
     clothes out of the closet.

                            MARCUS
                  All right, listen up. We're leaving in 30

                             TINY

     Simon tosses Singh his wallet, pockets the keys.

                             MARCUS
                  Just do it. Now!

     The panic is contagious. After a stunned beat, Tiny and Singh
     start moving, putting on shoes and restuffing suitcases.

     A KNOCK at the door. Everyone freezes. More KNOCKING.

                                                                     (CONTINUED)

                  Room service.

     Simon steps gingerly to the door, looks out the peephole.

     HIS P.O.V.

     A fleshy hand blocks the fisheye.

     Simon backs away from the door, freaking out. Marcus checks
     the windows. They're eight stories above a parking lot.

     Tiny knocks on the door to the adjoining room

      Tiny finally chips in. Simon shoves the cash in a wad under
      the door. They wait.

      The Boy counts the money, straightening the bills.

      Fingers reach into the hole, trying to pull back the bolt.

      a crack. It's clear. On the count of three, they go.

      We stay with the boy, who sits back against the windows,
      excited and rich. There's a KNOCK at the adjoining door. The
      boy tucks the money away.

      In answer to his question, the Ram Charger SLAMS into the trunk
      of the Cadillac. Simon cranks the wheel, barely avoiding the
      car ahead of him.

      Not slowing, Simon aims for the entrance lane, where the bar is
      coming down behind a small Nissan. Threading the needle, Simon
      makes it past the car and the gate. The Ram Charger smashes
      through the bar.

      Four a.m., but there's still traffic. The Cadillac slaloms
      between taxis and tourists. Approaching an intersection,
      yellow light...

      There's a police car waiting at the stoplight.         Simon hits the
      brakes, just short of a SQUEAL. They stop in a         middle lane,
      next to the cop. Simon and Marcus look over to         the OFFICER,
      trying to be calm. Singh and Tiny peer out the         back.

      The Ram Charger slowly approaches, no hurry. In the squad car,
      the Officer takes a radio call. Drunken TOURISTS walk past.
      The crosswalk switches to a flashing red hand.

                              SIMON

                   It's their town. I'm sure they have

      The Ram Charger pulls in right behind the Cadillac. It's so
      tall, all we see are the blinding headlights through the back
      window. Singh and Tiny slink down. Marcus checks the gun on
      his lap.

    The red hand stops flashing. The opposing light goes from
    green to yellow. Simon gently REVS the engine. Suddenly, a
    WHOOP.

    Lights flashing, the police car makes a right turn from the

    Simon sees his opportunity.

      Gunning the engine, he hangs a hard left, cutting across three
      oncoming lanes. The Ram Charger tries to follow, but the
      traffic is already moving. Over the protest of many HORNS, the
      pickup finally forces its way through.


107   EXT. A SIDE STREET - NIGHT                                            107

      The Cadillac takes a corner hard, fishtailing into oncoming
      traffic. Tiny SCREAMS. Simon pulls it back into the lane. In
      the rear-view mirror, we see the Ram Charger, gaining.

                           MARCUS
                We have to get off the major streets.
                Take a right up here. No, not here!

      It's too late. Simon mistook an alley for an actual road.

                           SIMON
                Hold on.

      Aiming for the alley, Simon hits a curb on the way in. Singh's
      head BANGS against the roof. The passenger-side mirror
      smashes off against the wall.

                           TINY
                Mother of fuck!


108   EXT. VERY NARROW ALLEY - NIGHT                                        108

      Just inches of clearance on either side, the alley runs behind
      a series of strip malls and office buildings. There's only one
      way out -- Simon's aiming for the boulevard on the far side.

                           SINGH
                    (looking out back)
                I don't see `em.

      The end of the alley approaches. From the far edge, a flashing
      orange light. A giant street-sweeper is slowly crossing the
      alley. We WHIP BACK to see the Cadillac approaching.

                           MARCUS
                Shit.

                          SINGH

      Behind them, the Ram Charger gingerly negotiates a three-point
      turn into the alley. Wider, it scrapes against one side.

      Ahead, the street sweeper is blocking one-quarter of the
      alley. One-third. A moment of hesitation, then Simon floors
      it. The Caddy hits thirty, forty. Engine RACING --

                             MARCUS
                  We can't make it!

      The sweeper is already halfway across the alley. Singh braces
      for impact. Somehow, Simon still thinks he can clear it.

                            MARCUS
                  STOP!

      At the last moment, Simon SLAMS on the brakes. They're
      skidding towards it.

      Marcus grabs the wheel and jerks it. The front bumper catches
      the wall, sending the trunk SLAMMING against the far alley
      wall. A ear-piercing SCREECH.

      A ribbon of sparks shoots off as the front and rear bumpers are
      scraped away. Forward momentum finally stops.


109   INT. THE CADILLAC - NIGHT                                             109

      The abrupt stop sends Tiny flying into the front seat, where
      his head SMACKS against the dash. Marcus's seat breaks,
      PINNING him. He pushes back, but Singh YELPS in protest.

      Simon blinks, trying to figure out if he's alive. With Tiny's
      bleeding head on his lap, he shifts into reverse.

      The tires SPIN in place. The car is wedged in tight sideways.
      Further down the alley, we find the broken-off

      SIDE MIRROR.

      In its cracked face we see five Ram Chargers approaching. A
      giant tire smashes the mirror to bits.

                                                                           74.

      Shifting gears, Simon tries to rock the car back and forth,
      making no progress. Looking over his seat, Marcus sees the
      giant pickup heading right for them. The headlights are bright
      enough to cast shadows.

      Forcing back the seat, Marcus stands up through the open
      sunroof. Aims and FIRES. Once. Twice. Three times.


112   INT. RAM CHARGER - NIGHT                                              112

      On the first shot, Vic Junior ducks down. Two bullets punch
      through the windshield. The third ricochets off the hood.

      Victor keeps the pedal to the floor. He's not stopping.


113   EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT                                                    113

      All four guys duck just before impact. The Ram Charger
      CRUNCHES into the side of the Cadillac, pushing it down the
      alley. More sparks shoot off as it goes.

      Looking ahead, the street sweeper has moved past the end of the
      alley, but the far side of the street beyond is a construction
      area, flashing baricades all around. The Ram Charger will push
      them right into it.


113A INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT                                                 113A

      Clearing the end of the alley, Simon punches the gas.

      Swinging wide, the Cadillac comes free with another CRUNCH.

      Momentum keeps the Ram Charger heading straight for the
      construction.

      Hitting a parked car, the Ram Charger tips and rolls over,
      landing on its side. It SCRAPES along the asphalt, finally
      coming to rest.


114   INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT                                                 114

      Simon fights to regain control, the    street outside a blur.
      Over his shoulder, an oncoming Yugo    can't stop fast enough.
      The little car hits just in front of    the tire, sending the
      Cadillac spinning back the opposite    direction.

      Tiny's unconscious body flies out the passenger window.
      Marcus and Singh both grab hold. As Simon rights the spin, the
      Cadillac brushes past the green street sweeper, still humming
      along. Marcus and Singh pull Tiny back in, inches away from
      decapitation.

      Simon finally settles into a lane, checking the rear-view
      mirror.

                                                                           75.

      We look through the windshield to find Victor piled on top of
      his son. Regaining his wits, the old man steps on Vic Jr.'s
      shoulder. Gets another foot into the steering wheel, climbing
      up to the driver's door window.

      Victor looks out to see the Cadillac turning down a side
      street, out of sight.

      In the back seat, Tiny is propped up with a bloody shirt
      pressed to his head. Singh has his feet up to brace the back
      of Marcus's seat.

                           SINGH
                Just so we're clear. You stole a car,
                shot a bouncer, and had sex with two
                women?

                           TINY
                You had sex with two women?

      Simon ignores them, still checking his rear-view mirror.

                We can be in Mexico by noon. I say we
                split up from there. I'll take Baja.

                   Simon, think about it. If they were going
                   to call the cops, they would have called
                   them in Las Vegas. They just wanted us
                   gone, and we're gone. It's over.

    Simon approaches Ronna gingerly. We stay back with Claire, who
    sets to work opening a box of expired cookies.

    She half-listens as Ronna and Simon have their discussion at
    the lockers, then at the time clock.

    Simon follows Ronna out into the alley.

    Claire takes a seat atop a crappy console TV, eating an oatmeal
    cookie. The VOICES on the soap opera seem familiar.

      Adam stands mostly naked, his shirt off his shoulders and jeans

      Loop -- the white dreadlocked guy -- retapes a transmitter on

                   Seems to me, if a guy's so concerned about
                   the legal process, how come he finds
                   himself getting busted for possession?

      Adam and Zack share a look. A beat.

                              BURKE
                   Relax. I sign your form and the whole
                   thing goes away. Your lawyer got you a
                   good deal.

      Loop sits back, his job finished.

                              ADAM
                   Is it safe to have a radio against my
                   balls like this?

      A beat.

                             LOOP
                   Safe enough.

      A BEEP as he presses a button. His headphones register.

                I smell a pilot.

      Burke is oblivious to sarcasm. Loop's pita is self-
      destructing. He eats faster, trying to finish before it falls
      apart.

                rubbing up against you to get some of that.
                    (off Loop's reaction)
                Some of the pussy power.

      Zack offers Loop a napkin. He passes.

                Zack's girlfriend is fucking around on

                Man, I'm sorry. How did you find out?

      ON ADAM, corner of his eye.

                           ZACK
                It's no big...I don't really want to get

                C'mon, tell us.

                          ADAM
                Absolutely. Tell us.

      There's a palpable tension between Adam and Zack. The others
      don't see it.

                           ZACK
                I found socks.

                           BURKE
                What, red socks, blue socks?

                           ZACK
                White socks. You know how the good kind
                of socks have band around the ankle that
                keeps them from stretching out? When I
                moved in, every one of the socks had that.
                Suddenly, there was one sock that didn't.

                           BURKE
                You hear that? We got John Sherlock
                Holmes in the car here.

      We pull into the parking lot of

      Adam turns on Zack.

      At the refrigerator section, both Adam and Zack reach for
      orange juice. Both back off. Adam motions, after you.

                             ADAM
                   So, Zack. Do you know who your

      tape. Zack does likewise. Their animosity is palpable.

                             ZACK
                   No, Adam. I do not. I have suspicions.
                   Mostly former boyfriends who keep
                   calling.

                              ADAM
                   What a coincidence. I have the exact same
                   problem with my girlfriend. In fact, I
                   think she's been sleeping around on me,
                   too.

                              ZACK
                   Isn't it ironic.

                               ADAM
                   Don't you think?
                        (beat)
                   Maybe I should start checking for socks,
                   too.

      Zack's glare could strip paint.

      As Adam and Zack head for the front, we REVERSE to find Mannie

      Zack pushes the cart past the checkstands, looking at each
      CASHIER -- they're all female. Adam is starting to panic. In
      near whispers...

                           ADAM

                You look more wholesome. Just improv.

      He steers the cart into Ronna's checkstand, where she's
      waiting on a Clutchy Old Woman who eyes everything
      suspiciously. Zack pulls out his cell phone, fake dials.

    Adam motions to leave it alone. Zack won't.

                  She's coming up.

    Burke cracks his neck, showtime.

                           ZACK
                What if she isn't really a dealer though?
                If you just pulled her into this one
                thing, wouldn't that be entrapment?

                           BURKE
                If she's making this deal, she's a dealer.
                Doesn't matter if its her first or her
                last.

      We stay on Zack, unconvinced.


133   INT. VENICE HOUSE - NIGHT                                             133

      Zack looks over as Burke comes out of the kitchen.

                           BURKE
                Cerveza?

      He hands Ronna the beer.

                          ADAM
                    (to Burke)
                Oh yeah. Hey. We bought a whole bunch of
                orange juice. It's in the car.

      Ronna has halfway figured out what's going on.

                           BURKE
                Now, Zack tells me you got 20 at 20, is
                that right?

                           RONNA
                    (suddenly)
                You got a bathroom?

                           ADAM
                Down the hall on the right.

                           ZACK
                Let me show you...

      SLOW MOTION

      Stepping towards Ronna, his back to Burke.       He very
      deliberately mouths a silent...

                           ZACK
                Go.

      Ronna sees it. Her eyes go wider. Zack nods.


                                                                  (CONTINUED)

      In the background, Burke is trying to look around. Ronna
      turns, heading down the hall. Up above, the camera is
      watching.

      For a just a second, Zack smiles.


134   INT. VENICE HOUSE - LATER                                               134

      Burke SLAMS Zack up against the wall, twisting an arm behind
      him. He kicks his feet apart, then starts to cuff him. Zack
      is in considerable pain.

                              BURKE
                       (to Adam)
                   Now watch what I do with his wrist. I
                   twist it away while I put on the second
                   cuff. That way he can't go after me. He
                   doesn't have any leverage.

      He releases his hold on Zack, his hands cuffed behind him.

                              BURKE
                   I watch all these cop shows and they never
                   do it right. Pisses me off.

      Loop emerges from the back room, carrying a big box of
      videotapes on his way out.

                              BURKE
                   Hey, feel the abs on this one.

      He rubs Zack's stomach.

                              BURKE
                   You could scrub laundry on these.

                             LOOP
                       (re: box)
                   Full hands.

      Loop pauses at the door, looking around. He's forgotten
      something.

                             BURKE
                   What?

      A beat. Loop can't remember what it was.

                             LOOP
                   Nothing. I'm out of it. Merry Christmas,
                   guys. Good to meet you.

      Adam waves. Zack nods. Loop shuts the door behind himself.
      Now its just the three men. An awkward beat.

                    (relieved)
                Great. Well, hey. A pleasure.

      He turns to the side, offering Burke his handcuffs to undo.
      Burke makes no motion to do so.

                           BURKE
                Now that he's gone, there's something I
                wanted to ask you guys about. Sort of a
                proposition.
                    (beat)
                See, my wife and I -- Irene, she's my wife
                -- we're both working on Christmas so
                we're gonna have Christmas dinner
                tonight. And I was thinking, maybe you
                guys would want to come over, eat some
                dinner with us. My wife is great, you'll
                love her, then I'll sign your form. How
                does that sound?

      A beat.

                          ZACK
                Actually, you know, I had plans.

                           ADAM
                You did?

                           ZACK
                I do.

                           ADAM
                With your girlfriend?

                          ZACK
                Yes, Adam, in fact. With my girlfriend.

                           ADAM
                Huh.
                    (beat; another; then suddenly)
                Wow, I can't believe I forgot this. I saw
                your girlfriend this morning, and she
                asked me to tell you that she couldn't
                make your plans tonight.

      Zack stares at Adam, a "why are you doing this" look.

135   EXT. A TINY HOUSE IN CULVER CITY - NIGHT                                135

      Zack hits the alarm for his red Miata, which BWOOPS. He and
      Adam walk to the door, hostility simmering.

      A prefab Nativity scene glows beside the front door. Adam
      pushes the doorbell, which CHIMES "Hark Ye Herald Angels
      Sing." Horrified, Zack turns to leave. Adam stops him.


136   INT. LIVING / DINING ROOM - NIGHT                                       136

      Too tall for the room, a Christmas tree leans back in a corner.
      The rest of the living room is dominated by a giant leather
      sofa pit.

      Bored, Adam lifts a plate to check the imprint. He sets it
      down, straightening it. Now it's out of alignment with the
      other plates. He looks around casually. No one's watching.

      Circling the table, he fixes all the plates and moves
      silverware to its proper position.

                                                                              88.

      Burke's wife IRENE is mashing potatoes with considerable zeal.
      Adam leans in, sees her dedication and tries to duck out. But
      she saw him.

                             IRENE
                Yes? Hi?

                             IRENE
                Here.

      She points. He sheepishly crosses to get it. While he's
      dialing, Irene starts in with the electric mixer. Butter.
      Milk. Salt. Adam doesn't know where to look while he's
      listening to his messages.

      He suddenly smiles. Irene notices and stops mixing.

                          ADAM
                    (re: phone)
                They're singing Christmas carols. My
                family. Minnesota, they do that.

      She leans close to listen. Smiles. She continues to lean
      close -- uncomfortably close -- for a long beat.

      We hear a toilet FLUSH. Zack emerges from the bathroom to find
      Burke stark naked, rubbing his hands over his body.

      He sprays some on Zack's hands, who didn't want it. While
      Burke turns to get some underwear, Zack tries to rub it off on
      the bedspread.

                    (mock bashful)
                It does have perks.

      Irene pops the beaters out of the mixer, hands one to Adam.
      They lick the potatoes off them.

                           IRENE
                Tell me something. When you kiss those
                girls, you're not really kissing them,
                are you?

                           ADAM
                It's a stage kiss. Your lips touch, but
                there's no tongue.

                           IRENE
                There's no feeling. Nobody gets jealous.

                          ADAM
                It's acting. It's not real.

      She takes his cleaned beater from him, dumps it in the sink.
      Turning back, she kisses him. Caught off guard, he backs into
      the refrigerator. It's a good three-second lip lock.

      She backs off. There's an awkward beat.

                           ADAM
                See, now, that. There was a tongue there.

                           BURKE (O.S.)
                Honey, red or white?

      Now dressed, Burke comes in with two bottles of wine. Zack is
      behind him at a distance, still creeped out from the bedroom
      encounter. He and Adam trade panicked stares.

                           IRENE
                What goes with turkey?

                                                                   (CONTINUED)

      Irene slides a plate under the candlestick, where wax is
      dripping onto the tablecloth. Burke tips the bottle at Adam.

                                BURKE
                   More wine?

                              ZACK
                   No. He doesn't want any more. Unless he
                   does, do you?

                                ADAM
                   No.

                              ZACK
                   This has been great, just wonderful, but
                   we're going to need to leave. Soon.
                   Adam's not feeling well.

                             ADAM
                   I'm not. It's true.

      Burke and Irene share a look.

                              BURKE
                   If you gotta go, then I understand.
                       (awkward beat)
                   But Irene and I sort of had an ulterior
                   motive inviting you here.

      Zack looks to Adam.

                              IRENE
                   He makes it sound sinister. It's not.

                              BURKE
                   She's right. Okay, you've looked around
                   our place. Where do you think we got most
                   of this stuff?

      Adam and Zack shake their heads.

                             IRENE
                   Just guess.

                                ADAM

                   J.C. Penney's?

      Irene and Burke both smile.

                              BURKE
                   It's actually from Confederated Products.
                   Almost everything in this house is from
                   Confederated Products, from the toilet
                   paper to the mattress to those candles.

                               IRENE
                   The wine.

                              BURKE
                   Even that cologne you liked.
                       (practiced)
                   See, Confederated Products is a multi-
                   level direct wholesaling company. That
                   means we don't just sell the products
                   ourselves, we also recruit and manage
                   teams who work under us. Irene and I
                   started eight months ago and we're
                   already bringing in fifty thousand a year
                   in revenues.

                              IRENE
                   We're the number four distributor in
                   Southern California. By March, we might
                   be number three.

      She crosses her fingers. So does Burke. We look to Zack,
      horrified.

                              BURKE
                   Now, as law enforcement officers, Irene
                   and I can't recruit distributors from
                   inside the force. It's against the rules
                   and we'd get fired. So what we do is look
                   for people in other industries...

                             IRENE
                   ...like the entertainment industry.

                              ZACK
                   Wait.
                       (realizing)
                   You want us to sell Amway.

                             BURKE
                   Confederated Products. It's a different
                   company, different quality of product.

      Zack and Adam share a look of disbelief and wonder.


141   EXT. FRONT OF BURKE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                    141

      Walking to the Miata, Adam takes the keys. Zack folds a form.

                           ZACK
                I need to do something terrifically
                unwholesome. I need to bathe in sin.

      Adam checks a low shelf for the right brand of scotch. Zack
      kneels beside him.

                           ZACK
                I have cheated on you with exactly one
                guy.

                           ADAM
                Ditto.

                           ZACK

                           ADAM
                No. See, if I tell you, you will freak
                out and it will be drama. Bad not-funny
                Roseanne kind of drama and I am just not
                up for it.

      He finds the right brand.

      BY THE REGISTER

      They wait in a short line.

                           ZACK

      A doorbell RINGS.


143   INT. HIGH RISE APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT                                 143

      An apartment door opens to reveal a chubby girl in sweats
      (SANDRA) with a cordless phone and giant bowl of popcorn. She
      drops the former into the latter.

                              ADAM

      the phone out of the bowl.

                   Jimmy's not here. He went to this thing.
                   Let me find it.

      She can't decide whether to close the door on them or not, so
      she only shuts it halfway. She pokes her head out the door
      again.

                              SANDRA
                   You do know, don't you?

                   I take no responsibilty. I was only an
                   innocent bystander. But there was once
                   where you missed each other by three
                   minutes. It was so exciting.

      She finds what she was looking for on the back of the door.
      Peels off a printed card.

                              SANDRA
                   It's some sort of rave thing.

                   He left an hour ago.

      Adam and Zack head back down the hall. She calls out after
      them.

                   You're not going to kill him, are you?

                   What do you mean? He was terrible. At
                   some point I just had to stop him and

                   take him by the ears and retrain him from

      A beat.

                              ZACK
                   When was that?

                             ADAM
                   October, maybe?

                             ZACK
                   Early October. And he suddenly got so
                   much better.

      A beat.

                              ADAM
                   That is so disturbing. It's like you were
                   there.

      Claire cuts through the crowd with two empty cups, in search of
      beverage.

      A sloe-eyed blonde boy (JIMMY) makes friendly with the
      BARTENDER, who is too busy to flirt. Rebuffed, Jimmy scans the
      crowd.

      Zack comes up behind him, grabs him by the waist. Jimmy
      smiles, kisses him hello.

      Adam comes up from the other side, blows in Jimmy's ear. Jimmy
      is so coked up that it takes him a beat to make the connection.
      Zack plus Adam equals bad.

      He smiles nervously.

      Zack takes a pair of child safety scissors from his jacket.
      Confused, Jimmy tries to back away. Adam holds him tight.
      Grabbing a fistful of hair, Zack cuts it off at the scalp. He
      lets the hair fall to the floor.

      Tucking away the scissors, he and Adam walk off.


146   EXT. FIELD - NIGHT (RAINING)                                           146

      The tiny Miata maneuvers through the badly organized parking
      lot, trying to find the way out.


147   INT. MIATA - NIGHT (RAINING)                                           147

      Zack gives directions from the passenger seat.

                              ZACK
                   Right. This right. This right!
                       (passing)
                   That was the right you wanted.

      Adam ignores him, convinced he can get out this way. A beat
      later, it dead-ends in a chain link fence.

      Zack points to his lips. He didn't say a word.

      Adam slams it in reverse, backtracking. He's doing about 20
      when suddenly we hear a loud THUMP!

      By instinct, he SLAMS on the brakes.

      Something CRASHES down on the soft roof.

                              ZACK
                   What the fuck!

      Ronna's face suddenly slams down on the windshield, bleeding
      already. Both men SCREAM. Her eyes are open, staring at them.
      After a beat, they recognize her.

                                ZACK
                   Oh my God.

                             ADAM
                   It's...It's that girl.

                                ZACK
                   Ronna.

      Her body continues its slide across the windshield, finally
      resting on the hood. In a sort of spasm, Adam REVS back,
      shaking the body off. It drops beyond the headlights.

      Zack looks past Adam to see Gaines standing there, gun drawn.

                            ZACK
                   Go. Go. Go!

                   Go!

      Adam pops the clutch and they lurch backward, out of there.

      IN THE MIRROR

      Gaines steps out to watch them go.


148   EXT. FIELD / PARKING LOT - NIGHT (RAIN)                                  148

      Adam steadies his hands on the wheel. Zack passes him the
      scotch. He takes a gulp, passes it back. The energy is still
      revved up to 11 -- we don't let ourselves catch a breath.

                              ZACK
                   Let's think about it logically. Either
                   she's alive, or she's dead. If she's
                   dead, then there's nothing we can do. If
                   she's alive, then the guy with the gun,
                   who seemed to want to shoot her, probably
                   did shoot her.

                              ADAM
                   So even if she's alive, she's dead.

                              ZACK
                   Exactly.

      Adam takes another drink.

                              ZACK
                   On the plus side, the only witnesses are
                   you, me and him. And none of us are going
                   to want to be talking about it. So if you
                   really think about it, it didn't turn out
                   as badly as it could have.

                              ADAM
                   A girl is dead.

                   I didn't say it went perfectly.

      Adam gets out of the car, walks away. Zack takes another swig.


151   EXT. SIDE OF THE GAS STATION - NIGHT (RAIN)                             151

      Adam stops at a payphone. A long moment before he reaches for
      the receiver. With a breath, he dials 911.

      Zack dunks the squeegee back in the bucket. With a wad of
      paper towels, he cleans the hood of the car.

                                                                          100.

      Washing his face, Adam looks at his reflection in the scratched
      mirror. He steps to the urinal, unbuttons.

      Before he can start to piss, he notices something strange. He
      looks down at his crotch.


154   EXT. GAS STATION ISLAND - NIGHT (RAIN)                                154

      Zack throws away the last of the towels as Adam approaches.

      With a finger to his lips, Adam holds out a mess of tape and
      wires, all connected to a battery pack. It's the microphone he
      was wearing.

                             ZACK
                Holy sh...

      He stops himself. Adam throws the bundle as far as he can.
      They keep their voices low anyway.

                           ZACK
                They wouldn't have been listening all
                this time.

                          ADAM
                Hello, they could have been recording it.
                Everything we said could be on tape
                somewhere. They would know we did it.

      A beat.

                What if we were just running lines? For a
                scene?

      Adam won't even dignify that with an answer. A long moment,
      just the BUZZ of the lights overhead. With an almost eerie
      calm...

                           ZACK
                There's a pretty good chance no one's
                found her yet.

                They will.

      The Supafest is still RAGING in the distance. Adam digs
      through the trunk of the convertible, frantically rearranging
      the junk inside. He keeps looking around the lid, waiting for
      someone to sneak up on them.

      Zack watches Adam's fruitless arranging efforts.

                             ZACK
                   Stop. Okay, stop!

                   It's a Miata.

      All Adam's effort, he's made enough room for a pizza. Maybe.

                              ZACK
                   We'll put her in the passenger seat.

                              ZACK
                   In the passenger seat. Holding her up.

      Adam shudders at the thought.

      With a flashlight, Zack jumps down into the ditch. He nudges
      Ronna's body with his foot. She's dead alright.

      He rolls the body over, grabbing under her arms. He tries to
      hoist her up, but she's too heavy and the ditch is too deep.

                             ZACK

                   I can't do this.

      Frustrated, Zack tries again to lug the body out. He can't do
      it by himself. Meanwhile, Adam is starting to hyperventilate,
      tears swelling.

      He looks around, expecting someone to walk up and see them.

                   No you didn't, okay? This is all just

      Obeying, Adam grabs Ronna's wrists as Zack pushes from below.
      Together they get the body out of the ditch. Zack climbs up to
      help maneuver her into the car. Just then...

      Ronna MOANS.

      Adam freaks out, dropping his side. Ronna's head hits the
      dirt. Louder MOANING.

                mean, you still killed her.

                           ADAM
                What do you mean, I killed her?

                           ZACK
                Christ, I didn't mean it that way. C'mon.
                I would never testify against you.

      Adam is not reassured.

                           ZACK
                We have to stick with Plan A.

                           ADAM
                In Plan A she was dead.

      Zack reaches into the car, pulling out The Club. Trades a look
      with Adam, who finally acquieces. Almost says something,
      doesn't. They both look around, making sure no one's coming.

      Zack grips the bar like a baseball bat. Adam turns his back,
      covering his ears.

      Zack raises the bar. Adam scrunches his face tight.

                                                                    (CONTINUED)

      Zack takes two quick breaths. And holds.

      And holds. And holds.

      Adam opens his eyes, looks back. Zack isn't swinging. He
      lowers the bar. They both breathe again, relieved.

                          ZACK
                Okay. New plan.


156   EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT (RAIN)                                       156

      A CAR ALARM drones incessantly, the siren interrupted with an
      occasional

                           CAR ALARM VOICE
                Back away from the vehicle.

      Weaving through some parked cars, we settle on an angry BMW,
      its lights flashing. A small throng of RAVERS have gathered
      around to look, because Ronna's limp body lies on the hood.

      A familiar face pushes through the crowd, just arrived.

                           FILA GUY
                Hey, it's Kelly. Somebody beat the crap
                out of her.

      Moving to find...

                          SKATE-PUNK GUY
                Somebody call an ambulance!

      After a beat, he realizes he should do it himself. He takes
      off running.

      ADAM AND ZACK

      look around from the edge of a van in the distance.

                          ZACK
                Look, she's fine. They're getting an
                ambulance. She's fine.

      Adam keeps watching, not convinced. He turns back, a
      thought...

                          ADAM
                What about that guy? The guy with the
                gun. He could still go after her.

                             ZACK
                   Okay, listen. Girl in ditch -- that's our

                   own problem. We're done. We did the
                   right thing.

      Thunder RUMBLES overhead. Off Adam's look...

                             ZACK
                   Okay, approximately the right thing. In a
                   half-assed, thrown-together fashion.

      Adam smiles despite himself. Zack points, "See? See?" That
      just makes Adam smile more.

                             ZACK
                   Home?

                             ADAM
                   Home.

      As they walk off, we leave the Mary Xmas Supafest still BLARING
      in the distance.


157   INT. JAVAMAN CAFE / HOLLYWOOD - DAY                                     157

      Too early for the brunch crowd, just a smattering of vampires.
      All around, Christmas lights are strung with mad abandon.

      The lights overhead FLICKER. Everyone looks up. That's when
      we come to find

      TODD GAINES

      sitting alone at a booth by the window, disassembling a
      newspaper. He finds the comics.




                                                                     (CONTINUED)

      Laying the paper flat, he tears off the bottom corner of the
      page and starts reading like a kid, his whole body leaning over
      the table.

      At the door, Claire comes in, shaking the rain out of her hair.
      After a beat, she does it again, as if she doesn't remember
      doing it the first time. She's tired and wired, all nerves and
      raw edges. There's static only she can feel.

      She looks right past Gaines, out to the rain on the street. He
      watches her, but doesn't try to catch her eye. The Jamaican
      WAITER walks past her with a pot of coffee.

                             WAITER
                   Anywhere you want.

                             CLAIRE
                   I'm meeting people.

      He doesn't care. Claire takes a seat at the table in front of
      her, but it's not to her liking. Then a booth. She plays with
      the salt shakers. Bad.

      It's only now that she sees Gaines watching her. At first she
      doesn't recognize him. Then a light goes on. She climbs over
      the booth and into his, facing him.

                             CLAIRE
                   Hey.

                             GAINES
                   Hey.

                             CLAIRE
                   We're twins.

      She turns over his hand, compares it to hers. They both have
      the same ink stamp on the back. He's busted, no way to talk
      himself out.

      The Waiter comes with coffee, refills Gaines' cup.

      Claire overturns the cup in front of her. The Waiter fills it.
      She overturns a second cup, points to it. A big weird smile.
      Reluctantly, the Waiter fills that too. Then leaves.

                              CLAIRE
                   I'll pay you back for breakfast.
                       (leaning closer)
                   Don't worry. I'm not really that hungry.

      She sheds her coat, having great difficulty with one sleeve.

                See, when we go out, we always meet here
                afterwards in case we get separated.

                It happens more than you'd think. I've
                been paging her, but she hasn't called
                back.

      The lights FLICKER again, storm still raging.

      Halfway into getting her coat off, Claire has second thoughts,
      but continues nonetheless. Gaines is taken off-balance, his
      private space violated.

      Claire finally looks up at Gaines, smiles. A beat.

                           CLAIRE
                Unless you wanted to eat alone.

                          GAINES
                No. It's fine.

      Gaines scrapes the last of his eggs off the plate. Claire sits
      with two pieces of toast, untouched. She takes the scrap of
      the newspaper he tore off, looks at it.

                           CLAIRE
                What do you have against The Family
                Circus?

                             GAINES
                It's evil.

                          CLAIRE
                Besides that.

                           GAINES
                Okay. Location mostly. Bottom right
                corner, just waiting there to suck. It's
                the last thing you read, and it spoils
                everything you read before it.

                           CLAIRE
                You could just not read it.

                           GAINES
                I hate it, yet I'm uncontrollably drawn to
                it. Are you going to...

      He points to her toast. She slides it over. He slathers on a
      thick coat of jelly.

                  Ginseng and lotsa caffeine.

    Gaines leaves money for the check.

    A beat. Claire looks around at the various decorations: a red
    tree by the door, snowflakes on the window, lights blinking on
    the wall.

158   INT. STAIRWELL TO GAINES' APARTMENT - DAY                             158

      Claire kisses Gaines, pinning him against the wall. Rain BEATS
      against the door.

      She fumbles with his belt. His hand slides under her jacket,
      trying to undo her bra. They take a break from undressing to
      kiss harder.

      Reclining on the steps, Claire tries to push his jeans down
      with her toes. Her foot gets caught in the chain from his
      wallet. Her butt slides down a step. They laugh.

      Her hand hits something hard -- his gun. It's tucked into his
      jacket pocket.

      As they start to work up a rhythm, Huxley the cat comes down
      the steps, curious. He brushes against them, unnoticed.
      Finally, he MEWS.

                How did you get out?

      them.

      It's Victor.

      He has the silver .45 drawn on them. Gaines looks down to the
      door at the bottom. Vic Jr. is blocking it. They're trapped.
      Claire looks around, trying to figure out what's happening.


159 - 167       OMIT                                                        159 - 167

     INT. APARTMENT - LATER

     Sitting in the green chair, Simon makes an `X' on his bicep
     with a marker. He feels for the bone.

                          SIMON
               It's all flesh here, it should be okay.

     Gaines and the Vics stand around him. In the background,
     Claire is dubious and horrified.

     Vic Jr. puts Todd's gun to the `X.' Gaines hands Simon a shirt
     to mop up the blood.

                         SIMON
               Right, great.

     On some sick level, he's really into this.

     Vic Jr. gets ready to shoot. Everyone subtly backs away,
     bracing for the gunshot. Three. Two. One.

     But there's no bang.                                                         *

169   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY                                               169

      Ronna wakes up, a bit at a time, an IV dripping overhead. We
      hear carolers SINGING in the distance.

      Her nose crinkles, her tongue finds her lips. Finally a
      swollen eye opens, looks around. A MEXICAN FAMILY is gathered
      around the other bed in the room, the father dressed as Santa
      Claus.

      Ronna sees the IV dangling from her arm. She sits up with
      difficulty, a head rush. She tries to get her bearings, but
      genuinely doesn't know how she got here.

      After a beat, she rips off the tape and carefuly pulls the
      needle out of her arm.

169B INT. SUPERMARKET BREAK ROOM - DAY                                      169B

      Ronna slides her time card into the machine, which PUNCHES
      down.


169C INT. SUPERMARKET AISLE - DAY                                           169C

      Ronna ties her apron as she heads to the front, limping a bit.


169D INT. SUPERMARKET / CHECKOUT LANE - DAY                                 169D

      Claire finishes bagging groceries. Looks up to see Ronna
      coming to open the next register.

                           RONNA
                Hey.

      Claire doesn't say anything, a pointed silence.

      Ronna keys in, checks the drawer. Claire returns to her
      register. Ronna tries to make eye contact, but no luck.


                                                                   (CONTINUED)

                  Okay, real mature.

    Claire continues to ignore her, turning her back. She
    straightens coupons, rubber-banding them.

                  Claire.

    Nothing. A beat. Finally...

                             RONNA
                  Alright. Mistakes were made. Things
                  didn't go exactly as planned.

    Claire's eyes -- understatement.

                             RONNA [CONT'D]
                  But it wasn't exactly a banner night for
                  me, either.

    Claire stops, disbelieving -- if Ronna only knew. She turns on
    her, then back to the register, holding it in. But she just has

      A stray   black cat scratches through a pile of foam peanuts,
      looking   for bugs. Another cat crawls up the body of Mannie,
      propped   against the dumpster. A trickle of water drips off the

      Simon awakes to POUNDING at the front door. He stands and
      turns, disoriented, no idea when or where he is. He finally
      finds a clock -- it's 4:14 in the afternoon.

      More POUNDING at the door. Simon half-crawls to the window,
      looking out to see who's at the door.

      HIS P.O.V.

      From this angle, all we can see is the sleeve of a man's
      jacket.

                              SIMON
                       (tentatively)
                   Who is it?

      He ducks, expecting a hail of gunfire.

                                MALE VOICE [O.S.]
                   It's Todd.

      A beat, then Simon finally drops his panic. He keeps the gun
      in hand as he pulls the chair away from the doorknob and slowly
      undoes the lock. He leaves the chain on.

      Looking out through the crack, we see Gaines, alone.

                              SIMON
                   Jesus, Todd. Thank God.
                       (undoes chain)
                   You won't believe the shit I've been
                   through...

      Without a word, Gaines grabs him by the collar and SMASHES him,
      one punch to the face. Simon falls in a dazed lump to the
      floor. We stay down with him as we watch Gaines walk away.

      Simon blinks and sniffles as we once again

      Adam and Zack scrub the Miata's upholstery with brushes and
      various cleaners, trying to get the bloodstains out. Zack

      Nothing. A quiet beat, the first moment of genuine affection
      between them.

      Suddenly we hear a BEEPING. We can't tell where it's coming
      from.

      Following the sound, Adam finds a mud-encrusted beeper wedged
      between the seat and the center console. He looks up to Zack,
      then checks the number.

                So last night I went back to the pier
                to do some investigating of my own.
                Turns out there are two boats named the
                Princess. Only, one just got back from
                two weeks at sea -- Sal Dominico's
                boat. It got me thinkin' -- if Chase
                really did know Carmen was on to him,
                how come he didn't tell Lucas, or
                Gamble, or Myerson? Why would he drive
                up to Pinecliff by himself? And why
                would you still have his briefcase?
                    (beat)

                           ZACK
                Don't forget, detective. I was cleared
                of all charges.

THIRD DRAFT				PARAMOUNT PICTURES
					1 Gulf and Western Plaza
March 29, 1971				New York, New York 10019





	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

	The PARAMOUNT Logo is presented austerely over a black
	background.  There is a moment's hesitation, and then the
	simple words in white lettering:

				  THE GODFATHER

	While this remains, we hear: "I believe in America."
	Suddenly we are watching in CLOSE VIEW, AMERIGO BONASERA, a
	man of sixty, dressed in a black suit, on the verge of great
	emotion.

				BONASERA
		America has made my fortune.

	As he speaks, THE VIEW imperceptibly begins to loosen.

				BONASERA
		I raised my daughter in the American
		fashion; I gave her freedom, but
		taught her never to dishonor her
		family.  She found a boy friend,
		not an Italian.  She went to the
		movies with him, stayed out late.
		Two months ago he took her for a
		drive, with another boy friend.
		They made her drink whiskey and
		then they tried to take advantage
		of her.  She resisted; she kept her
		honor.  So they beat her like an
		animal.  When I went to the hospital
		her nose was broken, her jaw was
		shattered and held together by
		wire, and she could not even weep
		because of the pain.

	He can barely speak; he is weeping now.

				BONASERA
		I went to the Police like a good
		American.  These two boys were
		arrested and brought to trial.  The
		judge sentenced them to three years
		in prison, and suspended the
		sentence.  Suspended sentence!
		They went free that very day.  I
		stood in the courtroom like a fool,
		and those bastards, they smiled at
		me.  Then I said to my wife, for
		Justice, we must go to The Godfather.

	By now, THE VIEW is full, and we see Don Corleone's office
	in his home.

	The blinds are closed, and so the room is dark, and with
	patterned shadows.  We are watching BONASERA over the
	shoulder of DON CORLEONE.  TOM HAGEN sits near a small
	table, examining some paperwork, and SONNY CORLEONE stands
	impatiently by the window nearest his father, sipping from a
	glass of wine.  We can HEAR music, and the laughter and
	voices of many people outside.

				DON CORLEONE
		Bonasera, we know each other for
		years, but this is the first time
		you come to me for help.  I don't
		remember the last time you invited
		me to your house for coffee...even
		though our wives are friends.

				BONASERA
		What do you want of me?  I'll give
		you anything you want, but do what
		I ask!

				DON CORLEONE
		And what is that Bonasera?

	BONASERA whispers into the DON's ear.

				DON CORLEONE
		No.  You ask for too much.

				BONASERA
		I ask for Justice.

				DON CORLEONE
		The Court gave you justice.

				BONASERA
		An eye for an eye!

				DON CORLEONE
		But your daughter is still alive.

				BONASERA
		Then make them suffer as she
		suffers.  How much shall I pay you.

	Both HAGEN and SONNY react.

				DON CORLEONE
		You never think to protect yourself
		with real friends.  You think it's
		enough to be an American.  All
		right, the Police protects you,
		there are Courts of Law, so you
		don't need a friend like me.
		But now you come to me and say Don
		Corleone, you must give me justice.
		And you don't ask in respect or
		friendship.  And you don't think to
		call me Godfather; instead you come
		to my house on the day my daughter
		is to be married and you ask me to
		do murder...for money.

				BONASERA
		America has been good to me...

				DON CORLEONE
		Then take the justice from the
		judge, the bitter with the sweet,
		Bonasera.  But if you come to me
		with your friendship, your loyalty,
		then your enemies become my enemies,
		and then, believe me, they would
		fear you...

	Slowly, Bonasera bows his head and murmurs.

				BONASERA
		Be my friend.

				DON CORLEONE
		Good.  From me you'll get Justice.

				BONASERA
		Godfather.

				DON CORLEONE
		Some day, and that day may never
		come, I would like to call upon you
		to do me a service in return.

	EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

	A HIGH ANGLE of the CORLEONE MALL in bright daylight.  There
	are at least five hundred guests filling the main courtyard
	and gardens.  There is music and laughing and dancing and
	countless tables covered with food and wine.

	DON CORLEONE stands at the Gate, flanked on either side by a
	son: FREDO and SONNY, all dressed in the formal attire of
	the wedding party.  He warmly shakes the hands, squeezes the
	hands of the friends and guests, pinches the cheeks of the
	children, and makes them all welcome.  They in turn carry
	with them gallons of homemade wine, cartons of freshly baked
	bread and pastries, and enormous trays of Italian delicacies.

	The entire family poses for a family portrait: DON CORLEONE,
	MAMA, SONNY, his wife, SANDRA, and their children, TOM HAGEN
	and his wife, THERESA, and their BABY; CONSTANZIA, the
	bride, and her bridegroom, CARLO RIZZI.  As they move into
	the pose, THE DON seems preoccupied.

				DON CORLEONE
		Where's Michael?

				SONNY
		He'll be here Pop, it's still early.

				DON CORLEONE
		Then the picture will wait for him.

	Everyone in the group feels the uneasiness as the DON moves
	back to the house.  SONNY gives a delicious smile in the
	direction of the Maid-of-Honor, LUCY MANCINI.  She returns
	it.  Then he moves to his wife.

				SONNY
		Sandra, watch the kids.  They're
		running wild.

				SANDRA
		You watch yourself.

	HAGEN kisses his WIFE, and follows THE DON, passing the wine
	barrels, where a group of FOUR MEN nervously wait.  TOM
	crooks a finger at NAZORINE, who doublechecks that he is
	next, straightens, and follows HAGEN.

	EXT DAY: MALL ENTRANCE (SUMMER 1945)

	Outside the main gate of the Mall, SEVERAL MEN in suits,
	working together with a MAN in a dark sedan, walk in and out
	of the rows of parked cars, writing license plate numbers
	down in their notebooks.  We HEAR the music and laughter
	coming from the party in the distance.

	A MAN stops at a limousine and copies down the number.

	BARZINI, dignified in a black homburg, is always under the
	watchful eyes of TWO BODYGUARDS as he makes his way to
	embrace DON CORLEONE in the courtyard.

	The MEN walk down another row of parked cars.  Put another
	number in the notebook.  A shiney new Cadillac with wooden
	bumpers.

	PETER CLEMENZA, dancing the Tarantella joyously, bumping
	bellies with the ladies.

				CLEMENZA
		Paulie...wine...WINE.

	He mops his sweating forehead with a big handkerchief.
	PAULIE hustles, gets a glass of icy black wine, and brings
	it to him.

				PAULIE
		You look terrif on the floor!

				CLEMENZA
		What are you, a dance judge?  Go do
		your job; take a walk around the
		neighborhood... see everything is
		okay.

	PAULIE nods and leaves; CLEMENZA takes a breath, and leaps
	back into the dance.

	The MEN walk down another row of parked cars.  Put another
	number in the notebook.

	TESSIO, a tall, gentle-looking man, dances with a NINE-YEAR-
	OLD GIRL, her little black party shoes planted on his
	enormous brown shoes.

	The MEN move on to other parked cars, when SONNY storms out
	of the gate, his face flushed with anger, followed by
	CLEMENZA and PAULIE.

				SONNY
		Buddy, this is a private party.

	The MAN doesn't answer, but points to the DRIVER of the
	sedan.  SONNY menacingly thrusts his reddened face at him.
	The DRIVER merely flips open his wallet to a greed card,
	without saying a word.  SONNY steps back, spits on the
	ground, turns, and walks away, followed by CLEMENZA, PAULIE,
	and another TWO MEN.  He doesn't say a thing for most of the
	walk back into the courtyard, and then, muttered to PAULIE.

				SONNY
		Goddamn FBI...don't respect nothing.

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

	DON CORLEONE sits quietly behind his massive desk in the
	dark study.

				NAZORINE
		...a fine boy from Sicily, captured
		by the American Army, and sent to
		New Jersey as a prisoner of war...

				DON CORLEONE
		Nazorine, my friend, tell me what I
		can do.

				NAZORINE
		Now that the war is over, Enzo,
		this boy is being repatriated to
		Italy.  And you see, Godfather...
			  (he wrings his hands,
			  unable to express himself)
		He...my daughter...they...

				DON CORLEONE
		You want him to stay in this country.

				NAZORINE
		Godfather, you understand everything.

				DON CORLEONE
		Tom, what we need is an Act of
		Congress to allow Enzo to become a
		citizen.

				NAZORINE
			  (impressed)
		An Act of Congress!

				HAGEN
			  (nodding)
		It will cost.

	The DON shrugs; such are the way with those things; NAZORINE
	nods.

				NAZORINE
		Is that all?  Godfather, thank
		you...
			  (backing out, enthusiastically)
		Oh, wait till you see the cake I
		made for your beautiful daughter!

	NAZORINE backs out, all smiles, and nods to the GODFATHER.
	DON CORLEONE rises and moves to the Venetian blinds.

				HAGEN
		Who do I give this job to?

	The DON moves to the windows, peeking out through the blinds.

				DON CORLEONE
		Not to one of our paisans...give it
		to a Jew Congressman in another
		district.  Who else is on the list
		for today?

	The DON is peeking out to the MEN around the barrel, waiting
	to see him.

				HAGEN
		Francesco Nippi.  His nephew has
		been refused parole.  A bad case.

	EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

	WHAT HE SEES:

	NIPPI waits nervously by the barrel.

				HAGEN (O.S.)
		His father worked with you in the
		freight yards when you were young.

	LUCA BRASI sitting alone, grotesque and quiet.

				HAGEN (O.S.)
		He's not on the list, but Luca
		Brasi wants to see you.

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

	The DON turns to HAGEN.

				DON CORLEONE
		Is it necessary?

				HAGEN
		You understand him better than
		anyone.

	The DON nods to this.  Turns back to the blinds and peeks out.

	EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

	WHAT HE SEES:

	MICHAEL CORLEONE, dressed in the uniform of a Marine Captain,
	leads KAY ADAMS through the wedding crowd, occasionally
	stopped and greeted by FRIENDS of the family.

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

	The DON, inside the office, peering through the blinds,
	following them.

	EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

	MICHAEL moves through the crowd, embraces MAMA and introduces
	her to his GIRL.

	EXT DAY: OFFICE WINDOW (SUMMER 1945)

	The DON's eyes peering through the blinds.

	EXT DAY: MALL TABLES (SUMMER 1945)

	KAY and MICHAEL settle by a table on the edge of the wedding,
	burdened down with plates of food and glasses and wine.  She
	is exhilarated by the enormity of the affair, the music and
	the vitality.

				KAY
		I've never seen anything like it.

				MICHAEL
		I told you I had a lot of relatives.

	KAY looking about, a young and lively thing in a gift shop.
	We see what she sees:

	Her interest is caught by THREE MEN standing by the wine
	barrels.

				KAY
			  (amused)
		Michael, what are those men doing?

				MICHAEL
		They're waiting to see my father.

				KAY
		They're talking to themselves.

				MICHAEL
		They're going to talk to my father,
		which means they're going to ask
		him for something, which means they
		better get it right.

				KAY
		Why do they bother him on a day
		like this?

				MICHAEL
		Because they know that no Sicilian
		will refuse a request on his
		daughter's wedding day.

	EXT DAY: WEDDING PARTY (SUMMER 1945)

	CONNIE CORLEONE, the Bride, is pressing the bodice of her
	overly-fluffy white gown against the groom, CARLO RIZZI.  He
	is bronzed, with curly blondish hair and lovely dimples.
	She absolutely adores him and can barely take her eyes from
	him long enough to thank the various GUESTS for the white
	envelopes they are putting into the large white purse she
	holds.  In fact, if we watch carefully, we can see that one
	of her hands is slid under his jacket, and into his shirt,
	where she is provocatively rubbing the hair on his chest.
	CARLO, on the other hand, has his blue eyes trained on the
	bulging envelopes, and is trying to guess how much cash the
	things hold.

	Discreetly, he moves her hand off of his skin.

				CARLO
			  (whispered)
		Cut it out, Connie.

	The purse, looped by a ribbon of silk around CONNIE's arm,
	is fat with money.

				PAULIE (O.S.)
		What do you think?  Twenty grand?

	A little distance away, a young man, PAULIE GATTO, catches a
	prosciutto sandwich thrown by a friend, without once taking
	eyes from the purse.

				PAULIE
		Who knows?  Maybe more.  Twenty,
		thirty grand in small bills cash in
		that silk purse.  Holy Toledo, if
		this was somebody else's wedding!

	SONNY is sitting at the Wedding Dias, talking to LUCY
	MANCINI, the Maid of Honor.  Every once in a while he
	glances across the courtyard, where his WIFE is talking with
	some WOMEN.

	He bends over and whispers something into LUCY's ear.

	SANDRA and the WOMEN are in the middle of a big, ribald laugh.

				WOMAN
		Is it true what they say about your
		husband, Sandra?

	SANDRA's hands separate with expanding width further and
	further apart until she bursts into a peal of laughter.
	Through her separated hands she sees the Wedding Dais.
	SONNY and LUCY are gone.

	INT DAY: DON'S HALL & STAIRS (SUMMER 1945)

	The empty hallway.  The bathroom door opens and LUCY
	surreptitiously steps out.

	She looks up where SONNY is standing on the second landing,
	motioning for her to come up.

	She lifts her petticoats off the ground and hurries upstairs.

	EXT DAY: MALL TABLES (SUMMER 1945)

	KAY and MICHAEL.

				KAY
			  (in a spooky low tone)
		Michael, that scarey guy...Is he a
		relative?

	She has picked out LUCA BRASI.

				MICHAEL
		No.  His name is Luca Brasi.  You
		wouldn't like him.

				KAY
			  (Excited)
		Who is he?

				MICHAEL
			  (Sizing her up)
		You really want to know?

				KAY
		Yes.  Tell me.

				MICHAEL
		You like spaghetti?

				KAY
		You know I love spaghetti.

				MICHAEL
		Then eat your spaghetti and I'll
		tell you a Luca Brasi story.

	She starts to eat her spaghetti.

	She begins eating, looking at him eagerly.

				MICHAEL
		Once upon a time, about fifteen
		years ago some people wanted to
		take over my father's olive oil
		business.  They had Al Capone send
		some men in from Chicago to kill my
		father, and they almost did.

				KAY
		Al Capone!

				MICHAEL
		My Father sent Luca Brasi after
		them.  He tied the two Capone men
		hand and foot, and stuffed small
		bath towels into their mouths.
		Then he took an ax, and chopped one
		man's feet off...

				KAY
		Michael...

				MICHAEL
		Then the legs at the knees...

				KAY
		Michael you're trying to scare me...

				MICHAEL
		Then the thighs where they joined
		the torso.

				KAY
		Michael, I don't want to hear
		anymore...

				MICHAEL
		Then Luca turned to the other man...

				KAY
		Michael, I love you.

				MICHAEL
		...who out of sheer terror had
		swallowed the bath towel in his
		mouth and suffocated.

	The smile on his face seems to indicate that he is telling a
	tall story.

				KAY
		I never know when you're telling me
		the truth.

				MICHAEL
		I told you you wouldn't like him.

				KAY
		He's coming over here!

	LUCA comes toward them to meet TOM HAGEN halfway, just near
	their table.

				MICHAEL
		Tom...Tom, I'd like you to meet Kay
		Adams.

				KAY
			  (having survived LUCA)
		How do you do.

				MICHAEL
		My brother, Tom Hagen.

				HAGEN
		Hello Kay.  Your father's inside,
		doing some business.
			  (privately)
		He's been asking for you.

				MICHAEL
		Thanks Tom.

	HAGEN smiles and moves back to the house, LUCA ominously
	following.

				KAY
		If he's your brother, why does he
		have a different name?

				MICHAEL
		My brother Sonny found him living
		in the streets when he was a kid,
		so my father took him in.  He's a
		good lawyer.

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

	DON CORLEONE at the window.  He has seen the intimacy of the
	YOUNG COUPLE.

				LUCA (O.S.)
		Don Corleone...

	THE DON turns to the stiffly formal LUCA, and he moves
	forward to kiss his hand.  He takes the envelope from his
	jacket, holds it out, but does not release it until he makes
	a formal speech.

				LUCA
			  (with difficulty)
		Don Corleone...I am honored, and
		grateful...that you invited me to
		your home...on the wedding day of
		your...daughter.
		May their first child...be a
		masculine child.  I pledge my never
		ending loyalty.
			  (he offers the envelope)
		For your daughter's bridal purse.

				DON CORLEONE
		Thank you, Luca, my most valued
		friend.

	THE DON takes it, and then LUCA's hand, which he squeezes so
	tightly we might imagine it to be painful.

				LUCA
		Let me leave you, Don Corleone.  I
		know you are busy.

	He turns, almost an about-face, and leaves the study with
	the same formality he entered with.  DON CORLEONE breathes
	more easily, and gives the thick envelope to HAGEN.

				DON CORLEONE
		I'm sure it's the most generous
		gift today.

				HAGEN
		The Senator called--apologized for
		not coming personally, but said
		you'd understand.  Also, some of
		the Judges...they've all sent gifts.
		And another call from Virgil
		Sollozzo.

	DON CORLEONE is not pleased.

				HAGEN
		The action is narcotics.  Sollozzo
		has contacts in Turkey for the
		poppy, in Sicily for the plants to
		process down to morphine or up to
		heroin.  Also he has access to this
		country.  He's coming to us for
		financial help, and some sort of
		immunity from the law.  For that we
		get a piece of the action, I
		couldn't find out how much.
		Sollozzo is vouched for by the
		Tattaglia family, and they may have
		a piece of the action.  They call
		Sollozzo the Turk.
		He's spent a lot of time in Turkey
		and is suppose to have a Turkish
		wife and kids.  He's suppose to be
		very quick with the knife, or was,
		when he was younger.  Only in
		matters of business and with some
		reasonable complaint.  Also he has
		an American wife and three children
		and he is a good family man.

	THE DON nods.

				HAGEN
		He's his own boss, and very
		competent.

				DON CORLEONE
		And with prison record.

				HAGEN
		Two terms; one in Italy, one in the
		United States.  He's known to the
		Government as a top narcotics man.
		That could be a plus for us; he
		could never get immunity to testify.

				DON CORLEONE
		When did he call?

				HAGEN
		This morning.

				DON CORLEONE
		On a day like this.  Consiglero, do
		you also have in your notes the the
		Turk made his living from
		Prostitution before the war, like
		the Tattaglias do now.  Write that
		down before you forget it.  The
		Turk will wait.

	We now begin to hear a song coming over the loud-speakers
	from outside.  In Italian, with unmistakable style.

				DON CORLEONE
		What that?  It sounds like Johnny.

	He moves to the window, pulls the blinds up, flooding the
	room with light.

				DON CORLEONE
		It is Johnny.  He came all the way
		from California to be at the wedding.

				HAGEN
		Should I bring him in.

				DON CORLEONE
		No.  Let the people enjoy him.  You
		see?  He is a good godson.

				HAGEN
		It's been two years.  He's probably
		in trouble again.

	EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

	JOHNNY FONTANE on the bandstand, singing to the delight and
	excitement of the wedding GUESTS.

				KAY
		I didn't know your family knew
		Johnny Fontane.

				MICHAEL
		Sure.

				KAY
		I used to come down to New York
		whenever he sang at the Capitol and
		scream my head off.

				MICHAEL
		He's my father's godson; he owes
		him his whole career.

	JOHNNY finishes the song and the CROWD screams with delight.
	They call out for another when DON CORLEONE appears.

				DON CORLEONE
		My Godson has come three thousand
		miles to do us honor and no one
		thinks to wet his throat.

	At once a dozen wine glasses are offered to JOHNNY, who
	takes a sip from each as he moves to embrace his GODFATHER.

				JOHNNY
		I kept trying to call you after my
		divorce and Tom always said you
		were busy.  When I got the Wedding
		invitation I knew you weren't sore
		at me anymore, Godfather.

				DON CORLEONE
		Can I do something for you still?
		You're not too rich, or too famous
		that I can't help you?

				JOHNNY
		I'm not rich anymore, Godfather,
		and...my career, I'm almost washed
		up...

	He's very disturbed.  The GODFATHER indicates that he come
	with him to the office so no one will notice.  He turns to
	HAGEN.

				DON CORLEONE
		Tell Santino to come in with us.
		He should hear some things.

	They go, leaving HAGEN scanning the party looking for SONNY.

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

	HAGEN glances up the staircase.

				HAGEN
		Sonny?

	Then he goes up.

	INT DAY: DON'S UPSTAIRS ROOM (SUMMER 1945)

	SONNY and LUCY are in a room upstairs; he has lifted her
	gown's skirts almost over her head, and has her standing
	against the door.  Her face peeks out from the layers of
	petticoats around it like a flower in ecstasy.

				LUCY
		Sonnyeeeeeeee.

	Her head bouncing against the door with the rhythm of his
	body.  But there is a knocking as well.  They stop, freeze
	in that position.

				HAGEN (O.S.)
		Sonny?  Sonny, you in there?

	INT DAY: DON'S UPSTAIRS HALLWAY (SUMMER 1945)

	Outside, HAGEN by the door.

				HAGEN
		The old man wants you; Johnny's
		here...he's got a problem.

				SONNY (O.S.)
		Okay.  One minute.

	HAGEN hesitates.  We HEAR LUCY's head bouncing against the
	door again.  TOM leaves.

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

				DON CORLEONE
		ACT LIKE A MAN!  By Christ in
		Heaven, is it possible you turned
		out no better than a Hollywood
		finocchio.

	Both HAGEN and JOHNNY cannot refrain from laughing.  The DON
	smiles.  SONNY enters as noiselessly as possible, still
	adjusting his clothes.

				DON CORLEONE
		All right, Hollywood...Now tell me
		about this Hollywood Pezzonovanta
		who won't let you work.

				JOHNNY
		He owns the studio.  Just a month
		ago he bought the movie rights to
		this book, a best seller.  And the
		main character is a guy just like
		me.  I wouldn't even have to act,
		just be myself.

	The DON is silent, stern.

				DON CORLEONE
		You take care of your family?

				JOHNNY
		Sure.

	He glances at SONNY, who makes himself as inconspicuous as
	he can.

				DON CORLEONE
		You look terrible.  I want you to
		eat well, to rest.  And spend time
		with your family.  And then, at the
		end of the month, this big shot
		will give you the part you want.

				JOHNNY
		It's too late.  All the contracts
		have been signed, they're almost
		ready to shoot.

				DON CORLEONE
		I'll make him an offer he can't
		refuse.

	He takes JOHNNY to the door, pinching his cheek hard enough
	to hurt.

				DON CORLEONE
		Now go back to the party and leave
		it to me.

	He closes the door, smiling to himself.  Turns to HAGEN.

				DON CORLEONE
		When does my daughter leave with
		her bridegroom?

				HAGEN
		They'll cut the cake in a few
		minutes...leave right after that.
		Your new son-in-law, do we give him
		something important?

				DON CORLEONE
		No, give him a living.  But never
		let him know the family's business.
		What else, Tom?

				HAGEN
		I've called the hospital; they've
		notified Consiglere Genco's family
		to come and wait.  He won't last
		out the night.

	This saddens the DON.  He sighs.

				DON CORLEONE
		Genco will wait for me.  Santino,
		tell your brothers they will come
		with me to the hospital to see
		Genco.  Tell Fredo to drive the big
		car, and ask Johnny to come with us.

				SONNY
		And Michael?

				DON CORLEONE
		All my sons.
			  (to HAGEN)
		Tom, I want you to go to California
		tonight.  Make the arrangements.
		But don't leave until I come back
		from the hospital and speak to you.
		Understood?

				HAGEN
		Understood.

	EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

	Now all the wedding GUESTS excitedly clap their hands over
	the entrance of the cake: NAZORINE is beaming as he wheels
	in a serving table containing the biggest, gaudiest, most
	extravagant wedding cake ever baked, an incredible monument
	of his gratitude.  The CROWD is favorably impressed: they
	begin to clink their knives or forks against their glasses,
	in the traditional request for the Bride to cut the cake and
	kiss the Groom.  Louder and louder, five hundred forks
	hitting five hundred glasses.

	EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

	Silence.

	HIGH ANGLE ON THE MALL, late day.  The GUESTS are gone.  A
	single black car is in the courtyard.  FREDDIE is behind the
	driver's seat: the DON enters the car, looks at MICHAEL, who
	sits between SONNY and JOHNNY in the rear seat.

				DON CORLEONE
		Will your girl friend get back to
		the city all right?

				MICHAEL
		Tom said he'd take care of it.

	The DON pulls the door shut; and the car pulls out, through
	the gate of the great Corleone Mall.

	INT DAY: HOSPITAL CORRIDOR (SUMMER 1945)

	A long white hospital corridor, at the end of which we can
	see a grouping of FIVE WOMEN, some old and some young, but
	all plump and dressed in black.

	DON CORLEONE and his SONS move toward the end.  But then the
	DON slows, putting his hand on MICHAEL's shoulder.  MICHAEL
	stops and turns toward his FATHER.  The two looks at one
	another for some time.  SILENCE.  DON CORLEONE then lifts
	his hand, and slowly touches a particular medal on MICHAEL's
	uniform.

				DON CORLEONE
		What was this for?

				MICHAEL
		For bravery.

				DON CORLEONE
		And this?

				MICHAEL
		For killing a man.

				DON CORLEONE
		What miracles you do for strangers.

				MICHAEL
		I fought for my country.  It was my
		choice.

				DON CORLEONE
		And now, what do you choose to do?

				MICHAEL
		I'm going to finish school.

				DON CORLEONE
		Good.  When you are finished, come
		and talk to me.  I have hopes for
		you.

	Again they regard each other without a word.  MICHAEL turns,
	and continues on.  DON CORLEONE watches a moment, and then
	follows.

	INT DAY: HOSPITAL ROOM (SUMMER 1945)

	DON CORLEONE enters the hospital room, moving closest to OUR
	VIEW.  He is followed by his SONS, JOHNNY and the WOMEN.

				DON CORLEONE
			  (whispered)
		Genco, I've brought my sons to pay
		their respects.  And look, even
		Johnny Fontane, all the way from
		Hollywood.

	GENCO is a tiny, wasted skeleton of a man.  DON CORLEONE
	takes his bony hand, as the others arrange themselves around
	his bed, each clasping the other hand in turn.

				GENCO
		Godfather, Godfather, it's your
		daughter's wedding day, you cannot
		refuse me.  Cure me, you have the
		power.

				DON CORLEONE
		I have no such power...but Genco,
		don't fear death.

				GENCO
			  (with a sly wink)
		It's been arranged, then?

				DON CORLEONE
		You blaspheme.  Resign yourself.

				GENCO
		You need your old Consigliere.  Who
		will replace me?
			  (suddenly)
		Stay with me Godfather.  Help me
		meet death.  If he sees you, he
		will be frightened and leave me in
		peace.  You can say a word, pull a
		few strings, eh?  We'll outwit that
		bastard as we outwitted all those
		others.
			  (clutching his hand)
		Godfather, don't betray me.

	The DON motions all the others to leave the room.  They do.
	He returns his attention to GENCO, holding his hand and
	whispering things we cannot hear, as they wait for death.

	INT NIGHT: AIRPLANE (SUMMER 1945)

	FADE IN:

	The interior of a non-stop Constellation.  HAGEN is one of
	the very few passengers on this late flight.  He looks like
	any young lawyer on a business trip.  He is tired from the
	difficult preparation and duties that he has just executed
	during the wedding.  On the seat next to him is an enormous,
	bulging briefcase.  He closes his eyes.

	INT NIGHT: HONEYMOON HOTEL (SUMMER 1945)

	The honeymoon hotel: CARLO and CONNIE.  CARLO is in his
	undershorts, sitting up on the bed, anxiously taking the
	envelopes out of the silk bridal purse and counting the
	contents.  CONNIE prepares herself in the large marble
	bathroom.  She rubs her hands over his bronze shoulders, and
	tries to get his interest.

	INT NIGHT: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

	DON CORLEONE in his office.  LUCA BRASI sitting near to him.

				DON CORLEONE
		Luca, I am worried about this man
		Sollozzo.  Find out what you can,
		through the Tattaglias.  Let them
		believe you could be tempted away
		from the Corleone Family, if the
		right offer was made.  Learn what
		he has under his fingernails...

	INT NIGHT: MANCINI APT. HALL (SUMMER 1945)

	The hallway of an apartment building.  SONNY enters, climbs
	two steps at a time.  He knocks, and then whispers.

				SONNY
		It's me, Sonny.

	The door opens, and two lovely arms are around him, pulling
	him into the apartment.

	INT NIGHT: LUCA'S ROOM (WINTER 1945)

	LUCA BRASI's tiny room.  He is partly dressed.  He kneels
	and reaches under his bed and pulls out a small, locked
	trunk.  He opens it, and takes out a heavy, bullet-proof
	vest.  He puts it on, over his wool undershirt, and then
	puts on his shirt and jacket.  He takes his gun, quickly
	disassembles, checks, and reassembles it.  And leaves.

	INT NIGHT: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

	A CLOSE VIEW of DON CORLEONE thinking quietly.

	INT NIGHT: MOVING TRAIN (SUMMER 1945)

	MICHAEL and KAY on a train, speeding on their way to New
	Hampshire.

	INT NIGHT: SUBWAY (WINTER 1945)

	LUCA, in his bulky jacket, sitting quietly on an empty
	subway train.

	INT NIGHT: AIRPLANE (SUMMER 1945)

	HAGEN on the Constellation.  He reaches into his briefcase,
	and takes out several pictures and papers.

	One photograph is of a smiling man, JACK WOLTZ, linked arm
	in arm with fifteen movie stars on either side, including a
	lovely young child star to his immediate right.

	HAGEN considers other papers.

	INT NIGHT: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

	DON CORLEONE looks, and then moves HAGEN into an embrace.
	He straightens his arms and looks at TOM deeply.

				DON CORLEONE
		Remember my new Consigliere, a
		lawyer with his briefcase can steal
		more than a hundred men with guns.

	EXT DAY: WOLTZ ESTATE GATE (SUMMER 1945)

	JACK WOLTZ ESTATE.  HAGEN stands before the impressive gate,
	armed only with his briefcase.  A GATEMAN opens the gate,
	and TOM enters.

	EXT DAY: WOLTZ GARDENS (SUMMER 1945)

	HAGEN and WOLTZ comfortably stroll along beautiful formal
	gardens, martinis in hand.

				WOLTZ
		You should have told me your boss
		was Corleone, Tom, I had to check
		you out.  I thought you were just
		some third rate hustler Johnny was
		running in to bluff me.
			  (a piece of statuary)
		Florence, thirteenth century.
		Decorated the garden of a king.

	They cross the garden and head toward the stables.

				WOLTZ
		I'm going to show you something
		beautiful.

	They pass the stables, and come to rest by a stall with a
	huge bronze plaque attached to the outside wall: "KHARTOUM."
	TWO SECURITY GUARDS are positioned in chairs nearby; they
	rise as WOLTZ approaches.

				WOLTZ
		You like horses?  I like horses, I
		love 'em.  Beautiful, expensive
		Racehorses.

	The animal inside is truly beautiful.  WOLTZ whispers to him
	with true love in his voice.

				WOLTZ
		Khartoum...Kartoum...You are
		looking at six hundred thousand
		dollars on four hoofs.  I bet even
		Russian Czars never paid that kind
		of dough for a single horse.  But
		I'm not going to race him I'm going
		to put him out to Stud.

	INT NIGHT: WOLTZ DINING ROOM (SUMMER 1945)

	HAGEN and WOLTZ sit at an enormous dining room table,
	attended by SEVERAL SERVANTS.  Great paintings hang on the
	walls.  The meal is elaborate and sumptuous.

				HAGEN
		Mr. Corleone is Johnny's Godfather.
		That is very close, a very sacred
		religious relationship.

				WOLTZ
		Okay, but just tell him this is one
		favor I can't give.  But he should
		try me again on anything else.

				HAGEN
		He never asks a second favor when
		he has been refused the first.
		Understood?

				WOLTZ
		You smooth son of a bitch, let me
		lay it on the line for you, and
		your boss.  Johnny Fontane never
		gets that movie.  I don't care how
		many Dago, Guinea, wop Greaseball
		Goombahs come out of the woodwork!

				HAGEN
		I'm German-Irish.

				WOLTZ
		Okay my Kraut-Mick friend, Johnny
		will never get that part because I
		hate that pinko punk and I'm going
		to run him out of the Movies.  And
		I'll tell you why.  He ruined one
		of Woltz Brothers' most valuable
		proteges.  For five years I had
		this girl under training; singing
		lessons!  Acting lessons!  Dancing
		lessons!  We spent hundreds of
		thousands of dollars--I was going
		to make her a star.  I'll be even
		more frank, just to show you that
		I'm not a hard-hearted man, that it
		wasn't all dollars and cents.  That
		girl was beautiful and young and
		innocent and she was the greatest
		piece of ass I've ever ad and I've
		had them all over the world.  Then
		Johnny comes along with that olive
		oil voice and guinea charm and she
		runs off.  She threw it all away to
		make me look ridiculous.  A MAN IN
		MY POSITION CANNOT AFFORD TO BE
		MADE TO LOOK RIDICULOUS!

	EXT DAY: GENCO OLIVE OIL CO. (SUMMER 1945)

	An unimposing little building in New York City on Mott
	Street with a large old sign: "GENCO OLIVE OIL IMPORTS,
	INC." next to an open-faced fruit market.

	A dark Buick pulls up, and a single small man, whom we
	cannot see well because of the distance, gets out and enters
	the building.  This is VIRGIL SOLLOZZO.

	INT DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICES (SUMMER 1945)

	Looking toward the staircase we can hear SOLLOZZO's footsteps
	before he actually rises into view.  He is a small man, very
	dark, with curly black hair.  But wiry, and tight and hard,
	and obviously very dangerous.  He is greeted at the head of
	the stairs by SONNY, who takes his hand and shakes it,
	introducing himself.  For a moment, there is a complex of
	handshaking quite formal, and whispered respectful
	introductions.  Finally, SOLLOZZO is taken into the DON's
	glass paneled office; the two principals are introduced.
	They are very respectful of one another.  Folding chairs are
	brought in by FREDDIE, and soon they are all sitting around
	in a circle; the DON, SOLLOZZO, SONNY, HAGEN, FREDDIE,
	CLEMENZA and TESSIO.  The DON is the slightest bit foolish
	with all his compatriots, whereas SOLLOZZO has brought no
	one.  Throughout all that transpires, however, it is clear
	that this scene is between two men: SOLLOZZO and DON CORLEONE.

				SOLLOZZO
		My business is heroin, I have poppy
		fields, laboratories in Narseilles
		and Sicily, ready to go into
		production.  My importing methods
		are as safe as these things can be,
		about five per cent loss.  The risk
		is nothing, the profits enormous.

				DON CORLEONE
		Why do you come to me?  Why do I
		deserve your generosity?

				SOLLOZZO
		I need two million dollars in
		cash...more important, I need a
		friend who has people in high
		places; a friend who can guarantee
		that if one of my employees be
		arrested, they would get only light
		sentences.  Be my friend.

				DON CORLEONE
		What percentages for my family?

				SOLLOZZO
		Thirty per cent.  In the first year
		your share would be four million
		dollars; then it would go up.

				DON CORLEONE
		And what is the percentage of the
		Tattaglia family?

	SOLLOZZO nods toward HAGEN.

				SOLLOZZO
		My compliments.  I'll take care of
		them from my share.

				DON CORLEONE
		So.  I receive 30 per cent just for
		finance and legal protection.  No
		worries about operations, is that
		what you tell me?

				SOLLOZZO
		If you think two million dollars in
		cash is just finance, I congratulate
		you Don Corleone.

	There is a long silence; in which each person present feels
	the tension.  The DON is about to give his answer.

				DON CORLEONE
		I said I would see you because I've
		heard you're a serious man, to be
		treated with respect...
			  (pause)
		But I'll say no to you.

	We feel this around the room.

				DON CORLEONE
		I'll give you my reasons.  I have
		many, many friends in Politics.
		But they wouldn't be so friendly if
		my business was narcotics instead
		of gambling.  They think gambling
		is something like liquor, a harmless
		vice...and they think narcotics is
		dirty business.

	SOLLOZZO takes a breath.

				DON CORLEONE
		No...how a man makes his living is
		none of my business.  But this
		proposition of yours is too risky.
		All the people in my family lived
		well the last ten years, I won't
		risk that out of greed.

				SOLLOZZO
		Are you worried about security for
		your million?

				DON CORLEONE
		No.

				SOLLOZZO
		The Tattaglias will guarantee your
		investment also.

	This startles SONNY; he blurts out.

				SONNY
		The Tattaglia family guarantees our
		investment?

	SOLLOZZO hears him first, and then very slowly turns to face
	him.  Everyone is the room knows that SONNY has stepped out
	of line.

				DON CORLEONE
		Young people are greedy, and they
		have no manners.  They speak when
		they should listen.  But I have a
		sentimental weakness for my
		children, and I've spoiled them, as
		you see.  But Signor Sollozzo, my
		no is final.

	SOLLOZZO nods, understands that this is the dismissal.  He
	glances one last time at SONNY.  He rises; all the others do
	as well.  He bows to the DON, shakes his hand, and formally
	takes his leave.  When the footsteps can no longer be heard:

	The DON turns to SONNY.

				DON CORLEONE
		Santino, never let anyone outside
		the family know what you are
		thinking.  I think your brain is
		going soft from all that comedy you
		play with that young girl.

	TWO OFFICE WORKERS are carrying an enormous floral display
	with the word "THANK YOU" spelled out in flowers.

				DON CORLEONE
		What is this nonsense?

				HAGEN
		It's from Johnny.  It was announced
		this morning.  He's going to play
		the lead in the new Woltz Brothers
		film.

	INT DAY: WOLTZ'S BEDROOM (SUMMER 1945)

	It is large, dominated by a huge bed, in which a man,
	presumably WOLTZ, is sleeping.  Soft light bathes the room
	from the large windows.  We move closer to him until we see
	his face, and recognize JACK WOLTZ.  He turns uncomfortably;
	mutters, feels something strange in his bedsheets.  Something
	wet.

	He wakens, feels the sheets with displeasure; they are wet.
	He looks at his hand; the wetness is blood.  He is
	frightened, pulls aside the covers, and sees fresh blood on
	his sheets and pajamas.  He grunts, pulls the puddle of
	blood in his bed.  He feels his own body frantically,
	moving, down, following the blood, until he is face to face
	with the great severed head of Khartoum lying at the foot of
	his bed.  Just blood from the hacked neck.  White reedy
	tendons show.  He struggles up to his elbows in the puddle
	of blood to see more clearly.  Froth covers the muzzle, and
	the enormous eyes of the animal are yellowed and covered
	with blood.

	WOLTZ tries to scream; but cannot.  No sound comes out.
	Then, finally and suddenly an ear-splitting scream of pure
	terror escapes from WOLTZ, who is rocking on his hands and
	knees in an uncontrolled fit, blood all over him.

	INT DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICES (SUMMER 1945)

	CLOSE VIEW on the GODFATHER.  Nodding.

				DON CORLEONE
		Send Johnny my congratulations.

	----------------------------------------FADE OUT--------

	(SCENES 12 & 12 OMITTED)

	FADE IN:

	EXT DAY: FIFTH AVENUE (WINTER 1945)

	Fifth Avenue in the snow.  Christmas week.  People are
	bundled up with rosy faces, rushing to buy presents.

	KAY and MICHAEL exit a Fifth Avenue department store,
	carrying a stack of gaily wrapped gifts, arm in arm.

				KAY
		We have something for your mother,
		for Sonny, we have the tie for
		Fredo and Tom Hagen gets the
		Reynolds pen...

				MICHAEL
		And what do you want for Christmas?

				KAY
		Just you.

	They kiss.

	INT DAY: HOTEL ROOM (WINTER 1945)

	CLOSE ON a wooden radio, playing quiet Music.  THE VIEW PANS
	AROUND the dark hotel room, curtained against the daylight.

				MICHAEL (O.S.)
		We'll have a quiet, civil ceremony
		at the City Hall, no big fuss, no
		family, just a couple of friends as
		witnesses.

	The two are in each other's arms in a mess of bedsheets on
	the two single beds that they have pushed together.

				KAY
		What will your father say?

				MICHAEL
		As long as I tell him beforehand he
		won't object.  He'll be hurt, but
		he won't object.

				KAY
		What time do they expect us?

				MICHAEL
		For dinner.  Unless I call and tell
		them we're still in New Hampshire.

				KAY
		Michael.

				MICHAEL
		Then we can have dinner, see a
		show, and spend one more night.

	He moves to the telephone.

				MICHAEL (CONT'D.)
		Operator.  Get me
			  (fill in number)


				KAY
		Michael, what are you doing?

				MICHAEL
		Shhh, you be the long distance
		operator.  Here.

				KAY
		Hello...this is Long Distance.  I
		have a call from New Hampshire.  Mr.
		Michael Corleone.  One moment please.

	She hands the phone to MICHAEL who continues the deception.

				MICHAEL
		Hello, Tom?  Michael.  Yeah...
		listen, we haven't left yet.  I'm
		driving down to the city with Kay
		tomorrow morning.  There's something
		important I want to tell the old
		man before Christmas.  Will he be
		home tomorrow night?

	INT DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

	HAGEN in the Olive Oil Company office.  In the background,
	through the glass partitions, we can see the DON, at work in
	his office.  TOM is tired, and steeped in paperwork.

				HAGEN (O.S.)
		Sure.  Anything I can do for you.

				MICHAEL (O.S.)
		No.  I guess I'll see you Christmas.
		Everyone's going to be out at Long
		Beach, right?

				HAGEN
		Right.

	He smiles.  MICHAEL has hung up.  He looks at the piles of
	work, and can't face it.  He rises, puts on his coat and
	hat, and continues out.

	He peeks into the DON's office.

				HAGEN
		Michael called; he's not leaving
		New Hampshire until tomorrow
		morning.  I've got to go, I promised
		Theresa I'd pick up some toys for
		the kids.

	The DON smiles and nods.

	TOM smiles, and leaves; OUR VIEW remaining with DON CORLEONE.
	FREDDIE is sitting on a bench in the corner, reading the
	afternoon paper.  He puts aside the papers the office
	manager has prepared for him, and then moves to FREDDIE,
	raps his knuckles on his head to take his nose out of the
	paper.

				DON CORLEONE
		Tell Paulie to get the car from the
		lot; I'll be ready to go home in a
		few minutes.

				FREDO
		I'll have to get it myself; Paulie
		called in sick this morning.

				DON CORLEONE
		That's the third time this month.
		I think maybe you'd better get a
		healthier bodyguard for me.  Tell
		Tom.

				FREDO
			  (going)
		Paulie's a good kid.  If he's sick,
		he's sick.  I don't mind getting
		the car.

	FREDDIE leaves.  He slowly puts on his jacket.  Looks out
	his window.

	EXT DUSK: OLIVE OIL CO. (WINTER 1945)

	FREDDIE crosses the street.

	INT DUSK: OLIVE OIL OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

				OFFICE MANAGER
		Buon Watale, Don Corleone.

	The MANAGER helps him on with his overcoat.  Once again, the
	DON glances out his window.

	The black car pulls up; FREDDIE driving.

				DON CORLEONE
		Merry Christmas.
			  (handing the MANAGER
			  an envelope)


	And he starts down the stairs.

	EXT DUSK: OLIVE OIL CO. (WINTER 1945)

	The light outside is very cold, and beginning to fail.  When
	FREDDIE sees his FATHER coming, he moves back into the
	driver's seat.  The DON moves to the car, and is about to
	get in when he hesitates, and turns back to the long, open
	fruit stand near the corner.

	The PROPRIETOR springs to serve him.  The DON walks among
	the trays and baskets, and merely points to a particular
	piece of fruit.  As he selects, the MAN gingerly picks the
	pieces of fruit up and puts them into a paper bag.  The DON
	pays with a five dollar bill, waits for his change, and then
	turns back to the car.

	EXT DUSK: POLKS TOY STORE (WINTER 1945)

	TOM HAGEN exits carrying a stack of presents, all gift
	wrapped.  He continues past the windows.  As he walks,
	someone walks right in his way.  He looks up.  It is SOLLOZZO.

	He takes TOM by the arm and walks along with him.

				SOLLOZZO
			  (quietly)
		Don't be frightened.  I just want
		to talk to you.

	A car parked at the curb suddenly flings its rear door open.

				SOLLOZZO
			  (urgently)
		Get in; I want to talk to you.

	HAGEN pulls his arm free.  He is frightened.

				HAGEN
		I haven't got time.

	TWO MEN suddenly appear on either side of him.

				SOLLOZZO
		Get in the car.  If I wanted to
		kill you you'd be dead already.
		Trust me.

	HAGEN, sick to his stomach, moves with his ESCORTS, leaving
	our VIEW on the Mechanical windows gaily bobbing the story
	of Hansel and Gretel.  We HEAR the car doors shut, and the
	car drive off.

	EXT NIGHT: RADIO CITY - PHONE BOOTH (WINTER 1945)

	RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL during the Christmas show.  KAY and
	MICHAEL exit; tears are still streaming down her cheeks, and
	she sniffles, and dries her tears with Kleenex.  KAY
	nostalgically hums "The Bells of Saint Mary's," as they walk
	arm in arm.

				KAY
		Would you like me better if I were
		a nun?

				MICHAEL
		No.

				KAY
		Would you like me better if I were
		Ingrid Bergman?

	They have passed a little enclosed newsstand.  KAY sees
	something that terrifies her.  She doesn't know what to do.
	MICHAEL still walks, thinking about her question.

				KAY
			  (a little voice)
		Michael?

				MICHAEL
		I'm thinking about it.

				KAY
		Michael...

				MICHAEL
		No, I would not like you better if
		you were Ingrid Bergman.

	She cannot answer him.  Rather she pulls him by the arm,
	back to the newsstand, and points.  His face goes grave.

	The headlines read: "VITO CORLEONE SHOT, CHIEFTAN GUNNED
	DOWN."

	MICHAEL is petrified; quickly he takes each edition, drops a
	dollar in the tray, and hungrily reads through them.  KAY
	knows to remain silent.

				MICHAEL
			  (desperately)
		They don't say if he's dead or alive.

	EXT DUSK: OLIVE OIL CO. (WINTER 1945)

	DON CORLEONE by the fruit stand; he is about to move to the
	car, when TWO MEN step from the corner.  Suddenly, the DON
	drops the bag of fruit and darts with startling quickness
	toward the parked car.

				DON CORLEONE
		Fredo, Fredo!

	The paper bag has hit the ground, and the fruit begins
	rolling along the sidewalk, as we HEAR gunshots.

	Five bullets catch the DON in the back; he arches in pain,
	and continues toward the car.

	The PROPRIETOR of the fruit stand rushes for cover, knocking
	over an entire case of fruit.

	The TWO GUNMEN move in quickly, anxious to finish him off.

	Their feet careful to avoid the rolling fruit.  There are
	more GUNSHOTS.

	FREDDIE is hysterical; he tries to get out of the car;
	having difficulty opening the door.  He rushes out, a gun
	trembling in his hand; his mouth open.  He actually drops
	the gun.

	The gun falls amid the rolling fruit.

	The GUNMEN are panicked.  They fire once more at the downed
	DON CORLEONE.  His leg and arm twitch where they are hit;
	and pools of blood are beginning to form.

	The GUNMEN are obviously in a state of panic and confusion;
	they disappear around the corner as quickly as they came.

	The PEOPLE about the avenue have all but disappeared:
	rather, we catch glimpses of them, poking their heads safely
	from around corners, inside doorways and arches, and from
	windows.  But the street itself is now empty.

	FREDDIE is in shock; he looks at his FATHER; now great
	puddles of blood have formed, and the DON is lifeless and
	face down in them.

	FREDDIE falls back on to the curb and sits there, saying
	something we cannot understand.  He begins to weep profusely.

	INT NIGHT: SUBWAY (WINTER 1945)

	LUCA BRASI riding alone on a subway car, late at night.  He
	gets off.

	He emerges at a subway terminal, proceeds out.

	EXT NITE: NIGHT CLUB STREET (WINTER 1945)

	LUCA walks down the late night street.  He approaches an
	elegant New York Nightclub, whose gaudy neon sign is still
	winking this late at night.  He waits and watches.  Then the
	sign goes out; and he proceeds into the club.

	INT NITE: NIGHTCLUB (WINTER 1945)

	The main floor of the Nightclub is very large, with endless
	glistening wooden floors.  Now, at this late time, the
	chairs have been stacked on the tables and a NEGRO JANITOR
	is waxing them.  A single HAT-CHECK GIRL is counting her
	receipts.  LUCA moves past the empty bandstand, and sits at
	the bar.  ANOTHER MAN, dark and very well-built, moves
	behind the bar.

				MAN
		Luca...I'm Bruno Tattaglia.

				LUCA
		I know.

	LUCA looks up; and out of the shadows emerges SOLLOZZO.

				SOLLOZZO
		Do you know who I am?

	LUCA Nods.

				SOLLOZZO
		You've been talking to the
		Tattaglias.  They thought we could
		do business.

	LUCA listens.

				SOLLOZZO
		I need somebody strong to protect
		my operation, physically.  I've
		heard you're not happy with your
		family, you might make a switch.

				LUCA
		If the money is good enough.

				SOLLOZZO
		On the first shipment, I can
		guarantee you fifty thousand dollars.

	LUCA looks at him; he had no idea the offer would be so good.

	SOLLOZZO extends his hand, but LUCA pretends not to see it,
	rather, he busies himself putting a cigarette in his mouth.
	BRUNO TATTAGLIA, behind the bar, makes a cigarette lighter
	magically appear, and holds it to LUCA's cigarette.  Then,
	he does an odd thing; he drops the lighter on the bar, and
	puts his hand lightly on LUCA's, almost patting it.

	INT NITE: SONNY'S LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)

	The telephone in SONNY's house is ringing.  He approaches
	it, obviously fresh from a nap.

				SONNY
		Yeah.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Do you recognize my voice?

				SONNY
		I think so.  Detective squad?

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Right.  Don't say my name, just
		listen.  Somebody shot your father
		outside his place fifteen minutes
		ago.

				SONNY
		Is he alive?

				VOICE (O.S.)
		I think so, but I can't get close
		enough.  There's a lot of blood.
		I'll try to find out more.

				SONNY
		Find out anything you can...you got
		a Grand coming.
			  (click)


	SONNY cradles the phone.  An incredible rage builds up in
	him, his face actually turning red.  He would like to rip
	the phone to pieces in his bare hands.  Then he controls it.
	Quickly, he dials another number.

				SONNY
		Theresa, let me talk to Tom.  Not
		yet?  Have him call me as soon as
		he gets home.

	He hangs up.

				SANDRA (O.S.)
		Sonny?  Sonny, who is it?
			  (she enters the room)
		What is it?

				SONNY
			  (calmly)
		They shot the old man.

				SANDRA
		Oh God...

				SONNY
		Honey...don't worry.  Nothing else
		is going to happen.

	There is a POUNDING on the door.  A BABY starts crying.

				SANDRA
			  (really frightened)
		SONNY?

	SONNY reaches into a cabinet drawer, takes out a gun, and
	moves quickly.  He opens the front door quickly.  It is
	CLEMENZA.  He enters, SONNY closes the door.  SANDRA goes to
	look after the baby.

				CLEMENZA
			  (excited)
		You heard about your father?

				SONNY
		Yeah.

				CLEMENZA
		The word is out in the streets that
		he's dead.

				SONNY
		Where the hell was Paulie, why
		wasn't he with the Don?

				CLEMENZA
		Paulie's been a little sick all
		winter...he was home.

				SONNY
		How many times did he stay home the
		last couple of months?

				CLEMENZA
		Maybe three, four times.  I always
		asked Freddie if he wanted another
		bodyguard, but he said no.  Things
		have been so smooth the last ten
		years...

				SONNY
		Go get Paulie, I don't care how
		sick he is.  Pick him up yourself,
		and bring him to my father's house.

				CLEMENZA
		That's all?  Don't you want me to
		send some people over here?

				SONNY
		No, just you and Paulie.

	CLEMENZA leaves; SONNY moves to SANDRA, who sits on the
	couch weeping quietly, comforting her BABY.

				SONNY
		A couple of our people will come to
		stay here.  Do whatever they say;
		I'm going over to the main house.
		If you want me, use Pop's special
		phone.

	The telephone rings again.  SONNY answers it.

				SONNY
		Hello.

				SOLLOZZO (O.S.)
		Santino Corleone?

	SANDRA moves behind him, anxious to know who it is.  SONNY
	indicates that she be quiet.

				SONNY
		Yeah.

				SOLLOZZO (O.S.)
		We have Tom Hagen.  In about three
		hours he'll be released with our
		proposition.  Don't do anything
		until you've heard what he has to
		say.  You can only cause a lot of
		trouble.  What's done is done.
			  (a pause)
		Don't lose that famous temper of
		yours.

				SONNY
			  (quietly)
		I'll wait.

	EXT NITE: MALL (WINTER 1945)

	FULL VIEW OF THE CORLEONE MALL.  It is night, but the
	courtyard is bathed with white light from floodlights on the
	tops of all the houses.  It is very cold.  We see the figure
	of SONNY cross the Mall, and let himself into the main house.

	INT NITE: DON'S KITCHEN (WINTER 1945)

	SONNY walks into the empty, darkened house.  Then he calls
	out.

				SONNY
		Ma?  Ma, where are you.

	The kitchen door swings open.  He moves quickly and takes
	her by the arm.  He is deliberately calm.

				SONNY
		Ma, I just got a call.  Pop's
		hurt...I don't know how bad.

				MAMA
			  (quietly)
		Santino?  Have they killed him?

				SONNY
			  (almost in tears)
		We don't know yet, Ma.

				MAMA
		I'll get dressed.  In case we can
		see him...

	She moves out of the kitchen, and continues upstairs.  SONNY
	turns the gas from the pan of peppers she was frying.  He
	takes some bread without thinking, and dips it in the oil,
	and sloppily eats some of the peppers, as he moves into his
	father's office.

	INT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

	He switches the lights on in the DON's office.  The massive
	desk dominates the room.  SONNY moves quickly to the
	telephone, pulling a small chair to the side of the desk,
	and dials a number.

				SONNY
		Tessio...This is Santino Corleone.
		I want fifty reliable men out here.

				TESSIO (O.S.)
		I heard, Sonny...but what about
		Clemenza's regime?

				SONNY
		I don't want to use Clemenza's
		people right now.  Understood?

	He hangs up.  He moves quickly to a wall safe; operates the
	dial, and removes a small notebook.  He takes it back to the
	desk, and runs over the list of numbers with his forefinger.
	We follow the names, until the finger stops at one: LUCA
	BRASI.  SONNY dials the number.  There is no answer.

				SONNY
		Luca.

	INT NITE: BUILDING (WINTER 1945)

	The interior of an abandoned building.  SEVERAL MEN in suits
	and ties sit around in the booths.

	HAGEN sits in one: SOLLOZZO sits across from him.

				SOLLOZZO
		I know you're not in the muscle end
		of the family--so I don't want you
		to be afraid.  I want you to help
		the Corleones and I want you to
		help me.

	HAGEN's hands are trembling as he tries to put a cigarette
	in his mouth.  ONE of the BUTTON MEN brings a bottle of rye
	to the table, and pours a little into a delicate, flowered
	china cup.  HAGEN sips gratefully.

				SOLLOZZO
		Your boss is dead...

	HAGEN is overwhelmed: actual tears spring to his eyes.
	SOLLOZZO pauses respectfully.

				SOLLOZZO
			  (pushing the bottle)
		Have some more.  We got him outside
		his office, just before I picked
		you up.  You have to make the peace
		between me and Santino.

	HAGEN still is focused on the grief of losing the old man.

				SOLLOZZO
		Sonny was hot for my deal, right?
		You know it's the smart thing to
		do, too.  I want you to talk Sonny
		into it.

				HAGEN
			  (pulling himself together)
		Sonny will come after you with
		everything he's got.

	SOLLOZZO rises, impatiently.

				SOLLOZZO
		That's going to be his first
		reaction.  You have to talk some
		sense into him.  The Tattaglia
		family stands behind me with all
		their people.  The other New York
		Families will go along with anything
		that prevents a full scale war.

	He leans close to HAGEN.

				SOLLOZZO
		The Don was slipping; in the old
		days I could never have gotten to
		him.  Now he's dead, nothing can
		bring him back.  Talk to Sonny,
		talk to the Caporegimes, Clemenza
		and Tessio...it's good business.

				HAGEN
		Even Sonny won't be able to call
		off Luca Brasi.

				SOLLOZZO
		I'll worry about Luca.  You take
		care of Sonny and the other two kids.

				HAGEN
		I'll try...It's what the Don would
		want us to do.

				SOLLOZZO
			  (lifting his hands in
			  an expression of harmlessness)
		Good...then you can go...
			  (he escorts him to
			  the door)
		I don't like violence.  I'm a
		businessman, and blood is a big
		expense.

	He opens the door; they step out together.

	EXT NITE: BUILDING

	HAGEN, SOLLOZZO exit.

	But a car pulls up, and ONE of SOLLOZZO'S MEN rushes out.
	He indicates with some urgency that he wants to talk to
	SOLLOZZO in private.

	Then SOLLOZZO moves with a grave expression.  He opens the
	door, indicating that HAGEN should be led back in.

				SOLLOZZO
		The old man is still alive.  Five
		bullets in his Sicilian hide and
		he's still alive.
			  (he gives a fatalistic
			  shrug)
		Bad luck for me, bad luck for you.

	EXT NITE: MALL (WINTER 1945)

	MICHAEL driving during the night.  There is a little fog in
	the air, and moisture has formed on the windshield, making
	it difficult to see well.  The wipers move across the view,
	as the gate of the Corleone Mall appears before us, still
	decorated for Christmas.  The courtyard is bathed with white
	floodlight, giving this place a cold and isolated look.  The
	narrow entrance mouth of the Mall is sealed off with a link
	chain.  There are strange cars parked along the curving
	cement walk.  SEVERAL MEN are congregated about the gate and
	chain; ONE of them approaches MICHAEL's car.

				MAN
		Who're you?

	ANOTHER peeks his ugly face almost right up to MICHAEL, and
	then turns.

				MAN 2
		It's the Don's kid; take the car,
		I'll bring him inside.

	The FIRST MAN opens the car door, and MICHAEL steps out.

	INT NITE: HALL (WINTER 1945)

	The Hallway of the main house is filled with MEN MICHAEL
	doesn't recognize.  They pay little attention to him.  Most
	of them are waiting; sitting uncomfortably; no one is talking.

	INT NITE: DON'S LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)

	MICHAEL moves into the living room; there is a Christmas
	tree, and countless greeting cards taped to the walls.

	THERESA HAGEN is sitting stiffly on the sofa, smoking a
	cigarette; on the coffee table in front of her is a water
	glass half filled with whiskey.  On the other side of the
	sofa sits CLEMENZA; his face is impassive, but he is
	sweating, and the cigar in his hand glistens slickly black
	with his saliva.  PAULIE GATTO sits tensely and alone on the
	other side of the room.  CLEMENZA sees MICHAEL, looks up at
	him.

				CLEMENZA
		Your mother's at the hospital with
		the old man: He's gonna pull through.

	MICHAEL nods his relief.

				MICHAEL
		Thanks.

	He moves to THERESA.

				MICHAEL
			  (gently)
		You heard from Tom yet?

	Without looking up, she clings to him for a moment, and
	trembles.  Occasionally, STRANGE MEN will cross through the
	room; everyone speaks in a whisper.

				MICHAEL
			  (taking her hand)
		C'mon.

	He leads her into his father's office without knocking.

	INT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

	SONNY and TESSIO are huddled around a yellow pad.  They look
	up, startled.

				SONNY
		Don't worry, Theresa; they just
		want to give Tom the proposition,
		then they're going to turn him loose.

	He reassuringly hugs THERESA, and then to MICHAEL's surprise,
	he kisses him on the cheek.

				SONNY
		I was worried when we couldn't get
		in touch with you in that hick town.

				MICHAEL
		How's Mom?

				SONNY
		Good.  She's been through it before.
		Me too.  You were too young to know
		about it.  You better wait outside;
		there're some things you shouldn't
		hear.

				MICHAEL
		I can help you out...

				SONNY
		Oh no you can't, the old man'd be
		sore as hell if I let you get mixed
		up in this.

				MICHAEL
		Jesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny.

				SONNY
		Theresa.

	She understands, and leaves them alone.

				SONNY
		All right, Mikey...who do we have
		to hit, Clemenza or Paulie?

				MICHAEL
		What?

				SONNY
		One of them fingered the old man.

	MICHAEL didn't realize that the men waiting outside were on
	trial for their lives.

				MICHAEL
		Clemenza?  No, I don't believe it.

				SONNY
		You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay.
		It was Paulie.

				MICHAEL
		How can you be sure?

				SONNY
		On the three days Paulie was sick
		this month, he got calls from a
		payphone across from the old man's
		building.  We got people in the
		phone company.
			  (he shrugs)
		Thank God it was Paulie...we'll
		need Clemenza bad.

	MICHAEL is just realizing the gravity and extent of the
	situation.

				MICHAEL
		Is it going to be all-out war, like
		last time?

				SONNY
		Until the old man tells me different.

				MICHAEL
		Then wait, Sonny.  Talk to Pop.

				SONNY
		Sollozzo is a dead man, I don't
		care what it costs.  I don't care
		if we have to fight all the five
		families in New York.  The Tattaglia
		family's going to eat dirt.  I
		don't care if we all go down
		together.

				MICHAEL
			  (softly)
		That's not how Pop would have
		played it.

				SONNY
		I know I'm not the man he was.  But
		I'll tell you this and he'll tell
		you too.  When it comes to real
		action, I can operate as good as
		anybody short range.

				MICHAEL
			  (calmly)
		All right, Sonny.  All right.

				SONNY
		Christ, if I could only contact Luca.

				MICHAEL
		Is it like they say?  Is he that
		good?

	Outside, we HEAR THERESA cry out, almost a scream of relief.
	Then open the door and rush out.

	Everyone is standing: in the doorway, TOM HAGEN is wrapped
	in a tight embrace with his WIFE.

				HAGEN
		If I plead before the Supreme
		Court, I'll never do better than I
		did tonight with that Turk.

	EXT NITE: MALL, FEATURING DON'S HOUSE (WINTER 1945)

	The windows of the main house are dark except for the DON's
	study.  It stands out against the cold, dark night.

	INT NITE: DON'S LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)

	The living room is empty, save for PAULIE GATTO sitting on
	the edge of the sofa.  The clock reads: 4:00 a.m.

	INT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

	SONNY, MICHAEL, HAGEN, CLEMENZA and TESSIO; all exhausted,
	in shirtsleeves, about to fall asleep.  It is four in the
	morning; there is evidence of many cups of coffee and many
	snacks.  They can barely talk anymore.

				HAGEN
		Is the hospital covered?

				SONNY
		The cops have it locked in and I
		got my people there visiting Pop
		all the time.  What about the hit
		list.

	HAGEN widens his sleepy eyes, and looks at the yellow pad.

				HAGEN
		Too much, too far, too personal.
		The Don would consider this all
		purely a business dispute: Get rid
		of Sollozzo, and everything falls
		in line.  YOU don't have to go
		after the Tattaglias.

	CLEMENZA nods.

				HAGEN
		What about Luca?  Sollozzo didn't
		seem worried about Luca.  That
		worries me.

				SONNY
		If Luca sold out we're in real
		trouble.

				HAGEN
		Has anyone been able to get in
		touch with him?

				SONNY
		No, and I've been calling all night.
		Maybe he's shacked up.

				HAGEN
		Luca never sleeps over with a broad.
		He always goes home when he's
		through.  Mike, keep ringing Luca's
		number.

	MICHAEL, very tired, picks up the phone, and dials the
	number once again.  He can hear the phone ringing on the
	other end but no one answers.  Then hangs up.

				HAGEN
		Keep trying every fifteen minutes.
			  (exhausted)


				SONNY
		Tom, you're the Consigliere, what
		do we do if the old man dies?

				HAGEN
		Without your father's political
		contacts and personal influence,
		the Corleone family loses half its
		strength.  Without your father, the
		other New York families might wind
		up supporting Sollozzo, and the
		Tattaglias just to make sure there
		isn't a long destructive war.  The
		old days are over, this is 1946;
		nobody wants bloodshed anymore.  If
		your father dies...make the deal,
		Sonny.

				SONNY
			  (angry)
		That's easy to say; it's not your
		father.

				HAGEN
			  (quietly)
		I was as good a son to him as you
		or Mike.

				SONNY
		Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it
		that way.

				HAGEN
		We're all tired...

				SONNY
		OK, we sit tight until the old man
		can give us the lead.  But Tom, I
		want you to stay inside the Mall.
		You too, Mike, no chances.  Tessio,
		you hold your people in reserve,
		but have them nosing around the
		city.  The hospital is yours; I
		want it tight, fool-proof, 24 hours
		a day.

	There is a timid knock on the door.

				SONNY
		What is it?

	PAULIE GATTO looks in.

				CLEMENZA
		I tol' you to stay put, Paulie...

				PAULIE
		The guy at the gate's outside...says
		there's a package...

				SONNY
		Tessio, see what it is.

	TESSIO gets up, leaves.

				PAULIE
		You want me to hang around?

				SONNY
		Yeah.  Hang around.

				PAULIE
		Outside?

				CLEMENZA
		Outside.

				PAULIE
		Sure.

	He closes the door.

				SONNY
		Clemenza.  You take care of Paulie.
		I don't ever want to see him again.
		Understood?

				CLEMENZA
		Understood.

				SONNY
		Okay, now you can move your men
		into the Mall, replace Tessio's
		people.  Mike, tomorrow you take a
		couple of Clemenza's people and go
		to Luca's apartment and wait for
		him to show.  That crazy bastard
		might be going after Sollozzo right
		now if he's heard the news.

				HAGEN
		Maybe Mike shouldn't get mixed up
		in this so directly.  You know the
		old man doesn't want that.

				SONNY
		OK forget it, just stay on the phone.

	MICHAEL is embarrassed to be so protected.  He dials Luca
	Brasi's number once again.  The ring repeats, but no one
	answers.

	TESSIO comes back, carrying Luca Brasi's bullet-proof vest
	in his hand.  He unwraps it; there is a large fish wrapped
	inside.

				CLEMENZA
		A Sicilian message: Luca Brasi
		sleeps with the fishes.

	INT. NITE: NIGHTCLUB (WINTER 1945)

	LUCA sits at the Bar of the Tattaglia Nightclub, as we
	remember him.  BRUNO TATTAGLIA had just patted his hand.
	LUCA looks up at him.

	Then SOLLOZZO pats the other hand, almost affectionately.
	LUCA is just about to twist his hands away, when they both
	clamp down as hard as they can.  Suddenly, a garrote is
	thrown around his neck, and pulled violently tight.  His
	face begins to turn to purple blotches, and then totally
	purple, right before our eyes; his tongue hangs out, in a
	far more extreme way than a normal tongue could.  His eyes
	bulge.

	ONE of the MEN looks down at him in disgust as LUCA's
	strength leaves him.

				BRUNO
			  (making an ugly face)
		Oh Christ...all over the floor.

	SOLLOZZO lets LUCA's hand go with a victorious smile on his
	face.

	LUCA falls to the floor.

				SOLLOZZO
		The Godfather is next.

	----------------------------------------FADE OUT--------

	FADE IN:

	EXT DAY: CLEMENZA'S HOUSE (WINTER 1945)

	Morning in a simple Brooklyn suburb.  There are rows of
	pleasant houses; driveway after driveway, down the block.  A
	dark, somber young man of thirty-one or two walks with a
	noticeable limp down the sidewalk, and rings the bell.  This
	is ROCCO LAMPONE.  The woman of the house, MRS. CLEMENZA,
	talks to him through the screen door, and then points to the
	side of the house.  ROCCO moves to the garage, which is
	specially heated, and in which CLEMENZA is busy at work
	washing a shiny brand new Lincoln.  LAMPONE admires the car.

				LAMPONE
		Nice.

				CLEMENZA
		Crazy Detroit delivered it with a
		wooden bumper.  They're going to
		send me the chrome bumpers in a
		couple months.  I waited two years
		for this car to come with wooden
		bumpers!

	He scrubs and polishes with great affection.

				CLEMENZA
		Today you make your bones on Paulie.
		You understand everything?

				LAMPONE
		Sure.

	As he scrubs around the glove compartment, he opens it,
	unwraps a gun and gives it to LAMPONE.

				CLEMENZA
		.22 soft-nosed load.  Accurate up
		to five feet.

	LAMPONE expertly puts the gun away.  GATTO's car pulls into
	the driveway, and he sounds the horn.

	The two men walk to the car.  GATTO is driving, a bit
	nervous, like he doesn't know what is up.  LAMPONE gets in
	the rear seat; CLEMENZA in the front, making a grunt of
	recognition.  He looks at his wristwatch, as though wanting
	to chide PAULIE for being late.  PAULIE flinches a little
	when he sees LAMPONE will ride behind him; he half turns:

				PAULIE
		Rocco, sit on the other side.  A
		big guy like you blocks my rearview
		mirror.

	CLEMENZA turns sourly to PAULIE.

				CLEMENZA
		Goddamn Sonny.  He's running scared.
		He's already thinking of going to
		the mattresses.  We have to find a
		place on the West Side.  Paulie,
		you know a good location?

	PAULIE relaxes a bit; he thinks he's off any possible hook
	he was on.  Also there's the money he can make by selling
	Sollozzo any secret location.

				PAULIE
		I'll think about it.

				CLEMENZA
			  (grunting)
		Drive while you thinking; I wanna
		get to the City this month!

	The car pulls out.

	EXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR - ON ROAD (WINTER 1945)

	Inside PAULIE drives; and CLEMENZA sits in a grump.  OUR
	VIEW does not show LAMPONE in the rear seat.

	EXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR AT TUNNEL (WINTER 1945)

	The Car crosses to the Midtown Tunnel in the late Winter
	light.

	INT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR IN TUNNEL (WINTER 1945)

	Inside the tunnel; GATTO doesn't like not seeing LAMPONE.
	He tries to adjust his rearview mirror to catch a glimpse of
	him.

				CLEMENZA
		Pay attention!

	EXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR AT MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)

	The car is parked in the City.  PAULIE comes down from an
	available apartment and gets back into the car.

				PAULIE
		Good for ten men...

				CLEMENZA
		OK, go to Arthur Avenue; I'm
		suppose to call when I found
		somethin'.

	The car pulls off.

	EXT DAY: RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)

	New part of the city; the car pulls up in a parking lot.
	CLEMENZA get outs, glances at LAMPONE, then to PAULIE.

				CLEMENZA
		You wait; I'll call.

	He walks, tucking his shirt into his pants, around the
	corner and enters the Luna Restaurant.

	INT DAY: RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)

	CLEMENZA enters the little restaurant, sits down at a table.
	The WAITERS know him; immediately put a bottle of wine, some
	bread--and then a plate of veal on his table.  He eats.

	EXT DAY: RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)

	CLEMENZA exits the restaurant, belches, adjusts his pants;
	he is well fed.

	We move with him around the corner, not knowing what to
	expect has happened to Paulie.

	There is the car; PAULIE is still sitting behind the wheel,
	LAMPONE in the rear seat.  CLEMENZA steps in.

				CLEMENZA
		He talked my ear off.  Want us to
		go back to Long Beach; have another
		job for us.  Rocco, you live in the
		City, can we drop you off?

				LAMPONE (O.S.)
		Ah, I left my car at your place.

				CLEMENZA
		OK, then you gotta come back.

	The car pulls out.  By now, PAULIE is completely relaxed and
	secure.

				PAULIE
		You think we'll go for that last
		place?

				CLEMENZA
		Maybe, or you gotta know now.

				PAULIE
		Holy cow, I don't gotta know nothing.

	EXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR ON CAUSEWAY (WINTER 1945)

	The car moves along the ready beach area of the causeway.
	Inside, CLEMENZA turns to PAULIE.

				CLEMENZA
		Paulie, pull over.  I gotta take a
		leak.

	The car pulls off the Causeway, into the reeds.  CLEMENZA
	steps out of the car, OUR VIEW MOVING with him.

	He turns his back three quarters from us (we can no longer
	see the car), unzips, and we hear the sound of urine hitting
	the ground.  We wait on this for a moment; and then there
	are two GUNSHOTS.  CLEMENZA finishes his leak, zips up and
	turns, moving back to the car.

	PAULIE is dead, bleeding from the mouth; the windows behind
	him are shattered.

				CLEMENZA
		Leave the gun.

	LAMPONE gets out, the two men walk through the reeds a few
	feet where there is another car.  They get in, and drive off.

	---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

	EXT DAY: MALL (WINTER 1945)

	HIGH ANGLE OF THE MALL.  It is late afternoon.  Many strange
	cars are parked on the nearby streets.  We can see the group
	of BUTTON MEN, stationed here and there, obviously sentries
	with concealed weapons.

	MICHAEL walks along in the rear yard.

	He is bundled in a warm marine coat.  He looks at the
	strange men, regarding them with an uncertain awe.  They
	look back at him, at first suspiciously and then with the
	respect of his position.  He is like an exile Prince.  He
	wanders past them, and hesitates and looks at the yard.

	A rusted set of garden swings; and other home playground
	equipment.  The basketball ring now half coming off.  This
	is where he was a child.  Then a shout.

				CLEMENZA (O.S.)
		Mike.  Hey Mikey; telephone.

	CLEMENZA had shouted from the kitchen window.  MICHAEL
	hurries into the house.

	INT DAY: DON'S KITCHEN (WINTER 1945)

	CLEMENZA is in the kitchen, cooking over an enormous pot.
	He points to the kitchen wall phone which is hanging off the
	hook.

				CLEMENZA
		Some dame.

	MICHAEL picks it up.

				MICHAEL
		Hello.  Kay?

				KAY (O.S.)
		How is your father?

				MICHAEL
		He'll be OK.

				KAY (O.S.)
			  (pause)
		I love you.

	He glances at the THUGS in the kitchen.  Tries to shield the
	phone.

				KAY (O.S.)
		I LOVE YOU.

				MICHAEL
		Yeah Kay, I'm here.

				KAY (O.S.)
		Can you say it?

				MICHAEL
		Huh?

				KAY (O.S.)
		Tell me you love me.

	MICHAEL glances at the HOODS at the kitchen table.  He curls
	up in a corner, and in a quarter voice:

				MICHAEL
		I can't...

				KAY (O.S.)
		Please say it.

				MICHAEL
		Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK?

				KAY (O.S.)
		OK.
			  (click)


	CLEMENZA is getting ready to build a tomato sauce for all
	the button men stationed around the house.

				CLEMENZA
		How come you don't tell that nice
		girl you love her...here, learn
		something... you may have to feed
		fifty guys some day.  You start
		with olive oil...fry some garlic,
		see.  And then fry some sausage...or meat
		balls if you like...then you throw
		in the tomatoes, the tomato
		paste...some basil; and a little
		red wine...that's my trick.

	SONNY peeks into the kitchen; sees CLEMENZA.

				SONNY
		You take care of Paulie?

				CLEMENZA
		You won't see Paulie anymore.  He's
		sick for good this winter.

	MICHAEL starts to leave.

				SONNY
		Where are you going?

				MICHAEL
		To the city.

				SONNY
			  (to Clemenza; dipping
			  bread into the sauce)
		Send some bodyguards.

				MICHAEL
		I don't need them, Sonny.  I'm just
		going to see Pop in the hospital.
		Also, I got other things.

				CLEMENZA
		Sollozzo knows Mike's a civilian.

				SONNY
		OK, but be careful.

	EXT NITE: CAR

	MICHAEL sits in the rear seat, calmly, as he is being driven
	into the city.  THREE BUTTONMEN are crowded into the front
	seat.

	INT NITE: HOTEL LOBBY

	MICHAEL crosses the lobby, past lines of servicemen trying
	to book rooms.

	INT NITE: HOTEL

	MICHAEL and KAY eating a quiet dinner at the hotel.  He is
	preoccupied, she's concerned.

				MICHAEL
		Visiting hour ends at eight thirty.
		I'll just sit with him; I want to
		show respect.

				KAY
		Can I go to the hospital with you?

				MICHAEL
		I don't think so.  You don't want
		to end up on page 3 of the Daily
		News.

				KAY
		My parents don't read the Daily
		News.  All right, if you think I
		shouldn't.  I can't believe the
		things the papers are printing.
		I'm sure most of it's not true.

				MICHAEL
		I don't think so either.
			  (silence)
		I better go.

				KAY
		When will I see you again?

				MICHAEL
		I want you to go back to New
		Hampshire...think things over.

	He leans over her; kisses her.

				KAY
		When will I see you again?

				MICHAEL
		Goodbye.

	Quietly, he moves out the door.

	KAY lies on the bed a while, and then, to herself:

				KAY
		Goodbye.

	EXT NITE: DON'S HOSPITAL (WINTER 1945)

	A taxi pulls up in front of a hospital, marked clearly with
	a neon sign "HOSPITAL--EMERGENCY."  MICHAEL steps out, pays
	the fare...and then stops dead in his tracks.

	MICHAEL looks.

	He sees the hospital in the night; but it is deserted.  He
	is the only one on the street.  There are gay, twinkling
	Christmas decorations all over the building.  He walks,
	slowly at first, and then ever so quickly, up the steps.  He
	hesitates, looks around.  This area is empty.  He checks the
	address on a scrap of paper.  It is correct.  He tries the
	door, it is empty.

	He walks in.

	INT NITE: HOSPITAL LOBBY (WINTER 1945)

	MICHAEL stands in the center of an absolutely empty hospital
	lobby.  He looks to the right; there is a long, empty
	corridor.  To the left: the same.

	HIGH FULL ANGLE, as MICHAEL walks through the desolated
	building lit by eerie green neon lighting.  All we hear are
	his sole footsteps.

	He walks up to a desk marked "INFORMATION".  No one is there.
	He moves quickly to a door marked "OFFICE"; swings into it;
	no one is there.  He looks onto the desk:  There is half a
	sandwich, and a half-filled bottle of coke.

				MICHAEL
		Hello?  Hello?

	Now he knows something is happening, he moves quickly,
	alertly.  MICHAEL walking down the hospital corridors; all
	alone.  The floors have just been mopped.  They are still wet.

	INT NITE: HOSPITAL STAIRS

	Now he turns onto a staircase; ever quickening; up several
	flights.

	INT NITE: 4TH FLOOR CORRIDOR

	He steps out onto the fourth floor.  He looks.  There are
	merely empty corridors.  He takes out his scrap of paper;
	checks it.  "Room 4A."  Now he hurries, trying to follow the
	code of hospital rooms; following the right arrows, quicker
	and quicker they flash by him.  Now he stops, looks up "4A--
	Corleone".

	There is a special card table set up there with some
	magazines...and some smoking cigarettes still in the
	ashtray--but no detectives, no police, no bodyguards.

	INT NITE: DON'S ROOM 4A

	Slowly he pushes the door open, almost afraid at what he
	will find.  He looks.  Lit by the moonlight through the
	window, he can see a FIGURE in the hospital bed alone in the
	room, and under a transparent oxygen tent.  All that can be
	heard is the steady though strained breathing.  Slowly
	MICHAEL walks up to it, and is relieved to see his FATHER,
	securely asleep.  Tubes hang from a steel gallows beside the
	bed, and run to his nose and mouth.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		What are you doing here?

	This startles MICHAEL; who almost jumps around.  It is a
	NURSE lit from the light behind her in the hallway.

				NURSE
		You're not supposed to be here now.

	MICHAEL calms himself, and moves to her.

				MICHAEL
		I'm Michael Corleone--this is my
		father.  What happened to the
		detectives who were guarding him?

				NURSE
		Oh your father just had too many
		visitors.  It interfered with the
		hospital service.  The police came
		and made them all leave just ten
		minutes ago.
			  (comfortingly)
		But don't worry.  I look in on him.

				MICHAEL
		You just stand here one minute...

	Quickly he moves to the telephone, dials a number.

				MICHAEL
		Sonny...Sonny--Jesus Christ, I'm
		down at the hospital.  I came down
		late.  There's no one here.  None
		of Tessio's people--no detectives,
		no one.  The old man is completely
		unprotected.

				SONNY (O.S.)
		All right, get him in a different
		room; lock the door from the inside.
		I'll have some men there inside of
		fifteen minutes.  Sit tight, and
		don't panic.

				MICHAEL
			  (furiously, but kept inside)
		I won't panic.

	He hangs up; returns to the NURSE...

				NURSE
		You cannot stay here...I'm sorry.

				MICHAEL
			  (coldly)
		You and I are going to move my
		father right now...to another room
		on another floor...Can you
		disconnect those tubes so we can
		wheel the bed out?

				NURSE
		Absolutely not!  We have to get
		permission from the Doctor.

				MICHAEL
		You've read about my father in the
		papers.  You've seen that no one's
		here to guard him.  Now I've just
		gotten word that men are coming to
		this hospital to kill him.  Believe
		me and help me.

				NURSE
			  (frightened)
		We don't have to disconnect them,
		we can wheel the stand with the bed.

	She does so...and they perform the very difficult task of
	moving the bed and the apparatus, out of the room.

	INT NITE: 4TH FLOOR HOSPITAL (WINTER 1945)

	They roll the bed, the stand, and all the tubes silently
	down the corridor.  We hear FOOTSTEPS coming up the stairs.
	MICHAEL hears them, stops.

				MICHAEL
		Hurry, into there.

	They push it into the first available room.  MICHAEL peeks
	out from the door.  The footsteps are louder; then they
	emerge.  It is ENZO, NAZORINE's helper, carrying a bouquet
	of flowers.

				MICHAEL
			  (stepping out)
		Who is it?

				ENZO
		Michael...do you remember me, Enzo,
		the baker's helper to Nazorine, now
		his son-in-law.

				MICHAEL
		Enzo, get out of here.  There's
		going to be trouble.

	A look of fear sweeps through ENZO's face.

				ENZO
		If there...will be trouble...I stay
		with you, to help.  I owe it to the
		Godfather.

	MICHAEL thinks, realizes he needs all the help he can get.

				MICHAEL
		Go outside; stand in front...I'll
		be out in a minute.

	INT NITE: DON'S SECOND HOSPITAL ROOM (WINTER 1945)

	They part.  MICHAEL moves into the hospital room where they
	put his FATHER.

				NURSE
			  (frightened)
		He's awake.

	MICHAEL looks at the OLD MAN, his eyes are open, though he
	cannot speak.  MICHAEL touches his face tenderly.

				MICHAEL
		Pop...Pop, it's me Michael.  Shhhh,
		don't try to speak.  There are men
		who are coming to try to kill you.
		But I'm with you...I'm with you
		now...

	The OLD MAN tries to speak...but cannot.  MICHAEL tenderly
	puts his finger to his FATHER's lips.

	EXT NITE: DON'S HOSPITAL STREET (WINTER 1945)

	Outside the hospital is empty save for a nervous ENZO,
	pacing back and forth brandishly the flowers as his only
	weapon.  MICHAEL exits the hospital and moves to him.  They
	both stand under a lamppost in the cold December night.
	They are both frightened; MICHAEL gives ENZO a cigarette,
	lights it.  ENZO's hands are trembling, MICHAEL's are not.

				MICHAEL
		Get rid of those and look like
		you've got a gun in your pocket.

	The windows of the hospital twinkle with Christmas
	decorations.

				MICHAEL
		Listen...

	We HEAR the sound of a single automobile coming.  MICHAEL
	and ENZO look with fear in their eyes.  Then MICHAEL takes
	the bouquet of flowers and stuffs them under his jacket.
	They stand, hands in their pockets.

	A long low black car turns the corner and cruises by them.
	MICHAEL's and ENZO's faces are tough, impassive.  The car
	seems as though it will stop; and then quickly accelerates.
	MICHAEL and ENZO are relieved.  MICHAEL looks down; the
	BAKER's hands are shaking.  He looks at his own, and they
	are not.

	Another moment goes by and we can hear the distant sound of
	police sirens.  They are clearly coming toward the hospital,
	getting louder and louder.  MICHAEL heaves a sigh of relief.

	In a second, a patrol car makes a screaming turn in front of
	the hospital; then two more squad cars follow with uniformed
	POLICE and DETECTIVES.  He smiles his relief and starts
	toward them.  TWO huge, burly POLICEMEN suddenly grab his
	arms while ANOTHER frisks him.  A massive POLICE CAPTAIN,
	spattered with gold braid and scrambled eggs on his hat,
	with beefy red face and white hair seems furious.  This is
	McCLUSKEY.

				MCCLUSKEY
		I thought I got all you guinea
		hoods locked up.  Who the hell are
		you and what are you doing here?

	ANOTHER COP standing nearby:

				COP
		He's clean, Captain.

	MICHAEL studies McCLUSKEY closely.

				MICHAEL
			  (quietly)
		What happened to the detectives who
		were supposed to be guarding my
		father?

				MCCLUSKEY
			  (furious)
		You punk-hood.  Who the hell are
		you to tell me my business.  I
		pulled them off.  I don't care how
		many Dago gangsters kill each other.
		I wouldn't lift a finger to keep
		your old man from getting knocked
		off.  Now get the hell out of here;
		get off this street you punk, and
		stay away from this hospital.

	MICHAEL stands quiet.

				MICHAEL
		I'll stay until you put guards
		around my father's room.

				MCCLUSKEY
		Phil, lock this punk up.

				A DETECTIVE
		The Kid's clean, Captain...He's a
		war hero, and he's never been mixed
		up in the rackets...

				MCCLUSKEY
			  (furious)
		Goddam it, I said lock him up.  Put
		the cuffs on him.

				MICHAEL
			  (deliberately, right
			  to McCLUSKEY's face,
			  as he's being handcuffed)
		How much is the Turk paying you to
		set my father up, Captain?

	Without any warning, McCLUSKEY leans back and hits MICHAEL
	squarely on the jaw with all his weight and strength.
	MICHAEL groans, and lifts his hand to his jaw.  He looks at
	McCLUSKEY; we are his VIEW and everything goes spinning, and
	he falls to the ground, just as we see HAGEN and CLEMENZA'S
	MEN arrive.

	---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

	EXT DAY: MALL (WINTER 1945)

	HIGH ANGLE VIEW of THE CORLEONE MALL.  The gateway now has a
	long black car blocking it.  There are more BUTTON MEN
	stationed more formally; and some of them visibly carrying
	rifles; those of the houses close to the courtyard have MEN
	standing by open windows.  It is clear that the war is
	escalating.  A car pulls up and out get CLEMENZA, LAMPONE,
	MICHAEL and HAGEN.  MICHAEL's jaw is wired and bandaged.  He
	stops and looks up at the open window.  We can see MEN
	holding rifles.

				MICHAEL
		Christ, Sonny really means business.

	They continue walking.  TESSIO joins them.  The various
	BODYGUARDS make no acknowledgment.

				CLEMENZA
		How come all the new men?

				TESSIO
		We'll need them now.  After the
		hospital incident, Sonny got mad.
		We hit Bruno Tattaglia four o'clock
		this morning.

	INT DAY: DON'S HALLWAY

	They enter the house past the scores of new and strange faces.

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

	SONNY is in the DON's office; he is excited and exuberant.

				SONNY
		I've got a hundred button men on
		the streets twenty-four hours a day.
		If Sollozzo shows one hair on his
		ass he's dead.

	He sees MICHAEL, and holds his bandaged face in his hand,
	kiddingly.

				SONNY
		Mikey, you look beautiful!

				MICHAEL
		Cut it out.

				SONNY
		The Turk wants to talk!  The nerve
		of that son of a bitch!  After he
		craps out last night he wants a meet.

				HAGEN
		Was there a definite proposal?

				SONNY
		Sure, he wants us to send Mike to
		meet him to hear his proposition.
		The promise is the deal will be so
		good we can't refuse.

				HAGEN
		What about that Tattaglias?  What
		will they do about Bruno?

				SONNY
		Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out
		what they did to my father.

				HAGEN
		We should hear what they have to say.

				SONNY
		No, no Consiglere.  Not this time.
		No more meetings, no more
		discussions, no more Sollozzo
		tricks.  Give them one message: I
		WANT SOLLOZZO.  If not, it's all
		out war.  We go to the mattresses
		and we put all the button men out
		on the street.

				HAGEN
		The other families won't sit still
		for all out war.

				SONNY
		Then THEY hand me Sollozzo.

				HAGEN
		Come ON Sonny, your father wouldn't
		want to hear this.  This is not a
		personal thing, this is Business.

				SONNY
		And when they shot me father...

				HAGEN
		Yes, even the shooting of your
		father was business, not personal...

				SONNY
		No no, no more advice on how to
		patch it up Tom.  You just help me
		win.  Understood?

	HAGEN bows his head; he is deeply concerned.

				HAGEN
		I found out about this Captain
		McCluskey who broke Mike's jaw.
		He's definitely on Sollozzo's
		payroll, and for big money.
		McCluskey's agreed to be the Turk's
		bodyguard.  What you have to
		understand is that while Sollozzo
		is guarded like this, he's
		invulnerable.  Nobody has ever
		gunned down a New York Police
		Captain.  Never.  It would be
		disastrous.  All the five families
		would come after you Sonny; the
		Corleone family would be outcasts;
		even the old man's political
		protection would run for cover.  So
		just...take that into consideration.

				SONNY
			  (still fuming)
		McCluskey can't stay with the Turk
		forever.  We'll wait.

				MICHAEL
		We can't wait.  No matter what
		Sollozzo say about a deal, he's
		figuring out how to kill Pop.  You
		have to get Sollozzo now.

				SONNY
		The kid's right.

				HAGEN
		What about McCluskey?

				MICHAEL
		Let's say now that we have to kill
		McCluskey.  We'll clear that up
		through our Newspaper contacts later.

				SONNY
		Go on Mike.

				MICHAEL
		They want me to go to the conference
		with Sollozzo.  Set up the meeting
		for two days from now.  Sonny, get
		our informers to find out where the
		meeting will be held.
		Insist it has to be a public place:
		a bar or restaurant at the height
		of the dinner hour.  So I'll feel
		safe.  They'll check me when I meet
		them so I won't be able to carry a
		weapon; but Clemenza, figure out a
		way to have one planted there for
		me.
			  (pause)
		Then I'll kill them both.

	Everyone in the room is astonished; they all look at MICHAEL.
	Silence.  SONNY suddenly breaks out in laughter.  He points
	a finger at MICHAEL, trying to speak.

				SONNY
		You?  You, the high-class college
		kid.  You never wanted to get mixed
		up in the family business.  Now you
		wanta gun down a police Captain and
		the Turk just because you got
		slapped in the face.  You're taking
		it personal, it's just business and
		he's taking it personal.

	Now CLEMENZA and TESSIO are also smiling; only HAGEN keeps
	his face serious.

				MICHAEL
			  (angrily, but cold)
		Sonny, it's all personal, and I
		learned it from him, the old man,
		the Godfather.  He took my joining
		the Marines personal.  I take
		Sollozzo trying to kill my father
		personal, and you know I'll kill
		them Sonny.

	MICHAEL radiates danger...SONNY stops laughing.

	INT DAY: CLEMENZA'S CELLAR (WINTER 1945)

	CLOSE on a revolver.

				CLEMENZA (O.S.)
		It's as cold as they come,
		impossible to trace.
			  (he turns it upside down)
		Don't worry about prints Mike, I
		put a special tape on the trigger
		and butt.  Here.
			  (he hands the gun to
			  another pair of hands)
		Whatsamatter?  Trigger too tight.
			  (it fires: very LOUD)
		I left it noisy, so it'll scare any
		pain-in-the-neck innocent bystander
		away.

	MICHAEL is alone with CLEMENZA in a cellar workshop.

				CLEMENZA
		Just let your hand drop to your
		side, and let the gun slip out.
		Everybody will still think you got
		it.  They'll be starin' at your
		face, see?  Then walk out of the
		place real fast, but don't run.
		Don't look anybody directly in the
		eye, but don't look away from them
		neither.  Hey, they'll be scared
		stiff o you, believe me.  Nobody's
		gonna bother with you.  Don't worry
		about nothing; you'd be surprised
		how good these things go.  O.K.,
		put your hat on, let's see how you
		look.  Helps with identification.

	They put the hat on; CLEMENZA adjusts it.

				CLEMENZA
		Mostly it gives witnesses an excuse
		to change their identification when
		we make them see the light.  Then
		you take a long vacation and we
		catch the hell.

				MICHAEL
		How bad will it be?

				CLEMENZA
		Probably all the other families
		will line up against us.  But, it's
		alright.  These things have to
		happen once every ten years or
		so...gets rid of the bad blood.
		You gotta stop 'em at the beginning.
		Like they shoulda stopped Hitler at
		Munich, they shoulda never let him
		get away with that, they were just
		asking for big trouble...

	INT DAY: DON'S HALL & LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)

	MICHAEL steps into the foyer of the main house.  A card
	table is set up with a man playing cards with three of the
	Corleone buttonmen.

	He continues into the living room.  It's a mess.  SONNY
	asleep on the sofa.  On the coffee table are the remains of
	a take-out Chinese food dinner, and a half-empty bottle of
	whisky.  The radio is playing.

				MICHAEL
		Why don't you stop living like a
		bum and get this place cleaned up.

				SONNY
		What are you, inspecting the
		barracks?
			  (SONNY sits up with
			  his head in his hands)
		You ready?  Did Clemenza tell you
		be sure to drop the gun right away?

				MICHAEL
		A million times.

				SONNY
		Sollozzo and McCluskey are going to
		pick you up in an hour and a half
		on Times Square, under the big
		Camels sign.

				HAGEN
		We don't let Mike go until we have
		the hostage, Sonny.

				CLEMENZA
		It's okay...the hostage is outside
		playing pinochle with three of my
		men.

	The phone rings in the DON's office.

				SONNY
		That could be a Tattaglia informer
		with the meeting place.

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

	HAGEN has hurried into the Den to get the phone; the OTHERS
	move in.

	HAGEN's on the phone; he writes something down.

				SONNY
		One of Tattaglia's people?

				HAGEN
		No.  Our informer in McCluskey's
		precinct.  Tonight at 8:00 he
		signed out for Louis' Restaurant in
		the Bronx.  Anyone know it.

				TESSIO
		Sure, I do.  It's perfect for us.
		A small family place with big
		booths where people can talk in
		private.  Good food.  Everybody
		minds their business.  Perfect.
			  (he moves to the desk
			  and makes a crude drawing)
		This is the entrance, Mike.  When
		you finish just walk out and turn
		left, then turn the corner.
		Clemenza, you gotta work fast to
		plant the gun.  They got an old-
		fashioned toilet with a space
		between the water container and the
		wall.  We can tape the gun behind
		there.

				CLEMENZA
		Mike, they're gonna frisk you in
		the car.  You'll be clean so they
		won't worry 'bout nothing.  In the
		restaurant, wait and talk a while,
		and then ask permission to go.  See?
		Then when you come out, don't waste
		time; don't sit down...you come out
		blasting.  And don't take chances.
		In the head, two shots apiece.  And
		out as fast as your legs can move.

				SONNY
		I want somebody very good, very
		safe to plant that gun.  I don't
		want my brother coming out of that
		toilet with just his dick in his
		hand.

				CLEMENZA
		The gun will be there.

				SONNY
			  (to MICHAEL, warmly)
		You're on, kid...I'll square it
		with Mom your not seeing her before
		you left.  And I'll get a message
		to your girl friend when I think
		the time is right.

				CLEMENZA
		We gotta move...

				MICHAEL
		O.K.  How long do you think before
		I can come back?

				SONNY
		Probably a year...

				HAGEN
			  (starting to crack)
		Jesus, I don't know...

				SONNY
		Can you do it Mike?

	MICHAEL moves out.

	EXT NITE: CAMELS SIGN (WINTER 1945)

	The enormous "CAMELS" sign, puffing smoke, below it stands
	MICHAEL, dressed in a warm overcoat, and wearing the hat
	CLEMENZA had given him.  A long black car pulls around the
	corner and slows before him.  The DRIVER, leaning over, open
	the front door.

				DRIVER
		Get in, Mike.

	He does, the car drives off.

	EXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR (WINTER 1945)

	Inside the car, SOLLOZZO reaches his hand over the back seat
	and shakes MIKE's hand.

				SOLLOZZO
		I'm glad you came, Mike.  I hope we
		can straighten everything out.  All
		this is terrible, it's not the way
		I wanted things to happen at all.
		It should never have happened.

				MICHAEL
		I want to settle things tonight.  I
		want my father left alone.

				SOLLOZZO
		He won't be; I swear to you be my
		children he won't be.  Just keep an
		open mind when we talk.  I hope
		you're not a hothead like your
		brother, Sonny.  It's impossible to
		talk business with him.

	McCLUSKEY grunts.

				MCCLUSKEY
		He's a good kid.  He's all right.
		Turn around, up on your knees,
		facing me.

	He gives MICHAEL a thorough frisk.

				MCCLUSKEY
		I'm sorry about the other night
		Mike.  I'm getting too old for my
		job, too grouchy.  Can't stand the
		aggravation.  You know how it is.
		He's clean.

	EXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR - WEST SIDE HIGHWAY (WINTER 1945)

	MICHAEL looks at the DRIVER and then ahead to see where
	they're heading.

	The car takes the George Washington Bridge.  MICHAEL is
	concerned.

				MICHAEL
		We're going to New Jersey?

				SOLLOZZO
			  (sly)
		Maybe.

	MICHAEL closes his eyes.

	EXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR ON G.W. BRIDGE (WINTER 1945)

	The car speeds along the George Washington Bridge on its way
	to New Jersey.  Then suddenly it hits the divider,
	temporarily lifts into the air, and bounces over into the
	lanes going back to New York.  It then hits it very fast, on
	the way back to the city.

	EXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR (WINTER 1945)

	SOLLOZZO checks to see the cars that had been following, and
	then leans to the DRIVER.

				SOLLOZZO
		Nice work; I'll remember it.

	MICHAEL is relieved.

	EXT NITE: LUNA AZURA RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)

	The car pulls up in front of a little family restaurant in
	the Bronx:  The "LUNA AZURA".  There is no one on the street.
	MICHAEL looks to see if the DRIVER is going to get out with
	them.  He gets out, and opens the door.  SOLLOZZO, McCLUSKEY
	and MICHAEL get out; the DRIVER remains leaning against the
	car.  They enter the restaurant.

	INT NITE: LUNA AZURA (WINTER 1945)

	A very small family restaurant with a mosaic tile floor.
	SOLLOZZO, MICHAEL and McCLUSKEY sit around a rather small
	round table near the center of the room.  There are empty
	booths along the side walls; with a handful of CUSTOMERS,
	and ONE or TWO WAITERS.  It is very quiet.

				MCCLUSKEY
		Is the Italian food good here?

				SOLLOZZO
		Try the veal; it's the finest in
		New York.

	The solitary WAITER brings a bottle of wine to the table.
	They watch him silently as he uncorks it and pours three
	glasses.  Then, when he leaves, SOLLOZZO turns to McCLUSKEY:

				SOLLOZZO
		I am going to talk Italian to Mike.

				MCCLUSKEY
		Sure, you two go right ahead; I'll
		concentrate on my veal and my
		spaghetti.

	SOLLOZZO now begins in rapid Sicilian.  MICHAEL listening
	carefully and nodding every so often.  Then MICHAEL answers
	in Sicilian, and SOLLOZZO goes on.  The WAITER occasionally
	brings food; and they hesitate while he is there; then go on.
	Then MICHAEL, having difficulty expressing himself in
	Italian, accidentally lapses into English.

				MICHAEL
			  (using English for emphasis)
		Most important...I want a sure
		guarantee that no more attempts
		will be made on my father's life.

				SOLLOZZO
		What guarantees can I give you?  I
		am the hunted one.  I've missed my
		chance.  You think too highly of
		me, my friend...I am not so
		clever...all I want if a truce...

	MICHAEL looks long and hard at SOLLOZZO, who is smiling
	holding his open hands up as if to say: "I have no tricks up
	my sleeve".  Then he looks away and makes a distressed look
	on his face.

				SOLLOZZO
		What is it?

				MICHAEL
		Is it all right if I go to the
		bathroom?

	SOLLOZZO is intuitively suspicious.  He studies MICHAEL with
	his dark eyes.  Then he thrusts his hand onto MICHAEL's
	thigh feeling in and around, searching for a weapon.

				MCCLUSKEY
		I frisked him; I've frisked
		thousands of young punks; he's clean.

	He looks at a MAN sitting at a table opposite them;
	indicating the bathroom with his eyes.  The MAN nods,
	indicating no one is there.

				SOLLOZZO
		Don't take too long.

	MICHAEL gets up and calmly walks to the bathroom, and
	disappears inside.

	INT NITE: LUNA AZURA TOILET (WINTER 1945)

	MICHAEL steps into the small bathroom; he is breathing very
	hard.  He actually uses the urinal.  Then he washes his
	hands with the bar of pink soap; and dries them thoroughly.
	Then he moves to the booth, up to the old-fashioned toilet.
	Slowly he reaches behind the water tank; he panics when he
	cannot feel the gun.  We see behind the tank his hand is
	just a few inches from the gun...he gropes
	searchingly...finally coming to rest on the gun.

	CLOSE ON MICHAEL; the feel of it reassures him.  Then he
	breaks it loose from the tape holding it; he takes a deep
	breath and shoves it under his waistband.  For some
	unexplainable reason he hesitates once again, deliberately
	washes his hands and dries them.  Then he goes out.

	INT NITE: LUNA AZURA (WINTER 1945)

	He hesitates by the bathroom door; and looks at his table.
	McCLUSKEY is eating a plate of spaghetti and veal.  SOLLOZZO
	turns around upon hearing the door, and looks directly at
	MICHAEL.  MICHAEL looks back.  Then he smiles and continues
	back to the table.  He sits down.

				MICHAEL
		Now I can talk.  I feel much better.

	The MAN by the far wall had been stiff with attention; now
	he too relaxes.  SOLLOZZO leans toward MICHAEL who sits down
	comfortably and his hands move under the table and unbutton
	his jacket.  SOLLOZZO begins to speak in Sicilian once again
	but MICHAEL's heart is pounding so hard he can barely hear
	him.

	The WAITER comes to ask about the order, SOLLOZZO turns to
	speak, and without warning, MICHAEL shoves the table away
	from him with his left hand, and with his right hand puts
	the gun right against SOLLOZZO's head, just touching his
	temple.  He pulls the trigger, and we see part of SOLLOZZO's
	head blown away, and a spray of fine mist of blood cover the
	entire area.

	The WAITER looks in amazement; suddenly his white jacket is
	sprayed and stained with blood.

	SOLLOZZO seems in a perpetual fall to the floor; through he
	seems to hang in space suspended.

	MICHAEL pivots, and looks:

	There is McCLUSKEY, frozen, the fork with a piece of veal
	suspended in air before his gaping mouth.

	MICHAEL fires; catching McCLUSKEY in his thick bulging
	throat.  He makes a horrible, gagging, choking sound.  Then
	coolly, and deliberately, MICHAEL fires again, fires right
	through McCLUSKEY's white-topped skull.

	The air is filled with pink mist.
	MICHAEL swings toward the MAN standing by the bathroom wall.
	He does not make a move, seemingly paralyzed.
	Now he carefully shows his hands to be empty.
	The WAITER steps backward through the mist of blood, an
	expression of horror on his face.
	MICHAEL looks at his two victims:
	SOLLOZZO still in his chair, side of his body propped up by
	the table.
	McCLUSKEY finally falls from the chair to the table.
	MICHAEL is wildly at a peak.  He starts to move out.  His
	hand: is frozen by his side, STILL GRIPPING THE GUN.
	He moves, not letting the gun go.

	MICHAEL's face; frozen in its expression.

	His hand: still holding the gun.

	His face: finally he closes his eyes.

	His hand relaxes, the gun falls to the floor with a dull thud.

	He walks quickly out of the restaurant, looks back.

	He sees a frozen tableau of the murder; as though it had
	been recreated in wax.

	Then he leaves.

	FADE IN:

	INT DAY: MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)

	A MAN is his shirtsleeves plays a sentimental tune on an old
	upright piano, while his cigarette burns on the edge.
	ANOTHER stands nearby, listening quietly.

	A little distance away, TEN MEN sit around a crude table,
	quietly eating.  They talk in low, relaxed voices, and there
	is an occasional laugh.

	ROCCO LAMPONE stands by a window, which has been covered
	with a heavy-mesh wire grating, gazing out.

	A large bowl of pasta is passed, and the MEN eat heartily.

	The sentimental tune is continued over the following:

	INT DAY: BODIES IN CAR (WINTER 1945)

	A MAN and a WOMAN, blood coming out of their noses, lie
	still together in a bullet-riddled automobile.

	INT DAY: BODY IN BARBER SHOP (WINTER 1945)

	A MAN is covered by a sheet on the floor of a barber shop.

	INT DAY: MATTRESS

	Ten mattresses are spread out around the otherwise empty
	living room of an apartment.  THREE or FOUR MEN including
	CLEMENZA, are taking naps.

	An arsenal of hand guns are spread out on a card table.

	The MEN at the table continue their dinner; passing and
	pouring the wine.

	Trash is thrown in 2 or 3 garbage cans kept in the apartment.

	INT DAY: BODY IN OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

	A MAN, his clothes soaked in blood, lies on the floor of an
	office building, dead, under an enormous portrait of Harry S.
	Truman.

	EXT DAY: BODY ON STOOP (WINTER 1945)

	ANOTHER MAN, his trousers soaked in blood, lies spanning
	three steps of a front stoop.

	INT NITE: MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)

	TESSIO, sits in a simple straight-backed chair, doing a
	crossword puzzle.

	A thin, boyish BUTTON MAN, writes a letter.

	Six or seven empty mattresses, with tossed unmade blankets.
	Coffee cans beside them serve as ash trays.

	A MAN by the table pulls the cork on another bottle of
	Ruffino, and wine is poured as the MEN eat.

	EXT DAY: BODY IN ALLEY (WINTER 1945)

	A CORPSE is half out of an overturned garbage can in a quiet
	alley.

	INT DAY: BODY AT TABLE (WINTER 1945)

	A MAN in a formal jacket and tie is slumped over a table, in
	a pool of blood on the tablecloth.

	INT DAY: MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)

	A neatly stacked pile of newspapers in the corner of an
	apartment.  We catch a glimpse of one headline: "Five Family
	War..."

	The table.  The MEN are sitting around cracking nuts.  ONE
	has fallen asleep on his arms at the table.

	SEVERAL MEN are taking naps on the Mattresses.

	The PIANO PLAYER finishes the tune with finesse.  Picks up
	and takes a drag from his cigarette.  The OTHER MAN nods
	appreciatively.

				MAN
		Nice Augie...nice.

	EXT DAY: MANCINI BLDG. (SPRING '46)

	Several cars are parked in front of a pleasant New York
	apartment building.  We recognize a couple of SONNY's
	bodyguards loafing by the cars, pitching playing cards
	against the curb.

	Inside the building, two others wait quietly by the rows of
	brass mailboxes: they have been there quite awhile.

	Up one flight of stairs, a single man sits on the step,
	smoking a cigarette.

	One of the men by the mailboxes checks his pocketwatch,
	which is attached to a key chain.  We HEAR the sound of a
	door opening; they look up.

	The man sitting on the stop stands; and looks.

	SONNY backs out of an apartment, the arms of LUCY MANCINI
	wrapped around him.  She doesn't want to let go of him; she
	draws him back into the apartment for a moment, and then he
	comes out alone, adjusting his clothes.

	He jauntily skips down the steps, trailed by the bodyguard
	on the first floor, and moves outside toward his car.  The
	men quickly take up their positions.  As he gets in his car:

				DRIVER
		Pick up your sister?

				SONNY
		Yeah.

	The car drives off; accompanied and escorted by the
	bodyguards in their cars.

	INT DAY: CONNIE'S HALL (SPRING '46)

	He knocks on the door.  No answer.  Then again.

				CONNIE'S VOICE
		Who is it?

				SONNY
		It's me, Sonny.

	We hear the bolt slide back, and see the door open.  SONNY
	enters, but CONNIE has quickly moved into the hallway, her
	back to him.

				SONNY
			  (tenderly)
		Connie, what is it?

	He turns her around in his arms.

	Her face is swollen and bruised; and we can tell from her
	rough, red eyes that she has been crying for a long time.
	As soon as he realizes what's happened, his face goes red
	with rage.  She sees it coming, and clings to him, preventing
	him from running out of the apartment.

				CONNIE
			  (desperately)
		It was my fault!  I started a fight
		with him and I tried to hit him so
		he hit me.  He didn't even try to
		hit me hard Sonny, I walked into it.

	Sonny listens, and calms himself.  He touches her shoulder,
	the thin silk robe.

				SONNY
		I'm goin' to have the doctor come
		over and take a look at you.

	He starts to leave.

				CONNIE
		Oh Sonny, please don't do anything.
		Please don't.

	He stops, and then laughs good naturedly.

				SONNY
		Hey.  Con.  What'm I goin' to do?
		Make your kid a orphan before he's
		born.

	She laughs with him.  He kisses her reassuringly, and leaves.

	EXT DAY: CONNIE'S STREET

	CARLO settles down on the front steps of the 112th St.
	"Book" with SALLY RAGS and COACH, who have been drinking
	beer out of glasses and a pitcher of beer from around the
	corner.  The ball game is blaring from the radio; and the
	kids on the street are still playing stickball.

	CARLO has barely settled down, when the kids in the street
	suddenly scatter, and a car comes screeching up the block
	and to a halt in front of the candy store.  The tires
	scream, and before it seems as though it has even stopped, a
	MAN comes hurtling out of the driver's seat, moving so fast
	the everyone is paralyzed.  It is a moment before we
	recognize that it is SONNY.

	His face is contorted with anger; in a split second he is on
	the stoop and has CARLO by the throat.

	He pulls CARLO away from the others, trying to get him down
	into the street.  But CARLO reaches out for the iron railing,
	and hangs on, his hand in a lock, cringing away, trying to
	hide his head and face in the hollow of the his shoulders.
	His shirt is ripped away in SONNY's hand.

	SALLY RAGS and COACH, merely sit, watching, stunned.

	SONNY is pounding the cowered CARLO with all his strength,
	in a continuous monologue of indistinguishable cursing.  His
	blows are powerful; and begin to draw blood.

	The kids who have been playing stickball, move up, watching
	in fascination.

	CARLO's hands are clenched tight around the railing.

	SONNY beats him mercilessly.

	Now SONNY's bodyguards' car pulls up, and they too become
	spectators.

	SONNY's tight fists are going down like hammers, into
	CARLO's face and body.

	CARLO's nose is bleeding profusely; but still he does
	nothing, other than hang onto the railing.

	SONNY grabs hold of CARLO's massive body, and tries to drag
	him off of the hold on the railing, his teeth clenched in
	the effort.  Then he tries loosening CARLO's locked hands;
	even biting them.  CARLO screams but he does not let go.

	It's clear that CARLO is much stronger than he is, and will
	not be moved.  SONNY knees him in the mouth, and beats him
	more; but he is exhausted.  Totally out of breath, he
	stammers haltingly to the bleeding CARLO.

				SONNY
		You...bastard...You...hurt my
		sister... again...and I'll
		kill...you.

	He wipes the sweat from his face, and then turns suddenly.
	and hurries back to the car, in a moment his car is gone,
	leaving even his bodyguards in confusion.  We notice ONE MAN
	with a sports jacket in the group of spectators especially
	interested.

	CARLO finally relaxes the clenched, locked hands.  He slumps
	onto the stoop.

	---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

	FADE IN:

	EXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1946)

	HIGH ANGLE on the Corleone Mall.  It is a gray, rainy day.
	Young BUTTON MEN in raincoats stand in quiet groups of
	various points around the main house and compound.  Things
	have changed; one house has been extensively enlarged; a new
	and secure gate house has been built.  Security measures
	that had been make-shift and temporarily have now been made
	a permanent part of the Mall, evolving it into a Medieval
	Fortress.  We notice a huge crater in the courtyard; the
	result of a recent bomb attempt.  The house nearest the
	crater is damaged by fire.

	A taxi arrives; KAY ADAMS steps out, huddled in a bright
	yellow raincoat; she lets the cab go, and hurries to the
	shelter of the gate house.

	They are not expecting her, and ask her to wait while they
	call the main house.

	KAY looks at the imposing, depressing Mall, while rain still
	runs down onto her face.

	She notices the bomb crater, and the fire damage; and the
	sullen faces of the BUTTON MEN.

	TOM HAGEN exits the Main House, and hurries toward her.

				HAGEN
		Kay, we weren't expecting you.  You
		should call...

				KAY
		I've tried calling and writing.  I
		want to reach Michael.

				HAGEN
		Nobody knows where he is.  We know
		he's all right, but that's all.

	KAY looks in the direction of the crater, filling with
	rainwater.

				KAY
		What was that?

				HAGEN
		An accident.  No one was hurt.

				KAY
		Listen Tom, I let my cab go; can I
		come in to call another one?

	TOM is clearly reluctant to involve her any more than he has
	to.

				HAGEN
		Sure...I'm sorry.

	They hurry through the rain and into the Main House.

	INT DAY: DON'S LIVING ROOM (SPRING 1946)

	In the living room, KAY shakes the water from her coat and
	takes her rainhat off.

				KAY
		Will you give this to him.

				HAGEN
		If I accept that letter and you
		told a Court of Law I accepted it,
		they would interpret it as my
		having knowledge of his whereabouts.
		Just wait Kay, he'll contact you.

	We hear footsteps descending the staircase; MAMA CORLEONE
	enters the room; the OLD WOMAN squints at KAY, evaluating her.

				MAMA
		You're Mikey's little girl.

	KAY nods yes; there are still tears in her eyes.

				MAMA
		You eat anything?

	KAY shakes her head.

				MAMA
			  (to HAGEN)
		Disgrazia, you don't even give the
		poor girl a cup of coffee?

	HAGEN shrugs helplessly; on an impulse, KAY quickly moves
	toward MAMA, the letter extended.

				KAY
		Will you give this letter to Michael.

				HAGEN
		Mama, no.

				MAMA
		You tell me what to do?  Even he
		don't tell me what to do.

	She takes the letter from KAY, who is grateful and relieved.

				KAY
		Why did they blame Michael?

				MAMA
		You listen to me, you go home to
		your family, and you find a good
		young man and get married.  Forget
		about Mikey; he's no good for you,
		anymore.

	She looks directly into KAY's eyes; and KAY understands what
	that means.

	EXT DAY: DON'S HOSPITAL (SPRING 1946)

	A hospital in New York City.  POLICE and teams of PRIVATE
	DETECTIVES are stationed guarding the area.  An ambulance
	with a team of DETECTIVES and BUTTON-MEN GUARDS exit the
	hospital with rifles in hand; followed by SEVERAL HOSPITAL
	ASSISTANTS wheeling a hospital stretcher, presumably carrying
	the DON.

	TESSIO and CLEMENZA emerge, with OTHER BUTTON MEN bringing
	up the rear.  HAGEN walks with the stretcher, and for a
	moment they disappear behind the ambulance.  Then suddenly,
	siren blasting, it speeds off, accompanied by dark low-slung
	cars.

	EXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1946)

	The Corleone Mall.

	Equally impressive security stands ready at the Corleone
	Mall.  EXTRA BUTTON MEN, as well as SOME POLICE, and PRIVATE
	DETECTIVES.

	It all seems to be under the supervision of ROCCO LAMPONE.
	All is silent.  The WOMEN and CHILDREN, dressed in Sunday
	clothes, wait.

	EXT DAY: AMBULANCE (SPRING 1946)

	One ambulance, speeding along the Grand Central Parkway,
	preceded and followed by a dark car, each one carrying a
	team of BUTTON MEN.

	Sitting next to the DRIVER of the ambulance is a GUARD with
	a rifle on his lap.

	INT DAY: DON'S HALL (SPRING 1946)

	Inside the Main CORLEONE House:

	Hospital ORDERLIES carry the DON on his stretcher carefully
	under the watchful eyes of CLEMENZA, TESSIO, LAMPONE and
	various GUARDS and BUTTON MEN.

	All the CORLEONE family is here today: MAMA, FREDO, SANDRA,
	THERESA, CONNIE, CARLO; the various CORLEONE CHILDREN.

	INT DAY: DON'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)

	The DON is made comfortable in his room, which has all but
	been converted into a hospital room, with complete and
	extensive equipment.  The various CHILDREN get a turn to
	kiss the OLD MAN, as he is made comfortable... and then
	SONNY indicates that all the CHILDREN, WOMEN, and CARLO
	should leave.

	They do, the door is closed.

	INT DAY: DON'S DINING ROOM (SPRING 1946)

	The mood is quite happy downstairs, as the WOMEN prepare the
	Sunday dinner, and set the table.

	CARLO sits alone among them, a frown on his face.

				CONNIE
		What's the matter, Carlo?

				CARLO
		Shut up.

	INT DAY: DON'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)

	All the MEN of the family stand around the hospital bed with
	grim faces, SONNY and HAGEN closest to the OLD MAN.  The DON
	does not speak, yet he asks questions with his looks and
	glances, as clearly as if they were verbalized.  HAGEN is
	the spokesman for the family.

				HAGEN
		...since McCluskey's killing, the
		police have cracked down on most of
		our operations...on the other
		families too.  There's been a lot
		of bad blood.

	The OLD MAN glances at SONNY.

				SONNY
		Pop, they hit us and we hit them
		back.

				HAGEN
		We put out a lot of material
		through our contacts in the
		Newspapers...about McCluskey's
		being tied up with Sollozzo in the
		Drug Rackets...things are starting
		to loosen up.

	The OLD MAN nods.

				SONNY
		Freddie's gonna go to Las
		Vegas...under the protection of Don
		Francesco of L.A.  I want him to
		rest...

				FREDO
		I'm goin' to learn the casino
		business.

	The DON nods approvingly.  Then he searches around the room
	for a face he does not see.  HAGEN knows who he's looking for.

				HAGEN
		Michael...
			  (he takes a breath)
		It was Michael who killed Sollozzo.

	The DON closes his eyes, and then reopens them in anger and
	rage.

				HAGEN
		He's safe now...we're already
		working on ways to bring him back.

	The DON is very angry, he motions with a weak hand that they
	leave him alone.

	INT. DAY: DON'S STAIRS AND HALL (SPRING 1946)

	HAGEN is very upset as he comes down the Stairs; SONNY is
	expansive and optimistic.

				SONNY
		We'll let the old man take it easy
		for a couple of weeks.  I want to
		get things going good before he
		gets better.  What's the matter
		with you?

				HAGEN
		You start operating, the five
		families will start their raids
		again.  We're at a stalemate Sonny,
		your war is costing us a lot of
		money.

				SONNY
		No more stalemate Tom, we got the
		soldiers, we'll match them gun for
		gun if that's how they want it.
		They know me for what I am, Tom--
		and they're scared of me.

				HAGEN
		Yes.  That's true, you're getting a
		hell of a reputation.

				SONNY
		Well it's war!  We might not be in
		this shape if we had a real war-
		time Consiglere, a Sicilian.  Pop
		had Genco, who do I have?
			  (TOM starts to leave)
		Hey Tom, hey...hey.  It's Sunday,
		we're gonna have dinner.  Don't be
		sore.

	INT DAY: DON'S DINING ROOM (SPRING 1946)

	The FAMILY, WIVES, CHILDREN and all sit around the table
	over Sunday dinner.  SONNY is at the head of the table.

	EXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1946)

	SOME of the CORLEONE GRANDCHILDREN play in the enclosed
	Mall, in the proximity of the BUTTON MEN stationed liberally
	by the gate.

	ONE CHILD misses a ball, it rolls by the gate house.  A
	young BUTTON MAN scoops it up and throws it back, smiling.

	-----------------------------------------FADE OUT-------

	INT DAY: CONNIE'S APT. (SPRING 1946)

	CONNIE and CARLO's apartment.  She's in a slip, on the phone.
	We HEAR the shower going in the bathroom.

				CONNIE
		Who is this?

				GIRL (O.S.)
			  (giggle)
		I'm a friend of Carlo's.  I just
		wanted to tell him I can't see him
		tonight; I have to go out of town.

	CONNIE's face turns red.

				CONNIE
		You lousy tramp bitch.
			  (click)


	She slams the phone down; just as CARLO is coming out of the
	bathroom drying his golden body.

				CARLO
		What was that?

				CONNIE
		Your girl friend.  She says she
		can't make it tonight.  You lousy
		bastard you have the nerve to give
		your whores my telephone number.
		I'll kill you, you bastard!

	She hauls off and punches him knowingly; he laughs, so then
	she flings herself at him, kicking and scratching; her heavy
	belly heaving under the thin slip.

				CARLO
			  (defending himself)
		You're crazy.  She was kidding
		around; I don't know, some nut.

	He pushes her aside, and moves into the bedroom to continue
	dressing.

				CONNIE
		You're staying home.  You're not
		going out.

				CARLO
		OK, OK.  You gonna make me something
		to eat at least?

	That calms her down; she stands there a moment, breathing
	heavily; and then she nods, and goes into the kitchen, and
	starts her wifely duties.

	CARLO is dressed; puts on some cologne; CONNIE appears in
	the doorway.

				CONNIE
		The food is on the table.

				CARLO
		I'm not hungry yet.

				CONNIE
		Eat it, it's on the table.

				CARLO
		Ba Fa Goulle.

				CONNIE
		BA FA GOULE YOU!

	She turns deliberately, goes out into the kitchen.  A moment
	later we begin to hear the sound of dishes breaking.  CARLO
	slowly walks out, where we can see CONNIE systematically
	smashing all the dishes against the sink, sending the greasy
	veal and peppers all over the apartment floor.

				CARLO
		You filthy guinea spoiled brat.
		Clean it up or I'll kick your head
		in.

				CONNIE
		Like hell I will.

	She stands there, solid, ready to punch him again.  Slowly,
	he slides his belt out of his trousers, and doubles it in
	his hand.

				CARLO
		Clean it up!

	He swings the belt against her heavy hips.  She moves back
	into the kitchen, and gets a kitchen knife, and holds it
	ready.

				CARLO
		Even the female Corleones are
		murderers.

	He puts the strap down on a table, and moves after her.  She
	makes a sudden thrust at his groin, which he avoids.  He
	pulls the knife away, cutting his hand in the process.  She
	gets away momentarily, but he pursues her around the table,
	gets her; and starts to slap her in the face.

	She breaks away from him, and rushes into the bedroom.

				CONNIE
		The baby!  The baby!

	INT DAY: CONNIE'S BEDROOM  (SPRING 1946)

	She runs into the bedroom; he follows.  She moves into a
	corner, and then like a desperate animal, tries to hide
	under the bed.

	He reaches under, and pulls her out by the hair.

	He slaps her in the face until she begins to weep; then he
	throws her on the bed, contemptuously.  He grabs part of her
	thigh, pinching it very hard.

				CARLO
		You're fat as a pig.

	Then he pushes her away, and walks out of the room, leaving
	her in tears.  She is crying; she pulls herself to the
	bedroom phone, and in a whisper:

				CONNIE
		Mama...mama, it's Connie.  Mama, I
		can't talk any louder.  No, I don't
		want to talk to Sonny.

	We can tell that the phone has been passed to SONNY.

	INT DAY: DON'S KITCHEN (SPRING 1946)

	In the kitchen at the Mall, MAMA cannot understand the
	whispering and she has given the phone to SONNY.

				SONNY
		Yeah Connie.

				CONNIE (O.S.)
		Sonny, just send a car to bring me
		home.  I'll tell you then, it's
		nothing Sonny, don't you come.
		Send TOM, please Sonny, it's
		nothing; I just want to come home.

	SONNY's face is turning red.

				SONNY
			  (in a controlled voice)
		You wait there.  You just wait there.

	He hangs up the phone; and just stands there for a moment.

				SONNY
			  (quietly)
		That sonofabitch; that sonofabitch...

	HAGEN enters the room; he knows what is happening, knows he
	cannot interfere.

	EXT DAY: MALL

	SONNY leaves the house.  HAGEN moves to the outside mall
	just as SONNY's car is driving off.  He moves to a group of
	BUTTON MEN.

				HAGEN
		Go after him.

	EXT DAY: CAUSEWAY (SPRING 1946)

	SONNY's car on the Jones Beach Causeway, speeds quickly by.
	After a pause, another car, with the CORLEONE BODYGUARDS, is
	trailing.

	SONNY is driving; he is very angry.

	EXT NITE: TOLL BOOTHS (SPRING 1946)

	SONNY in his car; driving back.  Still breathing hard and
	still furious.  Then he thinks it's funny; he enjoyed it.
	He starts laughing, louder and louder, as he pulls up to a
	toll booth, stops, and extends his hand with a coin to the
	COLLECTOR.

	---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

	FADE IN:

	INT NITE: AMERIGO BONASERA'S APARTMENT

	The serious-faced UNDERTAKER is on the telephone.

				HAGEN (O.S.)
		This is Tom Hagen.  I'm calling for
		Don Corleone, at his request.

	BONASERA looks at his WIFE, with deep anxiety in his eyes.
	BONASERA's lips are suddenly dry.

				BONASERA
		Yes, I understand.  I'm listening.

				HAGEN (O.S.)
		You owe the Don a service.  In one
		hour, not before, perhaps later, he
		will be at your funeral parlor to
		ask for your help.  Be there to
		greet him.  If you have any
		objections speak now, and I'll
		inform him.

	Silence.  BONASERA stutters, then speaks in fright.

				BONASERA
		Anything...Anything the Godfather
		wishes.

				HAGEN (O.S.)
		Good.  He never doubted you.

				BONASERA
		The Don himself is coming to me
		tonight?

				HAGEN (O.S.)
		Yes.
			  (click)


	BONASERA is sweating; slowly he lowers the phone; his WIFE
	sees his pale expression, and follows him into the room.

	Silently, he begins the ritual of dressing.  His WIFE knows
	something serious is happening, and never takes her eyes
	from him.  He lights a cigarette.

				BONASERA
		For the last year, they have been
		killing one another.  So now, what?
		Your Godfather comes to me...Why?
			  (whispering, slyly)
		They've killed someone so important
		that they wish to make his body
		disappear.

				MRS. BONASERA
			  (frightened)
		Amerigo!

				BONASERA
		They could make me an accomplice to
		their murder.  They could send me
		to jail!

	He slips into his trousers.  Then he moves to his WIFE to
	tie his tie, as she has done for years.

				BONASERA
		And if the other families find
		out...they will make me their enemy.
		They could come here to our house.
		I curse the day I ever went to the
		Godfather.

	EXT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR (SPRING 1946)

	With his ring of keys, he opens the funeral parlor, enters.

	INT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR (SPRING 1946)

	BONASERA walks through the darkened funeral parlor, without
	turning on the lights; then into the rear, preparation room,
	past the tables, and equipment.  He operates the chain that
	lifts a large overhead garage type door.  And looks out into
	the alley.

	He sits on a bench, and waits.

	EXT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR ALLEY (SPRING 1946)

	The tires of a car roll very quietly along the small alley;
	we notice a dark car approach the rear of BONASERA's funeral
	parlor.

	CLEMENZA gets out, and moves to the open, rear door.
	BONASERA greets him, too petrified to speak.  He notices TWO
	OTHER MEN get out of the car, and carry a stretcher with a
	CORPSE swaddled in a gray blanket, with yellowed feet
	protruding.

	BONASERA closes his eyes in fear, but indicates which way
	the MEN should carry their sinister burden.

	INT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR EMBALMING ROOM (SPRING 1946)

	They carry the CORPSE to one of the tables in the embalming
	room.

	Then BONASERA turns to see ANOTHER MAN step out of the
	darkness somewhat uncertainly.  It is DON CORLEONE.

	He walks up to BONASERA, very close, without speaking.  His
	cold eyes looking directly at the frightened UNDERTAKER.
	Then, after a long gaze:

				DON CORLEONE
		Well my friend, are you ready to do
		me this service?

	BONASERA nods.  The DON moves to the CORPSE on the embalming
	table; he makes a gesture, and the OTHER MEN leave them alone.

				BONASERA
		What do you wish me to do?

				DON CORLEONE
			  (staring at the table)
		I want you to use all your powers,
		all your skill, as you love me.  I
		do not want his mother to see him
		as he is.

	He draws down the gray blanket.

	BONASERA lets out a gasp of horror at what he sees:

	The bullet-smashed face of SONNY CORLEONE.

	EXT NITE: TOLL BOOTHS (SPRING 1946)

	SONNY extends his hand with a coin at the toll booth.

	A car suddenly swerves in front of him, trapping him in the
	booth, and in incredible rally of machine gun fire greets
	him, coming through and smashing the windows of the toll
	booths on both side of him, and from the front window of the
	car blocking him.

	The windows of his car are shot out.

	Bullet holes puncture the doors of his car.

	His hand, with the coin in it, falls inside the car.

	His arms, shoulders are riddled by the fire, and still it
	continues, as though the ASSASSINS cannot take a chance that
	he will survive it.

	Suddenly, he lets out an enormous ROAR, like a bull, and
	actually, opens the door, and steps out of the car, UNDER
	fire.

	His face is hit; and finally he falls to the ground.

	A FULL SHOT...as the ASSASSINS scramble for their cars and
	make off in the distance.

	SONNY's BODYGUARDS stop a safe distance away, realizing they
	are too late.

	INT NITE: DON'S LIVING ROOM (SPRING 1946)

	View on HAGEN's ashen face in the living room.  He is silent
	a moment, and then:

				HAGEN
			  (quietly)
		OK.  Go to Clemenza's house and
		tell him to come here right away.
		He'll tell you what to do.

	The MEN leave him alone.  He is quiet, standing in the
	middle of the living room a moment.  He looks in the
	direction of the kitchen, where he can see fragments of MAMA
	moving around.

	INT NITE: UPSTAIRS (SPRING 1946)

	TOM proceeds up stairs, and quietly in the direction of the
	DON's room.  He opens the DON's door.  Looks in.

	INT NITE: DON'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)

	The DON in his hospital bed.  Asleep under sedation.  HAGEN
	hesitates.  He cannot go in; he cannot tell the OLD MAN.  He
	closes the door.

	INT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (SPRING 1946)

	HAGEN alone in the office.  He is drinking.  He looks up at
	the sound of cars; the CAPOREGIMES are arriving.  Then he
	hears footsteps.

	The door opens; and in a robe, with slippers, DON CORLEONE
	slowly enters the room.  He walks directly to his stuffed
	armchair, sits down.  His face is stern, as he looks into
	HAGEN's eyes.

				DON CORLEONE
		Give me a drop of anisette.

	HAGEN rises, and pours a glass for the OLD MAN.

				DON CORLEONE
		My wife was weeping before she fell
		asleep, outside my window I saw my
		caporegimes to the house, and it is
		midnight.  So, Consigliere of mine,
		I think you should tell your Don
		what everyone knows.

				HAGEN
			  (quietly)
		I didn't tell Mama anything.  I was
		about to come up and wake you and
		tell you.  Just now.

				DON CORLEONE
		But you needed a drink first.

				HAGEN
		Yes.

				DON CORLEONE
		Now you've had your drink.

	Pause.

				HAGEN
		They shot Sonny on the Causeway.
			  (pause)
		He's dead.

	DON CORLEONE blinks.  One feels that just for a second he
	loses all physical strength; he clasps his hands in front of
	him on the top of the desk and looks into HAGEN's eyes.

				DON CORLEONE
		I want no inquiries made.  No acts
		of vengeance.
			  (pause)
		Consigliere, arrange a meeting with
		the heads of the five
		families...this war stops now.

	He rises and unsteadily leaves the room, turns...

				DON CORLEONE
		Call Bonasera...he will do me a
		service.

	And leaves.  HAGEN moves to the phone; dials...

				HAGEN
		This is Tom Hagen; I'm calling for
		Don Corleone, at his request.

				BONASERA (O.S.)
		Yes, I understand I'm listening.

				HAGEN
		You owe the Don a service.  He has
		no doubt that you will repay it.

	EXT DAY: BANK BUILDING (SPRING 1946)

	Day in Manhattan.  An impressive Bank Building in the
	financial center of New York.  Many limousines are parked,
	uniforms and plain-clothed CHAUFFEURS waiting quietly.

	INT DAY: BOARD ROOM (SPRING 1946)

	The Board Room of a bank, daylight shines in the windows.

	CARLO TRAMONTI, an impressive, handsome middle-aged man,
	sits quietly, smoking a Di Napoli cigar, OUR VIEW moves to a
	MAN sitting to his left, and a little to the rear, and
	settles on JOSEPH ZALUCHI, a moon-faced amiable-looking man;
	as the view continues, around the table, we HEAR:

				DON CORLEONE (O.S.)
		I want to thank you all for coming.
		I consider it a service done to me
		personally and I am in the debt of
		each and every one of you.
		Especially those of you who have
		traveled from such distances as
		California, St. Louis, Kansas City;
		and New Orleans...

	The VIEW PASSES to FRANK FALCONE and ANTHONY MOLINARI, both
	younger than any of the others; then on to DOMENICK PANZA,
	short and squat sitting in a wheelchair; then around the
	table to DON VINCENENZO FORLENZA, who is whispering to his
	JEWISH ASSISTANT; the VIEW PASSES on to ANTHONY STRACCI, an
	older man, sipping from a drink and smoking a cigar; OTTILIO
	CUNEO, in his middle sixties with a jolly round face; then
	DON PHILLIP TATTAGLIA, a delicate older man with dyed hair
	and a pencil mustache; and finally, EMILIO BARZINI, in his
	early sixties, a man to 'respect'; whom we had seen at
	CONNIE's Wedding.

				DON CORLEONE
		Ah well, let's get down to business.
		We are all honorable men here, we
		don't have to give assurances as if
		we were lawyers.
			  (he sits, gazes out
			  at them, and sighs)
		How did things ever go so far?
		Well, no matter.  A lot of
		foolishness has come to pass.  It
		was so unfortunate, so unnecessary.

	The VIEW examines the room once again, as the DON speaks.  A
	large, clicking board is changing numbers at various times,
	and two tapes, showing the fluctuations of the Market during
	the day's trading, and projected above.

	DON CORLEONE pauses; and TOM HAGEN hands him a cold drink.

				DON CORLEONE
		Tattaglia has lost a son; I have
		lost a son.  We are quits.  Let
		there be a peace...
			  (he gestures
			  expressively,
			  submissively, with
			  his hands)
		That is all I want...

				BARZINI
		Don Corleone is too modest.  He had
		the judges and politicians in his
		pocket and he refused to share them.
		His refusal is not the act of a
		friend.  He takes the bread out of
		the mouths of our families.  Times
		have changed, it's not like the old
		days where everyone can go his own
		way.  If Don Corleone had all the
		judges and politicians in New York,
		then he must share them or let
		others use them.  Certainly he can
		present a bill for such services,
		we're not Communists, after all.
		But he has to let us draw water
		from the well.  It's that simple.

				DON CORLEONE
		My friends, I didn't refuse out of
		malice.  You all know me.  When
		have I ever refused an accommodation?
		But why, this time?  Because I
		think this drug business will
		destroy us in the years to come.
		It's not like whiskey or gambling
		or even women which most people
		want and is forbidden them by the
		pezzonovante of the Church and the
		Government.  But drugs?  No.  Even
		policemen, who help us in gambling
		and other things would refuse to
		help us in drugs.  But...I am
		willing to do whatever all of you
		think is necessary.

				DON ZALUCHI
		I don't believe in drugs.  For
		years I paid my people extra so
		they wouldn't do that kind of
		business...$200 a week.  But it
		didn't matter.  Somebody comes to
		them and says, "I have powders, if
		you put up three, four thousand
		dollar investment, we can make
		fifty thousand distributing."  Who
		can resist such a profit?
		There's no way to control it, as a
		business...to keep it respectable.
			  (rapping the table)
		I don't want it near schools!  I
		don't want it sold to children.
		That is an infamita.
			  (thinking)
		In my city I would try to keep the
		traffic in the dark people, the
		colored.  They are the best
		customers, the least troublesome,
		and they are animals anyway.  They
		have no respect for their wives or
		their families or themselves.  Let
		them lose their souls with drugs.
		But something has to be done, we
		can't have everybody running around
		doing just what they please, like a
		bunch of anarchists.

				BARZINI
		Then, are we agreed; the traffic in
		drugs will be permitted, but
		controlled; and Don Corleone agrees
		to give it protection in the East.

	DON CORLEONE nods.

				BARZINI
		That's the whole matter then, we
		have the peace, and let me pay my
		respects to Don Corleone, whom we
		have all known over the years as a
		man of his word.
			  (noticing TATTAGLIA
			  is uneasy)
		Don Philip?

				TATTAGLIA
		I agree to everything here, I'm
		willing to forget my own misfortune.
		But I must hear strict assurance
		from Corleone.  When time goes by
		and his position becomes stronger,
		will he attempt any individual
		vengeance?

	They all look at the DON; especially HAGEN, who feels that
	DON CORLEONE has given a great deal, and must have something
	else in mind.  Slowly the DON rises.

				DON CORLEONE
		I forego my vengeance for my dead
		son, for the common good.  But I
		have selfish reasons.  My youngest
		son had to flee, accused of
		Sollozzo's murder, and I must now
		make arrangements so that he can
		come home with safety, cleared of
		all those false charges.  That is
		my affair, and I will make those
		arrangements.
			  (with strength)
		But I am a superstitious man...and
		so if some unlucky accident should
		befall my youngest son, if some
		police officer should accidentally
		shoot him, or if he should hang
		himself in his cell, or if my son
		is struck by a bolt of lightning,
		then I will blame some of the
		people here.  That, I could never
		forgive, but...aside from that, let
		me swear by the souls of my
		Grandchildren that I will never be
		the one to break the peace we have
		made.

	EXT NITE: DON'S LIMO (SPRING 1946)

	The DON's black limousine.  He sits quietly in the padded
	rear seat; TOM HAGEN next to him.

	It is night.  Lights flash by them every so often.

				HAGEN
		When I meet with Tattaglia's
		people; should I insist that all
		his drug middle-men be clean?

				DON CORLEONE
		Mention it, don't insist.  Barzini
		is a man who will know that without
		being told.

				HAGEN
		You mean Tattaglia.

				DON CORLEONE
			  (shaking his head)
		Barzini.

				HAGEN
			  (a revelation)
		He was the one behind Sollozzo?

				DON CORLEONE
		Tattaglia is a pimp.  He could
		never have outfought Santino.  But
		I wasn't sure until this day.  No,
		it was Barzini all along.

	The black limousine speeds away from us in the night.

	------------------------------------------FADE OUT------

	FADE IN:

	EXT DAY: ESTABLISHING SICILY SHOT

	A CLOSE VIEW OF MICHAEL, moving as he walks, sullen and
	downcast, the left side of his face healed, but left
	grotesque and misshapen.

	GRADUALLY, THE VIEW LOOSENS, he wears a warm navy Pea
	jacket, and walks with his hands in his pockets.

	THE VIEW LOOSENS FURTHER, revealing a Sicilian SHEPHERD on
	either side of him, each carrying a shotgun slung over his
	shoulder, CALO, a squat and husky young man with a simple
	honest quality, and FABRIZZIO, slender and handsome, likable,
	and with a pleasing build.  Each of the SHEPHERDS  carry
	knapsacks.

	The THREE YOUNG MEN continue over the Sicilian landscape,
	overlooking an impressive view of land and sea.

	EXT DAY: SICILY ROAD

	The THREE move through a flock of wind-blown sheep, and make
	their way to a dusty rural road.  We HEAR a rinky horn
	sound, as a pre-war Italian automobile makes its way to them.
	An OLD MAN peeks from the window, waving to MICHAEL.  The
	car pulls in front of them and stops.  MICHAEL nods
	respectfully.

				MICHAEL
		Don Tommassino.

				DON TOMMASSINO
		Michael, why must you do this.  We
		have been lucky so far, all these
		months you've been here we've kept
		your name a secret.  It is from
		love for your father that I've
		asked you never to more than an
		hour from the Villa.

				MICHAEL
		Calo and Fabrizzio are with me;
		nothing will happen.

				DON TOMMASSINO
		You must understand that your
		Father's enemies have friends in
		Palermo.

				MICHAEL
		I know.

				DON TOMMASSINO
		Where are you going?

				MICHAEL
		Corleone.

				DON TOMMASSINO
		There is nothing there.  Not anymore.

				MICHAEL
		I was told that my Grandfather was
		murdered on its main street; and
		his murderers came to kill my
		father there when he was twelve
		years old.

				DON TOMMASSINO
		Long ago.  Now there is nothing:
		the men killed each other in family
		vendettas...the others escaped to
		America.

				MICHAEL
		Don Tommassino...I should see this
		place.

	DON TOMMASSINO thinks a moment, then concedes.

				DON TOMMASSINO
		That is your birthright...but
		Michael, use this car.

				MICHAEL
		No...I would like to walk to
		Corleone.

	The OLD MAN sighs, and then returns to his car.

				DON TOMMASSINO
		Be careful Michael, don't let them
		know your name.

	The old car sputters off; MICHAEL watches, and then continues
	on his journey.

	EXT DAY: COUNTRYSIDE

	The THREE pass through abundant areas of flowers and fruit
	trees, in bloom and bursting with life.

	EXT DAY: VILLAGE

	They continue in the empty streets of a little town; the
	post-war poverty is evident in the skinny dogs; and the
	empty streets.  Occasionally, a military vehicle, the only
	gasoline-powered vehicles on the road, will pass.  And there
	are many POLICE evident, most of them carrying machine guns.

	The THREE pass under an enormous banner slung over the main
	road "VOTA COMMUNISTA".

	EXT DAY: COUNTRY ROAD

	They continue through dusty country roads, where occasionally
	a donkey pulling a cart, or a lone horseman will pass them.

	EXT DAY: FIELD

	Out in a field, in the distance, they come upon a procession
	of peasants and activists, perhaps two hundred strong,
	marching, and singing, and in the lead, are five or six men
	carrying billowing red banners.

	EXT DAY: GROVE

	They are in an orange grove; on the other side of the trees
	is a deep, tall field of wild flowers.

	The Shepherds unsling their guns and knapsacks, and take out
	loaves of bread, some wine, sausage and cheese.

	MICHAEL rests against a tree, and uses his handkerchief.

				FABRIZZIO
		You tell us about America.

				MICHAEL
		How do you know I come from America?

				FABRIZZIO
		We hear.  We were told you were a
		Pezzonovanta...big shot.

				MICHAEL
		Only the son of a Pezzonovanta.

				FABRIZZIO
		Hey America!  Is she as rich as
		they say?

				MICHAEL
		Yes.

				FABRIZZIO
		Take me to America!  You need a
		good lupara in America?
			  (pats his shotgun)
		You take me, I'll be the best man
		you got.  "Oh say, can you
		seeee...By da star early light..."

	MICHAEL laughs.

	EXT DAY: ANOTHER ROAD

	The TRIO continues down a dirt road, as an American Military
	convoy speeds by; FABRIZZIO waves, and calls out to each of
	the U.S. drivers, as they move by.

				FABRIZZIO
		America.
		Hey America!
		Take me with you!
		Hey, take me to America G.I.!

	EXT DAY: CORLEONE HILL

	They continue their long hike, high on a promentory; until
	they hesitate, and look down.

				CALO
		Corleone.

	They can see a grim Sicilian village, almost devoid of people.

	EXT DAY: CORLEONE STREET

	MICHAEL and his bodyguards move through the empty streets of
	the village.  They walk behind him, and spread to either
	side about fifteen feet away from him.

	They move down ancient steps, past an old stone fountain.
	MICHAEL hesitates, cups his hands and drinks some water.
	They go on.

	They move up a very narrow old street.  MICHAEL looks at the
	doorways that they pass.

	MOVING VIEW: Each door has a plaque, with a ribbon or flower.

	CALO sees MICHAEL looking.

				CALO
		The names of the dead.

	MICHAEL hesitates in the center of the main street.  He looks.

	The street is empty, barren.  Occasionally, an old woman
	will pass.

	MICHAEL turns his head.

	The other side of the street: empty and deathly.

	A HIGH VIEW of MICHAEL standing in the center of the old
	street, the shepherds a respectful distance away.

	-------------------------------------FADE OUT-----------

	EXT DAY: BARONIAL ESTATE

	A green ribboned field of a baronial Estate.  Further ahead
	is a villa so Roman it looks as though it had just been
	discovered in the ruins of Pompeii.  There is a group of
	young village GIRLS accompanied by two stocky MATRONS,
	dressed in black.  They have been gathering the pink sulla,
	purple wisteria, and mixing them with orange and lemon
	blossoms.  They are singing, off in the distance as they work.

	MICHAEL, CALO and FABRIZZIO are silent as they watch this
	Fantasy-like scene.

				FABRIZZIO
			  (calling out to them)
		Hey, beautiful girls!

				MICHAEL
			  (sternly)
		Shhhhh.

	He settles down to watch.

	The GIRLS are dressed in cheap gaily painted frocks that
	cling to their bodies.  They are still in their teens, but
	developed and womanly.

	They are moving along the fields, picking blossoms, not
	aware of the three men watching them from the orange grove.
	Three or four of the girls begin chasing one of them
	playfully, in the direction of the grove.

	The GIRL being chased holds a bunch of purple grapes in her
	left hand and with the right, picks more grapes, and throws
	them back at her pursuers laughing.

	They come closer and closer.  Just short of the grove, she
	poses, startled, her large, oval shaped eyes catching the
	view of the THREE MEN.  She stands there on her toes about
	to run.

	MICHAEL sees her; now face to face.  He looks.

	Her face.  Incredibly beautiful with olive skin, black hair
	and a rich mouth.

				FABRIZZIO
			  (murmuring)
		Jesus Christ, take my soul.  I'm
		dying.

	Quickly, she turns, and runs away.

	MICHAEL stands up never taking his eyes from her.  We hold
	on him for a long while; and eventually hear the SHEPHERDS
	laughing.  Then he turns to them.

				FABRIZZIO
		You got hit by the thunderbolt, eh?

	CALO pats him on the shoulder.

				CALO
		Easy man.

				MICHAEL
		What are you talking about?

				FABRIZZIO
		You can't hide it when you're hit
		by the thunderbolt.

	EXT DAY: BARONIAL VILLAGE

	The little village built attendant to the Baronial Estate,
	is decked with the flowers the girls had been picking.

	MICHAEL, followed by the bodyguards, moves into the central
	square, and onto the balcony of a little cafe.

	The proprietor of the cafe, VITELLI, is a short burly man;
	he greets them cheerfully, and sets a dish of chickpeas at
	their table.

				FABRIZZIO
		You know all the girls in this
		town, eh?  We saw some beauties
		coming down the road.  One in
		particular got our friend hit with
		the Thunderbolt...
			  (he indicates MICHAEL)

	VITELLI gives a big knowing laugh, and looks at MICHAEL with
	new interest.

				VITELLI
		You had better bring a few bottles
		home with you, my friend; you'll
		need help sleeping tonight.
			  (he laughs)

				FABRIZZIO
		This one could seduce the devil.  A
		body! and eyes as big and black as
		olives.

				VITELLI
			  (laughing with
			  them...pouring more wine)
		I know about what you mean!

				FABRIZZIO
		This was a beauty.  Right, Calo?

				VITELLI
			  (laughing)
		Beautiful all over, eh?

				FABRIZZIO
		And hair.  Black and curly, like a
		doll.  And such a mouth.

	VITELLI does not laugh quite so much.

				VITELLI
		Yes, we have beautiful girls here...
		but virtuous.

	VITELLI is no longer drinking with them.

				MICHAEL
		She wore a red dress, and a red
		ribbon in her hair.  She looks more
		Greek than Italian.  Do you know a
		beauty like that?

	As MICHAEL describes her, VITELLI laughed less and less,
	until he wears a scowl.

				VITELLI
		No.

	Then he curtly leaves him, and walks into the back room.

				FABRIZZIO
		God in Heaven, I think I
		understand...

	He goes into the back room after the innkeeper.  Then he
	returns.

				FABRIZZIO
		Let's get out of here; he's boiling
		up his blood to do us mischief.
		It's his daughter.

	They start to leave; but MICHAEL doesn't move.

				CALO
		Come quickly.

				MICHAEL
		Innkeeper.  More wine!

				FABRIZZIO
			  (whispered)
		The old bastard mentioned two sons
		he only has to whistle up.

	MICHAEL turns to FABRIZZIO with his cold authority.

				MICHAEL
		Tell him to come to me.

	The two BODYGUARDS shoulder their luparas, and disappear in
	a moment they return with the red-faced angry VITELLI
	between them.

				MICHAEL
			  (quietly)
		I understand I've offended you by
		talking about your daughter.  I
		offer you my apologies, I'm a
		stranger in this country, I don't
		know the customs very well.  Let me
		say this, I meant no disrespect to
		you or her...

	CALO and FABRIZZIO are impressed.

				VITELLI
			  (shrugs)
		Who are you and what do you want
		from my daughter?

				MICHAEL
		I am an American hiding in Sicily
		from the police of my country.  My
		name is Michael.  You can inform
		the police and make your fortune
		but then your daughter would lose a
		father rather than gain a husband.
		In any case, I want to meet your
		daughter.  With your permission and
		under the supervision of your
		family.  With all decorum.  With
		all respect.  I am an honorable man.

	CALO and FABRIZZIO are stupefied; VITELLI pauses, and then
	asks:

				VITELLI
		Are you a friend of the friends?

				MICHAEL
		When the proper time comes, I'll
		tell you everything that a wife's
		father should know.

				FABRIZZIO
		It's the real Thunderbolt, then.

				VITELLI
			  (formally)
		Come Sunday morning:  My name is
		Vitelli and my house is up there on
		the hill, above the village.

				MICHAEL
		Your daughter's name?

				VITELLI
		Appolonia.

	-------------------------------------FADE OUT-----------

	EXT DAY: TOMMASSINO COURTYARD

	MUSIC comes up; as MICHAEL, dressed in new clothes from
	Palermo, and carrying a stack of wrapped gifts, gets into an
	Alfa Romeo.  CALO and FABRIZZIO each dressed in their Sunday
	best, are in the rear seat, huddled together, with their
	luparas on their shoulders.

	DON TOMMASSINO waves them off, as the little car drives off,
	rocky and bouncing on the dirt road.

	The Sunday churchbells ring.

	--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------

	EXT DAY: VITELLI HOUSE

	MICHAEL is presented to each of the Vitelli relatives, by
	the yard of their little hilltop house; the BROTHERS; the
	MOTHER, who is given a gift; several UNCLES and AUNTS.
	Finally APPOLONIA enters, dressed beautifully in appropriate
	Sunday clothing.  Now he presents the wrapped gift to
	APPOLONIA.  She looks at her MOTHER, who with a nod gives
	her permission to open it.  She unwraps it.  Her eyes light
	at the sight of a heavy gold chain; to be worn as a necklace.

	She looks at him.

				APPOLONIA
		Grazia.

	--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------

	EXT DAY: VITELLI CAFE

	Now the little Alpha drives into the village near VITELLI's
	cafe.

	MICHAEL is, as ever, accompanied with his two BODYGUARDS,
	though they are all dressed differently.

	They go up to the cafe...and sit with VITELLI, who is
	talking and talking.

	MICHAEL looks at APPOLONIA; who sits, respectfully quiet.
	She wears the gold necklace around her neck.

	--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------

	EXT DAY: HILLTOP NEAR VITELLI HOME

	MICHAEL and APPOLONIA are walking through a hilltop path,
	seemingly alone, although a respectful distance apart.

	As the VIEW PANS with them, we notice that her MOTHER and a
	half dozen AUNTS are twenty paces behind them, and ten paces
	further behind are CALO and FABRIZZIO, their luparas on
	their shoulders.

	Further up the hill, APPOLONIA stumbles on a loose stone,
	and falls briefly onto MICHAEL's arm.  She modestly regains
	her balance, and they continue walking.

	Behind them, her MOTHER giggles to herself.

	--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------

	EXT DAY: VITELLI VILLAGE CHURCH

	Church bells in an ancient belfry ring out.  Music, old and
	dissonant, plays.

	There is a bridal procession in the street of the village;
	the same in feeling and texture as it might have been five
	hundred years ago.

	Donkeys and other animals have been decorated with abundant
	flowers; children carrying candles and wearing white
	confirmation gowns walk in the procession, followed by
	countless townspeople, members of the clergy, even the police.

	We present the entire bridal procession and ceremony with
	all the ritual and pageantry, as it has always been, in
	Sicily.

	APPOLONIA is radiant as the Bride; MICHAEL is handsome
	despite the grotesque jaw and occasional white handkerchief.

	--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------

	EXT NITE: VITELLI VILLAGE SQUARE

	CALO and FABRIZZIO dance wildly through the night of the
	great wedding celebration.  It is held in the Village
	Square; under the watchful eyes of SHEPHERDS above on the
	tops of buildings, carrying luparas.

	--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------

	INT NITE: MICHAEL'S ROOM IN VILLA

	MICHAEL opens the shutters in his darkened room; moonlight
	fills the room.

	He turns, and there, in her wedding slip, is APPOLONIA.  A
	little frightened; but lovely.

	He moves to her; and for a moment just stands before her,
	looking at her incredible face; her lovely hair and body.

	Slowly and tenderly he kisses her.  Her tiny hands come up
	to his face; touch his cheek and embrace him.

	She lets her bridal slip fall to the floor.

	--------------------------------------FADE OUT----------

	INT DAY: MICHAEL'S ROOM AT VILLA

	Morning.  MICHAEL sits on the window ledge, gazing into the
	room.

	APPOLONIA is asleep; she is naked, and only partially
	covered by the bedsheets.

	He looks at her for a long time in the early morning light.

	EXT DAY: TOMMASSINO COURTYARD

	HIGH ANGLE ON DON TOMMASSINO'S VILLA

	We HEAR girlish laughter; the little Alpha is driving
	erratically, knocking down an occasional wall, and almost
	hitting th inner court wall.

	APPOLONIA is laughing, driving.  MICHAEL pretends to be
	frightened, as he teaches her to drive.

	Outside the walls, we notice SHEPHERDS with luparas, walking
	guard duty.

	The car stops and a laughing MICHAEL gets out.

				MICHAEL
		It's safer to teach you English.

				APPOLONIA
		Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
		Thursday, Friday...See, I learned
		it.  Now teach me to drive!

	DON TOMMASSINO enters the Courtyard.  He seems tired and
	concerned.

				MICHAEL
		Ciao, Don Tommassino.

	APPOLONIA kisses him.

				MICHAEL
		Things went badly in Palermo?

				DON TOMMASSINO
		The younger men have no respect.
		Things are changing; I don't know
		what will happen.  Michael, because
		of the wedding, people now know
		your name.

				MICHAEL
		Is that why there are more men on
		the walls?

				DON TOMMASSINO
		Even so, I don't think it is safe
		here anymore.  I've made plans to
		move you to a villa near Siracuse.
		You must go right away.

				MICHAEL
		What is it?

				DON TOMMASSINO
		Bad news from America.  Your
		brother, Santino.  He has been
		killed.

	For a moment, the whole world of New York, Sollozzo, the
	Five Family War, all comes back to MICHAEL.

	EXT DAY: VILLA COURTYARD

	Morning.  MICHAEL leans out of the bedroom window.

	Below, FABRIZZIO is sitting in one of the garden chairs,
	combing his thick hair.

	MICHAEL whistles and FABRIZZIO looks up to his window.

				MICHAEL
		Get the car.  I'll be leaving in
		ten minutes.  Where's Calo?

				FABRIZZIO
		Calo is having a cup of coffee in
		the kitchen.  Is your wife coming
		with you?

				MICHAEL
		No, she's going home to her family.
		She'll join me in a few weeks...

	INT DAY: VILLA KITCHEN

	MICHAEL, dressed, crosses from the hallway, and into the
	kitchen.  CALO is just finishing a bite.  He rises when he
	sees MICHAEL.

				CALO
		Should I get your bag?

				MICHAEL
		No, I'll get it.  Where's Appolonia?

				CALO
			  (smiling)
		She is sitting in the driver's seat
		of the car, dying to step on the
		gas.  She'll be a real American
		woman before she gets to America.

	MICHAEL smiles.

				MICHAEL
		Tell Fabrizzio and wait for me in
		the car.

	He leaves the kitchen, after a quick sip of coffee.

	He looks out from the opening in the doorway.

	EXT DAY: VILLA COURTYARD

	There is the car, with APPOLONIA sitting in the driver's
	seat, playing with the wheel like a child.

	CALO moves to the car, and puts a lunch basket in the rear
	seat.

	Then MICHAEL seems disturbed.

	Over, on the other side of the courtyard, he sees FABRIZZIO
	disappear through the gate.

				MICHAEL
			  (muttering to himself)
		Where the hell is he going?

	MICHAEL goes down the hallway, and outside.

	MICHAEL steps out into the bright sunlight of the outer
	courtyard, causing him to shade his eyes.

	APPOLONIA sees him, and waves, motioning that he should stay
	where he is.

				APPOLONIA
			  (calling out)
		I'll drive to you.

	He smiles affectionately.

	CALO stands beside the car, smiling, with his lupara dangling
	by his side.  There is no sight of FABRIZZIO.  Suddenly the
	smile fades from MICHAEL's face.  He steps forward and holds
	out his hand.

				MICHAEL
		No.  No!

	His shout is drowned in the roar of a tremendous EXPLOSION,
	as she switched on the ignition.

	Part of the wall is caved in, the kitchen door is blown off;
	and there is nothing left of the Alpha, or of Appolonia.

	MICHAEL is thrown against the wall, and knocked unconscious.

	INT DAY: VILLA BEDROOM

	MICHAEL is unconscious in a darkened room.  We hear
	whispering around him, but can't make any of it out.  A soft
	cloth is applied to his face; gradually his eyes open.  DON
	TOMMASSINO is there, close to him.  He looks at them and
	from their grave expressions, he knows his wife is dead.

				MICHAEL
		Fabrizzio.  Let your shepherds know
		that the one who gives me Fabrizzio
		will own the finest pastures in
		Sicily.

	--------------------------------------FADE OUT----------

	FADE IN:

	EXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1951)

	Easter.

	A HIGH VIEW ON THE CORLEONE MALL in the springtime.  Hordes
	of little CHILDREN including many of the Corleone Children
	and Grandchilren, rush about carrying little Easter baskets,
	searching here and there for candy treasures and hidden
	Easter eggs.

	The DON himself, much older, much smaller in size, wearing
	baggy pants and a plaid shirt and an old hat, moves around
	his garden, tending rows and rows of rich tomato plants.

	Suddenly, he stops and looks.

	MICHAEL stands there, still holding his suitcase.

	Great emotion comes over the DON, who takes a few steps in
	MICHAEL's direction.

	MICHAEL leaves his suitcase and walks to his favorite son
	and embraces him.

				DON CORLEONE
		Be my son...

	INT DAY: THE OLIVE OIL FACTORY

	DON CORLEONE leads MICHAEL through the corridors of the
	building.

				DON CORLEONE
		This old building has seen its day.
		No way to do business...too small,
		too old.

	They enter the DON's glass-panelled office.

				DON CORLEONE
		Have you thought about a wife?  A
		family?

				MICHAEL
			  (pained)
		No.

				DON CORLEONE
		I understand, Michael.  But you
		must make a family, you know.

				MICHAEL
		I want children, I want a family.
		But I don't know when.

				DON CORLEONE
		Accept what's happened, Michael.

				MICHAEL
		I could accept everything that's
		happened; I could accept it, but
		that I never had a choice.  From
		the time I was born, you had laid
		this all out for me.

				DON CORLEONE
		No, I wanted other things for you.

				MICHAEL
		You wanted me to be your son.

				DON CORLEONE
		Yes, but sons who would be
		professors, scientists,
		musicians...and grandchildren who
		could be, who knows, a Governor, a
		President even, nothing's impossible
		here in America.

				MICHAEL
		Then why have I become a man like
		you?

				DON CORLEONE
		You are like me, we refuse to be
		fools, to be puppets dancing on a
		string pulled by other men.  I
		hoped the time for guns and killing
		and massacres was over.  That was
		my misfortune.  That was your
		misfortune.  I was hunted on the
		streets of Corleone when I was
		twelve years old because of who my
		father was.  I had no choice.

				MICHAEL
		A man has to choose what he will be.
		I believe that.

				DON CORLEONE
		What else do you believe in?

	MICHAEL doesn't answer.

				DON CORLEONE
		Believe in a family.  Can you
		believe in your country?  Those
		Pezzonovante of the State who
		decide what we shall do with our
		lives?  Who declare wars they wish
		us to fight in to protect what they
		own.  Do you put your fate in the
		hands of men whose only talent is
		that they tricked a bloc of people
		to vote for them?  Michael, in five
		years the Corleone family can be
		completely legitimate.  Very
		difficult things have to happen to
		make that possible.  I can't do
		them anymore, but you can, if you
		choose to.

	MICHAEL listens.

				DON CORLEONE
		Believe in a family; believe in a
		Code of Honor, older and higher,
		believe in Roots that go back
		thousands of years into your Race.
		Make a family, Michael, and protect
		it.  These are our affairs, sono cosa
		nostra, Governments only protect
		men who have their own individual
		power.  Be one of those men...you
		have the choice.

	--------------------------------------FADE OUT----------

	EXT DAY: STOCK FOOTAGE LAS VEGAS (1955)

	A MOVING VIEW, driving up the Las Vegas Strip of 1955.

				FREDO (O.S.)
		There's a new one.  Construction
		going on everywhere.

	MORE VIEWS, showing new hotels and casinos being built; the
	bill marquees read: "MARTIN AND LEWIS", "PATTI PAGE", etc.

				FREDO (O.S.)
		That's one of the family's new ones.
		Not bad, eh?

	EXT DAY: FLAMINGO (1955)

	The car pulls up at the Flamingo Hotel.

	Inside the car: MICHAEL, FREDO, TOM HAGEN and a new man,
	NERI, quiet and sinister.

				MICHAEL
		Why didn't Moe Green meet us at the
		airport?

				FREDO
		He had business at the hotel, but
		he'll drop in for dinner.

	From the expression on MICHAEL's face we know this is a
	discourtesy.

	INT DAY: FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE (1955)

	A whole entourage precedes FREDO and his V.I.P. party of
	MICHAEL, HAGEN and NERI.  Great fuss is made.  They are
	being shown into the hotel's 'special' suite.

				FREDO
		You look wonderful, kid; really
		wonderful.  That doctor did some
		job on your face.

				MICHAEL
		You look good, too.

	They enter the suite.

				FREDO
		Nice, eh?

	FREDO is as excited as a kid, snapping orders at the
	bellboys, waiters and maids.

				FREDO
			  (hurrying into the bedroom)
		Kid, take a look-see.

	MICHAEL gives a look to HAGEN, and continues into the bedroom.

	There is an enormous circular bed on a huge platform,
	mirrors to each side.  FREDO points upward.

	A VIEW into a large CEILING mirror.

				FREDO
		Ever seen anything like that before?

				MICHAEL
			  (dryly)
		No.

	INT NITE: FLAMINGO SUITE BEDROOM (1955)

	MICHAEL is alone in the bedroom.  He is just finishing
	dressing; he puts on his jacket.  From the window, with the
	lights blinking, we can tell it's late at night.  MICHAEL
	passes into the other room.

	He stops, looks.  He is disturbed.

	INT NITE: FLAMINGO SUITE (1955)

	A magnificent, circular table has been set up in his suite;
	a lavish table setting for eight.  Standing by the table are
	HAGEN, JOHNNY FONTANE, looking wonderful, a little heavier,
	beautifully dressed; FREDO, a dandy, and TWO LAS VEGAS GIRLS.
	NERI stands quietly by the door.

				FREDO
		Mike!  The party starting!

				MICHAEL
		Come here a minute, Fredo.

	FREDO goes to him, a big smile all over his face.

				MICHAEL
		Who are those girls?

				FREDO
			  (jokingly)
		That's for you to find out.

				MICHAEL
		Give them some money and send them
		home.

				FREDO
		Mike!

				MICHAEL
		Get rid of them...

	INT NITE: FLAMINGO SUITE (1955)

	They are seated around the lavish table in Michael's suite.
	MICHAEL is speaking to JOHNNY.

				MICHAEL
		Johnny, the Corleone family is
		thinking of selling out all our
		interests in the Olive Oil business
		and settling here.  Moe Greene will
		sell us his interest so it can be
		wholly owned by friends of the
		family.

	FREDDIE seems anxious.

				FREDO
		Mike, you sure about Moe selling.
		He never mentioned it to me and he
		loves the business.

				MICHAEL
		I'll make him an offer he can't
		refuse.

	MICHAEL turns to JOHNNY.

				MICHAEL
		Johnny, the Don wants you to help
		us get started.  We figure
		entertainment will be the big
		factor in drawing gamblers.  We
		hope you'll sign a contract to
		appear five times a year for maybe
		a week long engagement.
		We hope your friends in the movies
		will do the same.  We count on you
		to convince them.

				JOHNNY
		Sure, I'll do anything for my
		Godfather.  You know that, Mike.

	There is knock on the door.  NERI rises, looks at MICHAEL,
	who nods.  NERI opens the door, and MOE GREENE enters,
	followed by TWO BODYGUARDS.  He is a handsome hood, dressed
	in the Hollywood style.  His BODYGUARDS are more West Coast
	style.

				MOE
		Mike, good to see you.  Got
		everything you want?

				MICHAEL
		Thanks.

				MOE
		The chef cooked for you special;
		the dancers will kick your tongue
		out and you credit is good!
			  (to his BODYGUARDS)
		Draw chips for all these people so
		they can play on the house.

				MICHAEL
		Is my credit good enough to buy you
		out?

	MOE laughs.

				MOE
		Buy me out?...

				MICHAEL
		The hotel, the casino.  The Corleone
		family wants to buy you out.

	GREENE stops laughing; the room becomes tense.  NERI eyes
	the BODYGUARDS.

				MOE
			  (furious)
		The Corleone family wants to buy me
		out.  I buy you out.  You don't buy
		me out.

				MICHAEL
		Your casino loses money.  Maybe we
		can do better.

				MOE
		You think I scam?

				MICHAEL
			  (the worst insult)
		You're unlucky.

				MOE
		You goddamn dagos.  I do you a
		favor and take Freddie in when
		you're having a bad time, and then
		you try to push me out.

				MICHAEL
		You took Freddie in because the
		Corleone family bankrolled your
		casino.  You and the Corleone
		family are evened out.  This is for
		business; name your price.

				MOE
		The Corleone family don't have that
		kind of muscle anymore.  The
		Godfather is sick.  You're getting
		chased out of New York by Barzini
		and the other families, and you
		think you can find easier pickings
		here.  I've talked to Barzini; I
		can make a deal with him and keep
		my hotel!

				MICHAEL
			  (quietly, deadly)
		Is that why you thought you could
		slap Freddie around in public?

				FREDO
			  (his face turns red)
		Ah Mike, that was nothing.  Moe
		didn't mean anything.  He flies off
		the handle sometimes; but me and
		him are good friends.  Right, Moe?

				MOE
		Yeah sure.  Sometimes I gotta kick
		asses to make this place run right.
		Freddie and I had a little argument
		and I had to straighten him out.

				MICHAEL
		You straightened my brother out?

				MOE
		Hell, he was banging cocktail
		waitresses two at a time.  Players
		couldn't get a drink.

	MICHAEL rises from his chair, and says in a tone of dismissal:

				MICHAEL
		I have to go back to New York
		tomorrow.  Think of your price.

				MOE
		You son of a bitch, you think you
		can brush me off like that?  I made
		my bones when you were going out
		with cheerleaders.

				FREDO
			  (frightened)
		Tom, you're the Consigliere; you
		can talk to the Don and advise him.

				MICHAEL
		The Don has semi-retired.  I'm
		running the Family business now.
		So anything you have to say, say it
		to me.

	Nobody answers.  MICHAEL nods to NERI, who opens the door.
	MOE exits angrily.

				MICHAEL
		Freddie, you're my older brother.
		I love you.  But don't ever take
		sides with anybody against the
		Family again.

	EXT DAY: N.Y. AIRPORT (1955)

	KAY sits in the back of a limousine parked by the Newark
	AIRPORT.  ROCCO LAMPONE is leaning against it.

	She has a little three year old boy; MICHAEL's son, who
	plays with a cardboard bird on a string.

	Two other cars are stationed discreetly, with men we have
	learned to tell are bodyguards.

	MICHAEL, HAGEN and NERI exit the airport with TWO NEGRO
	PORTERS carrying luggage.

	NERI sees something, and taps MICHAEL on the shoulder.

	MICHAEL turns, and sees KAY.

	LAMPONE opens the car door; KAY steps out with the BOY, and
	MICHAEL embraces her, and kisses his son.  Automatically,
	the luggage is put in.  NERI replaces LAMPONE as the driver;
	and LAMPONE joins the other men.  HAGEN gets into one of the
	other cars.

	And the limo drives off, preceded and followed by the other
	sedans.

	INT DAY: LIMO (1955)

	The little BOY looks out the window as they drive.

				MICHAEL
		I have to see my father and his
		people when we get back to the Mall.

				KAY
		Oh Michael.

				MICHAEL
		We'll go to the show tomorrow
		night--we can change the tickets.

				KAY
		Don't you want dinner first?

				MICHAEL
		No, you eat...don't wait up for me.

				KAY
		Wake me up when you come to bed?

	The little BOY flies his cardboard bird out of the speeding
	limousine window.

	EXT DAY: MALL (1955)

	The limousine arrives at the Mall.  We are inside.

				KAY
		Your sister wants to ask you
		something.

				MICHAEL
		Let HER ask.

	NERI opens the door.  KAY wants to talk just a little more.

				KAY
		She's afraid to.  Michael...

	MICHAEL nods to NERI; who gives them their privacy a moment
	longer.

				KAY
		Why are you so cold to her and
		Carlo?  They live with us on the
		Mall now, but you never get close
		to them.

				MICHAEL
		I'm busy.

				KAY
		Connie and Carlo want you to be
		godfather to their little boy.

	NERI opens the door; MICHAEL starts to get out; KAY too.

	He smiles at her, tired, and a little sad.

				KAY
		Will you?

				MICHAEL
		Let me think about it, O.K.?

	She smiles; MICHAEL goes with NERI to the Main House; KAY
	and the little BOY move to the house that was Sonny's.

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (1955)

	VIEW ON DON CORLEONE, much older, much smaller in size.  He
	wears baggy pants, and a warm plaid shirt.  He sits in a
	chair, gazing out through the window, into the garden.

				TESSIO (O.S.)
		Barzini's people chisel my territory
		and we do nothing about it.  Pretty
		soon there won't be one place in
		Brooklyn I can hang my hat.

				MICHAEL (O.S.)
		Just be patient.

				TESSIO
		I'm not asking you for help, Mike.
		Just take off the handcuffs.

				MICHAEL (O.S.)
		Be patient.

				CLEMENZA (O.S.)
		We gotta fight sometime.  Let us at
		least recruit our regimes to full
		strength.

				MICHAEL (O.S.)
		No, I don't want to give Barzini an
		excuse to start fighting.

				TESSIO (O.S.)
		Mike, you're wrong.

				CLEMENZA (O.S.)
		Don Corleone...Don Corleone.

	The OLD MAN looks up.  CLEMENZA stand before him in the Den.
	Beside him is an anxious TESSIO.  NERI stands by the door;
	HAGEN is seated; MICHAEL sits behind the big desk.

				CLEMENZA
		You said there would come a day
		when Tessio and me could form our
		own Families.  Only with your
		benediction, of course.  I ask
		permission...

				DON CORLEONE
		My son is head of the Family now.
		If you have his permission, you
		have my good will.

				MICHAEL
		In six months you can break off
		from the Corleone Family and go on
		your own.  Carlo, I'm counting on
		you to make the move to Nevada;
		you'll be my right-hand man out
		there.  Tom Hagen is no longer the
		Consigliere.

	Everyone is a bit surprised; look to see HAGEN's reaction.
	He remains inexpressive.

				MICHAEL
		He's going to be our lawyer in
		Vegas.  Nobody goes to him with any
		other business as of now, this
		minute.  No reflection on Tom;
		that's the way I want it.  Besides,
		if I ever need any advice, who's a
		better Consigliere than my father.

				CLEMENZA
		Then in a six month time we're on
		our own; is that it?

				MICHAEL
		Maybe less...

				TESSIO
		Let us fill up our Regimes.

				MICHAEL
		No.  I want things very calm for
		another six months.

				TESSIO
		Forgive me, Godfather, let our
		years of friendship be my excuse.
		How can you hope for success there
		without your strength here to back
		you up?  The two  go hand in hand.
		And with you gone from here the
		Barzini and the Tattaglias will be
		too strong for us.

				CLEMENZA
		And I don't like Barzini.  I say
		the Corleone Family has to move
		from strength, not weakness.  We
		should build our Regimes and take
		back our lost territories in Staten
		Island, at least.

				DON CORLEONE
		Do you have faith in my judgement?

				CLEMENZA
		Yes, Godfather...

				DON CORLEONE
		Then do what Michael says...

				MICHAEL
		All I can say is that things are
		being resolved that are more
		effective than a thousand buttonmen
		on the streets.  Understood?

	There are uneasy looks all around.

				CARLO
		Understood.  I just wish I was
		doing more to help out.

				MICHAEL
		I'll come to you when I need you.

	He looks at CLEMENZA, TESSIO and HAGEN.  They all nod,
	reluctantly.

				MICHAEL
		All right, then it's resolved.

	NERI knows the meeting is over, he opens the Den's door.

	CLEMENZA and TESSIO pay their respects to the DON and leave,
	then CARLO.  NERI watches CARLO as he walks down the
	corridor, casting a nervous look back at the sinister man.

	Then NERI closes the door.

	MICHAEL relaxes.

				HAGEN
		Mike, why are you cutting me out of
		the action?

				MICHAEL
		Tom, we're going to be legitimate
		all the way, and you're the legal
		man.  What could be more important
		than that.

				HAGEN
		I'm not talking about that.  I'm
		talking about Rocco Lampone building
		a secret regime.  Why does Neri
		report directly to you, rather than
		through me or a caporegime?

				DON CORLEONE
		I told you that it wouldn't escape
		his eye.

				MICHAEL
		How did you find out?

				HAGEN
		Bookkeepers know everything.
		Rocco's men are all a little too
		good for the jobs they're supposed
		to be doing.  They get a little
		more money than the job's worth.
			  (pause)
		Lampone's a good man; he's operating
		perfectly.

				MICHAEL
		Not so perfectly if you noticed.

				HAGEN
		Mike, why am I out?

				MICHAEL
		You're not a wartime Consigliere.
		Things may get tough with the move
		we're trying.

				HAGEN
		OK, but then I agree with Tessio.
		You're going about it all wrong;
		you're making the move out of
		weakness... Barzini's a wolf, and
		if he tears you apart, the other
		families won't come running to help
		the Corleones...

				DON CORLEONE
		Tom, I never thought you were a bad
		Consigliere, I thought Santino a
		bad Don, rest in peace.  He had a
		good heart but he wasn't the right
		man to head the family when I had
		my misfortune.  Michael has all my
		confidence, as you do.  For reasons
		which you can't know, you must have
		no part in what will happen.

				HAGEN
		Maybe I can help.

				MICHAEL
			  (coldly)
		You're out, Tom.

	TOM pauses, thinks...and then he nods in acquiescence.  TOM
	leaves.

	MICHAEL looks at NERI.

				MICHAEL
		I'm going to talk to my father.

	NERI nods, and then leaves.  The DON opens the doors,
	breathes in the air, and steps outside.

	EXT DAY: THE GARDEN (1955)

				DON CORLEONE
		I see you have your Luca Brasi.

				MICHAEL
		I'll need him.

				DON CORLEONE
		There are men in this world who
		demand to be killed.  They argue in
		gambling games; they jump out of
		their cars in a rage if someone so
		much as scratches their fender.
		These people wander through the
		streets calling out "Kill me, kill
		me."  Luca Brasi was like that.
		And since he wasn't scared of
		death, and in fact, looked for
		it...I made him my weapon.  Because
		I was the only person in the world
		that he truly hoped would not kill
		him.  I think you have done the
		same with this man.

	They walk through the DON's vegetable garden.  Tomatoes,
	peppers, carefully tended, and covered with a silky netting.
	MICHAEL follows; the DON turns and looks at him.  Then
	stoops over to right a tomato plant that had been pushed over.

				DON CORLEONE
		Barzini will move against you first.

				MICHAEL
		How?

				DON CORLEONE
		He will get in touch with you
		through someone you absolutely
		trust.  That person will arrange a
		meeting, guarantee your safety...

	He rises, and looks at Michael...

				DON CORLEONE
		...and at that meeting you will be
		assassinated.

	The DON walks on further.

				DON CORLEONE
		Your wife and children...you're
		happy with them?

				MICHAEL
		Yes.

				DON CORLEONE
		Good.

	MICHAEL wants to express something...hesitates, then:

				MICHAEL
		I've always respected you...

	A long silence.  The DON smiles at MICHAEL.

				DON CORLEONE
		And I...you.

	EXT DAY: CHURCH (1955)

	KAY and MAMA walking from the black car that has just left
	them off.

				KAY
		How is your husband feeling?

				MAMA
		He's not the same since they shot
		him.  He lets Michael do all the
		work.  He just plays the fool with
		his garden, his peppers, his
		tomatoes, as if he was some peasant
		still.  But men are like that...

	She stops toward the Church.

				MAMA
		You come in, too.

	KAY shakes her head.

				MAMA
		The Priest ain't gonna bite you
		cause you're not Catholic.
			  (whispered)
		He's in the back drinkin' his wine.

	KAY laughs and follows MAMA up the steps of the Church.
	They enter.

	INT DAY: CHURCH (1955)

	Inside the Church, KAY watches as MAMA blesses herself from
	the holy water.

				MAMA
		You can.

	Tentatively, KAY dips her fingers into the water, and
	blesses herself.  Then SHE follows MAMA down the aisle, in
	awe at the high ceiling, the art, the windows, and finally
	the Altar.

	MAMA stops by the impressive tiers of candles.  There is a
	large coin box for those who wish to pay for lighting
	candles.  MAMA fumbles in her purse for change; KAY gives
	her some.

	MAMA drops the coins in the box, one by one; then takes the
	taper, and in a pattern known only to her, and with great
	dignity, she closes her eyes, says a prayer, and then lights
	twenty candles.

	She finishes, and bows her head.

	EXT DAY: BONASERA'S FUNERAL HOME

	Very few people in the streets.  TOTAL SILENCE.  But black
	flower cars as far as the eye can see, for blocks and blocks.
	An expression of respect, of honor and fear that is enormous.
	Certainly no more could be done for a President or a King.

	Each car carries an elaborate floral decoration.  We show
	these in detail; and the flowered messages: "A Benefactor to
	Mankind", "He Knew and Pitied"..."Our Don Our Leader"..."The
	Sacred Heart"...

	EXT DAY: MALL (1955)

	HIGH ANGLE ON THE CORLEONE MALL

	Silence.

	The flower cars, funeral limousines, and private cars fill
	all the areas attendant to the Corleone residence.

	Hundreds of people fill the Mall, reminiscent in size of the
	wedding of Connie and Carlo; of course, now the mood is
	somber and respectful.

	MICHAEL, MAMA, FREDO and HAGEN stand by the flowered platform
	which holds the ornate coffin.  We cannot see the remains of
	Don Corleone.

	BONASERA is nearby, ready to do service to the bereaved
	family.  One by one the mourners come by, weeping, or merely
	with grave expressions; pay their respects and continue on.

	The VIEW ALTERS,

	and we see that the line is endless.  JOHNNY FONTANE, tears
	openly falling, takes his turn.

	Children are taken by the hand, and lifted for their last
	look at the great man.

	CLEMENZA whispers into the ear of LAMPONE.  LAMPONE
	immediately arranges for the members of the Five New York
	Families to pay their respects.

	First CUNEO, then STRACHI and then ZALUCHI.  Then PHILIP
	TATTAGLIA, who merely passes by the Coffin.

	Then BARZINI in a black homburg, standing a long time.

	MICHAEL watches the scene.

	BARZINI crosses himself and passes on, immediately rejoined
	by his men.

	As BARZINI leaves, it seems as though everyone is fawning on
	him; perhaps asking for favors: But at any rate, it is clear
	from the doors opened for him, the cigars lit for him, that
	he is the new Capo di Capi--the place formerly held by Don
	Corleone.

	MICHAEL watches silently.

	BARZINI is searching for somebody with his eyes.  First
	CLEMENZA.  Then TESSIO.

	CONNIE rushes into MICHAEL's arms, tears in her eyes.  He
	embraces and comforts her.

	Everywhere MICHAEL goes, NERI is a few feet away--watching
	all who come close to him.

	EXT DAY: MALL (LATER)

	Later on the Mall; some people have left, although there are
	still hundreds of mourners.

	A young GIRL approaches TESSIO.  She's about 18.

				GIRL
		Do you remember me?

				TESSIO
		No...

				GIRL
		We danced together at Connie's
		wedding.

	TESSIO makes a gesture, which is to say 'How you've grown',
	and they move though the crowd, looking for Michael.  He
	finds him.

				TESSIO
		Mike, could I have a minute?

	MIKE; nods; and they move to a private place.  NERI is close
	by.

				TESSIO
		Barzini wants to arrange a meeting.
		Says we can straighten any of our
		problems out.

				MICHAEL
		He talked to you?

				TESSIO
			  (nods)
		I can arrange security.

	MICHAEL looks at him.

	EXT DAY: CEMETERY (1955)

	The Cemetery.  Late day.

	The hundreds of cars, limousines and flower cars line the
	stone wall that surrounds this Italian-Catholic cemetary in
	Queens Village.

	Hundreds of people stand in a cluster; others watch; take
	pictures, etc.

	MICHAEL stands with his family, his MOTHER...and TOM HAGEN.

				MICHAEL
			  (softly)
		Christ, Tom; I needed more time
		with him.  I really needed him.

				HAGEN
		Did he give you his politicians?

				MICHAEL
		Not all...I needed another four
		months and I would have had them
		all.
			  (he looks at TOM)
		I guess you've figured it all out?

				HAGEN
		How will they come at you?

				MICHAEL
		I know now.
			  (a passion wells up
			  inside of MICHAEL)
		I'll make them call me Don.

				HAGEN
		Have you agreed on a meeting?

				MICHAEL
			  (nods)
		A week from tonight.  In Brooklyn
		on Tessio's ground, where I'll be
		safe.

	HAGEN looks at him; understands.

				MICHAEL
		But after the Baptism.  I've
		decided to stand as godfather to
		Connie's baby.

	They look up.

	The coffin is lowered into an excavation, behind which
	stands an enormous stone monument; it is of a weeping angel,
	with the bold inscription: CORLEONE.

	---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

	FADE IN:

	INT DAY: NERI'S APT. (1955)

	ALBERT NERI moves around in his small Corona Apartment; he
	pulls a small trunk from under his bed.  He opens it, and we
	see in it, nearly folded, a New York City Policeman's
	uniform.  He takes it out piece by piece, almost reverently.
	Then the badge, and the identification card; with his
	picture on it.  Slowly, in the solitude of his room, he
	begins to dress.

	INT DAY: MICHAEL'S BEDROOM (1955)

	MICHAEL and KAY are getting dressed for the christening in
	their room.  MICHAEL looks very well; very calm; KAY is
	beginning to take on a matronly look.

	INT DAY: MOTEL ROOM (1955)

	In a Long Island motel.

	ROCCO LAMPONE carefully disassembles a revolver; oils it,
	checks it, and puts it back together.

	EXT DAY: CLEMENZA'S HOUSE (1955)

	PETER CLEMENZA about to get in his Lincoln.  He hesitates,
	takes a rag and cleans some dirt off of the fender, and then
	gets in, drives off.

	EXT DAY: CHURCH (1955)

	The Church.

	Various relatives and friends are beginning to gather at the
	Church.  They laugh and talk.  A MONSIGNOR is officiating.
	Not all of the participants have arrived yet.

	CONNIE is there, with a beaming CARLO.  She holds the
	infant; showing him off to interested people.

	EXT DAY: U.N. PLAZA (1955)

	NERI walks down the sidewalk in the neighborhood of the UN
	Building.  He is dressed as, and has the bearing of, a
	policeman.  He carries a huge flashlight.

	EXT DAY: MOTEL BALCONY (1955)

	LAMPONE steps out onto the little balcony of a Sea-Resort
	Motel; We can see the bright, neon lit sign advertising
	"ROOMS FACING THE SEA--VACANY".

	INT DAY: CHURCH

	The Church.

	CONNIE holds the baby; the MONSIGNOR is speaking; KAY and
	MICHAEL stand side by side around the urn.

				PRIEST
			  (to MICHAEL)
		Do you pledge to guide and protect
		this child if he is left fatherless?
		Do you promise to shield him
		against the wickedness of the world?

				MICHAEL
		Yes, I promise.

	EXT DAY: FIFTH AVE.

	NERI continues up the 55th St. and Fifth Avenue area.  He
	continues until he is in front of Rockefeller Center.  On
	his side of the street, he spots a limousine waiting directly
	across from the main entrance of the building.  Slowly he
	approaches the limo, and taps on its fender with his
	nightstick.

	The DRIVER looks up in surprise.

	NERI points to the "No Parking" sign.

	The DRIVER turns his head away.

				NERI
		OK, wise guy, you wanna summons, or
		you wanna move?

				DRIVER
			  (obviously a hood)
		You better check with your precinct.

				NERI
		Move it!

	The DRIVER takes a ten dollar bill, folds it deliberately,
	and hands it out the window, trying to put it under NERI's
	jacket.

	NERI backs up, letting the bill fall onto the street.  Then
	he crooks a finger at the DRIVER.

				NERI
		Let me see you license and
		registration.

	EXT DAY: MOTEL BALCONY

	LAMPONE on the motel balcony spots a Cadillac pulling up.
	It parks.  A young, pretty GIRL gets out.  Quickly, he
	returns into the room.

	INT DAY: HOTEL STAIRS (1955)

	CLEMENZA is climbing the back stairs of a large hotel.  He
	rounds the corner, puffs a little, and then continues upward.

	INT DAY: CHURCH

	The Church.  Close on the PRIEST's fingers as he gently
	applies oil to the infant's ears and nostrils.

				PRIEST
		Ephetha...be opened...So you may
		perceive the fragrance of God's
		sweetness.

	EXT DAY: ROCKEFELLER CENTER (1955)

	The DRIVER of the limousine in front of Rockefeller Center
	is arguing with NERI.

	Now the DRIVER looks up.

	WHAT HE SEES:

	TWO MEN in topcoats exit the building, through the revolving
	glass doors.

	NERI opens up fire, trapping BARZINI in the shattering glass
	doors.  The doors still rotate, moving the dead body of
	BARZINI within them.

	INT DAY: CHURCH

	In the Church--the VIEW on MICHAEL.  The PRIEST hands him
	the infant.

				PRIEST
		Do you renounce Satan.

				MICHAEL
		I do renounce him.

				PRIEST
		And all his works?

				MICHAEL
		I do renounce them.

	INT DAY: MOTEL MURDER (1955)

	LAMPONE, backed up by two other MEN in his regime, runs down
	the iron-rail steps, and kicks in the door on Room 7F.
	PHILIP TATTAGLIA, old and wizened and naked, leaps up; a
	semi-nude young GIRL leans up.

	They are riddled with gunfire.

	INT DAY: HOTEL STAIRS (1955)

	CLEMENZA, huffing and puffing, climbs the back stairs, with
	his package.

	INT DAY: CHURCH

	The PRIEST pours water over the forehead of the infant
	MICHAEL holds.

				PRIEST
		Do you wish to be baptized?

				MICHAEL
		I do wish to be baptized.

	INT DAY: HOTEL ELEVATOR MURDER (1955)

	CLEMENZA, out of breath, climbs the final few steps.

	He walks through some glass doors, and moves to an ornate
	elevator waiting shaft.

	The lights indicate the elevator has arrived.

	The doors open, and we see a surprised CUNEO standing with
	the dapper MOE GREENE.

	CLEMENZA fires into the small elevator with a shotgun.

	The PRIEST hands a lighted candle to MICHAEL.

				PRIEST
		I christen you Michael Francis Rizzi.

	Flash bulbs go off.  Everyone is smiles, and crowds around
	MICHAEL, KAY, CONNIE...and CARLO.

	--------------------------------------FADE OUT----------

	EXT DAY: CHURCH (1955)

	The christening party outside the Church.

	Four or five limousines have been waiting; now pull up to
	receive MAMA, CONNIE and the baby; and the others.

	Everyone is very happy; only MICHAEL seems aloof and grave.

	As the fuss is going on, a car pulls up.  LAMPONE gets out
	and works his way to MICHAEL.  He whispers in his ear.  This
	is the news MICHAEL has been waiting for.

	CONNIE holds the baby up to MICHAEL.

				CONNIE
		Kiss your Godfather.

	The infant turns its head, and MICHAEL uses that as an
	excuse to back away.

				MICHAEL
		Carlo...we've had a change in the
		plans.  Mama, Connie, Kay and the
		kids will have to take the trip out
		to Vegas without us.

				CONNIE
		Oh Mike, it's our first vacation
		together.

				CARLO
			  (anxious to please)
		Jesus, Connie...Sure, Mike...

				MICHAEL
		Go back to your house and wait for
		me...

	He kisses KAY.

				MICHAEL
			  (to KAY)
		I'll just be a couple of days...

	People are guided to the correct limousines; they start to
	drive off.

	INT DAY: DON'S KITCHEN

	TESSIO sits in the Kitchen of the Main House on the Mall.

	HAGEN enters.

				HAGEN
		You'd better make your call to
		Barzini; Michael's ready.

	TESSIO nods; moves to the telephone and dials a number.

				TESSIO
		We're on our way to Brooklyn.

	He hangs up and smiles.

				TESSIO
		I hope Mike can get us a good deal
		tonight.

				HAGEN
			  (gravely)
		I'm sure he will.

	EXT DAY: MALL (1955)

	The TWO MEN walk out onto the Mall, toward a car.  On their
	way they are stopped by TWO BODYGUARDS.

				BUTTON MAN
		The boss says he'll come in a
		separate car.  He says for you two
		to go on ahead.

				TESSIO
			  (frowning)
		Hell, he can't do that.  It screws
		up all my arrangements.

	THREE MORE BODYGUARDS appear around him.

				HAGEN
			  (gently)
		I can't go with you either, Tessio.

	He flashes at the men surrounding him; for a moment he
	panics, and then he accepts it.

				TESSIO
			  (after the pause)
		Tell Mike it was business...I
		always liked him.

				HAGEN
		He understands that.

	TESSIO looks at the men, and then pauses.

				TESSIO
			  (softly)
		Tom, can you get me off the hook?
		For old times' sake?

				HAGEN
		I can't.

	HAGEN turns, and walks away from the group.  Then about
	twenty paces away, he stops, and looks back.

	TESSIO is led into a waiting car.

	HAGEN looks away, and walks off.

	INT DAY: CARLO'S LIVING ROOM (1955)

	CARLO RIZZI is alone in his house, smoking, waiting rather
	nervously.  He moves to the window and looks out.

	WHAT HE SEES:

	EXT DAY: MALL (1955)

	MICHAEL, still dressed in a dark suit; followed by NERI,
	LAMPONE and CLEMENZA, then HAGEN.

	They move toward us.

	Excitedly, CARLO moves to the front door; opens it.

	He wears a broad smile.

				CARLO
		Godfather!

				MICHAEL
		You have to answer for Santino.

	The smile on CARLO's face slowly fades, then, in a foolish
	attempt for safety, he slams the door in their faces and
	backs into the living room.

	INT DAY: CARLO'S LIVING ROOM (1955)

	The door opens, and the grim party enters.

				MICHAEL
		You fingered Sonny for the Barzini
		people.  That little farce you
		played out with my sister.  Did
		Barzini kid you that would fool a
		Corleone?

				CARLO
			  (dignity)
		I swear I'm innocent.  I swear on
		the head of my children, I'm
		innocent.  Mike, don't do this to
		me, please Mike, don't do this to me!

				MICHAEL
			  (quietly)
		Barzini is dead.  So is Philip
		Tattaglia, so are Strachi, Cuneo
		and Moe Greene...I want to square
		all the family accounts tonight.
		So don't tell me you're innocent;
		admit what you did.

	CARLO is silent; he wants to talk but is terrified.

				MICHAEL
			  (almost kindly)
		Don't be frightened.  Do you think
		I'd make my sister a widow?  Do you
		think I'd make your children
		fatherless?  After all, I'm
		Godfather to your son.  No, your
		punishment is that you're out of
		the family business.  I'm putting
		you on a plane to Vegas--and I want
		you to stay there.  I'll send
		Connie an allowance, that's all.
		But don't keep saying you're
		innocent; it insults my intelligence
		and makes me angry.  Who approached
		you, Tattaglia or Barzini?

				CARLO
			  (sees his way out)
		Barzini.

				MICHAEL
			  (softly)
		Good, good.  Leave now; there's a
		car waiting to take you to the
		airport.

	CARLO moves to the door; opens it.  There is a car waiting;
	with a group of MEN around it.

	He looks back at MICHAEL, who reassures him.

				MICHAEL
		I'll call your wife and tell her
		what flight you're on.

	EXT DAY: MALL

	CARLO moves out to the Mall; the BUTTONMEN are putting his
	things in the trunk.

	ONE opens the front door for him.

	SOMEONE is sitting in the rear seat, though we cannot see who.

	CARLO gets into the car; out of nervousness, he looks back
	to see the other man.

	It is CLEMENZA, who nods cordially.

	The motor starts, and as the car pulls away, CLEMENZA
	suddenly throws the garrote around CARLO's neck.  He chokes
	and leaps up like a fish on a line, kicking his feet.

	The garrote is pulled tighter; CARLO's face turns color.

	His thrashing feet kick right through the front windshield.

	Then the body goes slack.

	CLEMENZA makes a foul face, and opens the window as the car
	drives off.

	EXT DAY: CARLO'S STEPS (1955)

	MICHAEL and his party.  They watch.

	Then he turns and walks off, and they follow.

	---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

	FADE IN:

	INT NITE: MICHAEL'S LIMO EN ROUTE (1955)

	MICHAEL sits alone in the back of his car; NERI is driving.

	They do not speak for a long time; it is night--car lights
	flash by.

	NERI turns back.

				NERI
		You know I would never question
		anything you say.

				MICHAEL
			  (smiles)
		Speak your mind.

				NERI
		I'll do this for you; you know I
		should.

				MICHAEL
		No.  This I have to do.

	EXT NITE: PIZZA STREET (1955)

	MICHAEL's car pulls up in a quiet neighborhood, near an
	Italian Pizzeria.  NERI opens the door.

				MICHAEL
		Sit in the car.

	INT NITE: PIZZA PLACE (1955)

	He walks alone into the restaurant.  A MAN is tossing pizza
	dough in the air.

				MICHAEL
		Where's the boss?

				MAN
		In the back.  Hey Frank, someone
		wants you.

	A MAN comes out of the shadows, with a strong Italian accent.

				MAN
		What is it?

	He stops, frozen in fear.  It is FABRIZZIO.

	VIEW ON MICHAEL.  Gunfire from under his coat.  FABRIZZIO is
	cut down.  MICHAEL throws the gun down; turns and exits.

	EXT DAY: MALL (1955)

	HIGH ANGLE ON THE CORLEONE MALL

	Several moving vans are parked in the Mall; one feels that
	these are the final days; the families are moving out; signs
	indicating that the property is for sale are evident.

	A black limousine pulls up, and before it has even stopped,
	the rear door flies open, and CONNIE attempts to run out,
	restrained by MAMA.  She manages to break free and runs
	across the Mall into Michael's house.

	INT DAY: DON'S LIVING ROOM (1955)

	Inside the Corleone house.  Big boxes have been packed;
	furniture prepared for shipping.

				CONNIE
		Michael!

	She hurries into the living room, where she comes upon
	MICHAEL and KAY.

				KAY
			  (comforting)
		Connie...

	But CONNIE avoids her, and moves directly to MICHAEL.  NERI
	is watchful.

				CONNIE
		You lousy bastard; you killed my
		husband...

				KAY
		Connie...

				CONNIE
		You waited until our father died
		and nobody could stop you and you
		killed him, you killed him!  You
		blamed him about Sonny, you always
		did, everybody did.  But you never
		thought about me, never gave a damn
		about me.
			  (crying)
		What am I going to do now, what am
		I going to do.

	TWO of Michael's BODYGUARDS move closer, ready for orders
	from him.  But he stands there, waiting for his sister to
	finish.

				KAY
		Connie, how could you say such
		things?

				CONNIE
		Why do you think he kept Carlo on
		the Mall?  All the time he knew he
		was going to kill my husband.  But
		he didn't dare while my father was
		alive.  And then he stood Godfather
		to our child.  That coldhearted
		bastard.
			  (to KAY)
		And do you know how many men he had
		killed with Carlo?  Just read the
		papers.  That's your husband.

	She tries to spit into MICHAEL's face; but in her hysteria
	she has no saliva.

				MICHAEL
		Get her home and get a doctor.

	The TWO BODYGUARDS immediately take her arms and move her,
	gently but firmly.

	KAY is shocked; never taking her look of amazement from
	MICHAEL.  He feels her look.

				MICHAEL
		She's hysterical.

	But KAY won't let him avoid her eyes.

				KAY
		Michael, it's not true.  Please
		tell me.

				MICHAEL
		Don't ask me.

				KAY
		Tell me!

				MICHAEL
		All right, this one time I'll let
		you ask about my affairs, one last
		time.

				KAY
		Is it true?

	She looks directly into his eyes, he returns the look, so
	directly that we know he will tell the truth.

				MICHAEL
			  (after a very long pause)
		No.

	KAY is relieved; she throws her arms around him, and hugs
	him.  Then she kisses him.

				KAY
			  (through her tears)
		We both need a drink.

	INT DAY: DON'S KITCHEN (1955)

	She moves back into the kitchen and begins to prepare the
	drinks.  From her vantage point, as she smilingly makes the
	drinks, she sees CLEMENZA, NERI and ROCCO LAMPONE enter the
	house with their BODYGUARDS.

	She watches with curiosity, as MICHAEL stands to receive
	them.  He stands arrogantly at ease, weight resting on one
	foot slightly behind the other.  One hand on his hip, like a
	Roman Emperor.  The CAPOREGIMES stand before him.

	CLEMENZA takes MICHAEL's hand, kissing it.

				CLEMENZA
		Don Corleone...

	The smile fades from KAY's face, as she looks at what her
	husband has become.

	INT DAY: CHURCH (1955)

	KAY wears a shawl over her hand.  She drops many coins in
	the coin box, and lifts a burning taper, and one by one, in
	a pattern known only to herself, lights thirty candles.

THIRD DRAFT				PARAMOUNT PICTURES
					1 Gulf and Western Plaza
March 29, 1971				New York, New York 10019





	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

	The PARAMOUNT Logo is presented austerely over a black
	background.  There is a moment's hesitation, and then the
	simple words in white lettering:

				  THE GODFATHER

	While this remains, we hear: "I believe in America."
	Suddenly we are watching in CLOSE VIEW, AMERIGO BONASERA, a
	man of sixty, dressed in a black suit, on the verge of great
	emotion.

				BONASERA
		America has made my fortune.

	As he speaks, THE VIEW imperceptibly begins to loosen.

				BONASERA
		I raised my daughter in the American
		fashion; I gave her freedom, but
		taught her never to dishonor her
		family.  She found a boy friend,
		not an Italian.  She went to the
		movies with him, stayed out late.
		Two months ago he took her for a
		drive, with another boy friend.
		They made her drink whiskey and
		then they tried to take advantage
		of her.  She resisted; she kept her
		honor.  So they beat her like an
		animal.  When I went to the hospital
		her nose was broken, her jaw was
		shattered and held together by
		wire, and she could not even weep
		because of the pain.

	He can barely speak; he is weeping now.

				BONASERA
		I went to the Police like a good
		American.  These two boys were
		arrested and brought to trial.  The
		judge sentenced them to three years
		in prison, and suspended the
		sentence.  Suspended sentence!
		They went free that very day.  I
		stood in the courtroom like a fool,
		and those bastards, they smiled at
		me.  Then I said to my wife, for
		Justice, we must go to The Godfather.

	By now, THE VIEW is full, and we see Don Corleone's office
	in his home.

	The blinds are closed, and so the room is dark, and with
	patterned shadows.  We are watching BONASERA over the
	shoulder of DON CORLEONE.  TOM HAGEN sits near a small
	table, examining some paperwork, and SONNY CORLEONE stands
	impatiently by the window nearest his father, sipping from a
	glass of wine.  We can HEAR music, and the laughter and
	voices of many people outside.

				DON CORLEONE
		Bonasera, we know each other for
		years, but this is the first time
		you come to me for help.  I don't
		remember the last time you invited
		me to your house for coffee...even
		though our wives are friends.

				BONASERA
		What do you want of me?  I'll give
		you anything you want, but do what
		I ask!

				DON CORLEONE
		And what is that Bonasera?

	BONASERA whispers into the DON's ear.

				DON CORLEONE
		No.  You ask for too much.

				BONASERA
		I ask for Justice.

				DON CORLEONE
		The Court gave you justice.

				BONASERA
		An eye for an eye!

				DON CORLEONE
		But your daughter is still alive.

				BONASERA
		Then make them suffer as she
		suffers.  How much shall I pay you.

	Both HAGEN and SONNY react.

				DON CORLEONE
		You never think to protect yourself
		with real friends.  You think it's
		enough to be an American.  All
		right, the Police protects you,
		there are Courts of Law, so you
		don't need a friend like me.
		But now you come to me and say Don
		Corleone, you must give me justice.
		And you don't ask in respect or
		friendship.  And you don't think to
		call me Godfather; instead you come
		to my house on the day my daughter
		is to be married and you ask me to
		do murder...for money.

				BONASERA
		America has been good to me...

				DON CORLEONE
		Then take the justice from the
		judge, the bitter with the sweet,
		Bonasera.  But if you come to me
		with your friendship, your loyalty,
		then your enemies become my enemies,
		and then, believe me, they would
		fear you...

	Slowly, Bonasera bows his head and murmurs.

				BONASERA
		Be my friend.

				DON CORLEONE
		Good.  From me you'll get Justice.

				BONASERA
		Godfather.

				DON CORLEONE
		Some day, and that day may never
		come, I would like to call upon you
		to do me a service in return.

	EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

	A HIGH ANGLE of the CORLEONE MALL in bright daylight.  There
	are at least five hundred guests filling the main courtyard
	and gardens.  There is music and laughing and dancing and
	countless tables covered with food and wine.

	DON CORLEONE stands at the Gate, flanked on either side by a
	son: FREDO and SONNY, all dressed in the formal attire of
	the wedding party.  He warmly shakes the hands, squeezes the
	hands of the friends and guests, pinches the cheeks of the
	children, and makes them all welcome.  They in turn carry
	with them gallons of homemade wine, cartons of freshly baked
	bread and pastries, and enormous trays of Italian delicacies.

	The entire family poses for a family portrait: DON CORLEONE,
	MAMA, SONNY, his wife, SANDRA, and their children, TOM HAGEN
	and his wife, THERESA, and their BABY; CONSTANZIA, the
	bride, and her bridegroom, CARLO RIZZI.  As they move into
	the pose, THE DON seems preoccupied.

				DON CORLEONE
		Where's Michael?

				SONNY
		He'll be here Pop, it's still early.

				DON CORLEONE
		Then the picture will wait for him.

	Everyone in the group feels the uneasiness as the DON moves
	back to the house.  SONNY gives a delicious smile in the
	direction of the Maid-of-Honor, LUCY MANCINI.  She returns
	it.  Then he moves to his wife.

				SONNY
		Sandra, watch the kids.  They're
		running wild.

				SANDRA
		You watch yourself.

	HAGEN kisses his WIFE, and follows THE DON, passing the wine
	barrels, where a group of FOUR MEN nervously wait.  TOM
	crooks a finger at NAZORINE, who doublechecks that he is
	next, straightens, and follows HAGEN.

	EXT DAY: MALL ENTRANCE (SUMMER 1945)

	Outside the main gate of the Mall, SEVERAL MEN in suits,
	working together with a MAN in a dark sedan, walk in and out
	of the rows of parked cars, writing license plate numbers
	down in their notebooks.  We HEAR the music and laughter
	coming from the party in the distance.

	A MAN stops at a limousine and copies down the number.

	BARZINI, dignified in a black homburg, is always under the
	watchful eyes of TWO BODYGUARDS as he makes his way to
	embrace DON CORLEONE in the courtyard.

	The MEN walk down another row of parked cars.  Put another
	number in the notebook.  A shiney new Cadillac with wooden
	bumpers.

	PETER CLEMENZA, dancing the Tarantella joyously, bumping
	bellies with the ladies.

				CLEMENZA
		Paulie...wine...WINE.

	He mops his sweating forehead with a big handkerchief.
	PAULIE hustles, gets a glass of icy black wine, and brings
	it to him.

				PAULIE
		You look terrif on the floor!

				CLEMENZA
		What are you, a dance judge?  Go do
		your job; take a walk around the
		neighborhood... see everything is
		okay.

	PAULIE nods and leaves; CLEMENZA takes a breath, and leaps
	back into the dance.

	The MEN walk down another row of parked cars.  Put another
	number in the notebook.

	TESSIO, a tall, gentle-looking man, dances with a NINE-YEAR-
	OLD GIRL, her little black party shoes planted on his
	enormous brown shoes.

	The MEN move on to other parked cars, when SONNY storms out
	of the gate, his face flushed with anger, followed by
	CLEMENZA and PAULIE.

				SONNY
		Buddy, this is a private party.

	The MAN doesn't answer, but points to the DRIVER of the
	sedan.  SONNY menacingly thrusts his reddened face at him.
	The DRIVER merely flips open his wallet to a greed card,
	without saying a word.  SONNY steps back, spits on the
	ground, turns, and walks away, followed by CLEMENZA, PAULIE,
	and another TWO MEN.  He doesn't say a thing for most of the
	walk back into the courtyard, and then, muttered to PAULIE.

				SONNY
		Goddamn FBI...don't respect nothing.

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

	DON CORLEONE sits quietly behind his massive desk in the
	dark study.

				NAZORINE
		...a fine boy from Sicily, captured
		by the American Army, and sent to
		New Jersey as a prisoner of war...

				DON CORLEONE
		Nazorine, my friend, tell me what I
		can do.

				NAZORINE
		Now that the war is over, Enzo,
		this boy is being repatriated to
		Italy.  And you see, Godfather...
			  (he wrings his hands,
			  unable to express himself)
		He...my daughter...they...

				DON CORLEONE
		You want him to stay in this country.

				NAZORINE
		Godfather, you understand everything.

				DON CORLEONE
		Tom, what we need is an Act of
		Congress to allow Enzo to become a
		citizen.

				NAZORINE
			  (impressed)
		An Act of Congress!

				HAGEN
			  (nodding)
		It will cost.

	The DON shrugs; such are the way with those things; NAZORINE
	nods.

				NAZORINE
		Is that all?  Godfather, thank
		you...
			  (backing out, enthusiastically)
		Oh, wait till you see the cake I
		made for your beautiful daughter!

	NAZORINE backs out, all smiles, and nods to the GODFATHER.
	DON CORLEONE rises and moves to the Venetian blinds.

				HAGEN
		Who do I give this job to?

	The DON moves to the windows, peeking out through the blinds.

				DON CORLEONE
		Not to one of our paisans...give it
		to a Jew Congressman in another
		district.  Who else is on the list
		for today?

	The DON is peeking out to the MEN around the barrel, waiting
	to see him.

				HAGEN
		Francesco Nippi.  His nephew has
		been refused parole.  A bad case.

	EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

	WHAT HE SEES:

	NIPPI waits nervously by the barrel.

				HAGEN (O.S.)
		His father worked with you in the
		freight yards when you were young.

	LUCA BRASI sitting alone, grotesque and quiet.

				HAGEN (O.S.)
		He's not on the list, but Luca
		Brasi wants to see you.

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

	The DON turns to HAGEN.

				DON CORLEONE
		Is it necessary?

				HAGEN
		You understand him better than
		anyone.

	The DON nods to this.  Turns back to the blinds and peeks out.

	EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

	WHAT HE SEES:

	MICHAEL CORLEONE, dressed in the uniform of a Marine Captain,
	leads KAY ADAMS through the wedding crowd, occasionally
	stopped and greeted by FRIENDS of the family.

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

	The DON, inside the office, peering through the blinds,
	following them.

	EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

	MICHAEL moves through the crowd, embraces MAMA and introduces
	her to his GIRL.

	EXT DAY: OFFICE WINDOW (SUMMER 1945)

	The DON's eyes peering through the blinds.

	EXT DAY: MALL TABLES (SUMMER 1945)

	KAY and MICHAEL settle by a table on the edge of the wedding,
	burdened down with plates of food and glasses and wine.  She
	is exhilarated by the enormity of the affair, the music and
	the vitality.

				KAY
		I've never seen anything like it.

				MICHAEL
		I told you I had a lot of relatives.

	KAY looking about, a young and lively thing in a gift shop.
	We see what she sees:

	Her interest is caught by THREE MEN standing by the wine
	barrels.

				KAY
			  (amused)
		Michael, what are those men doing?

				MICHAEL
		They're waiting to see my father.

				KAY
		They're talking to themselves.

				MICHAEL
		They're going to talk to my father,
		which means they're going to ask
		him for something, which means they
		better get it right.

				KAY
		Why do they bother him on a day
		like this?

				MICHAEL
		Because they know that no Sicilian
		will refuse a request on his
		daughter's wedding day.

	EXT DAY: WEDDING PARTY (SUMMER 1945)

	CONNIE CORLEONE, the Bride, is pressing the bodice of her
	overly-fluffy white gown against the groom, CARLO RIZZI.  He
	is bronzed, with curly blondish hair and lovely dimples.
	She absolutely adores him and can barely take her eyes from
	him long enough to thank the various GUESTS for the white
	envelopes they are putting into the large white purse she
	holds.  In fact, if we watch carefully, we can see that one
	of her hands is slid under his jacket, and into his shirt,
	where she is provocatively rubbing the hair on his chest.
	CARLO, on the other hand, has his blue eyes trained on the
	bulging envelopes, and is trying to guess how much cash the
	things hold.

	Discreetly, he moves her hand off of his skin.

				CARLO
			  (whispered)
		Cut it out, Connie.

	The purse, looped by a ribbon of silk around CONNIE's arm,
	is fat with money.

				PAULIE (O.S.)
		What do you think?  Twenty grand?

	A little distance away, a young man, PAULIE GATTO, catches a
	prosciutto sandwich thrown by a friend, without once taking
	eyes from the purse.

				PAULIE
		Who knows?  Maybe more.  Twenty,
		thirty grand in small bills cash in
		that silk purse.  Holy Toledo, if
		this was somebody else's wedding!

	SONNY is sitting at the Wedding Dias, talking to LUCY
	MANCINI, the Maid of Honor.  Every once in a while he
	glances across the courtyard, where his WIFE is talking with
	some WOMEN.

	He bends over and whispers something into LUCY's ear.

	SANDRA and the WOMEN are in the middle of a big, ribald laugh.

				WOMAN
		Is it true what they say about your
		husband, Sandra?

	SANDRA's hands separate with expanding width further and
	further apart until she bursts into a peal of laughter.
	Through her separated hands she sees the Wedding Dais.
	SONNY and LUCY are gone.

	INT DAY: DON'S HALL & STAIRS (SUMMER 1945)

	The empty hallway.  The bathroom door opens and LUCY
	surreptitiously steps out.

	She looks up where SONNY is standing on the second landing,
	motioning for her to come up.

	She lifts her petticoats off the ground and hurries upstairs.

	EXT DAY: MALL TABLES (SUMMER 1945)

	KAY and MICHAEL.

				KAY
			  (in a spooky low tone)
		Michael, that scarey guy...Is he a
		relative?

	She has picked out LUCA BRASI.

				MICHAEL
		No.  His name is Luca Brasi.  You
		wouldn't like him.

				KAY
			  (Excited)
		Who is he?

				MICHAEL
			  (Sizing her up)
		You really want to know?

				KAY
		Yes.  Tell me.

				MICHAEL
		You like spaghetti?

				KAY
		You know I love spaghetti.

				MICHAEL
		Then eat your spaghetti and I'll
		tell you a Luca Brasi story.

	She starts to eat her spaghetti.

	She begins eating, looking at him eagerly.

				MICHAEL
		Once upon a time, about fifteen
		years ago some people wanted to
		take over my father's olive oil
		business.  They had Al Capone send
		some men in from Chicago to kill my
		father, and they almost did.

				KAY
		Al Capone!

				MICHAEL
		My Father sent Luca Brasi after
		them.  He tied the two Capone men
		hand and foot, and stuffed small
		bath towels into their mouths.
		Then he took an ax, and chopped one
		man's feet off...

				KAY
		Michael...

				MICHAEL
		Then the legs at the knees...

				KAY
		Michael you're trying to scare me...

				MICHAEL
		Then the thighs where they joined
		the torso.

				KAY
		Michael, I don't want to hear
		anymore...

				MICHAEL
		Then Luca turned to the other man...

				KAY
		Michael, I love you.

				MICHAEL
		...who out of sheer terror had
		swallowed the bath towel in his
		mouth and suffocated.

	The smile on his face seems to indicate that he is telling a
	tall story.

				KAY
		I never know when you're telling me
		the truth.

				MICHAEL
		I told you you wouldn't like him.

				KAY
		He's coming over here!

	LUCA comes toward them to meet TOM HAGEN halfway, just near
	their table.

				MICHAEL
		Tom...Tom, I'd like you to meet Kay
		Adams.

				KAY
			  (having survived LUCA)
		How do you do.

				MICHAEL
		My brother, Tom Hagen.

				HAGEN
		Hello Kay.  Your father's inside,
		doing some business.
			  (privately)
		He's been asking for you.

				MICHAEL
		Thanks Tom.

	HAGEN smiles and moves back to the house, LUCA ominously
	following.

				KAY
		If he's your brother, why does he
		have a different name?

				MICHAEL
		My brother Sonny found him living
		in the streets when he was a kid,
		so my father took him in.  He's a
		good lawyer.

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

	DON CORLEONE at the window.  He has seen the intimacy of the
	YOUNG COUPLE.

				LUCA (O.S.)
		Don Corleone...

	THE DON turns to the stiffly formal LUCA, and he moves
	forward to kiss his hand.  He takes the envelope from his
	jacket, holds it out, but does not release it until he makes
	a formal speech.

				LUCA
			  (with difficulty)
		Don Corleone...I am honored, and
		grateful...that you invited me to
		your home...on the wedding day of
		your...daughter.
		May their first child...be a
		masculine child.  I pledge my never
		ending loyalty.
			  (he offers the envelope)
		For your daughter's bridal purse.

				DON CORLEONE
		Thank you, Luca, my most valued
		friend.

	THE DON takes it, and then LUCA's hand, which he squeezes so
	tightly we might imagine it to be painful.

				LUCA
		Let me leave you, Don Corleone.  I
		know you are busy.

	He turns, almost an about-face, and leaves the study with
	the same formality he entered with.  DON CORLEONE breathes
	more easily, and gives the thick envelope to HAGEN.

				DON CORLEONE
		I'm sure it's the most generous
		gift today.

				HAGEN
		The Senator called--apologized for
		not coming personally, but said
		you'd understand.  Also, some of
		the Judges...they've all sent gifts.
		And another call from Virgil
		Sollozzo.

	DON CORLEONE is not pleased.

				HAGEN
		The action is narcotics.  Sollozzo
		has contacts in Turkey for the
		poppy, in Sicily for the plants to
		process down to morphine or up to
		heroin.  Also he has access to this
		country.  He's coming to us for
		financial help, and some sort of
		immunity from the law.  For that we
		get a piece of the action, I
		couldn't find out how much.
		Sollozzo is vouched for by the
		Tattaglia family, and they may have
		a piece of the action.  They call
		Sollozzo the Turk.
		He's spent a lot of time in Turkey
		and is suppose to have a Turkish
		wife and kids.  He's suppose to be
		very quick with the knife, or was,
		when he was younger.  Only in
		matters of business and with some
		reasonable complaint.  Also he has
		an American wife and three children
		and he is a good family man.

	THE DON nods.

				HAGEN
		He's his own boss, and very
		competent.

				DON CORLEONE
		And with prison record.

				HAGEN
		Two terms; one in Italy, one in the
		United States.  He's known to the
		Government as a top narcotics man.
		That could be a plus for us; he
		could never get immunity to testify.

				DON CORLEONE
		When did he call?

				HAGEN
		This morning.

				DON CORLEONE
		On a day like this.  Consiglero, do
		you also have in your notes the the
		Turk made his living from
		Prostitution before the war, like
		the Tattaglias do now.  Write that
		down before you forget it.  The
		Turk will wait.

	We now begin to hear a song coming over the loud-speakers
	from outside.  In Italian, with unmistakable style.

				DON CORLEONE
		What that?  It sounds like Johnny.

	He moves to the window, pulls the blinds up, flooding the
	room with light.

				DON CORLEONE
		It is Johnny.  He came all the way
		from California to be at the wedding.

				HAGEN
		Should I bring him in.

				DON CORLEONE
		No.  Let the people enjoy him.  You
		see?  He is a good godson.

				HAGEN
		It's been two years.  He's probably
		in trouble again.

	EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

	JOHNNY FONTANE on the bandstand, singing to the delight and
	excitement of the wedding GUESTS.

				KAY
		I didn't know your family knew
		Johnny Fontane.

				MICHAEL
		Sure.

				KAY
		I used to come down to New York
		whenever he sang at the Capitol and
		scream my head off.

				MICHAEL
		He's my father's godson; he owes
		him his whole career.

	JOHNNY finishes the song and the CROWD screams with delight.
	They call out for another when DON CORLEONE appears.

				DON CORLEONE
		My Godson has come three thousand
		miles to do us honor and no one
		thinks to wet his throat.

	At once a dozen wine glasses are offered to JOHNNY, who
	takes a sip from each as he moves to embrace his GODFATHER.

				JOHNNY
		I kept trying to call you after my
		divorce and Tom always said you
		were busy.  When I got the Wedding
		invitation I knew you weren't sore
		at me anymore, Godfather.

				DON CORLEONE
		Can I do something for you still?
		You're not too rich, or too famous
		that I can't help you?

				JOHNNY
		I'm not rich anymore, Godfather,
		and...my career, I'm almost washed
		up...

	He's very disturbed.  The GODFATHER indicates that he come
	with him to the office so no one will notice.  He turns to
	HAGEN.

				DON CORLEONE
		Tell Santino to come in with us.
		He should hear some things.

	They go, leaving HAGEN scanning the party looking for SONNY.

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

	HAGEN glances up the staircase.

				HAGEN
		Sonny?

	Then he goes up.

	INT DAY: DON'S UPSTAIRS ROOM (SUMMER 1945)

	SONNY and LUCY are in a room upstairs; he has lifted her
	gown's skirts almost over her head, and has her standing
	against the door.  Her face peeks out from the layers of
	petticoats around it like a flower in ecstasy.

				LUCY
		Sonnyeeeeeeee.

	Her head bouncing against the door with the rhythm of his
	body.  But there is a knocking as well.  They stop, freeze
	in that position.

				HAGEN (O.S.)
		Sonny?  Sonny, you in there?

	INT DAY: DON'S UPSTAIRS HALLWAY (SUMMER 1945)

	Outside, HAGEN by the door.

				HAGEN
		The old man wants you; Johnny's
		here...he's got a problem.

				SONNY (O.S.)
		Okay.  One minute.

	HAGEN hesitates.  We HEAR LUCY's head bouncing against the
	door again.  TOM leaves.

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

				DON CORLEONE
		ACT LIKE A MAN!  By Christ in
		Heaven, is it possible you turned
		out no better than a Hollywood
		finocchio.

	Both HAGEN and JOHNNY cannot refrain from laughing.  The DON
	smiles.  SONNY enters as noiselessly as possible, still
	adjusting his clothes.

				DON CORLEONE
		All right, Hollywood...Now tell me
		about this Hollywood Pezzonovanta
		who won't let you work.

				JOHNNY
		He owns the studio.  Just a month
		ago he bought the movie rights to
		this book, a best seller.  And the
		main character is a guy just like
		me.  I wouldn't even have to act,
		just be myself.

	The DON is silent, stern.

				DON CORLEONE
		You take care of your family?

				JOHNNY
		Sure.

	He glances at SONNY, who makes himself as inconspicuous as
	he can.

				DON CORLEONE
		You look terrible.  I want you to
		eat well, to rest.  And spend time
		with your family.  And then, at the
		end of the month, this big shot
		will give you the part you want.

				JOHNNY
		It's too late.  All the contracts
		have been signed, they're almost
		ready to shoot.

				DON CORLEONE
		I'll make him an offer he can't
		refuse.

	He takes JOHNNY to the door, pinching his cheek hard enough
	to hurt.

				DON CORLEONE
		Now go back to the party and leave
		it to me.

	He closes the door, smiling to himself.  Turns to HAGEN.

				DON CORLEONE
		When does my daughter leave with
		her bridegroom?

				HAGEN
		They'll cut the cake in a few
		minutes...leave right after that.
		Your new son-in-law, do we give him
		something important?

				DON CORLEONE
		No, give him a living.  But never
		let him know the family's business.
		What else, Tom?

				HAGEN
		I've called the hospital; they've
		notified Consiglere Genco's family
		to come and wait.  He won't last
		out the night.

	This saddens the DON.  He sighs.

				DON CORLEONE
		Genco will wait for me.  Santino,
		tell your brothers they will come
		with me to the hospital to see
		Genco.  Tell Fredo to drive the big
		car, and ask Johnny to come with us.

				SONNY
		And Michael?

				DON CORLEONE
		All my sons.
			  (to HAGEN)
		Tom, I want you to go to California
		tonight.  Make the arrangements.
		But don't leave until I come back
		from the hospital and speak to you.
		Understood?

				HAGEN
		Understood.

	EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

	Now all the wedding GUESTS excitedly clap their hands over
	the entrance of the cake: NAZORINE is beaming as he wheels
	in a serving table containing the biggest, gaudiest, most
	extravagant wedding cake ever baked, an incredible monument
	of his gratitude.  The CROWD is favorably impressed: they
	begin to clink their knives or forks against their glasses,
	in the traditional request for the Bride to cut the cake and
	kiss the Groom.  Louder and louder, five hundred forks
	hitting five hundred glasses.

	EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

	Silence.

	HIGH ANGLE ON THE MALL, late day.  The GUESTS are gone.  A
	single black car is in the courtyard.  FREDDIE is behind the
	driver's seat: the DON enters the car, looks at MICHAEL, who
	sits between SONNY and JOHNNY in the rear seat.

				DON CORLEONE
		Will your girl friend get back to
		the city all right?

				MICHAEL
		Tom said he'd take care of it.

	The DON pulls the door shut; and the car pulls out, through
	the gate of the great Corleone Mall.

	INT DAY: HOSPITAL CORRIDOR (SUMMER 1945)

	A long white hospital corridor, at the end of which we can
	see a grouping of FIVE WOMEN, some old and some young, but
	all plump and dressed in black.

	DON CORLEONE and his SONS move toward the end.  But then the
	DON slows, putting his hand on MICHAEL's shoulder.  MICHAEL
	stops and turns toward his FATHER.  The two looks at one
	another for some time.  SILENCE.  DON CORLEONE then lifts
	his hand, and slowly touches a particular medal on MICHAEL's
	uniform.

				DON CORLEONE
		What was this for?

				MICHAEL
		For bravery.

				DON CORLEONE
		And this?

				MICHAEL
		For killing a man.

				DON CORLEONE
		What miracles you do for strangers.

				MICHAEL
		I fought for my country.  It was my
		choice.

				DON CORLEONE
		And now, what do you choose to do?

				MICHAEL
		I'm going to finish school.

				DON CORLEONE
		Good.  When you are finished, come
		and talk to me.  I have hopes for
		you.

	Again they regard each other without a word.  MICHAEL turns,
	and continues on.  DON CORLEONE watches a moment, and then
	follows.

	INT DAY: HOSPITAL ROOM (SUMMER 1945)

	DON CORLEONE enters the hospital room, moving closest to OUR
	VIEW.  He is followed by his SONS, JOHNNY and the WOMEN.

				DON CORLEONE
			  (whispered)
		Genco, I've brought my sons to pay
		their respects.  And look, even
		Johnny Fontane, all the way from
		Hollywood.

	GENCO is a tiny, wasted skeleton of a man.  DON CORLEONE
	takes his bony hand, as the others arrange themselves around
	his bed, each clasping the other hand in turn.

				GENCO
		Godfather, Godfather, it's your
		daughter's wedding day, you cannot
		refuse me.  Cure me, you have the
		power.

				DON CORLEONE
		I have no such power...but Genco,
		don't fear death.

				GENCO
			  (with a sly wink)
		It's been arranged, then?

				DON CORLEONE
		You blaspheme.  Resign yourself.

				GENCO
		You need your old Consigliere.  Who
		will replace me?
			  (suddenly)
		Stay with me Godfather.  Help me
		meet death.  If he sees you, he
		will be frightened and leave me in
		peace.  You can say a word, pull a
		few strings, eh?  We'll outwit that
		bastard as we outwitted all those
		others.
			  (clutching his hand)
		Godfather, don't betray me.

	The DON motions all the others to leave the room.  They do.
	He returns his attention to GENCO, holding his hand and
	whispering things we cannot hear, as they wait for death.

	INT NIGHT: AIRPLANE (SUMMER 1945)

	FADE IN:

	The interior of a non-stop Constellation.  HAGEN is one of
	the very few passengers on this late flight.  He looks like
	any young lawyer on a business trip.  He is tired from the
	difficult preparation and duties that he has just executed
	during the wedding.  On the seat next to him is an enormous,
	bulging briefcase.  He closes his eyes.

	INT NIGHT: HONEYMOON HOTEL (SUMMER 1945)

	The honeymoon hotel: CARLO and CONNIE.  CARLO is in his
	undershorts, sitting up on the bed, anxiously taking the
	envelopes out of the silk bridal purse and counting the
	contents.  CONNIE prepares herself in the large marble
	bathroom.  She rubs her hands over his bronze shoulders, and
	tries to get his interest.

	INT NIGHT: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

	DON CORLEONE in his office.  LUCA BRASI sitting near to him.

				DON CORLEONE
		Luca, I am worried about this man
		Sollozzo.  Find out what you can,
		through the Tattaglias.  Let them
		believe you could be tempted away
		from the Corleone Family, if the
		right offer was made.  Learn what
		he has under his fingernails...

	INT NIGHT: MANCINI APT. HALL (SUMMER 1945)

	The hallway of an apartment building.  SONNY enters, climbs
	two steps at a time.  He knocks, and then whispers.

				SONNY
		It's me, Sonny.

	The door opens, and two lovely arms are around him, pulling
	him into the apartment.

	INT NIGHT: LUCA'S ROOM (WINTER 1945)

	LUCA BRASI's tiny room.  He is partly dressed.  He kneels
	and reaches under his bed and pulls out a small, locked
	trunk.  He opens it, and takes out a heavy, bullet-proof
	vest.  He puts it on, over his wool undershirt, and then
	puts on his shirt and jacket.  He takes his gun, quickly
	disassembles, checks, and reassembles it.  And leaves.

	INT NIGHT: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

	A CLOSE VIEW of DON CORLEONE thinking quietly.

	INT NIGHT: MOVING TRAIN (SUMMER 1945)

	MICHAEL and KAY on a train, speeding on their way to New
	Hampshire.

	INT NIGHT: SUBWAY (WINTER 1945)

	LUCA, in his bulky jacket, sitting quietly on an empty
	subway train.

	INT NIGHT: AIRPLANE (SUMMER 1945)

	HAGEN on the Constellation.  He reaches into his briefcase,
	and takes out several pictures and papers.

	One photograph is of a smiling man, JACK WOLTZ, linked arm
	in arm with fifteen movie stars on either side, including a
	lovely young child star to his immediate right.

	HAGEN considers other papers.

	INT NIGHT: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

	DON CORLEONE looks, and then moves HAGEN into an embrace.
	He straightens his arms and looks at TOM deeply.

				DON CORLEONE
		Remember my new Consigliere, a
		lawyer with his briefcase can steal
		more than a hundred men with guns.

	EXT DAY: WOLTZ ESTATE GATE (SUMMER 1945)

	JACK WOLTZ ESTATE.  HAGEN stands before the impressive gate,
	armed only with his briefcase.  A GATEMAN opens the gate,
	and TOM enters.

	EXT DAY: WOLTZ GARDENS (SUMMER 1945)

	HAGEN and WOLTZ comfortably stroll along beautiful formal
	gardens, martinis in hand.

				WOLTZ
		You should have told me your boss
		was Corleone, Tom, I had to check
		you out.  I thought you were just
		some third rate hustler Johnny was
		running in to bluff me.
			  (a piece of statuary)
		Florence, thirteenth century.
		Decorated the garden of a king.

	They cross the garden and head toward the stables.

				WOLTZ
		I'm going to show you something
		beautiful.

	They pass the stables, and come to rest by a stall with a
	huge bronze plaque attached to the outside wall: "KHARTOUM."
	TWO SECURITY GUARDS are positioned in chairs nearby; they
	rise as WOLTZ approaches.

				WOLTZ
		You like horses?  I like horses, I
		love 'em.  Beautiful, expensive
		Racehorses.

	The animal inside is truly beautiful.  WOLTZ whispers to him
	with true love in his voice.

				WOLTZ
		Khartoum...Kartoum...You are
		looking at six hundred thousand
		dollars on four hoofs.  I bet even
		Russian Czars never paid that kind
		of dough for a single horse.  But
		I'm not going to race him I'm going
		to put him out to Stud.

	INT NIGHT: WOLTZ DINING ROOM (SUMMER 1945)

	HAGEN and WOLTZ sit at an enormous dining room table,
	attended by SEVERAL SERVANTS.  Great paintings hang on the
	walls.  The meal is elaborate and sumptuous.

				HAGEN
		Mr. Corleone is Johnny's Godfather.
		That is very close, a very sacred
		religious relationship.

				WOLTZ
		Okay, but just tell him this is one
		favor I can't give.  But he should
		try me again on anything else.

				HAGEN
		He never asks a second favor when
		he has been refused the first.
		Understood?

				WOLTZ
		You smooth son of a bitch, let me
		lay it on the line for you, and
		your boss.  Johnny Fontane never
		gets that movie.  I don't care how
		many Dago, Guinea, wop Greaseball
		Goombahs come out of the woodwork!

				HAGEN
		I'm German-Irish.

				WOLTZ
		Okay my Kraut-Mick friend, Johnny
		will never get that part because I
		hate that pinko punk and I'm going
		to run him out of the Movies.  And
		I'll tell you why.  He ruined one
		of Woltz Brothers' most valuable
		proteges.  For five years I had
		this girl under training; singing
		lessons!  Acting lessons!  Dancing
		lessons!  We spent hundreds of
		thousands of dollars--I was going
		to make her a star.  I'll be even
		more frank, just to show you that
		I'm not a hard-hearted man, that it
		wasn't all dollars and cents.  That
		girl was beautiful and young and
		innocent and she was the greatest
		piece of ass I've ever ad and I've
		had them all over the world.  Then
		Johnny comes along with that olive
		oil voice and guinea charm and she
		runs off.  She threw it all away to
		make me look ridiculous.  A MAN IN
		MY POSITION CANNOT AFFORD TO BE
		MADE TO LOOK RIDICULOUS!

	EXT DAY: GENCO OLIVE OIL CO. (SUMMER 1945)

	An unimposing little building in New York City on Mott
	Street with a large old sign: "GENCO OLIVE OIL IMPORTS,
	INC." next to an open-faced fruit market.

	A dark Buick pulls up, and a single small man, whom we
	cannot see well because of the distance, gets out and enters
	the building.  This is VIRGIL SOLLOZZO.

	INT DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICES (SUMMER 1945)

	Looking toward the staircase we can hear SOLLOZZO's footsteps
	before he actually rises into view.  He is a small man, very
	dark, with curly black hair.  But wiry, and tight and hard,
	and obviously very dangerous.  He is greeted at the head of
	the stairs by SONNY, who takes his hand and shakes it,
	introducing himself.  For a moment, there is a complex of
	handshaking quite formal, and whispered respectful
	introductions.  Finally, SOLLOZZO is taken into the DON's
	glass paneled office; the two principals are introduced.
	They are very respectful of one another.  Folding chairs are
	brought in by FREDDIE, and soon they are all sitting around
	in a circle; the DON, SOLLOZZO, SONNY, HAGEN, FREDDIE,
	CLEMENZA and TESSIO.  The DON is the slightest bit foolish
	with all his compatriots, whereas SOLLOZZO has brought no
	one.  Throughout all that transpires, however, it is clear
	that this scene is between two men: SOLLOZZO and DON CORLEONE.

				SOLLOZZO
		My business is heroin, I have poppy
		fields, laboratories in Narseilles
		and Sicily, ready to go into
		production.  My importing methods
		are as safe as these things can be,
		about five per cent loss.  The risk
		is nothing, the profits enormous.

				DON CORLEONE
		Why do you come to me?  Why do I
		deserve your generosity?

				SOLLOZZO
		I need two million dollars in
		cash...more important, I need a
		friend who has people in high
		places; a friend who can guarantee
		that if one of my employees be
		arrested, they would get only light
		sentences.  Be my friend.

				DON CORLEONE
		What percentages for my family?

				SOLLOZZO
		Thirty per cent.  In the first year
		your share would be four million
		dollars; then it would go up.

				DON CORLEONE
		And what is the percentage of the
		Tattaglia family?

	SOLLOZZO nods toward HAGEN.

				SOLLOZZO
		My compliments.  I'll take care of
		them from my share.

				DON CORLEONE
		So.  I receive 30 per cent just for
		finance and legal protection.  No
		worries about operations, is that
		what you tell me?

				SOLLOZZO
		If you think two million dollars in
		cash is just finance, I congratulate
		you Don Corleone.

	There is a long silence; in which each person present feels
	the tension.  The DON is about to give his answer.

				DON CORLEONE
		I said I would see you because I've
		heard you're a serious man, to be
		treated with respect...
			  (pause)
		But I'll say no to you.

	We feel this around the room.

				DON CORLEONE
		I'll give you my reasons.  I have
		many, many friends in Politics.
		But they wouldn't be so friendly if
		my business was narcotics instead
		of gambling.  They think gambling
		is something like liquor, a harmless
		vice...and they think narcotics is
		dirty business.

	SOLLOZZO takes a breath.

				DON CORLEONE
		No...how a man makes his living is
		none of my business.  But this
		proposition of yours is too risky.
		All the people in my family lived
		well the last ten years, I won't
		risk that out of greed.

				SOLLOZZO
		Are you worried about security for
		your million?

				DON CORLEONE
		No.

				SOLLOZZO
		The Tattaglias will guarantee your
		investment also.

	This startles SONNY; he blurts out.

				SONNY
		The Tattaglia family guarantees our
		investment?

	SOLLOZZO hears him first, and then very slowly turns to face
	him.  Everyone is the room knows that SONNY has stepped out
	of line.

				DON CORLEONE
		Young people are greedy, and they
		have no manners.  They speak when
		they should listen.  But I have a
		sentimental weakness for my
		children, and I've spoiled them, as
		you see.  But Signor Sollozzo, my
		no is final.

	SOLLOZZO nods, understands that this is the dismissal.  He
	glances one last time at SONNY.  He rises; all the others do
	as well.  He bows to the DON, shakes his hand, and formally
	takes his leave.  When the footsteps can no longer be heard:

	The DON turns to SONNY.

				DON CORLEONE
		Santino, never let anyone outside
		the family know what you are
		thinking.  I think your brain is
		going soft from all that comedy you
		play with that young girl.

	TWO OFFICE WORKERS are carrying an enormous floral display
	with the word "THANK YOU" spelled out in flowers.

				DON CORLEONE
		What is this nonsense?

				HAGEN
		It's from Johnny.  It was announced
		this morning.  He's going to play
		the lead in the new Woltz Brothers
		film.

	INT DAY: WOLTZ'S BEDROOM (SUMMER 1945)

	It is large, dominated by a huge bed, in which a man,
	presumably WOLTZ, is sleeping.  Soft light bathes the room
	from the large windows.  We move closer to him until we see
	his face, and recognize JACK WOLTZ.  He turns uncomfortably;
	mutters, feels something strange in his bedsheets.  Something
	wet.

	He wakens, feels the sheets with displeasure; they are wet.
	He looks at his hand; the wetness is blood.  He is
	frightened, pulls aside the covers, and sees fresh blood on
	his sheets and pajamas.  He grunts, pulls the puddle of
	blood in his bed.  He feels his own body frantically,
	moving, down, following the blood, until he is face to face
	with the great severed head of Khartoum lying at the foot of
	his bed.  Just blood from the hacked neck.  White reedy
	tendons show.  He struggles up to his elbows in the puddle
	of blood to see more clearly.  Froth covers the muzzle, and
	the enormous eyes of the animal are yellowed and covered
	with blood.

	WOLTZ tries to scream; but cannot.  No sound comes out.
	Then, finally and suddenly an ear-splitting scream of pure
	terror escapes from WOLTZ, who is rocking on his hands and
	knees in an uncontrolled fit, blood all over him.

	INT DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICES (SUMMER 1945)

	CLOSE VIEW on the GODFATHER.  Nodding.

				DON CORLEONE
		Send Johnny my congratulations.

	----------------------------------------FADE OUT--------

	(SCENES 12 & 12 OMITTED)

	FADE IN:

	EXT DAY: FIFTH AVENUE (WINTER 1945)

	Fifth Avenue in the snow.  Christmas week.  People are
	bundled up with rosy faces, rushing to buy presents.

	KAY and MICHAEL exit a Fifth Avenue department store,
	carrying a stack of gaily wrapped gifts, arm in arm.

				KAY
		We have something for your mother,
		for Sonny, we have the tie for
		Fredo and Tom Hagen gets the
		Reynolds pen...

				MICHAEL
		And what do you want for Christmas?

				KAY
		Just you.

	They kiss.

	INT DAY: HOTEL ROOM (WINTER 1945)

	CLOSE ON a wooden radio, playing quiet Music.  THE VIEW PANS
	AROUND the dark hotel room, curtained against the daylight.

				MICHAEL (O.S.)
		We'll have a quiet, civil ceremony
		at the City Hall, no big fuss, no
		family, just a couple of friends as
		witnesses.

	The two are in each other's arms in a mess of bedsheets on
	the two single beds that they have pushed together.

				KAY
		What will your father say?

				MICHAEL
		As long as I tell him beforehand he
		won't object.  He'll be hurt, but
		he won't object.

				KAY
		What time do they expect us?

				MICHAEL
		For dinner.  Unless I call and tell
		them we're still in New Hampshire.

				KAY
		Michael.

				MICHAEL
		Then we can have dinner, see a
		show, and spend one more night.

	He moves to the telephone.

				MICHAEL (CONT'D.)
		Operator.  Get me
			  (fill in number)


				KAY
		Michael, what are you doing?

				MICHAEL
		Shhh, you be the long distance
		operator.  Here.

				KAY
		Hello...this is Long Distance.  I
		have a call from New Hampshire.  Mr.
		Michael Corleone.  One moment please.

	She hands the phone to MICHAEL who continues the deception.

				MICHAEL
		Hello, Tom?  Michael.  Yeah...
		listen, we haven't left yet.  I'm
		driving down to the city with Kay
		tomorrow morning.  There's something
		important I want to tell the old
		man before Christmas.  Will he be
		home tomorrow night?

	INT DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

	HAGEN in the Olive Oil Company office.  In the background,
	through the glass partitions, we can see the DON, at work in
	his office.  TOM is tired, and steeped in paperwork.

				HAGEN (O.S.)
		Sure.  Anything I can do for you.

				MICHAEL (O.S.)
		No.  I guess I'll see you Christmas.
		Everyone's going to be out at Long
		Beach, right?

				HAGEN
		Right.

	He smiles.  MICHAEL has hung up.  He looks at the piles of
	work, and can't face it.  He rises, puts on his coat and
	hat, and continues out.

	He peeks into the DON's office.

				HAGEN
		Michael called; he's not leaving
		New Hampshire until tomorrow
		morning.  I've got to go, I promised
		Theresa I'd pick up some toys for
		the kids.

	The DON smiles and nods.

	TOM smiles, and leaves; OUR VIEW remaining with DON CORLEONE.
	FREDDIE is sitting on a bench in the corner, reading the
	afternoon paper.  He puts aside the papers the office
	manager has prepared for him, and then moves to FREDDIE,
	raps his knuckles on his head to take his nose out of the
	paper.

				DON CORLEONE
		Tell Paulie to get the car from the
		lot; I'll be ready to go home in a
		few minutes.

				FREDO
		I'll have to get it myself; Paulie
		called in sick this morning.

				DON CORLEONE
		That's the third time this month.
		I think maybe you'd better get a
		healthier bodyguard for me.  Tell
		Tom.

				FREDO
			  (going)
		Paulie's a good kid.  If he's sick,
		he's sick.  I don't mind getting
		the car.

	FREDDIE leaves.  He slowly puts on his jacket.  Looks out
	his window.

	EXT DUSK: OLIVE OIL CO. (WINTER 1945)

	FREDDIE crosses the street.

	INT DUSK: OLIVE OIL OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

				OFFICE MANAGER
		Buon Watale, Don Corleone.

	The MANAGER helps him on with his overcoat.  Once again, the
	DON glances out his window.

	The black car pulls up; FREDDIE driving.

				DON CORLEONE
		Merry Christmas.
			  (handing the MANAGER
			  an envelope)


	And he starts down the stairs.

	EXT DUSK: OLIVE OIL CO. (WINTER 1945)

	The light outside is very cold, and beginning to fail.  When
	FREDDIE sees his FATHER coming, he moves back into the
	driver's seat.  The DON moves to the car, and is about to
	get in when he hesitates, and turns back to the long, open
	fruit stand near the corner.

	The PROPRIETOR springs to serve him.  The DON walks among
	the trays and baskets, and merely points to a particular
	piece of fruit.  As he selects, the MAN gingerly picks the
	pieces of fruit up and puts them into a paper bag.  The DON
	pays with a five dollar bill, waits for his change, and then
	turns back to the car.

	EXT DUSK: POLKS TOY STORE (WINTER 1945)

	TOM HAGEN exits carrying a stack of presents, all gift
	wrapped.  He continues past the windows.  As he walks,
	someone walks right in his way.  He looks up.  It is SOLLOZZO.

	He takes TOM by the arm and walks along with him.

				SOLLOZZO
			  (quietly)
		Don't be frightened.  I just want
		to talk to you.

	A car parked at the curb suddenly flings its rear door open.

				SOLLOZZO
			  (urgently)
		Get in; I want to talk to you.

	HAGEN pulls his arm free.  He is frightened.

				HAGEN
		I haven't got time.

	TWO MEN suddenly appear on either side of him.

				SOLLOZZO
		Get in the car.  If I wanted to
		kill you you'd be dead already.
		Trust me.

	HAGEN, sick to his stomach, moves with his ESCORTS, leaving
	our VIEW on the Mechanical windows gaily bobbing the story
	of Hansel and Gretel.  We HEAR the car doors shut, and the
	car drive off.

	EXT NIGHT: RADIO CITY - PHONE BOOTH (WINTER 1945)

	RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL during the Christmas show.  KAY and
	MICHAEL exit; tears are still streaming down her cheeks, and
	she sniffles, and dries her tears with Kleenex.  KAY
	nostalgically hums "The Bells of Saint Mary's," as they walk
	arm in arm.

				KAY
		Would you like me better if I were
		a nun?

				MICHAEL
		No.

				KAY
		Would you like me better if I were
		Ingrid Bergman?

	They have passed a little enclosed newsstand.  KAY sees
	something that terrifies her.  She doesn't know what to do.
	MICHAEL still walks, thinking about her question.

				KAY
			  (a little voice)
		Michael?

				MICHAEL
		I'm thinking about it.

				KAY
		Michael...

				MICHAEL
		No, I would not like you better if
		you were Ingrid Bergman.

	She cannot answer him.  Rather she pulls him by the arm,
	back to the newsstand, and points.  His face goes grave.

	The headlines read: "VITO CORLEONE SHOT, CHIEFTAN GUNNED
	DOWN."

	MICHAEL is petrified; quickly he takes each edition, drops a
	dollar in the tray, and hungrily reads through them.  KAY
	knows to remain silent.

				MICHAEL
			  (desperately)
		They don't say if he's dead or alive.

	EXT DUSK: OLIVE OIL CO. (WINTER 1945)

	DON CORLEONE by the fruit stand; he is about to move to the
	car, when TWO MEN step from the corner.  Suddenly, the DON
	drops the bag of fruit and darts with startling quickness
	toward the parked car.

				DON CORLEONE
		Fredo, Fredo!

	The paper bag has hit the ground, and the fruit begins
	rolling along the sidewalk, as we HEAR gunshots.

	Five bullets catch the DON in the back; he arches in pain,
	and continues toward the car.

	The PROPRIETOR of the fruit stand rushes for cover, knocking
	over an entire case of fruit.

	The TWO GUNMEN move in quickly, anxious to finish him off.

	Their feet careful to avoid the rolling fruit.  There are
	more GUNSHOTS.

	FREDDIE is hysterical; he tries to get out of the car;
	having difficulty opening the door.  He rushes out, a gun
	trembling in his hand; his mouth open.  He actually drops
	the gun.

	The gun falls amid the rolling fruit.

	The GUNMEN are panicked.  They fire once more at the downed
	DON CORLEONE.  His leg and arm twitch where they are hit;
	and pools of blood are beginning to form.

	The GUNMEN are obviously in a state of panic and confusion;
	they disappear around the corner as quickly as they came.

	The PEOPLE about the avenue have all but disappeared:
	rather, we catch glimpses of them, poking their heads safely
	from around corners, inside doorways and arches, and from
	windows.  But the street itself is now empty.

	FREDDIE is in shock; he looks at his FATHER; now great
	puddles of blood have formed, and the DON is lifeless and
	face down in them.

	FREDDIE falls back on to the curb and sits there, saying
	something we cannot understand.  He begins to weep profusely.

	INT NIGHT: SUBWAY (WINTER 1945)

	LUCA BRASI riding alone on a subway car, late at night.  He
	gets off.

	He emerges at a subway terminal, proceeds out.

	EXT NITE: NIGHT CLUB STREET (WINTER 1945)

	LUCA walks down the late night street.  He approaches an
	elegant New York Nightclub, whose gaudy neon sign is still
	winking this late at night.  He waits and watches.  Then the
	sign goes out; and he proceeds into the club.

	INT NITE: NIGHTCLUB (WINTER 1945)

	The main floor of the Nightclub is very large, with endless
	glistening wooden floors.  Now, at this late time, the
	chairs have been stacked on the tables and a NEGRO JANITOR
	is waxing them.  A single HAT-CHECK GIRL is counting her
	receipts.  LUCA moves past the empty bandstand, and sits at
	the bar.  ANOTHER MAN, dark and very well-built, moves
	behind the bar.

				MAN
		Luca...I'm Bruno Tattaglia.

				LUCA
		I know.

	LUCA looks up; and out of the shadows emerges SOLLOZZO.

				SOLLOZZO
		Do you know who I am?

	LUCA Nods.

				SOLLOZZO
		You've been talking to the
		Tattaglias.  They thought we could
		do business.

	LUCA listens.

				SOLLOZZO
		I need somebody strong to protect
		my operation, physically.  I've
		heard you're not happy with your
		family, you might make a switch.

				LUCA
		If the money is good enough.

				SOLLOZZO
		On the first shipment, I can
		guarantee you fifty thousand dollars.

	LUCA looks at him; he had no idea the offer would be so good.

	SOLLOZZO extends his hand, but LUCA pretends not to see it,
	rather, he busies himself putting a cigarette in his mouth.
	BRUNO TATTAGLIA, behind the bar, makes a cigarette lighter
	magically appear, and holds it to LUCA's cigarette.  Then,
	he does an odd thing; he drops the lighter on the bar, and
	puts his hand lightly on LUCA's, almost patting it.

	INT NITE: SONNY'S LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)

	The telephone in SONNY's house is ringing.  He approaches
	it, obviously fresh from a nap.

				SONNY
		Yeah.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Do you recognize my voice?

				SONNY
		I think so.  Detective squad?

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Right.  Don't say my name, just
		listen.  Somebody shot your father
		outside his place fifteen minutes
		ago.

				SONNY
		Is he alive?

				VOICE (O.S.)
		I think so, but I can't get close
		enough.  There's a lot of blood.
		I'll try to find out more.

				SONNY
		Find out anything you can...you got
		a Grand coming.

	SONNY cradles the phone.  An incredible rage builds up in
	him, his face actually turning red.  He would like to rip
	the phone to pieces in his bare hands.  Then he controls it.
	Quickly, he dials another number.

				SONNY
		Theresa, let me talk to Tom.  Not
		yet?  Have him call me as soon as
		he gets home.

	He hangs up.

				SANDRA (O.S.)
		Sonny?  Sonny, who is it?
			  (she enters the room)
		What is it?

				SONNY
			  (calmly)
		They shot the old man.

				SANDRA
		Oh God...

				SONNY
		Honey...don't worry.  Nothing else
		is going to happen.

	There is a POUNDING on the door.  A BABY starts crying.

				SANDRA
			  (really frightened)
		SONNY?

	SONNY reaches into a cabinet drawer, takes out a gun, and
	moves quickly.  He opens the front door quickly.  It is
	CLEMENZA.  He enters, SONNY closes the door.  SANDRA goes to
	look after the baby.

				CLEMENZA
			  (excited)
		You heard about your father?

				SONNY
		Yeah.

				CLEMENZA
		The word is out in the streets that
		he's dead.

				SONNY
		Where the hell was Paulie, why
		wasn't he with the Don?

				CLEMENZA
		Paulie's been a little sick all
		winter...he was home.

				SONNY
		How many times did he stay home the
		last couple of months?

				CLEMENZA
		Maybe three, four times.  I always
		asked Freddie if he wanted another
		bodyguard, but he said no.  Things
		have been so smooth the last ten
		years...

				SONNY
		Go get Paulie, I don't care how
		sick he is.  Pick him up yourself,
		and bring him to my father's house.

				CLEMENZA
		That's all?  Don't you want me to
		send some people over here?

				SONNY
		No, just you and Paulie.

	CLEMENZA leaves; SONNY moves to SANDRA, who sits on the
	couch weeping quietly, comforting her BABY.

				SONNY
		A couple of our people will come to
		stay here.  Do whatever they say;
		I'm going over to the main house.
		If you want me, use Pop's special
		phone.

	The telephone rings again.  SONNY answers it.

				SONNY
		Hello.

				SOLLOZZO (O.S.)
		Santino Corleone?

	SANDRA moves behind him, anxious to know who it is.  SONNY
	indicates that she be quiet.

				SONNY
		Yeah.

				SOLLOZZO (O.S.)
		We have Tom Hagen.  In about three
		hours he'll be released with our
		proposition.  Don't do anything
		until you've heard what he has to
		say.  You can only cause a lot of
		trouble.  What's done is done.
			  (a pause)
		Don't lose that famous temper of
		yours.

				SONNY
			  (quietly)
		I'll wait.

	EXT NITE: MALL (WINTER 1945)

	FULL VIEW OF THE CORLEONE MALL.  It is night, but the
	courtyard is bathed with white light from floodlights on the
	tops of all the houses.  It is very cold.  We see the figure
	of SONNY cross the Mall, and let himself into the main house.

	INT NITE: DON'S KITCHEN (WINTER 1945)

	SONNY walks into the empty, darkened house.  Then he calls
	out.

				SONNY
		Ma?  Ma, where are you.

	The kitchen door swings open.  He moves quickly and takes
	her by the arm.  He is deliberately calm.

				SONNY
		Ma, I just got a call.  Pop's
		hurt...I don't know how bad.

				MAMA
			  (quietly)
		Santino?  Have they killed him?

				SONNY
			  (almost in tears)
		We don't know yet, Ma.

				MAMA
		I'll get dressed.  In case we can
		see him...

	She moves out of the kitchen, and continues upstairs.  SONNY
	turns the gas from the pan of peppers she was frying.  He
	takes some bread without thinking, and dips it in the oil,
	and sloppily eats some of the peppers, as he moves into his
	father's office.

	INT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

	He switches the lights on in the DON's office.  The massive
	desk dominates the room.  SONNY moves quickly to the
	telephone, pulling a small chair to the side of the desk,
	and dials a number.

				SONNY
		Tessio...This is Santino Corleone.
		I want fifty reliable men out here.

				TESSIO (O.S.)
		I heard, Sonny...but what about
		Clemenza's regime?

				SONNY
		I don't want to use Clemenza's
		people right now.  Understood?

	He hangs up.  He moves quickly to a wall safe; operates the
	dial, and removes a small notebook.  He takes it back to the
	desk, and runs over the list of numbers with his forefinger.
	We follow the names, until the finger stops at one: LUCA
	BRASI.  SONNY dials the number.  There is no answer.

				SONNY
		Luca.

	INT NITE: BUILDING (WINTER 1945)

	The interior of an abandoned building.  SEVERAL MEN in suits
	and ties sit around in the booths.

	HAGEN sits in one: SOLLOZZO sits across from him.

				SOLLOZZO
		I know you're not in the muscle end
		of the family--so I don't want you
		to be afraid.  I want you to help
		the Corleones and I want you to
		help me.

	HAGEN's hands are trembling as he tries to put a cigarette
	in his mouth.  ONE of the BUTTON MEN brings a bottle of rye
	to the table, and pours a little into a delicate, flowered
	china cup.  HAGEN sips gratefully.

				SOLLOZZO
		Your boss is dead...

	HAGEN is overwhelmed: actual tears spring to his eyes.
	SOLLOZZO pauses respectfully.

				SOLLOZZO
			  (pushing the bottle)
		Have some more.  We got him outside
		his office, just before I picked
		you up.  You have to make the peace
		between me and Santino.

	HAGEN still is focused on the grief of losing the old man.

				SOLLOZZO
		Sonny was hot for my deal, right?
		You know it's the smart thing to
		do, too.  I want you to talk Sonny
		into it.

				HAGEN
			  (pulling himself together)
		Sonny will come after you with
		everything he's got.

	SOLLOZZO rises, impatiently.

				SOLLOZZO
		That's going to be his first
		reaction.  You have to talk some
		sense into him.  The Tattaglia
		family stands behind me with all
		their people.  The other New York
		Families will go along with anything
		that prevents a full scale war.

	He leans close to HAGEN.

				SOLLOZZO
		The Don was slipping; in the old
		days I could never have gotten to
		him.  Now he's dead, nothing can
		bring him back.  Talk to Sonny,
		talk to the Caporegimes, Clemenza
		and Tessio...it's good business.

				HAGEN
		Even Sonny won't be able to call
		off Luca Brasi.

				SOLLOZZO
		I'll worry about Luca.  You take
		care of Sonny and the other two kids.

				HAGEN
		I'll try...It's what the Don would
		want us to do.

				SOLLOZZO
			  (lifting his hands in
			  an expression of harmlessness)
		Good...then you can go...
			  (he escorts him to
			  the door)
		I don't like violence.  I'm a
		businessman, and blood is a big
		expense.

	He opens the door; they step out together.

	EXT NITE: BUILDING

	HAGEN, SOLLOZZO exit.

	But a car pulls up, and ONE of SOLLOZZO'S MEN rushes out.
	He indicates with some urgency that he wants to talk to
	SOLLOZZO in private.

	Then SOLLOZZO moves with a grave expression.  He opens the
	door, indicating that HAGEN should be led back in.

				SOLLOZZO
		The old man is still alive.  Five
		bullets in his Sicilian hide and
		he's still alive.
			  (he gives a fatalistic
			  shrug)
		Bad luck for me, bad luck for you.

	EXT NITE: MALL (WINTER 1945)

	MICHAEL driving during the night.  There is a little fog in
	the air, and moisture has formed on the windshield, making
	it difficult to see well.  The wipers move across the view,
	as the gate of the Corleone Mall appears before us, still
	decorated for Christmas.  The courtyard is bathed with white
	floodlight, giving this place a cold and isolated look.  The
	narrow entrance mouth of the Mall is sealed off with a link
	chain.  There are strange cars parked along the curving
	cement walk.  SEVERAL MEN are congregated about the gate and
	chain; ONE of them approaches MICHAEL's car.

				MAN
		Who're you?

	ANOTHER peeks his ugly face almost right up to MICHAEL, and
	then turns.

				MAN 2
		It's the Don's kid; take the car,
		I'll bring him inside.

	The FIRST MAN opens the car door, and MICHAEL steps out.

	INT NITE: HALL (WINTER 1945)

	The Hallway of the main house is filled with MEN MICHAEL
	doesn't recognize.  They pay little attention to him.  Most
	of them are waiting; sitting uncomfortably; no one is talking.

	INT NITE: DON'S LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)

	MICHAEL moves into the living room; there is a Christmas
	tree, and countless greeting cards taped to the walls.

	THERESA HAGEN is sitting stiffly on the sofa, smoking a
	cigarette; on the coffee table in front of her is a water
	glass half filled with whiskey.  On the other side of the
	sofa sits CLEMENZA; his face is impassive, but he is
	sweating, and the cigar in his hand glistens slickly black
	with his saliva.  PAULIE GATTO sits tensely and alone on the
	other side of the room.  CLEMENZA sees MICHAEL, looks up at
	him.

				CLEMENZA
		Your mother's at the hospital with
		the old man: He's gonna pull through.

	MICHAEL nods his relief.

				MICHAEL
		Thanks.

	He moves to THERESA.

				MICHAEL
			  (gently)
		You heard from Tom yet?

	Without looking up, she clings to him for a moment, and
	trembles.  Occasionally, STRANGE MEN will cross through the
	room; everyone speaks in a whisper.

				MICHAEL
			  (taking her hand)
		C'mon.

	He leads her into his father's office without knocking.

	INT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

	SONNY and TESSIO are huddled around a yellow pad.  They look
	up, startled.

				SONNY
		Don't worry, Theresa; they just
		want to give Tom the proposition,
		then they're going to turn him loose.

	He reassuringly hugs THERESA, and then to MICHAEL's surprise,
	he kisses him on the cheek.

				SONNY
		I was worried when we couldn't get
		in touch with you in that hick town.

				MICHAEL
		How's Mom?

				SONNY
		Good.  She's been through it before.
		Me too.  You were too young to know
		about it.  You better wait outside;
		there're some things you shouldn't
		hear.

				MICHAEL
		I can help you out...

				SONNY
		Oh no you can't, the old man'd be
		sore as hell if I let you get mixed
		up in this.

				MICHAEL
		Jesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny.

				SONNY
		Theresa.

	She understands, and leaves them alone.

				SONNY
		All right, Mikey...who do we have
		to hit, Clemenza or Paulie?

				MICHAEL
		What?

				SONNY
		One of them fingered the old man.

	MICHAEL didn't realize that the men waiting outside were on
	trial for their lives.

				MICHAEL
		Clemenza?  No, I don't believe it.

				SONNY
		You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay.
		It was Paulie.

				MICHAEL
		How can you be sure?

				SONNY
		On the three days Paulie was sick
		this month, he got calls from a
		payphone across from the old man's
		building.  We got people in the
		phone company.
			  (he shrugs)
		Thank God it was Paulie...we'll
		need Clemenza bad.

	MICHAEL is just realizing the gravity and extent of the
	situation.

				MICHAEL
		Is it going to be all-out war, like
		last time?

				SONNY
		Until the old man tells me different.

				MICHAEL
		Then wait, Sonny.  Talk to Pop.

				SONNY
		Sollozzo is a dead man, I don't
		care what it costs.  I don't care
		if we have to fight all the five
		families in New York.  The Tattaglia
		family's going to eat dirt.  I
		don't care if we all go down
		together.

				MICHAEL
			  (softly)
		That's not how Pop would have
		played it.

				SONNY
		I know I'm not the man he was.  But
		I'll tell you this and he'll tell
		you too.  When it comes to real
		action, I can operate as good as
		anybody short range.

				MICHAEL
			  (calmly)
		All right, Sonny.  All right.

				SONNY
		Christ, if I could only contact Luca.

				MICHAEL
		Is it like they say?  Is he that
		good?

	Outside, we HEAR THERESA cry out, almost a scream of relief.
	Then open the door and rush out.

	Everyone is standing: in the doorway, TOM HAGEN is wrapped
	in a tight embrace with his WIFE.

				HAGEN
		If I plead before the Supreme
		Court, I'll never do better than I
		did tonight with that Turk.

	EXT NITE: MALL, FEATURING DON'S HOUSE (WINTER 1945)

	The windows of the main house are dark except for the DON's
	study.  It stands out against the cold, dark night.

	INT NITE: DON'S LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)

	The living room is empty, save for PAULIE GATTO sitting on
	the edge of the sofa.  The clock reads: 4:00 a.m.

	INT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

	SONNY, MICHAEL, HAGEN, CLEMENZA and TESSIO; all exhausted,
	in shirtsleeves, about to fall asleep.  It is four in the
	morning; there is evidence of many cups of coffee and many
	snacks.  They can barely talk anymore.

				HAGEN
		Is the hospital covered?

				SONNY
		The cops have it locked in and I
		got my people there visiting Pop
		all the time.  What about the hit
		list.

	HAGEN widens his sleepy eyes, and looks at the yellow pad.

				HAGEN
		Too much, too far, too personal.
		The Don would consider this all
		purely a business dispute: Get rid
		of Sollozzo, and everything falls
		in line.  YOU don't have to go
		after the Tattaglias.

	CLEMENZA nods.

				HAGEN
		What about Luca?  Sollozzo didn't
		seem worried about Luca.  That
		worries me.

				SONNY
		If Luca sold out we're in real
		trouble.

				HAGEN
		Has anyone been able to get in
		touch with him?

				SONNY
		No, and I've been calling all night.
		Maybe he's shacked up.

				HAGEN
		Luca never sleeps over with a broad.
		He always goes home when he's
		through.  Mike, keep ringing Luca's
		number.

	MICHAEL, very tired, picks up the phone, and dials the
	number once again.  He can hear the phone ringing on the
	other end but no one answers.  Then hangs up.

				HAGEN
		Keep trying every fifteen minutes.
			  (exhausted)


				SONNY
		Tom, you're the Consigliere, what
		do we do if the old man dies?

				HAGEN
		Without your father's political
		contacts and personal influence,
		the Corleone family loses half its
		strength.  Without your father, the
		other New York families might wind
		up supporting Sollozzo, and the
		Tattaglias just to make sure there
		isn't a long destructive war.  The
		old days are over, this is 1946;
		nobody wants bloodshed anymore.  If
		your father dies...make the deal,
		Sonny.

				SONNY
			  (angry)
		That's easy to say; it's not your
		father.

				HAGEN
			  (quietly)
		I was as good a son to him as you
		or Mike.

				SONNY
		Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it
		that way.

				HAGEN
		We're all tired...

				SONNY
		OK, we sit tight until the old man
		can give us the lead.  But Tom, I
		want you to stay inside the Mall.
		You too, Mike, no chances.  Tessio,
		you hold your people in reserve,
		but have them nosing around the
		city.  The hospital is yours; I
		want it tight, fool-proof, 24 hours
		a day.

	There is a timid knock on the door.

				SONNY
		What is it?

	PAULIE GATTO looks in.

				CLEMENZA
		I tol' you to stay put, Paulie...

				PAULIE
		The guy at the gate's outside...says
		there's a package...

				SONNY
		Tessio, see what it is.

	TESSIO gets up, leaves.

				PAULIE
		You want me to hang around?

				SONNY
		Yeah.  Hang around.

				PAULIE
		Outside?

				CLEMENZA
		Outside.

				PAULIE
		Sure.

	He closes the door.

				SONNY
		Clemenza.  You take care of Paulie.
		I don't ever want to see him again.
		Understood?

				CLEMENZA
		Understood.

				SONNY
		Okay, now you can move your men
		into the Mall, replace Tessio's
		people.  Mike, tomorrow you take a
		couple of Clemenza's people and go
		to Luca's apartment and wait for
		him to show.  That crazy bastard
		might be going after Sollozzo right
		now if he's heard the news.

				HAGEN
		Maybe Mike shouldn't get mixed up
		in this so directly.  You know the
		old man doesn't want that.

				SONNY
		OK forget it, just stay on the phone.

	MICHAEL is embarrassed to be so protected.  He dials Luca
	Brasi's number once again.  The ring repeats, but no one
	answers.

	TESSIO comes back, carrying Luca Brasi's bullet-proof vest
	in his hand.  He unwraps it; there is a large fish wrapped
	inside.

				CLEMENZA
		A Sicilian message: Luca Brasi
		sleeps with the fishes.

	INT. NITE: NIGHTCLUB (WINTER 1945)

	LUCA sits at the Bar of the Tattaglia Nightclub, as we
	remember him.  BRUNO TATTAGLIA had just patted his hand.
	LUCA looks up at him.

	Then SOLLOZZO pats the other hand, almost affectionately.
	LUCA is just about to twist his hands away, when they both
	clamp down as hard as they can.  Suddenly, a garrote is
	thrown around his neck, and pulled violently tight.  His
	face begins to turn to purple blotches, and then totally
	purple, right before our eyes; his tongue hangs out, in a
	far more extreme way than a normal tongue could.  His eyes
	bulge.

	ONE of the MEN looks down at him in disgust as LUCA's
	strength leaves him.

				BRUNO
			  (making an ugly face)
		Oh Christ...all over the floor.

	SOLLOZZO lets LUCA's hand go with a victorious smile on his
	face.

	LUCA falls to the floor.

				SOLLOZZO
		The Godfather is next.

	----------------------------------------FADE OUT--------

	FADE IN:

	EXT DAY: CLEMENZA'S HOUSE (WINTER 1945)

	Morning in a simple Brooklyn suburb.  There are rows of
	pleasant houses; driveway after driveway, down the block.  A
	dark, somber young man of thirty-one or two walks with a
	noticeable limp down the sidewalk, and rings the bell.  This
	is ROCCO LAMPONE.  The woman of the house, MRS. CLEMENZA,
	talks to him through the screen door, and then points to the
	side of the house.  ROCCO moves to the garage, which is
	specially heated, and in which CLEMENZA is busy at work
	washing a shiny brand new Lincoln.  LAMPONE admires the car.

				LAMPONE
		Nice.

				CLEMENZA
		Crazy Detroit delivered it with a
		wooden bumper.  They're going to
		send me the chrome bumpers in a
		couple months.  I waited two years
		for this car to come with wooden
		bumpers!

	He scrubs and polishes with great affection.

				CLEMENZA
		Today you make your bones on Paulie.
		You understand everything?

				LAMPONE
		Sure.

	As he scrubs around the glove compartment, he opens it,
	unwraps a gun and gives it to LAMPONE.

				CLEMENZA
		.22 soft-nosed load.  Accurate up
		to five feet.

	LAMPONE expertly puts the gun away.  GATTO's car pulls into
	the driveway, and he sounds the horn.

	The two men walk to the car.  GATTO is driving, a bit
	nervous, like he doesn't know what is up.  LAMPONE gets in
	the rear seat; CLEMENZA in the front, making a grunt of
	recognition.  He looks at his wristwatch, as though wanting
	to chide PAULIE for being late.  PAULIE flinches a little
	when he sees LAMPONE will ride behind him; he half turns:

				PAULIE
		Rocco, sit on the other side.  A
		big guy like you blocks my rearview
		mirror.

	CLEMENZA turns sourly to PAULIE.

				CLEMENZA
		Goddamn Sonny.  He's running scared.
		He's already thinking of going to
		the mattresses.  We have to find a
		place on the West Side.  Paulie,
		you know a good location?

	PAULIE relaxes a bit; he thinks he's off any possible hook
	he was on.  Also there's the money he can make by selling
	Sollozzo any secret location.

				PAULIE
		I'll think about it.

				CLEMENZA
			  (grunting)
		Drive while you thinking; I wanna
		get to the City this month!

	The car pulls out.

	EXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR - ON ROAD (WINTER 1945)

	Inside PAULIE drives; and CLEMENZA sits in a grump.  OUR
	VIEW does not show LAMPONE in the rear seat.

	EXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR AT TUNNEL (WINTER 1945)

	The Car crosses to the Midtown Tunnel in the late Winter
	light.

	INT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR IN TUNNEL (WINTER 1945)

	Inside the tunnel; GATTO doesn't like not seeing LAMPONE.
	He tries to adjust his rearview mirror to catch a glimpse of
	him.

				CLEMENZA
		Pay attention!

	EXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR AT MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)

	The car is parked in the City.  PAULIE comes down from an
	available apartment and gets back into the car.

				PAULIE
		Good for ten men...

				CLEMENZA
		OK, go to Arthur Avenue; I'm
		suppose to call when I found
		somethin'.

	The car pulls off.

	EXT DAY: RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)

	New part of the city; the car pulls up in a parking lot.
	CLEMENZA get outs, glances at LAMPONE, then to PAULIE.

				CLEMENZA
		You wait; I'll call.

	He walks, tucking his shirt into his pants, around the
	corner and enters the Luna Restaurant.

	INT DAY: RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)

	CLEMENZA enters the little restaurant, sits down at a table.
	The WAITERS know him; immediately put a bottle of wine, some
	bread--and then a plate of veal on his table.  He eats.

	EXT DAY: RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)

	CLEMENZA exits the restaurant, belches, adjusts his pants;
	he is well fed.

	We move with him around the corner, not knowing what to
	expect has happened to Paulie.

	There is the car; PAULIE is still sitting behind the wheel,
	LAMPONE in the rear seat.  CLEMENZA steps in.

				CLEMENZA
		He talked my ear off.  Want us to
		go back to Long Beach; have another
		job for us.  Rocco, you live in the
		City, can we drop you off?

				LAMPONE (O.S.)
		Ah, I left my car at your place.

				CLEMENZA
		OK, then you gotta come back.

	The car pulls out.  By now, PAULIE is completely relaxed and
	secure.

				PAULIE
		You think we'll go for that last
		place?

				CLEMENZA
		Maybe, or you gotta know now.

				PAULIE
		Holy cow, I don't gotta know nothing.

	EXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR ON CAUSEWAY (WINTER 1945)

	The car moves along the ready beach area of the causeway.
	Inside, CLEMENZA turns to PAULIE.

				CLEMENZA
		Paulie, pull over.  I gotta take a
		leak.

	The car pulls off the Causeway, into the reeds.  CLEMENZA
	steps out of the car, OUR VIEW MOVING with him.

	He turns his back three quarters from us (we can no longer
	see the car), unzips, and we hear the sound of urine hitting
	the ground.  We wait on this for a moment; and then there
	are two GUNSHOTS.  CLEMENZA finishes his leak, zips up and
	turns, moving back to the car.

	PAULIE is dead, bleeding from the mouth; the windows behind
	him are shattered.

				CLEMENZA
		Leave the gun.

	LAMPONE gets out, the two men walk through the reeds a few
	feet where there is another car.  They get in, and drive off.

	---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

	EXT DAY: MALL (WINTER 1945)

	HIGH ANGLE OF THE MALL.  It is late afternoon.  Many strange
	cars are parked on the nearby streets.  We can see the group
	of BUTTON MEN, stationed here and there, obviously sentries
	with concealed weapons.

	MICHAEL walks along in the rear yard.

	He is bundled in a warm marine coat.  He looks at the
	strange men, regarding them with an uncertain awe.  They
	look back at him, at first suspiciously and then with the
	respect of his position.  He is like an exile Prince.  He
	wanders past them, and hesitates and looks at the yard.

	A rusted set of garden swings; and other home playground
	equipment.  The basketball ring now half coming off.  This
	is where he was a child.  Then a shout.

				CLEMENZA (O.S.)
		Mike.  Hey Mikey; telephone.

	CLEMENZA had shouted from the kitchen window.  MICHAEL
	hurries into the house.

	INT DAY: DON'S KITCHEN (WINTER 1945)

	CLEMENZA is in the kitchen, cooking over an enormous pot.
	He points to the kitchen wall phone which is hanging off the
	hook.

				CLEMENZA
		Some dame.

	MICHAEL picks it up.

				MICHAEL
		Hello.  Kay?

				KAY (O.S.)
		How is your father?

				MICHAEL
		He'll be OK.

				KAY (O.S.)
			  (pause)
		I love you.

	He glances at the THUGS in the kitchen.  Tries to shield the
	phone.

				KAY (O.S.)
		I LOVE YOU.

				MICHAEL
		Yeah Kay, I'm here.

				KAY (O.S.)
		Can you say it?

				MICHAEL
		Huh?

				KAY (O.S.)
		Tell me you love me.

	MICHAEL glances at the HOODS at the kitchen table.  He curls
	up in a corner, and in a quarter voice:

				MICHAEL
		I can't...

				KAY (O.S.)
		Please say it.

				MICHAEL
		Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK?

				KAY (O.S.)
		OK.
			  (click)


	CLEMENZA is getting ready to build a tomato sauce for all
	the button men stationed around the house.

				CLEMENZA
		How come you don't tell that nice
		girl you love her...here, learn
		something... you may have to feed
		fifty guys some day.  You start
		with olive oil...fry some garlic,
		see.  And then fry some sausage...or meat
		balls if you like...then you throw
		in the tomatoes, the tomato
		paste...some basil; and a little
		red wine...that's my trick.

	SONNY peeks into the kitchen; sees CLEMENZA.

				SONNY
		You take care of Paulie?

				CLEMENZA
		You won't see Paulie anymore.  He's
		sick for good this winter.

	MICHAEL starts to leave.

				SONNY
		Where are you going?

				MICHAEL
		To the city.

				SONNY
			  (to Clemenza; dipping
			  bread into the sauce)
		Send some bodyguards.

				MICHAEL
		I don't need them, Sonny.  I'm just
		going to see Pop in the hospital.
		Also, I got other things.

				CLEMENZA
		Sollozzo knows Mike's a civilian.

				SONNY
		OK, but be careful.

	EXT NITE: CAR

	MICHAEL sits in the rear seat, calmly, as he is being driven
	into the city.  THREE BUTTONMEN are crowded into the front
	seat.

	INT NITE: HOTEL LOBBY

	MICHAEL crosses the lobby, past lines of servicemen trying
	to book rooms.

	INT NITE: HOTEL

	MICHAEL and KAY eating a quiet dinner at the hotel.  He is
	preoccupied, she's concerned.

				MICHAEL
		Visiting hour ends at eight thirty.
		I'll just sit with him; I want to
		show respect.

				KAY
		Can I go to the hospital with you?

				MICHAEL
		I don't think so.  You don't want
		to end up on page 3 of the Daily
		News.

				KAY
		My parents don't read the Daily
		News.  All right, if you think I
		shouldn't.  I can't believe the
		things the papers are printing.
		I'm sure most of it's not true.

				MICHAEL
		I don't think so either.
			  (silence)
		I better go.

				KAY
		When will I see you again?

				MICHAEL
		I want you to go back to New
		Hampshire...think things over.

	He leans over her; kisses her.

				KAY
		When will I see you again?

				MICHAEL
		Goodbye.

	Quietly, he moves out the door.

	KAY lies on the bed a while, and then, to herself:

				KAY
		Goodbye.

	EXT NITE: DON'S HOSPITAL (WINTER 1945)

	A taxi pulls up in front of a hospital, marked clearly with
	a neon sign "HOSPITAL--EMERGENCY."  MICHAEL steps out, pays
	the fare...and then stops dead in his tracks.

	MICHAEL looks.

	He sees the hospital in the night; but it is deserted.  He
	is the only one on the street.  There are gay, twinkling
	Christmas decorations all over the building.  He walks,
	slowly at first, and then ever so quickly, up the steps.  He
	hesitates, looks around.  This area is empty.  He checks the
	address on a scrap of paper.  It is correct.  He tries the
	door, it is empty.

	He walks in.

	INT NITE: HOSPITAL LOBBY (WINTER 1945)

	MICHAEL stands in the center of an absolutely empty hospital
	lobby.  He looks to the right; there is a long, empty
	corridor.  To the left: the same.

	HIGH FULL ANGLE, as MICHAEL walks through the desolated
	building lit by eerie green neon lighting.  All we hear are
	his sole footsteps.

	He walks up to a desk marked "INFORMATION".  No one is there.
	He moves quickly to a door marked "OFFICE"; swings into it;
	no one is there.  He looks onto the desk:  There is half a
	sandwich, and a half-filled bottle of coke.

				MICHAEL
		Hello?  Hello?

	Now he knows something is happening, he moves quickly,
	alertly.  MICHAEL walking down the hospital corridors; all
	alone.  The floors have just been mopped.  They are still wet.

	INT NITE: HOSPITAL STAIRS

	Now he turns onto a staircase; ever quickening; up several
	flights.

	INT NITE: 4TH FLOOR CORRIDOR

	He steps out onto the fourth floor.  He looks.  There are
	merely empty corridors.  He takes out his scrap of paper;
	checks it.  "Room 4A."  Now he hurries, trying to follow the
	code of hospital rooms; following the right arrows, quicker
	and quicker they flash by him.  Now he stops, looks up "4A--
	Corleone".

	There is a special card table set up there with some
	magazines...and some smoking cigarettes still in the
	ashtray--but no detectives, no police, no bodyguards.

	INT NITE: DON'S ROOM 4A

	Slowly he pushes the door open, almost afraid at what he
	will find.  He looks.  Lit by the moonlight through the
	window, he can see a FIGURE in the hospital bed alone in the
	room, and under a transparent oxygen tent.  All that can be
	heard is the steady though strained breathing.  Slowly
	MICHAEL walks up to it, and is relieved to see his FATHER,
	securely asleep.  Tubes hang from a steel gallows beside the
	bed, and run to his nose and mouth.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		What are you doing here?

	This startles MICHAEL; who almost jumps around.  It is a
	NURSE lit from the light behind her in the hallway.

				NURSE
		You're not supposed to be here now.

	MICHAEL calms himself, and moves to her.

				MICHAEL
		I'm Michael Corleone--this is my
		father.  What happened to the
		detectives who were guarding him?

				NURSE
		Oh your father just had too many
		visitors.  It interfered with the
		hospital service.  The police came
		and made them all leave just ten
		minutes ago.
			  (comfortingly)
		But don't worry.  I look in on him.

				MICHAEL
		You just stand here one minute...

	Quickly he moves to the telephone, dials a number.

				MICHAEL
		Sonny...Sonny--Jesus Christ, I'm
		down at the hospital.  I came down
		late.  There's no one here.  None
		of Tessio's people--no detectives,
		no one.  The old man is completely
		unprotected.

				SONNY (O.S.)
		All right, get him in a different
		room; lock the door from the inside.
		I'll have some men there inside of
		fifteen minutes.  Sit tight, and
		don't panic.

				MICHAEL
			  (furiously, but kept inside)
		I won't panic.

	He hangs up; returns to the NURSE...

				NURSE
		You cannot stay here...I'm sorry.

				MICHAEL
			  (coldly)
		You and I are going to move my
		father right now...to another room
		on another floor...Can you
		disconnect those tubes so we can
		wheel the bed out?

				NURSE
		Absolutely not!  We have to get
		permission from the Doctor.

				MICHAEL
		You've read about my father in the
		papers.  You've seen that no one's
		here to guard him.  Now I've just
		gotten word that men are coming to
		this hospital to kill him.  Believe
		me and help me.

				NURSE
			  (frightened)
		We don't have to disconnect them,
		we can wheel the stand with the bed.

	She does so...and they perform the very difficult task of
	moving the bed and the apparatus, out of the room.

	INT NITE: 4TH FLOOR HOSPITAL (WINTER 1945)

	They roll the bed, the stand, and all the tubes silently
	down the corridor.  We hear FOOTSTEPS coming up the stairs.
	MICHAEL hears them, stops.

				MICHAEL
		Hurry, into there.

	They push it into the first available room.  MICHAEL peeks
	out from the door.  The footsteps are louder; then they
	emerge.  It is ENZO, NAZORINE's helper, carrying a bouquet
	of flowers.

				MICHAEL
			  (stepping out)
		Who is it?

				ENZO
		Michael...do you remember me, Enzo,
		the baker's helper to Nazorine, now
		his son-in-law.

				MICHAEL
		Enzo, get out of here.  There's
		going to be trouble.

	A look of fear sweeps through ENZO's face.

				ENZO
		If there...will be trouble...I stay
		with you, to help.  I owe it to the
		Godfather.

	MICHAEL thinks, realizes he needs all the help he can get.

				MICHAEL
		Go outside; stand in front...I'll
		be out in a minute.

	INT NITE: DON'S SECOND HOSPITAL ROOM (WINTER 1945)

	They part.  MICHAEL moves into the hospital room where they
	put his FATHER.

				NURSE
			  (frightened)
		He's awake.

	MICHAEL looks at the OLD MAN, his eyes are open, though he
	cannot speak.  MICHAEL touches his face tenderly.

				MICHAEL
		Pop...Pop, it's me Michael.  Shhhh,
		don't try to speak.  There are men
		who are coming to try to kill you.
		But I'm with you...I'm with you
		now...

	The OLD MAN tries to speak...but cannot.  MICHAEL tenderly
	puts his finger to his FATHER's lips.

	EXT NITE: DON'S HOSPITAL STREET (WINTER 1945)

	Outside the hospital is empty save for a nervous ENZO,
	pacing back and forth brandishly the flowers as his only
	weapon.  MICHAEL exits the hospital and moves to him.  They
	both stand under a lamppost in the cold December night.
	They are both frightened; MICHAEL gives ENZO a cigarette,
	lights it.  ENZO's hands are trembling, MICHAEL's are not.

				MICHAEL
		Get rid of those and look like
		you've got a gun in your pocket.

	The windows of the hospital twinkle with Christmas
	decorations.

				MICHAEL
		Listen...

	We HEAR the sound of a single automobile coming.  MICHAEL
	and ENZO look with fear in their eyes.  Then MICHAEL takes
	the bouquet of flowers and stuffs them under his jacket.
	They stand, hands in their pockets.

	A long low black car turns the corner and cruises by them.
	MICHAEL's and ENZO's faces are tough, impassive.  The car
	seems as though it will stop; and then quickly accelerates.
	MICHAEL and ENZO are relieved.  MICHAEL looks down; the
	BAKER's hands are shaking.  He looks at his own, and they
	are not.

	Another moment goes by and we can hear the distant sound of
	police sirens.  They are clearly coming toward the hospital,
	getting louder and louder.  MICHAEL heaves a sigh of relief.

	In a second, a patrol car makes a screaming turn in front of
	the hospital; then two more squad cars follow with uniformed
	POLICE and DETECTIVES.  He smiles his relief and starts
	toward them.  TWO huge, burly POLICEMEN suddenly grab his
	arms while ANOTHER frisks him.  A massive POLICE CAPTAIN,
	spattered with gold braid and scrambled eggs on his hat,
	with beefy red face and white hair seems furious.  This is
	McCLUSKEY.

				MCCLUSKEY
		I thought I got all you guinea
		hoods locked up.  Who the hell are
		you and what are you doing here?

	ANOTHER COP standing nearby:

				COP
		He's clean, Captain.

	MICHAEL studies McCLUSKEY closely.

				MICHAEL
			  (quietly)
		What happened to the detectives who
		were supposed to be guarding my
		father?

				MCCLUSKEY
			  (furious)
		You punk-hood.  Who the hell are
		you to tell me my business.  I
		pulled them off.  I don't care how
		many Dago gangsters kill each other.
		I wouldn't lift a finger to keep
		your old man from getting knocked
		off.  Now get the hell out of here;
		get off this street you punk, and
		stay away from this hospital.

	MICHAEL stands quiet.

				MICHAEL
		I'll stay until you put guards
		around my father's room.

				MCCLUSKEY
		Phil, lock this punk up.

				A DETECTIVE
		The Kid's clean, Captain...He's a
		war hero, and he's never been mixed
		up in the rackets...

				MCCLUSKEY
			  (furious)
		Goddam it, I said lock him up.  Put
		the cuffs on him.

				MICHAEL
			  (deliberately, right
			  to McCLUSKEY's face,
			  as he's being handcuffed)
		How much is the Turk paying you to
		set my father up, Captain?

	Without any warning, McCLUSKEY leans back and hits MICHAEL
	squarely on the jaw with all his weight and strength.
	MICHAEL groans, and lifts his hand to his jaw.  He looks at
	McCLUSKEY; we are his VIEW and everything goes spinning, and
	he falls to the ground, just as we see HAGEN and CLEMENZA'S
	MEN arrive.

	---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

	EXT DAY: MALL (WINTER 1945)

	HIGH ANGLE VIEW of THE CORLEONE MALL.  The gateway now has a
	long black car blocking it.  There are more BUTTON MEN
	stationed more formally; and some of them visibly carrying
	rifles; those of the houses close to the courtyard have MEN
	standing by open windows.  It is clear that the war is
	escalating.  A car pulls up and out get CLEMENZA, LAMPONE,
	MICHAEL and HAGEN.  MICHAEL's jaw is wired and bandaged.  He
	stops and looks up at the open window.  We can see MEN
	holding rifles.

				MICHAEL
		Christ, Sonny really means business.

	They continue walking.  TESSIO joins them.  The various
	BODYGUARDS make no acknowledgment.

				CLEMENZA
		How come all the new men?

				TESSIO
		We'll need them now.  After the
		hospital incident, Sonny got mad.
		We hit Bruno Tattaglia four o'clock
		this morning.

	INT DAY: DON'S HALLWAY

	They enter the house past the scores of new and strange faces.

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

	SONNY is in the DON's office; he is excited and exuberant.

				SONNY
		I've got a hundred button men on
		the streets twenty-four hours a day.
		If Sollozzo shows one hair on his
		ass he's dead.

	He sees MICHAEL, and holds his bandaged face in his hand,
	kiddingly.

				SONNY
		Mikey, you look beautiful!

				MICHAEL
		Cut it out.

				SONNY
		The Turk wants to talk!  The nerve
		of that son of a bitch!  After he
		craps out last night he wants a meet.

				HAGEN
		Was there a definite proposal?

				SONNY
		Sure, he wants us to send Mike to
		meet him to hear his proposition.
		The promise is the deal will be so
		good we can't refuse.

				HAGEN
		What about that Tattaglias?  What
		will they do about Bruno?

				SONNY
		Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out
		what they did to my father.

				HAGEN
		We should hear what they have to say.

				SONNY
		No, no Consiglere.  Not this time.
		No more meetings, no more
		discussions, no more Sollozzo
		tricks.  Give them one message: I
		WANT SOLLOZZO.  If not, it's all
		out war.  We go to the mattresses
		and we put all the button men out
		on the street.

				HAGEN
		The other families won't sit still
		for all out war.

				SONNY
		Then THEY hand me Sollozzo.

				HAGEN
		Come ON Sonny, your father wouldn't
		want to hear this.  This is not a
		personal thing, this is Business.

				SONNY
		And when they shot me father...

				HAGEN
		Yes, even the shooting of your
		father was business, not personal...

				SONNY
		No no, no more advice on how to
		patch it up Tom.  You just help me
		win.  Understood?

	HAGEN bows his head; he is deeply concerned.

				HAGEN
		I found out about this Captain
		McCluskey who broke Mike's jaw.
		He's definitely on Sollozzo's
		payroll, and for big money.
		McCluskey's agreed to be the Turk's
		bodyguard.  What you have to
		understand is that while Sollozzo
		is guarded like this, he's
		invulnerable.  Nobody has ever
		gunned down a New York Police
		Captain.  Never.  It would be
		disastrous.  All the five families
		would come after you Sonny; the
		Corleone family would be outcasts;
		even the old man's political
		protection would run for cover.  So
		just...take that into consideration.

				SONNY
			  (still fuming)
		McCluskey can't stay with the Turk
		forever.  We'll wait.

				MICHAEL
		We can't wait.  No matter what
		Sollozzo say about a deal, he's
		figuring out how to kill Pop.  You
		have to get Sollozzo now.

				SONNY
		The kid's right.

				HAGEN
		What about McCluskey?

				MICHAEL
		Let's say now that we have to kill
		McCluskey.  We'll clear that up
		through our Newspaper contacts later.

				SONNY
		Go on Mike.

				MICHAEL
		They want me to go to the conference
		with Sollozzo.  Set up the meeting
		for two days from now.  Sonny, get
		our informers to find out where the
		meeting will be held.
		Insist it has to be a public place:
		a bar or restaurant at the height
		of the dinner hour.  So I'll feel
		safe.  They'll check me when I meet
		them so I won't be able to carry a
		weapon; but Clemenza, figure out a
		way to have one planted there for
		me.
			  (pause)
		Then I'll kill them both.

	Everyone in the room is astonished; they all look at MICHAEL.
	Silence.  SONNY suddenly breaks out in laughter.  He points
	a finger at MICHAEL, trying to speak.

				SONNY
		You?  You, the high-class college
		kid.  You never wanted to get mixed
		up in the family business.  Now you
		wanta gun down a police Captain and
		the Turk just because you got
		slapped in the face.  You're taking
		it personal, it's just business and
		he's taking it personal.

	Now CLEMENZA and TESSIO are also smiling; only HAGEN keeps
	his face serious.

				MICHAEL
			  (angrily, but cold)
		Sonny, it's all personal, and I
		learned it from him, the old man,
		the Godfather.  He took my joining
		the Marines personal.  I take
		Sollozzo trying to kill my father
		personal, and you know I'll kill
		them Sonny.

	MICHAEL radiates danger...SONNY stops laughing.

	INT DAY: CLEMENZA'S CELLAR (WINTER 1945)

	CLOSE on a revolver.

				CLEMENZA (O.S.)
		It's as cold as they come,
		impossible to trace.
			  (he turns it upside down)
		Don't worry about prints Mike, I
		put a special tape on the trigger
		and butt.  Here.
			  (he hands the gun to
			  another pair of hands)
		Whatsamatter?  Trigger too tight.
			  (it fires: very LOUD)
		I left it noisy, so it'll scare any
		pain-in-the-neck innocent bystander
		away.

	MICHAEL is alone with CLEMENZA in a cellar workshop.

				CLEMENZA
		Just let your hand drop to your
		side, and let the gun slip out.
		Everybody will still think you got
		it.  They'll be starin' at your
		face, see?  Then walk out of the
		place real fast, but don't run.
		Don't look anybody directly in the
		eye, but don't look away from them
		neither.  Hey, they'll be scared
		stiff o you, believe me.  Nobody's
		gonna bother with you.  Don't worry
		about nothing; you'd be surprised
		how good these things go.  O.K.,
		put your hat on, let's see how you
		look.  Helps with identification.

	They put the hat on; CLEMENZA adjusts it.

				CLEMENZA
		Mostly it gives witnesses an excuse
		to change their identification when
		we make them see the light.  Then
		you take a long vacation and we
		catch the hell.

				MICHAEL
		How bad will it be?

				CLEMENZA
		Probably all the other families
		will line up against us.  But, it's
		alright.  These things have to
		happen once every ten years or
		so...gets rid of the bad blood.
		You gotta stop 'em at the beginning.
		Like they shoulda stopped Hitler at
		Munich, they shoulda never let him
		get away with that, they were just
		asking for big trouble...

	INT DAY: DON'S HALL & LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)

	MICHAEL steps into the foyer of the main house.  A card
	table is set up with a man playing cards with three of the
	Corleone buttonmen.

	He continues into the living room.  It's a mess.  SONNY
	asleep on the sofa.  On the coffee table are the remains of
	a take-out Chinese food dinner, and a half-empty bottle of
	whisky.  The radio is playing.

				MICHAEL
		Why don't you stop living like a
		bum and get this place cleaned up.

				SONNY
		What are you, inspecting the
		barracks?
			  (SONNY sits up with
			  his head in his hands)
		You ready?  Did Clemenza tell you
		be sure to drop the gun right away?

				MICHAEL
		A million times.

				SONNY
		Sollozzo and McCluskey are going to
		pick you up in an hour and a half
		on Times Square, under the big
		Camels sign.

				HAGEN
		We don't let Mike go until we have
		the hostage, Sonny.

				CLEMENZA
		It's okay...the hostage is outside
		playing pinochle with three of my
		men.

	The phone rings in the DON's office.

				SONNY
		That could be a Tattaglia informer
		with the meeting place.

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

	HAGEN has hurried into the Den to get the phone; the OTHERS
	move in.

	HAGEN's on the phone; he writes something down.

				SONNY
		One of Tattaglia's people?

				HAGEN
		No.  Our informer in McCluskey's
		precinct.  Tonight at 8:00 he
		signed out for Louis' Restaurant in
		the Bronx.  Anyone know it.

				TESSIO
		Sure, I do.  It's perfect for us.
		A small family place with big
		booths where people can talk in
		private.  Good food.  Everybody
		minds their business.  Perfect.
			  (he moves to the desk
			  and makes a crude drawing)
		This is the entrance, Mike.  When
		you finish just walk out and turn
		left, then turn the corner.
		Clemenza, you gotta work fast to
		plant the gun.  They got an old-
		fashioned toilet with a space
		between the water container and the
		wall.  We can tape the gun behind
		there.

				CLEMENZA
		Mike, they're gonna frisk you in
		the car.  You'll be clean so they
		won't worry 'bout nothing.  In the
		restaurant, wait and talk a while,
		and then ask permission to go.  See?
		Then when you come out, don't waste
		time; don't sit down...you come out
		blasting.  And don't take chances.
		In the head, two shots apiece.  And
		out as fast as your legs can move.

				SONNY
		I want somebody very good, very
		safe to plant that gun.  I don't
		want my brother coming out of that
		toilet with just his dick in his
		hand.

				CLEMENZA
		The gun will be there.

				SONNY
			  (to MICHAEL, warmly)
		You're on, kid...I'll square it
		with Mom your not seeing her before
		you left.  And I'll get a message
		to your girl friend when I think
		the time is right.

				CLEMENZA
		We gotta move...

				MICHAEL
		O.K.  How long do you think before
		I can come back?

				SONNY
		Probably a year...

				HAGEN
			  (starting to crack)
		Jesus, I don't know...

				SONNY
		Can you do it Mike?

	MICHAEL moves out.

	EXT NITE: CAMELS SIGN (WINTER 1945)

	The enormous "CAMELS" sign, puffing smoke, below it stands
	MICHAEL, dressed in a warm overcoat, and wearing the hat
	CLEMENZA had given him.  A long black car pulls around the
	corner and slows before him.  The DRIVER, leaning over, open
	the front door.

				DRIVER
		Get in, Mike.

	He does, the car drives off.

	EXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR (WINTER 1945)

	Inside the car, SOLLOZZO reaches his hand over the back seat
	and shakes MIKE's hand.

				SOLLOZZO
		I'm glad you came, Mike.  I hope we
		can straighten everything out.  All
		this is terrible, it's not the way
		I wanted things to happen at all.
		It should never have happened.

				MICHAEL
		I want to settle things tonight.  I
		want my father left alone.

				SOLLOZZO
		He won't be; I swear to you be my
		children he won't be.  Just keep an
		open mind when we talk.  I hope
		you're not a hothead like your
		brother, Sonny.  It's impossible to
		talk business with him.

	McCLUSKEY grunts.

				MCCLUSKEY
		He's a good kid.  He's all right.
		Turn around, up on your knees,
		facing me.

	He gives MICHAEL a thorough frisk.

				MCCLUSKEY
		I'm sorry about the other night
		Mike.  I'm getting too old for my
		job, too grouchy.  Can't stand the
		aggravation.  You know how it is.
		He's clean.

	EXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR - WEST SIDE HIGHWAY (WINTER 1945)

	MICHAEL looks at the DRIVER and then ahead to see where
	they're heading.

	The car takes the George Washington Bridge.  MICHAEL is
	concerned.

				MICHAEL
		We're going to New Jersey?

				SOLLOZZO
			  (sly)
		Maybe.

	MICHAEL closes his eyes.

	EXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR ON G.W. BRIDGE (WINTER 1945)

	The car speeds along the George Washington Bridge on its way
	to New Jersey.  Then suddenly it hits the divider,
	temporarily lifts into the air, and bounces over into the
	lanes going back to New York.  It then hits it very fast, on
	the way back to the city.

	EXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR (WINTER 1945)

	SOLLOZZO checks to see the cars that had been following, and
	then leans to the DRIVER.

				SOLLOZZO
		Nice work; I'll remember it.

	MICHAEL is relieved.

	EXT NITE: LUNA AZURA RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)

	The car pulls up in front of a little family restaurant in
	the Bronx:  The "LUNA AZURA".  There is no one on the street.
	MICHAEL looks to see if the DRIVER is going to get out with
	them.  He gets out, and opens the door.  SOLLOZZO, McCLUSKEY
	and MICHAEL get out; the DRIVER remains leaning against the
	car.  They enter the restaurant.

	INT NITE: LUNA AZURA (WINTER 1945)

	A very small family restaurant with a mosaic tile floor.
	SOLLOZZO, MICHAEL and McCLUSKEY sit around a rather small
	round table near the center of the room.  There are empty
	booths along the side walls; with a handful of CUSTOMERS,
	and ONE or TWO WAITERS.  It is very quiet.

				MCCLUSKEY
		Is the Italian food good here?

				SOLLOZZO
		Try the veal; it's the finest in
		New York.

	The solitary WAITER brings a bottle of wine to the table.
	They watch him silently as he uncorks it and pours three
	glasses.  Then, when he leaves, SOLLOZZO turns to McCLUSKEY:

				SOLLOZZO
		I am going to talk Italian to Mike.

				MCCLUSKEY
		Sure, you two go right ahead; I'll
		concentrate on my veal and my
		spaghetti.

	SOLLOZZO now begins in rapid Sicilian.  MICHAEL listening
	carefully and nodding every so often.  Then MICHAEL answers
	in Sicilian, and SOLLOZZO goes on.  The WAITER occasionally
	brings food; and they hesitate while he is there; then go on.
	Then MICHAEL, having difficulty expressing himself in
	Italian, accidentally lapses into English.

				MICHAEL
			  (using English for emphasis)
		Most important...I want a sure
		guarantee that no more attempts
		will be made on my father's life.

				SOLLOZZO
		What guarantees can I give you?  I
		am the hunted one.  I've missed my
		chance.  You think too highly of
		me, my friend...I am not so
		clever...all I want if a truce...

	MICHAEL looks long and hard at SOLLOZZO, who is smiling
	holding his open hands up as if to say: "I have no tricks up
	my sleeve".  Then he looks away and makes a distressed look
	on his face.

				SOLLOZZO
		What is it?

				MICHAEL
		Is it all right if I go to the
		bathroom?

	SOLLOZZO is intuitively suspicious.  He studies MICHAEL with
	his dark eyes.  Then he thrusts his hand onto MICHAEL's
	thigh feeling in and around, searching for a weapon.

				MCCLUSKEY
		I frisked him; I've frisked
		thousands of young punks; he's clean.

	He looks at a MAN sitting at a table opposite them;
	indicating the bathroom with his eyes.  The MAN nods,
	indicating no one is there.

				SOLLOZZO
		Don't take too long.

	MICHAEL gets up and calmly walks to the bathroom, and
	disappears inside.

	INT NITE: LUNA AZURA TOILET (WINTER 1945)

	MICHAEL steps into the small bathroom; he is breathing very
	hard.  He actually uses the urinal.  Then he washes his
	hands with the bar of pink soap; and dries them thoroughly.
	Then he moves to the booth, up to the old-fashioned toilet.
	Slowly he reaches behind the water tank; he panics when he
	cannot feel the gun.  We see behind the tank his hand is
	just a few inches from the gun...he gropes
	searchingly...finally coming to rest on the gun.

	CLOSE ON MICHAEL; the feel of it reassures him.  Then he
	breaks it loose from the tape holding it; he takes a deep
	breath and shoves it under his waistband.  For some
	unexplainable reason he hesitates once again, deliberately
	washes his hands and dries them.  Then he goes out.

	INT NITE: LUNA AZURA (WINTER 1945)

	He hesitates by the bathroom door; and looks at his table.
	McCLUSKEY is eating a plate of spaghetti and veal.  SOLLOZZO
	turns around upon hearing the door, and looks directly at
	MICHAEL.  MICHAEL looks back.  Then he smiles and continues
	back to the table.  He sits down.

				MICHAEL
		Now I can talk.  I feel much better.

	The MAN by the far wall had been stiff with attention; now
	he too relaxes.  SOLLOZZO leans toward MICHAEL who sits down
	comfortably and his hands move under the table and unbutton
	his jacket.  SOLLOZZO begins to speak in Sicilian once again
	but MICHAEL's heart is pounding so hard he can barely hear
	him.

	The WAITER comes to ask about the order, SOLLOZZO turns to
	speak, and without warning, MICHAEL shoves the table away
	from him with his left hand, and with his right hand puts
	the gun right against SOLLOZZO's head, just touching his
	temple.  He pulls the trigger, and we see part of SOLLOZZO's
	head blown away, and a spray of fine mist of blood cover the
	entire area.

	The WAITER looks in amazement; suddenly his white jacket is
	sprayed and stained with blood.

	SOLLOZZO seems in a perpetual fall to the floor; through he
	seems to hang in space suspended.

	MICHAEL pivots, and looks:

	There is McCLUSKEY, frozen, the fork with a piece of veal
	suspended in air before his gaping mouth.

	MICHAEL fires; catching McCLUSKEY in his thick bulging
	throat.  He makes a horrible, gagging, choking sound.  Then
	coolly, and deliberately, MICHAEL fires again, fires right
	through McCLUSKEY's white-topped skull.

	The air is filled with pink mist.
	MICHAEL swings toward the MAN standing by the bathroom wall.
	He does not make a move, seemingly paralyzed.
	Now he carefully shows his hands to be empty.
	The WAITER steps backward through the mist of blood, an
	expression of horror on his face.
	MICHAEL looks at his two victims:
	SOLLOZZO still in his chair, side of his body propped up by
	the table.
	McCLUSKEY finally falls from the chair to the table.
	MICHAEL is wildly at a peak.  He starts to move out.  His
	hand: is frozen by his side, STILL GRIPPING THE GUN.
	He moves, not letting the gun go.

	MICHAEL's face; frozen in its expression.

	His hand: still holding the gun.

	His face: finally he closes his eyes.

	His hand relaxes, the gun falls to the floor with a dull thud.

	He walks quickly out of the restaurant, looks back.

	He sees a frozen tableau of the murder; as though it had
	been recreated in wax.

	Then he leaves.

	---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

	FADE IN:

	INT DAY: MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)

	A MAN is his shirtsleeves plays a sentimental tune on an old
	upright piano, while his cigarette burns on the edge.
	ANOTHER stands nearby, listening quietly.

	A little distance away, TEN MEN sit around a crude table,
	quietly eating.  They talk in low, relaxed voices, and there
	is an occasional laugh.

	ROCCO LAMPONE stands by a window, which has been covered
	with a heavy-mesh wire grating, gazing out.

	A large bowl of pasta is passed, and the MEN eat heartily.

	The sentimental tune is continued over the following:

	INT DAY: BODIES IN CAR (WINTER 1945)

	A MAN and a WOMAN, blood coming out of their noses, lie
	still together in a bullet-riddled automobile.

	INT DAY: BODY IN BARBER SHOP (WINTER 1945)

	A MAN is covered by a sheet on the floor of a barber shop.

	INT DAY: MATTRESS

	Ten mattresses are spread out around the otherwise empty
	living room of an apartment.  THREE or FOUR MEN including
	CLEMENZA, are taking naps.

	An arsenal of hand guns are spread out on a card table.

	The MEN at the table continue their dinner; passing and
	pouring the wine.

	Trash is thrown in 2 or 3 garbage cans kept in the apartment.

	INT DAY: BODY IN OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

	A MAN, his clothes soaked in blood, lies on the floor of an
	office building, dead, under an enormous portrait of Harry S.
	Truman.

	EXT DAY: BODY ON STOOP (WINTER 1945)

	ANOTHER MAN, his trousers soaked in blood, lies spanning
	three steps of a front stoop.

	INT NITE: MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)

	TESSIO, sits in a simple straight-backed chair, doing a
	crossword puzzle.

	A thin, boyish BUTTON MAN, writes a letter.

	Six or seven empty mattresses, with tossed unmade blankets.
	Coffee cans beside them serve as ash trays.

	A MAN by the table pulls the cork on another bottle of
	Ruffino, and wine is poured as the MEN eat.

	EXT DAY: BODY IN ALLEY (WINTER 1945)

	A CORPSE is half out of an overturned garbage can in a quiet
	alley.

	INT DAY: BODY AT TABLE (WINTER 1945)

	A MAN in a formal jacket and tie is slumped over a table, in
	a pool of blood on the tablecloth.

	INT DAY: MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)

	A neatly stacked pile of newspapers in the corner of an
	apartment.  We catch a glimpse of one headline: "Five Family
	War..."

	The table.  The MEN are sitting around cracking nuts.  ONE
	has fallen asleep on his arms at the table.

	SEVERAL MEN are taking naps on the Mattresses.

	The PIANO PLAYER finishes the tune with finesse.  Picks up
	and takes a drag from his cigarette.  The OTHER MAN nods
	appreciatively.

				MAN
		Nice Augie...nice.

	EXT DAY: MANCINI BLDG. (SPRING '46)

	Several cars are parked in front of a pleasant New York
	apartment building.  We recognize a couple of SONNY's
	bodyguards loafing by the cars, pitching playing cards
	against the curb.

	Inside the building, two others wait quietly by the rows of
	brass mailboxes: they have been there quite awhile.

	Up one flight of stairs, a single man sits on the step,
	smoking a cigarette.

	One of the men by the mailboxes checks his pocketwatch,
	which is attached to a key chain.  We HEAR the sound of a
	door opening; they look up.

	The man sitting on the stop stands; and looks.

	SONNY backs out of an apartment, the arms of LUCY MANCINI
	wrapped around him.  She doesn't want to let go of him; she
	draws him back into the apartment for a moment, and then he
	comes out alone, adjusting his clothes.

	He jauntily skips down the steps, trailed by the bodyguard
	on the first floor, and moves outside toward his car.  The
	men quickly take up their positions.  As he gets in his car:

				DRIVER
		Pick up your sister?

				SONNY
		Yeah.

	The car drives off; accompanied and escorted by the
	bodyguards in their cars.

	INT DAY: CONNIE'S HALL (SPRING '46)

	He knocks on the door.  No answer.  Then again.

				CONNIE'S VOICE
		Who is it?

				SONNY
		It's me, Sonny.

	We hear the bolt slide back, and see the door open.  SONNY
	enters, but CONNIE has quickly moved into the hallway, her
	back to him.

				SONNY
			  (tenderly)
		Connie, what is it?

	He turns her around in his arms.

	Her face is swollen and bruised; and we can tell from her
	rough, red eyes that she has been crying for a long time.
	As soon as he realizes what's happened, his face goes red
	with rage.  She sees it coming, and clings to him, preventing
	him from running out of the apartment.

				CONNIE
			  (desperately)
		It was my fault!  I started a fight
		with him and I tried to hit him so
		he hit me.  He didn't even try to
		hit me hard Sonny, I walked into it.

	Sonny listens, and calms himself.  He touches her shoulder,
	the thin silk robe.

				SONNY
		I'm goin' to have the doctor come
		over and take a look at you.

	He starts to leave.

				CONNIE
		Oh Sonny, please don't do anything.
		Please don't.

	He stops, and then laughs good naturedly.

				SONNY
		Hey.  Con.  What'm I goin' to do?
		Make your kid a orphan before he's
		born.

	She laughs with him.  He kisses her reassuringly, and leaves.

	EXT DAY: CONNIE'S STREET

	CARLO settles down on the front steps of the 112th St.
	"Book" with SALLY RAGS and COACH, who have been drinking
	beer out of glasses and a pitcher of beer from around the
	corner.  The ball game is blaring from the radio; and the
	kids on the street are still playing stickball.

	CARLO has barely settled down, when the kids in the street
	suddenly scatter, and a car comes screeching up the block
	and to a halt in front of the candy store.  The tires
	scream, and before it seems as though it has even stopped, a
	MAN comes hurtling out of the driver's seat, moving so fast
	the everyone is paralyzed.  It is a moment before we
	recognize that it is SONNY.

	His face is contorted with anger; in a split second he is on
	the stoop and has CARLO by the throat.

	He pulls CARLO away from the others, trying to get him down
	into the street.  But CARLO reaches out for the iron railing,
	and hangs on, his hand in a lock, cringing away, trying to
	hide his head and face in the hollow of the his shoulders.
	His shirt is ripped away in SONNY's hand.

	SALLY RAGS and COACH, merely sit, watching, stunned.

	SONNY is pounding the cowered CARLO with all his strength,
	in a continuous monologue of indistinguishable cursing.  His
	blows are powerful; and begin to draw blood.

	The kids who have been playing stickball, move up, watching
	in fascination.

	CARLO's hands are clenched tight around the railing.

	SONNY beats him mercilessly.

	Now SONNY's bodyguards' car pulls up, and they too become
	spectators.

	SONNY's tight fists are going down like hammers, into
	CARLO's face and body.

	CARLO's nose is bleeding profusely; but still he does
	nothing, other than hang onto the railing.

	SONNY grabs hold of CARLO's massive body, and tries to drag
	him off of the hold on the railing, his teeth clenched in
	the effort.  Then he tries loosening CARLO's locked hands;
	even biting them.  CARLO screams but he does not let go.

	It's clear that CARLO is much stronger than he is, and will
	not be moved.  SONNY knees him in the mouth, and beats him
	more; but he is exhausted.  Totally out of breath, he
	stammers haltingly to the bleeding CARLO.

				SONNY
		You...bastard...You...hurt my
		sister... again...and I'll
		kill...you.

	He wipes the sweat from his face, and then turns suddenly.
	and hurries back to the car, in a moment his car is gone,
	leaving even his bodyguards in confusion.  We notice ONE MAN
	with a sports jacket in the group of spectators especially
	interested.

	CARLO finally relaxes the clenched, locked hands.  He slumps
	onto the stoop.

	---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

	FADE IN:

	EXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1946)

	HIGH ANGLE on the Corleone Mall.  It is a gray, rainy day.
	Young BUTTON MEN in raincoats stand in quiet groups of
	various points around the main house and compound.  Things
	have changed; one house has been extensively enlarged; a new
	and secure gate house has been built.  Security measures
	that had been make-shift and temporarily have now been made
	a permanent part of the Mall, evolving it into a Medieval
	Fortress.  We notice a huge crater in the courtyard; the
	result of a recent bomb attempt.  The house nearest the
	crater is damaged by fire.

	A taxi arrives; KAY ADAMS steps out, huddled in a bright
	yellow raincoat; she lets the cab go, and hurries to the
	shelter of the gate house.

	They are not expecting her, and ask her to wait while they
	call the main house.

	KAY looks at the imposing, depressing Mall, while rain still
	runs down onto her face.

	She notices the bomb crater, and the fire damage; and the
	sullen faces of the BUTTON MEN.

	TOM HAGEN exits the Main House, and hurries toward her.

				HAGEN
		Kay, we weren't expecting you.  You
		should call...

				KAY
		I've tried calling and writing.  I
		want to reach Michael.

				HAGEN
		Nobody knows where he is.  We know
		he's all right, but that's all.

	KAY looks in the direction of the crater, filling with
	rainwater.

				KAY
		What was that?

				HAGEN
		An accident.  No one was hurt.

				KAY
		Listen Tom, I let my cab go; can I
		come in to call another one?

	TOM is clearly reluctant to involve her any more than he has
	to.

				HAGEN
		Sure...I'm sorry.

	They hurry through the rain and into the Main House.

	INT DAY: DON'S LIVING ROOM (SPRING 1946)

	In the living room, KAY shakes the water from her coat and
	takes her rainhat off.

				KAY
		Will you give this to him.

				HAGEN
		If I accept that letter and you
		told a Court of Law I accepted it,
		they would interpret it as my
		having knowledge of his whereabouts.
		Just wait Kay, he'll contact you.

	We hear footsteps descending the staircase; MAMA CORLEONE
	enters the room; the OLD WOMAN squints at KAY, evaluating her.

				MAMA
		You're Mikey's little girl.

	KAY nods yes; there are still tears in her eyes.

				MAMA
		You eat anything?

	KAY shakes her head.

				MAMA
			  (to HAGEN)
		Disgrazia, you don't even give the
		poor girl a cup of coffee?

	HAGEN shrugs helplessly; on an impulse, KAY quickly moves
	toward MAMA, the letter extended.

				KAY
		Will you give this letter to Michael.

				HAGEN
		Mama, no.

				MAMA
		You tell me what to do?  Even he
		don't tell me what to do.

	She takes the letter from KAY, who is grateful and relieved.

				KAY
		Why did they blame Michael?

				MAMA
		You listen to me, you go home to
		your family, and you find a good
		young man and get married.  Forget
		about Mikey; he's no good for you,
		anymore.

	She looks directly into KAY's eyes; and KAY understands what
	that means.

	EXT DAY: DON'S HOSPITAL (SPRING 1946)

	A hospital in New York City.  POLICE and teams of PRIVATE
	DETECTIVES are stationed guarding the area.  An ambulance
	with a team of DETECTIVES and BUTTON-MEN GUARDS exit the
	hospital with rifles in hand; followed by SEVERAL HOSPITAL
	ASSISTANTS wheeling a hospital stretcher, presumably carrying
	the DON.

	TESSIO and CLEMENZA emerge, with OTHER BUTTON MEN bringing
	up the rear.  HAGEN walks with the stretcher, and for a
	moment they disappear behind the ambulance.  Then suddenly,
	siren blasting, it speeds off, accompanied by dark low-slung
	cars.

	EXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1946)

	The Corleone Mall.

	Equally impressive security stands ready at the Corleone
	Mall.  EXTRA BUTTON MEN, as well as SOME POLICE, and PRIVATE
	DETECTIVES.

	It all seems to be under the supervision of ROCCO LAMPONE.
	All is silent.  The WOMEN and CHILDREN, dressed in Sunday
	clothes, wait.

	EXT DAY: AMBULANCE (SPRING 1946)

	One ambulance, speeding along the Grand Central Parkway,
	preceded and followed by a dark car, each one carrying a
	team of BUTTON MEN.

	Sitting next to the DRIVER of the ambulance is a GUARD with
	a rifle on his lap.

	INT DAY: DON'S HALL (SPRING 1946)

	Inside the Main CORLEONE House:

	Hospital ORDERLIES carry the DON on his stretcher carefully
	under the watchful eyes of CLEMENZA, TESSIO, LAMPONE and
	various GUARDS and BUTTON MEN.

	All the CORLEONE family is here today: MAMA, FREDO, SANDRA,
	THERESA, CONNIE, CARLO; the various CORLEONE CHILDREN.

	INT DAY: DON'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)

	The DON is made comfortable in his room, which has all but
	been converted into a hospital room, with complete and
	extensive equipment.  The various CHILDREN get a turn to
	kiss the OLD MAN, as he is made comfortable... and then
	SONNY indicates that all the CHILDREN, WOMEN, and CARLO
	should leave.

	They do, the door is closed.

	INT DAY: DON'S DINING ROOM (SPRING 1946)

	The mood is quite happy downstairs, as the WOMEN prepare the
	Sunday dinner, and set the table.

	CARLO sits alone among them, a frown on his face.

				CONNIE
		What's the matter, Carlo?

				CARLO
		Shut up.

	INT DAY: DON'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)

	All the MEN of the family stand around the hospital bed with
	grim faces, SONNY and HAGEN closest to the OLD MAN.  The DON
	does not speak, yet he asks questions with his looks and
	glances, as clearly as if they were verbalized.  HAGEN is
	the spokesman for the family.

				HAGEN
		...since McCluskey's killing, the
		police have cracked down on most of
		our operations...on the other
		families too.  There's been a lot
		of bad blood.

	The OLD MAN glances at SONNY.

				SONNY
		Pop, they hit us and we hit them
		back.

				HAGEN
		We put out a lot of material
		through our contacts in the
		Newspapers...about McCluskey's
		being tied up with Sollozzo in the
		Drug Rackets...things are starting
		to loosen up.

	The OLD MAN nods.

				SONNY
		Freddie's gonna go to Las
		Vegas...under the protection of Don
		Francesco of L.A.  I want him to
		rest...

				FREDO
		I'm goin' to learn the casino
		business.

	The DON nods approvingly.  Then he searches around the room
	for a face he does not see.  HAGEN knows who he's looking for.

				HAGEN
		Michael...
			  (he takes a breath)
		It was Michael who killed Sollozzo.

	The DON closes his eyes, and then reopens them in anger and
	rage.

				HAGEN
		He's safe now...we're already
		working on ways to bring him back.

	The DON is very angry, he motions with a weak hand that they
	leave him alone.

	INT. DAY: DON'S STAIRS AND HALL (SPRING 1946)

	HAGEN is very upset as he comes down the Stairs; SONNY is
	expansive and optimistic.

				SONNY
		We'll let the old man take it easy
		for a couple of weeks.  I want to
		get things going good before he
		gets better.  What's the matter
		with you?

				HAGEN
		You start operating, the five
		families will start their raids
		again.  We're at a stalemate Sonny,
		your war is costing us a lot of
		money.

				SONNY
		No more stalemate Tom, we got the
		soldiers, we'll match them gun for
		gun if that's how they want it.
		They know me for what I am, Tom--
		and they're scared of me.

				HAGEN
		Yes.  That's true, you're getting a
		hell of a reputation.

				SONNY
		Well it's war!  We might not be in
		this shape if we had a real war-
		time Consiglere, a Sicilian.  Pop
		had Genco, who do I have?
			  (TOM starts to leave)
		Hey Tom, hey...hey.  It's Sunday,
		we're gonna have dinner.  Don't be
		sore.

	INT DAY: DON'S DINING ROOM (SPRING 1946)

	The FAMILY, WIVES, CHILDREN and all sit around the table
	over Sunday dinner.  SONNY is at the head of the table.

	EXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1946)

	SOME of the CORLEONE GRANDCHILDREN play in the enclosed
	Mall, in the proximity of the BUTTON MEN stationed liberally
	by the gate.

	ONE CHILD misses a ball, it rolls by the gate house.  A
	young BUTTON MAN scoops it up and throws it back, smiling.

	-----------------------------------------FADE OUT-------

	INT DAY: CONNIE'S APT. (SPRING 1946)

	CONNIE and CARLO's apartment.  She's in a slip, on the phone.
	We HEAR the shower going in the bathroom.

				CONNIE
		Who is this?

				GIRL (O.S.)
			  (giggle)
		I'm a friend of Carlo's.  I just
		wanted to tell him I can't see him
		tonight; I have to go out of town.

	CONNIE's face turns red.

				CONNIE
		You lousy tramp bitch.
			  (click)


	She slams the phone down; just as CARLO is coming out of the
	bathroom drying his golden body.

				CARLO
		What was that?

				CONNIE
		Your girl friend.  She says she
		can't make it tonight.  You lousy
		bastard you have the nerve to give
		your whores my telephone number.
		I'll kill you, you bastard!

	She hauls off and punches him knowingly; he laughs, so then
	she flings herself at him, kicking and scratching; her heavy
	belly heaving under the thin slip.

				CARLO
			  (defending himself)
		You're crazy.  She was kidding
		around; I don't know, some nut.

	He pushes her aside, and moves into the bedroom to continue
	dressing.

				CONNIE
		You're staying home.  You're not
		going out.

				CARLO
		OK, OK.  You gonna make me something
		to eat at least?

	That calms her down; she stands there a moment, breathing
	heavily; and then she nods, and goes into the kitchen, and
	starts her wifely duties.

	CARLO is dressed; puts on some cologne; CONNIE appears in
	the doorway.

				CONNIE
		The food is on the table.

				CARLO
		I'm not hungry yet.

				CONNIE
		Eat it, it's on the table.

				CARLO
		Ba Fa Goulle.

				CONNIE
		BA FA GOULE YOU!

	She turns deliberately, goes out into the kitchen.  A moment
	later we begin to hear the sound of dishes breaking.  CARLO
	slowly walks out, where we can see CONNIE systematically
	smashing all the dishes against the sink, sending the greasy
	veal and peppers all over the apartment floor.

				CARLO
		You filthy guinea spoiled brat.
		Clean it up or I'll kick your head
		in.

				CONNIE
		Like hell I will.

	She stands there, solid, ready to punch him again.  Slowly,
	he slides his belt out of his trousers, and doubles it in
	his hand.

				CARLO
		Clean it up!

	He swings the belt against her heavy hips.  She moves back
	into the kitchen, and gets a kitchen knife, and holds it
	ready.

				CARLO
		Even the female Corleones are
		murderers.

	He puts the strap down on a table, and moves after her.  She
	makes a sudden thrust at his groin, which he avoids.  He
	pulls the knife away, cutting his hand in the process.  She
	gets away momentarily, but he pursues her around the table,
	gets her; and starts to slap her in the face.

	She breaks away from him, and rushes into the bedroom.

				CONNIE
		The baby!  The baby!

	INT DAY: CONNIE'S BEDROOM  (SPRING 1946)

	She runs into the bedroom; he follows.  She moves into a
	corner, and then like a desperate animal, tries to hide
	under the bed.

	He reaches under, and pulls her out by the hair.

	He slaps her in the face until she begins to weep; then he
	throws her on the bed, contemptuously.  He grabs part of her
	thigh, pinching it very hard.

				CARLO
		You're fat as a pig.

	Then he pushes her away, and walks out of the room, leaving
	her in tears.  She is crying; she pulls herself to the
	bedroom phone, and in a whisper:

				CONNIE
		Mama...mama, it's Connie.  Mama, I
		can't talk any louder.  No, I don't
		want to talk to Sonny.

	We can tell that the phone has been passed to SONNY.

	INT DAY: DON'S KITCHEN (SPRING 1946)

	In the kitchen at the Mall, MAMA cannot understand the
	whispering and she has given the phone to SONNY.

				SONNY
		Yeah Connie.

				CONNIE (O.S.)
		Sonny, just send a car to bring me
		home.  I'll tell you then, it's
		nothing Sonny, don't you come.
		Send TOM, please Sonny, it's
		nothing; I just want to come home.

	SONNY's face is turning red.

				SONNY
			  (in a controlled voice)
		You wait there.  You just wait there.

	He hangs up the phone; and just stands there for a moment.

				SONNY
			  (quietly)
		That sonofabitch; that sonofabitch...

	HAGEN enters the room; he knows what is happening, knows he
	cannot interfere.

	EXT DAY: MALL

	SONNY leaves the house.  HAGEN moves to the outside mall
	just as SONNY's car is driving off.  He moves to a group of
	BUTTON MEN.

				HAGEN
		Go after him.

	EXT DAY: CAUSEWAY (SPRING 1946)

	SONNY's car on the Jones Beach Causeway, speeds quickly by.
	After a pause, another car, with the CORLEONE BODYGUARDS, is
	trailing.

	SONNY is driving; he is very angry.

	EXT NITE: TOLL BOOTHS (SPRING 1946)

	SONNY in his car; driving back.  Still breathing hard and
	still furious.  Then he thinks it's funny; he enjoyed it.
	He starts laughing, louder and louder, as he pulls up to a
	toll booth, stops, and extends his hand with a coin to the
	COLLECTOR.

	---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

	FADE IN:

	INT NITE: AMERIGO BONASERA'S APARTMENT

	The serious-faced UNDERTAKER is on the telephone.

				HAGEN (O.S.)
		This is Tom Hagen.  I'm calling for
		Don Corleone, at his request.

	BONASERA looks at his WIFE, with deep anxiety in his eyes.
	BONASERA's lips are suddenly dry.

				BONASERA
		Yes, I understand.  I'm listening.

				HAGEN (O.S.)
		You owe the Don a service.  In one
		hour, not before, perhaps later, he
		will be at your funeral parlor to
		ask for your help.  Be there to
		greet him.  If you have any
		objections speak now, and I'll
		inform him.

	Silence.  BONASERA stutters, then speaks in fright.

				BONASERA
		Anything...Anything the Godfather
		wishes.

				HAGEN (O.S.)
		Good.  He never doubted you.

				BONASERA
		The Don himself is coming to me
		tonight?

				HAGEN (O.S.)
		Yes.
			  (click)


	BONASERA is sweating; slowly he lowers the phone; his WIFE
	sees his pale expression, and follows him into the room.

	Silently, he begins the ritual of dressing.  His WIFE knows
	something serious is happening, and never takes her eyes
	from him.  He lights a cigarette.

				BONASERA
		For the last year, they have been
		killing one another.  So now, what?
		Your Godfather comes to me...Why?
			  (whispering, slyly)
		They've killed someone so important
		that they wish to make his body
		disappear.

				MRS. BONASERA
			  (frightened)
		Amerigo!

				BONASERA
		They could make me an accomplice to
		their murder.  They could send me
		to jail!

	He slips into his trousers.  Then he moves to his WIFE to
	tie his tie, as she has done for years.

				BONASERA
		And if the other families find
		out...they will make me their enemy.
		They could come here to our house.
		I curse the day I ever went to the
		Godfather.

	EXT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR (SPRING 1946)

	With his ring of keys, he opens the funeral parlor, enters.

	INT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR (SPRING 1946)

	BONASERA walks through the darkened funeral parlor, without
	turning on the lights; then into the rear, preparation room,
	past the tables, and equipment.  He operates the chain that
	lifts a large overhead garage type door.  And looks out into
	the alley.

	He sits on a bench, and waits.

	EXT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR ALLEY (SPRING 1946)

	The tires of a car roll very quietly along the small alley;
	we notice a dark car approach the rear of BONASERA's funeral
	parlor.

	CLEMENZA gets out, and moves to the open, rear door.
	BONASERA greets him, too petrified to speak.  He notices TWO
	OTHER MEN get out of the car, and carry a stretcher with a
	CORPSE swaddled in a gray blanket, with yellowed feet
	protruding.

	BONASERA closes his eyes in fear, but indicates which way
	the MEN should carry their sinister burden.

	INT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR EMBALMING ROOM (SPRING 1946)

	They carry the CORPSE to one of the tables in the embalming
	room.

	Then BONASERA turns to see ANOTHER MAN step out of the
	darkness somewhat uncertainly.  It is DON CORLEONE.

	He walks up to BONASERA, very close, without speaking.  His
	cold eyes looking directly at the frightened UNDERTAKER.
	Then, after a long gaze:

				DON CORLEONE
		Well my friend, are you ready to do
		me this service?

	BONASERA nods.  The DON moves to the CORPSE on the embalming
	table; he makes a gesture, and the OTHER MEN leave them alone.

				BONASERA
		What do you wish me to do?

				DON CORLEONE
			  (staring at the table)
		I want you to use all your powers,
		all your skill, as you love me.  I
		do not want his mother to see him
		as he is.

	He draws down the gray blanket.

	BONASERA lets out a gasp of horror at what he sees:

	The bullet-smashed face of SONNY CORLEONE.

	EXT NITE: TOLL BOOTHS (SPRING 1946)

	SONNY extends his hand with a coin at the toll booth.

	A car suddenly swerves in front of him, trapping him in the
	booth, and in incredible rally of machine gun fire greets
	him, coming through and smashing the windows of the toll
	booths on both side of him, and from the front window of the
	car blocking him.

	The windows of his car are shot out.

	Bullet holes puncture the doors of his car.

	His hand, with the coin in it, falls inside the car.

	His arms, shoulders are riddled by the fire, and still it
	continues, as though the ASSASSINS cannot take a chance that
	he will survive it.

	Suddenly, he lets out an enormous ROAR, like a bull, and
	actually, opens the door, and steps out of the car, UNDER
	fire.

	His face is hit; and finally he falls to the ground.

	A FULL SHOT...as the ASSASSINS scramble for their cars and
	make off in the distance.

	SONNY's BODYGUARDS stop a safe distance away, realizing they
	are too late.

	INT NITE: DON'S LIVING ROOM (SPRING 1946)

	View on HAGEN's ashen face in the living room.  He is silent
	a moment, and then:

				HAGEN
			  (quietly)
		OK.  Go to Clemenza's house and
		tell him to come here right away.
		He'll tell you what to do.

	The MEN leave him alone.  He is quiet, standing in the
	middle of the living room a moment.  He looks in the
	direction of the kitchen, where he can see fragments of MAMA
	moving around.

	INT NITE: UPSTAIRS (SPRING 1946)

	TOM proceeds up stairs, and quietly in the direction of the
	DON's room.  He opens the DON's door.  Looks in.

	INT NITE: DON'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)

	The DON in his hospital bed.  Asleep under sedation.  HAGEN
	hesitates.  He cannot go in; he cannot tell the OLD MAN.  He
	closes the door.

	INT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (SPRING 1946)

	HAGEN alone in the office.  He is drinking.  He looks up at
	the sound of cars; the CAPOREGIMES are arriving.  Then he
	hears footsteps.

	The door opens; and in a robe, with slippers, DON CORLEONE
	slowly enters the room.  He walks directly to his stuffed
	armchair, sits down.  His face is stern, as he looks into
	HAGEN's eyes.

				DON CORLEONE
		Give me a drop of anisette.

	HAGEN rises, and pours a glass for the OLD MAN.

				DON CORLEONE
		My wife was weeping before she fell
		asleep, outside my window I saw my
		caporegimes to the house, and it is
		midnight.  So, Consigliere of mine,
		I think you should tell your Don
		what everyone knows.

				HAGEN
			  (quietly)
		I didn't tell Mama anything.  I was
		about to come up and wake you and
		tell you.  Just now.

				DON CORLEONE
		But you needed a drink first.

				HAGEN
		Yes.

				DON CORLEONE
		Now you've had your drink.

	Pause.

				HAGEN
		They shot Sonny on the Causeway.
			  (pause)
		He's dead.

	DON CORLEONE blinks.  One feels that just for a second he
	loses all physical strength; he clasps his hands in front of
	him on the top of the desk and looks into HAGEN's eyes.

				DON CORLEONE
		I want no inquiries made.  No acts
		of vengeance.
			  (pause)
		Consigliere, arrange a meeting with
		the heads of the five
		families...this war stops now.

	He rises and unsteadily leaves the room, turns...

				DON CORLEONE
		Call Bonasera...he will do me a
		service.

	And leaves.  HAGEN moves to the phone; dials...

				HAGEN
		This is Tom Hagen; I'm calling for
		Don Corleone, at his request.

				BONASERA (O.S.)
		Yes, I understand I'm listening.

				HAGEN
		You owe the Don a service.  He has
		no doubt that you will repay it.

	EXT DAY: BANK BUILDING (SPRING 1946)

	Day in Manhattan.  An impressive Bank Building in the
	financial center of New York.  Many limousines are parked,
	uniforms and plain-clothed CHAUFFEURS waiting quietly.

	INT DAY: BOARD ROOM (SPRING 1946)

	The Board Room of a bank, daylight shines in the windows.

	CARLO TRAMONTI, an impressive, handsome middle-aged man,
	sits quietly, smoking a Di Napoli cigar, OUR VIEW moves to a
	MAN sitting to his left, and a little to the rear, and
	settles on JOSEPH ZALUCHI, a moon-faced amiable-looking man;
	as the view continues, around the table, we HEAR:

				DON CORLEONE (O.S.)
		I want to thank you all for coming.
		I consider it a service done to me
		personally and I am in the debt of
		each and every one of you.
		Especially those of you who have
		traveled from such distances as
		California, St. Louis, Kansas City;
		and New Orleans...

	The VIEW PASSES to FRANK FALCONE and ANTHONY MOLINARI, both
	younger than any of the others; then on to DOMENICK PANZA,
	short and squat sitting in a wheelchair; then around the
	table to DON VINCENENZO FORLENZA, who is whispering to his
	JEWISH ASSISTANT; the VIEW PASSES on to ANTHONY STRACCI, an
	older man, sipping from a drink and smoking a cigar; OTTILIO
	CUNEO, in his middle sixties with a jolly round face; then
	DON PHILLIP TATTAGLIA, a delicate older man with dyed hair
	and a pencil mustache; and finally, EMILIO BARZINI, in his
	early sixties, a man to 'respect'; whom we had seen at
	CONNIE's Wedding.

				DON CORLEONE
		Ah well, let's get down to business.
		We are all honorable men here, we
		don't have to give assurances as if
		we were lawyers.
			  (he sits, gazes out
			  at them, and sighs)
		How did things ever go so far?
		Well, no matter.  A lot of
		foolishness has come to pass.  It
		was so unfortunate, so unnecessary.

	The VIEW examines the room once again, as the DON speaks.  A
	large, clicking board is changing numbers at various times,
	and two tapes, showing the fluctuations of the Market during
	the day's trading, and projected above.

	DON CORLEONE pauses; and TOM HAGEN hands him a cold drink.

				DON CORLEONE
		Tattaglia has lost a son; I have
		lost a son.  We are quits.  Let
		there be a peace...
			  (he gestures
			  expressively,
			  submissively, with
			  his hands)
		That is all I want...

				BARZINI
		Don Corleone is too modest.  He had
		the judges and politicians in his
		pocket and he refused to share them.
		His refusal is not the act of a
		friend.  He takes the bread out of
		the mouths of our families.  Times
		have changed, it's not like the old
		days where everyone can go his own
		way.  If Don Corleone had all the
		judges and politicians in New York,
		then he must share them or let
		others use them.  Certainly he can
		present a bill for such services,
		we're not Communists, after all.
		But he has to let us draw water
		from the well.  It's that simple.

				DON CORLEONE
		My friends, I didn't refuse out of
		malice.  You all know me.  When
		have I ever refused an accommodation?
		But why, this time?  Because I
		think this drug business will
		destroy us in the years to come.
		It's not like whiskey or gambling
		or even women which most people
		want and is forbidden them by the
		pezzonovante of the Church and the
		Government.  But drugs?  No.  Even
		policemen, who help us in gambling
		and other things would refuse to
		help us in drugs.  But...I am
		willing to do whatever all of you
		think is necessary.

				DON ZALUCHI
		I don't believe in drugs.  For
		years I paid my people extra so
		they wouldn't do that kind of
		business...$200 a week.  But it
		didn't matter.  Somebody comes to
		them and says, "I have powders, if
		you put up three, four thousand
		dollar investment, we can make
		fifty thousand distributing."  Who
		can resist such a profit?
		There's no way to control it, as a
		business...to keep it respectable.
			  (rapping the table)
		I don't want it near schools!  I
		don't want it sold to children.
		That is an infamita.
			  (thinking)
		In my city I would try to keep the
		traffic in the dark people, the
		colored.  They are the best
		customers, the least troublesome,
		and they are animals anyway.  They
		have no respect for their wives or
		their families or themselves.  Let
		them lose their souls with drugs.
		But something has to be done, we
		can't have everybody running around
		doing just what they please, like a
		bunch of anarchists.

				BARZINI
		Then, are we agreed; the traffic in
		drugs will be permitted, but
		controlled; and Don Corleone agrees
		to give it protection in the East.

	DON CORLEONE nods.

				BARZINI
		That's the whole matter then, we
		have the peace, and let me pay my
		respects to Don Corleone, whom we
		have all known over the years as a
		man of his word.
			  (noticing TATTAGLIA
			  is uneasy)
		Don Philip?

				TATTAGLIA
		I agree to everything here, I'm
		willing to forget my own misfortune.
		But I must hear strict assurance
		from Corleone.  When time goes by
		and his position becomes stronger,
		will he attempt any individual
		vengeance?

	They all look at the DON; especially HAGEN, who feels that
	DON CORLEONE has given a great deal, and must have something
	else in mind.  Slowly the DON rises.

				DON CORLEONE
		I forego my vengeance for my dead
		son, for the common good.  But I
		have selfish reasons.  My youngest
		son had to flee, accused of
		Sollozzo's murder, and I must now
		make arrangements so that he can
		come home with safety, cleared of
		all those false charges.  That is
		my affair, and I will make those
		arrangements.
			  (with strength)
		But I am a superstitious man...and
		so if some unlucky accident should
		befall my youngest son, if some
		police officer should accidentally
		shoot him, or if he should hang
		himself in his cell, or if my son
		is struck by a bolt of lightning,
		then I will blame some of the
		people here.  That, I could never
		forgive, but...aside from that, let
		me swear by the souls of my
		Grandchildren that I will never be
		the one to break the peace we have
		made.

	EXT NITE: DON'S LIMO (SPRING 1946)

	The DON's black limousine.  He sits quietly in the padded
	rear seat; TOM HAGEN next to him.

	It is night.  Lights flash by them every so often.

				HAGEN
		When I meet with Tattaglia's
		people; should I insist that all
		his drug middle-men be clean?

				DON CORLEONE
		Mention it, don't insist.  Barzini
		is a man who will know that without
		being told.

				HAGEN
		You mean Tattaglia.

				DON CORLEONE
			  (shaking his head)
		Barzini.

				HAGEN
			  (a revelation)
		He was the one behind Sollozzo?

				DON CORLEONE
		Tattaglia is a pimp.  He could
		never have outfought Santino.  But
		I wasn't sure until this day.  No,
		it was Barzini all along.

	The black limousine speeds away from us in the night.

	------------------------------------------FADE OUT------

	FADE IN:

	EXT DAY: ESTABLISHING SICILY SHOT

	A CLOSE VIEW OF MICHAEL, moving as he walks, sullen and
	downcast, the left side of his face healed, but left
	grotesque and misshapen.

	GRADUALLY, THE VIEW LOOSENS, he wears a warm navy Pea
	jacket, and walks with his hands in his pockets.

	THE VIEW LOOSENS FURTHER, revealing a Sicilian SHEPHERD on
	either side of him, each carrying a shotgun slung over his
	shoulder, CALO, a squat and husky young man with a simple
	honest quality, and FABRIZZIO, slender and handsome, likable,
	and with a pleasing build.  Each of the SHEPHERDS  carry
	knapsacks.

	The THREE YOUNG MEN continue over the Sicilian landscape,
	overlooking an impressive view of land and sea.

	EXT DAY: SICILY ROAD

	The THREE move through a flock of wind-blown sheep, and make
	their way to a dusty rural road.  We HEAR a rinky horn
	sound, as a pre-war Italian automobile makes its way to them.
	An OLD MAN peeks from the window, waving to MICHAEL.  The
	car pulls in front of them and stops.  MICHAEL nods
	respectfully.

				MICHAEL
		Don Tommassino.

				DON TOMMASSINO
		Michael, why must you do this.  We
		have been lucky so far, all these
		months you've been here we've kept
		your name a secret.  It is from
		love for your father that I've
		asked you never to more than an
		hour from the Villa.

				MICHAEL
		Calo and Fabrizzio are with me;
		nothing will happen.

				DON TOMMASSINO
		You must understand that your
		Father's enemies have friends in
		Palermo.

				MICHAEL
		I know.

				DON TOMMASSINO
		Where are you going?

				MICHAEL
		Corleone.

				DON TOMMASSINO
		There is nothing there.  Not anymore.

				MICHAEL
		I was told that my Grandfather was
		murdered on its main street; and
		his murderers came to kill my
		father there when he was twelve
		years old.

				DON TOMMASSINO
		Long ago.  Now there is nothing:
		the men killed each other in family
		vendettas...the others escaped to
		America.

				MICHAEL
		Don Tommassino...I should see this
		place.

	DON TOMMASSINO thinks a moment, then concedes.

				DON TOMMASSINO
		That is your birthright...but
		Michael, use this car.

				MICHAEL
		No...I would like to walk to
		Corleone.

	The OLD MAN sighs, and then returns to his car.

				DON TOMMASSINO
		Be careful Michael, don't let them
		know your name.

	The old car sputters off; MICHAEL watches, and then continues
	on his journey.

	EXT DAY: COUNTRYSIDE

	The THREE pass through abundant areas of flowers and fruit
	trees, in bloom and bursting with life.

	EXT DAY: VILLAGE

	They continue in the empty streets of a little town; the
	post-war poverty is evident in the skinny dogs; and the
	empty streets.  Occasionally, a military vehicle, the only
	gasoline-powered vehicles on the road, will pass.  And there
	are many POLICE evident, most of them carrying machine guns.

	The THREE pass under an enormous banner slung over the main
	road "VOTA COMMUNISTA".

	EXT DAY: COUNTRY ROAD

	They continue through dusty country roads, where occasionally
	a donkey pulling a cart, or a lone horseman will pass them.

	EXT DAY: FIELD

	Out in a field, in the distance, they come upon a procession
	of peasants and activists, perhaps two hundred strong,
	marching, and singing, and in the lead, are five or six men
	carrying billowing red banners.

	EXT DAY: GROVE

	They are in an orange grove; on the other side of the trees
	is a deep, tall field of wild flowers.

	The Shepherds unsling their guns and knapsacks, and take out
	loaves of bread, some wine, sausage and cheese.

	MICHAEL rests against a tree, and uses his handkerchief.

				FABRIZZIO
		You tell us about America.

				MICHAEL
		How do you know I come from America?

				FABRIZZIO
		We hear.  We were told you were a
		Pezzonovanta...big shot.

				MICHAEL
		Only the son of a Pezzonovanta.

				FABRIZZIO
		Hey America!  Is she as rich as
		they say?

				MICHAEL
		Yes.

				FABRIZZIO
		Take me to America!  You need a
		good lupara in America?
			  (pats his shotgun)
		You take me, I'll be the best man
		you got.  "Oh say, can you
		seeee...By da star early light..."

	MICHAEL laughs.

	EXT DAY: ANOTHER ROAD

	The TRIO continues down a dirt road, as an American Military
	convoy speeds by; FABRIZZIO waves, and calls out to each of
	the U.S. drivers, as they move by.

				FABRIZZIO
		America.
		Hey America!
		Take me with you!
		Hey, take me to America G.I.!

	EXT DAY: CORLEONE HILL

	They continue their long hike, high on a promentory; until
	they hesitate, and look down.

				CALO
		Corleone.

	They can see a grim Sicilian village, almost devoid of people.

	EXT DAY: CORLEONE STREET

	MICHAEL and his bodyguards move through the empty streets of
	the village.  They walk behind him, and spread to either
	side about fifteen feet away from him.

	They move down ancient steps, past an old stone fountain.
	MICHAEL hesitates, cups his hands and drinks some water.
	They go on.

	They move up a very narrow old street.  MICHAEL looks at the
	doorways that they pass.

	MOVING VIEW: Each door has a plaque, with a ribbon or flower.

	CALO sees MICHAEL looking.

				CALO
		The names of the dead.

	MICHAEL hesitates in the center of the main street.  He looks.

	The street is empty, barren.  Occasionally, an old woman
	will pass.

	MICHAEL turns his head.

	The other side of the street: empty and deathly.

	A HIGH VIEW of MICHAEL standing in the center of the old
	street, the shepherds a respectful distance away.

	-------------------------------------FADE OUT-----------

	EXT DAY: BARONIAL ESTATE

	A green ribboned field of a baronial Estate.  Further ahead
	is a villa so Roman it looks as though it had just been
	discovered in the ruins of Pompeii.  There is a group of
	young village GIRLS accompanied by two stocky MATRONS,
	dressed in black.  They have been gathering the pink sulla,
	purple wisteria, and mixing them with orange and lemon
	blossoms.  They are singing, off in the distance as they work.

	MICHAEL, CALO and FABRIZZIO are silent as they watch this
	Fantasy-like scene.

				FABRIZZIO
			  (calling out to them)
		Hey, beautiful girls!

				MICHAEL
			  (sternly)
		Shhhhh.

	He settles down to watch.

	The GIRLS are dressed in cheap gaily painted frocks that
	cling to their bodies.  They are still in their teens, but
	developed and womanly.

	They are moving along the fields, picking blossoms, not
	aware of the three men watching them from the orange grove.
	Three or four of the girls begin chasing one of them
	playfully, in the direction of the grove.

	The GIRL being chased holds a bunch of purple grapes in her
	left hand and with the right, picks more grapes, and throws
	them back at her pursuers laughing.

	They come closer and closer.  Just short of the grove, she
	poses, startled, her large, oval shaped eyes catching the
	view of the THREE MEN.  She stands there on her toes about
	to run.

	MICHAEL sees her; now face to face.  He looks.

	Her face.  Incredibly beautiful with olive skin, black hair
	and a rich mouth.

				FABRIZZIO
			  (murmuring)
		Jesus Christ, take my soul.  I'm
		dying.

	Quickly, she turns, and runs away.

	MICHAEL stands up never taking his eyes from her.  We hold
	on him for a long while; and eventually hear the SHEPHERDS
	laughing.  Then he turns to them.

				FABRIZZIO
		You got hit by the thunderbolt, eh?

	CALO pats him on the shoulder.

				CALO
		Easy man.

				MICHAEL
		What are you talking about?

				FABRIZZIO
		You can't hide it when you're hit
		by the thunderbolt.

	EXT DAY: BARONIAL VILLAGE

	The little village built attendant to the Baronial Estate,
	is decked with the flowers the girls had been picking.

	MICHAEL, followed by the bodyguards, moves into the central
	square, and onto the balcony of a little cafe.

	The proprietor of the cafe, VITELLI, is a short burly man;
	he greets them cheerfully, and sets a dish of chickpeas at
	their table.

				FABRIZZIO
		You know all the girls in this
		town, eh?  We saw some beauties
		coming down the road.  One in
		particular got our friend hit with
		the Thunderbolt...
			  (he indicates MICHAEL)

	VITELLI gives a big knowing laugh, and looks at MICHAEL with
	new interest.

				VITELLI
		You had better bring a few bottles
		home with you, my friend; you'll
		need help sleeping tonight.
			  (he laughs)

				FABRIZZIO
		This one could seduce the devil.  A
		body! and eyes as big and black as
		olives.

				VITELLI
			  (laughing with
			  them...pouring more wine)
		I know about what you mean!

				FABRIZZIO
		This was a beauty.  Right, Calo?

				VITELLI
			  (laughing)
		Beautiful all over, eh?

				FABRIZZIO
		And hair.  Black and curly, like a
		doll.  And such a mouth.

	VITELLI does not laugh quite so much.

				VITELLI
		Yes, we have beautiful girls here...
		but virtuous.

	VITELLI is no longer drinking with them.

				MICHAEL
		She wore a red dress, and a red
		ribbon in her hair.  She looks more
		Greek than Italian.  Do you know a
		beauty like that?

	As MICHAEL describes her, VITELLI laughed less and less,
	until he wears a scowl.

				VITELLI
		No.

	Then he curtly leaves him, and walks into the back room.

				FABRIZZIO
		God in Heaven, I think I
		understand...

	He goes into the back room after the innkeeper.  Then he
	returns.

				FABRIZZIO
		Let's get out of here; he's boiling
		up his blood to do us mischief.
		It's his daughter.

	They start to leave; but MICHAEL doesn't move.

				CALO
		Come quickly.

				MICHAEL
		Innkeeper.  More wine!

				FABRIZZIO
			  (whispered)
		The old bastard mentioned two sons
		he only has to whistle up.

	MICHAEL turns to FABRIZZIO with his cold authority.

				MICHAEL
		Tell him to come to me.

	The two BODYGUARDS shoulder their luparas, and disappear in
	a moment they return with the red-faced angry VITELLI
	between them.

				MICHAEL
			  (quietly)
		I understand I've offended you by
		talking about your daughter.  I
		offer you my apologies, I'm a
		stranger in this country, I don't
		know the customs very well.  Let me
		say this, I meant no disrespect to
		you or her...

	CALO and FABRIZZIO are impressed.

				VITELLI
			  (shrugs)
		Who are you and what do you want
		from my daughter?

				MICHAEL
		I am an American hiding in Sicily
		from the police of my country.  My
		name is Michael.  You can inform
		the police and make your fortune
		but then your daughter would lose a
		father rather than gain a husband.
		In any case, I want to meet your
		daughter.  With your permission and
		under the supervision of your
		family.  With all decorum.  With
		all respect.  I am an honorable man.

	CALO and FABRIZZIO are stupefied; VITELLI pauses, and then
	asks:

				VITELLI
		Are you a friend of the friends?

				MICHAEL
		When the proper time comes, I'll
		tell you everything that a wife's
		father should know.

				FABRIZZIO
		It's the real Thunderbolt, then.

				VITELLI
			  (formally)
		Come Sunday morning:  My name is
		Vitelli and my house is up there on
		the hill, above the village.

				MICHAEL
		Your daughter's name?

				VITELLI
		Appolonia.

	-------------------------------------FADE OUT-----------

	EXT DAY: TOMMASSINO COURTYARD

	MUSIC comes up; as MICHAEL, dressed in new clothes from
	Palermo, and carrying a stack of wrapped gifts, gets into an
	Alfa Romeo.  CALO and FABRIZZIO each dressed in their Sunday
	best, are in the rear seat, huddled together, with their
	luparas on their shoulders.

	DON TOMMASSINO waves them off, as the little car drives off,
	rocky and bouncing on the dirt road.

	The Sunday churchbells ring.

	--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------

	EXT DAY: VITELLI HOUSE

	MICHAEL is presented to each of the Vitelli relatives, by
	the yard of their little hilltop house; the BROTHERS; the
	MOTHER, who is given a gift; several UNCLES and AUNTS.
	Finally APPOLONIA enters, dressed beautifully in appropriate
	Sunday clothing.  Now he presents the wrapped gift to
	APPOLONIA.  She looks at her MOTHER, who with a nod gives
	her permission to open it.  She unwraps it.  Her eyes light
	at the sight of a heavy gold chain; to be worn as a necklace.

	She looks at him.

				APPOLONIA
		Grazia.

	--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------

	EXT DAY: VITELLI CAFE

	Now the little Alpha drives into the village near VITELLI's
	cafe.

	MICHAEL is, as ever, accompanied with his two BODYGUARDS,
	though they are all dressed differently.

	They go up to the cafe...and sit with VITELLI, who is
	talking and talking.

	MICHAEL looks at APPOLONIA; who sits, respectfully quiet.
	She wears the gold necklace around her neck.

	--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------

	EXT DAY: HILLTOP NEAR VITELLI HOME

	MICHAEL and APPOLONIA are walking through a hilltop path,
	seemingly alone, although a respectful distance apart.

	As the VIEW PANS with them, we notice that her MOTHER and a
	half dozen AUNTS are twenty paces behind them, and ten paces
	further behind are CALO and FABRIZZIO, their luparas on
	their shoulders.

	Further up the hill, APPOLONIA stumbles on a loose stone,
	and falls briefly onto MICHAEL's arm.  She modestly regains
	her balance, and they continue walking.

	Behind them, her MOTHER giggles to herself.

	--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------

	EXT DAY: VITELLI VILLAGE CHURCH

	Church bells in an ancient belfry ring out.  Music, old and
	dissonant, plays.

	There is a bridal procession in the street of the village;
	the same in feeling and texture as it might have been five
	hundred years ago.

	Donkeys and other animals have been decorated with abundant
	flowers; children carrying candles and wearing white
	confirmation gowns walk in the procession, followed by
	countless townspeople, members of the clergy, even the police.

	We present the entire bridal procession and ceremony with
	all the ritual and pageantry, as it has always been, in
	Sicily.

	APPOLONIA is radiant as the Bride; MICHAEL is handsome
	despite the grotesque jaw and occasional white handkerchief.

	--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------

	EXT NITE: VITELLI VILLAGE SQUARE

	CALO and FABRIZZIO dance wildly through the night of the
	great wedding celebration.  It is held in the Village
	Square; under the watchful eyes of SHEPHERDS above on the
	tops of buildings, carrying luparas.

	--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------

	INT NITE: MICHAEL'S ROOM IN VILLA

	MICHAEL opens the shutters in his darkened room; moonlight
	fills the room.

	He turns, and there, in her wedding slip, is APPOLONIA.  A
	little frightened; but lovely.

	He moves to her; and for a moment just stands before her,
	looking at her incredible face; her lovely hair and body.

	Slowly and tenderly he kisses her.  Her tiny hands come up
	to his face; touch his cheek and embrace him.

	She lets her bridal slip fall to the floor.

	--------------------------------------FADE OUT----------

	INT DAY: MICHAEL'S ROOM AT VILLA

	Morning.  MICHAEL sits on the window ledge, gazing into the
	room.

	APPOLONIA is asleep; she is naked, and only partially
	covered by the bedsheets.

	He looks at her for a long time in the early morning light.

	EXT DAY: TOMMASSINO COURTYARD

	HIGH ANGLE ON DON TOMMASSINO'S VILLA

	We HEAR girlish laughter; the little Alpha is driving
	erratically, knocking down an occasional wall, and almost
	hitting th inner court wall.

	APPOLONIA is laughing, driving.  MICHAEL pretends to be
	frightened, as he teaches her to drive.

	Outside the walls, we notice SHEPHERDS with luparas, walking
	guard duty.

	The car stops and a laughing MICHAEL gets out.

				MICHAEL
		It's safer to teach you English.

				APPOLONIA
		Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
		Thursday, Friday...See, I learned
		it.  Now teach me to drive!

	DON TOMMASSINO enters the Courtyard.  He seems tired and
	concerned.

				MICHAEL
		Ciao, Don Tommassino.

	APPOLONIA kisses him.

				MICHAEL
		Things went badly in Palermo?

				DON TOMMASSINO
		The younger men have no respect.
		Things are changing; I don't know
		what will happen.  Michael, because
		of the wedding, people now know
		your name.

				MICHAEL
		Is that why there are more men on
		the walls?

				DON TOMMASSINO
		Even so, I don't think it is safe
		here anymore.  I've made plans to
		move you to a villa near Siracuse.
		You must go right away.

				MICHAEL
		What is it?

				DON TOMMASSINO
		Bad news from America.  Your
		brother, Santino.  He has been
		killed.

	For a moment, the whole world of New York, Sollozzo, the
	Five Family War, all comes back to MICHAEL.

	EXT DAY: VILLA COURTYARD

	Morning.  MICHAEL leans out of the bedroom window.

	Below, FABRIZZIO is sitting in one of the garden chairs,
	combing his thick hair.

	MICHAEL whistles and FABRIZZIO looks up to his window.

				MICHAEL
		Get the car.  I'll be leaving in
		ten minutes.  Where's Calo?

				FABRIZZIO
		Calo is having a cup of coffee in
		the kitchen.  Is your wife coming
		with you?

				MICHAEL
		No, she's going home to her family.
		She'll join me in a few weeks...

	INT DAY: VILLA KITCHEN

	MICHAEL, dressed, crosses from the hallway, and into the
	kitchen.  CALO is just finishing a bite.  He rises when he
	sees MICHAEL.

				CALO
		Should I get your bag?

				MICHAEL
		No, I'll get it.  Where's Appolonia?

				CALO
			  (smiling)
		She is sitting in the driver's seat
		of the car, dying to step on the
		gas.  She'll be a real American
		woman before she gets to America.

	MICHAEL smiles.

				MICHAEL
		Tell Fabrizzio and wait for me in
		the car.

	He leaves the kitchen, after a quick sip of coffee.

	He looks out from the opening in the doorway.

	EXT DAY: VILLA COURTYARD

	There is the car, with APPOLONIA sitting in the driver's
	seat, playing with the wheel like a child.

	CALO moves to the car, and puts a lunch basket in the rear
	seat.

	Then MICHAEL seems disturbed.

	Over, on the other side of the courtyard, he sees FABRIZZIO
	disappear through the gate.

				MICHAEL
			  (muttering to himself)
		Where the hell is he going?

	MICHAEL goes down the hallway, and outside.

	MICHAEL steps out into the bright sunlight of the outer
	courtyard, causing him to shade his eyes.

	APPOLONIA sees him, and waves, motioning that he should stay
	where he is.

				APPOLONIA
			  (calling out)
		I'll drive to you.

	He smiles affectionately.

	CALO stands beside the car, smiling, with his lupara dangling
	by his side.  There is no sight of FABRIZZIO.  Suddenly the
	smile fades from MICHAEL's face.  He steps forward and holds
	out his hand.

				MICHAEL
		No.  No!

	His shout is drowned in the roar of a tremendous EXPLOSION,
	as she switched on the ignition.

	Part of the wall is caved in, the kitchen door is blown off;
	and there is nothing left of the Alpha, or of Appolonia.

	MICHAEL is thrown against the wall, and knocked unconscious.

	INT DAY: VILLA BEDROOM

	MICHAEL is unconscious in a darkened room.  We hear
	whispering around him, but can't make any of it out.  A soft
	cloth is applied to his face; gradually his eyes open.  DON
	TOMMASSINO is there, close to him.  He looks at them and
	from their grave expressions, he knows his wife is dead.

				MICHAEL
		Fabrizzio.  Let your shepherds know
		that the one who gives me Fabrizzio
		will own the finest pastures in
		Sicily.

	--------------------------------------FADE OUT----------

	FADE IN:

	EXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1951)

	Easter.

	A HIGH VIEW ON THE CORLEONE MALL in the springtime.  Hordes
	of little CHILDREN including many of the Corleone Children
	and Grandchilren, rush about carrying little Easter baskets,
	searching here and there for candy treasures and hidden
	Easter eggs.

	The DON himself, much older, much smaller in size, wearing
	baggy pants and a plaid shirt and an old hat, moves around
	his garden, tending rows and rows of rich tomato plants.

	Suddenly, he stops and looks.

	MICHAEL stands there, still holding his suitcase.

	Great emotion comes over the DON, who takes a few steps in
	MICHAEL's direction.

	MICHAEL leaves his suitcase and walks to his favorite son
	and embraces him.

				DON CORLEONE
		Be my son...

	INT DAY: THE OLIVE OIL FACTORY

	DON CORLEONE leads MICHAEL through the corridors of the
	building.

				DON CORLEONE
		This old building has seen its day.
		No way to do business...too small,
		too old.

	They enter the DON's glass-panelled office.

				DON CORLEONE
		Have you thought about a wife?  A
		family?

				MICHAEL
			  (pained)
		No.

				DON CORLEONE
		I understand, Michael.  But you
		must make a family, you know.

				MICHAEL
		I want children, I want a family.
		But I don't know when.

				DON CORLEONE
		Accept what's happened, Michael.

				MICHAEL
		I could accept everything that's
		happened; I could accept it, but
		that I never had a choice.  From
		the time I was born, you had laid
		this all out for me.

				DON CORLEONE
		No, I wanted other things for you.

				MICHAEL
		You wanted me to be your son.

				DON CORLEONE
		Yes, but sons who would be
		professors, scientists,
		musicians...and grandchildren who
		could be, who knows, a Governor, a
		President even, nothing's impossible
		here in America.

				MICHAEL
		Then why have I become a man like
		you?

				DON CORLEONE
		You are like me, we refuse to be
		fools, to be puppets dancing on a
		string pulled by other men.  I
		hoped the time for guns and killing
		and massacres was over.  That was
		my misfortune.  That was your
		misfortune.  I was hunted on the
		streets of Corleone when I was
		twelve years old because of who my
		father was.  I had no choice.

				MICHAEL
		A man has to choose what he will be.
		I believe that.

				DON CORLEONE
		What else do you believe in?

	MICHAEL doesn't answer.

				DON CORLEONE
		Believe in a family.  Can you
		believe in your country?  Those
		Pezzonovante of the State who
		decide what we shall do with our
		lives?  Who declare wars they wish
		us to fight in to protect what they
		own.  Do you put your fate in the
		hands of men whose only talent is
		that they tricked a bloc of people
		to vote for them?  Michael, in five
		years the Corleone family can be
		completely legitimate.  Very
		difficult things have to happen to
		make that possible.  I can't do
		them anymore, but you can, if you
		choose to.

	MICHAEL listens.

				DON CORLEONE
		Believe in a family; believe in a
		Code of Honor, older and higher,
		believe in Roots that go back
		thousands of years into your Race.
		Make a family, Michael, and protect
		it.  These are our affairs, sono cosa
		nostra, Governments only protect
		men who have their own individual
		power.  Be one of those men...you
		have the choice.

	--------------------------------------FADE OUT----------

	EXT DAY: STOCK FOOTAGE LAS VEGAS (1955)

	A MOVING VIEW, driving up the Las Vegas Strip of 1955.

				FREDO (O.S.)
		There's a new one.  Construction
		going on everywhere.

	MORE VIEWS, showing new hotels and casinos being built; the
	bill marquees read: "MARTIN AND LEWIS", "PATTI PAGE", etc.

				FREDO (O.S.)
		That's one of the family's new ones.
		Not bad, eh?

	EXT DAY: FLAMINGO (1955)

	The car pulls up at the Flamingo Hotel.

	Inside the car: MICHAEL, FREDO, TOM HAGEN and a new man,
	NERI, quiet and sinister.

				MICHAEL
		Why didn't Moe Green meet us at the
		airport?

				FREDO
		He had business at the hotel, but
		he'll drop in for dinner.

	From the expression on MICHAEL's face we know this is a
	discourtesy.

	INT DAY: FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE (1955)

	A whole entourage precedes FREDO and his V.I.P. party of
	MICHAEL, HAGEN and NERI.  Great fuss is made.  They are
	being shown into the hotel's 'special' suite.

				FREDO
		You look wonderful, kid; really
		wonderful.  That doctor did some
		job on your face.

				MICHAEL
		You look good, too.

	They enter the suite.

				FREDO
		Nice, eh?

	FREDO is as excited as a kid, snapping orders at the
	bellboys, waiters and maids.

				FREDO
			  (hurrying into the bedroom)
		Kid, take a look-see.

	MICHAEL gives a look to HAGEN, and continues into the bedroom.

	There is an enormous circular bed on a huge platform,
	mirrors to each side.  FREDO points upward.

	A VIEW into a large CEILING mirror.

				FREDO
		Ever seen anything like that before?

				MICHAEL
			  (dryly)
		No.

	INT NITE: FLAMINGO SUITE BEDROOM (1955)

	MICHAEL is alone in the bedroom.  He is just finishing
	dressing; he puts on his jacket.  From the window, with the
	lights blinking, we can tell it's late at night.  MICHAEL
	passes into the other room.

	He stops, looks.  He is disturbed.

	INT NITE: FLAMINGO SUITE (1955)

	A magnificent, circular table has been set up in his suite;
	a lavish table setting for eight.  Standing by the table are
	HAGEN, JOHNNY FONTANE, looking wonderful, a little heavier,
	beautifully dressed; FREDO, a dandy, and TWO LAS VEGAS GIRLS.
	NERI stands quietly by the door.

				FREDO
		Mike!  The party starting!

				MICHAEL
		Come here a minute, Fredo.

	FREDO goes to him, a big smile all over his face.

				MICHAEL
		Who are those girls?

				FREDO
			  (jokingly)
		That's for you to find out.

				MICHAEL
		Give them some money and send them
		home.

				FREDO
		Mike!

				MICHAEL
		Get rid of them...

	INT NITE: FLAMINGO SUITE (1955)

	They are seated around the lavish table in Michael's suite.
	MICHAEL is speaking to JOHNNY.

				MICHAEL
		Johnny, the Corleone family is
		thinking of selling out all our
		interests in the Olive Oil business
		and settling here.  Moe Greene will
		sell us his interest so it can be
		wholly owned by friends of the
		family.

	FREDDIE seems anxious.

				FREDO
		Mike, you sure about Moe selling.
		He never mentioned it to me and he
		loves the business.

				MICHAEL
		I'll make him an offer he can't
		refuse.

	MICHAEL turns to JOHNNY.

				MICHAEL
		Johnny, the Don wants you to help
		us get started.  We figure
		entertainment will be the big
		factor in drawing gamblers.  We
		hope you'll sign a contract to
		appear five times a year for maybe
		a week long engagement.
		We hope your friends in the movies
		will do the same.  We count on you
		to convince them.

				JOHNNY
		Sure, I'll do anything for my
		Godfather.  You know that, Mike.

	There is knock on the door.  NERI rises, looks at MICHAEL,
	who nods.  NERI opens the door, and MOE GREENE enters,
	followed by TWO BODYGUARDS.  He is a handsome hood, dressed
	in the Hollywood style.  His BODYGUARDS are more West Coast
	style.

				MOE
		Mike, good to see you.  Got
		everything you want?

				MICHAEL
		Thanks.

				MOE
		The chef cooked for you special;
		the dancers will kick your tongue
		out and you credit is good!
			  (to his BODYGUARDS)
		Draw chips for all these people so
		they can play on the house.

				MICHAEL
		Is my credit good enough to buy you
		out?

	MOE laughs.

				MOE
		Buy me out?...

				MICHAEL
		The hotel, the casino.  The Corleone
		family wants to buy you out.

	GREENE stops laughing; the room becomes tense.  NERI eyes
	the BODYGUARDS.

				MOE
			  (furious)
		The Corleone family wants to buy me
		out.  I buy you out.  You don't buy
		me out.

				MICHAEL
		Your casino loses money.  Maybe we
		can do better.

				MOE
		You think I scam?

				MICHAEL
			  (the worst insult)
		You're unlucky.

				MOE
		You goddamn dagos.  I do you a
		favor and take Freddie in when
		you're having a bad time, and then
		you try to push me out.

				MICHAEL
		You took Freddie in because the
		Corleone family bankrolled your
		casino.  You and the Corleone
		family are evened out.  This is for
		business; name your price.

				MOE
		The Corleone family don't have that
		kind of muscle anymore.  The
		Godfather is sick.  You're getting
		chased out of New York by Barzini
		and the other families, and you
		think you can find easier pickings
		here.  I've talked to Barzini; I
		can make a deal with him and keep
		my hotel!

				MICHAEL
			  (quietly, deadly)
		Is that why you thought you could
		slap Freddie around in public?

				FREDO
			  (his face turns red)
		Ah Mike, that was nothing.  Moe
		didn't mean anything.  He flies off
		the handle sometimes; but me and
		him are good friends.  Right, Moe?

				MOE
		Yeah sure.  Sometimes I gotta kick
		asses to make this place run right.
		Freddie and I had a little argument
		and I had to straighten him out.

				MICHAEL
		You straightened my brother out?

				MOE
		Hell, he was banging cocktail
		waitresses two at a time.  Players
		couldn't get a drink.

	MICHAEL rises from his chair, and says in a tone of dismissal:

				MICHAEL
		I have to go back to New York
		tomorrow.  Think of your price.

				MOE
		You son of a bitch, you think you
		can brush me off like that?  I made
		my bones when you were going out
		with cheerleaders.

				FREDO
			  (frightened)
		Tom, you're the Consigliere; you
		can talk to the Don and advise him.

				MICHAEL
		The Don has semi-retired.  I'm
		running the Family business now.
		So anything you have to say, say it
		to me.

	Nobody answers.  MICHAEL nods to NERI, who opens the door.
	MOE exits angrily.

				MICHAEL
		Freddie, you're my older brother.
		I love you.  But don't ever take
		sides with anybody against the
		Family again.

	EXT DAY: N.Y. AIRPORT (1955)

	KAY sits in the back of a limousine parked by the Newark
	AIRPORT.  ROCCO LAMPONE is leaning against it.

	She has a little three year old boy; MICHAEL's son, who
	plays with a cardboard bird on a string.

	Two other cars are stationed discreetly, with men we have
	learned to tell are bodyguards.

	MICHAEL, HAGEN and NERI exit the airport with TWO NEGRO
	PORTERS carrying luggage.

	NERI sees something, and taps MICHAEL on the shoulder.

	MICHAEL turns, and sees KAY.

	LAMPONE opens the car door; KAY steps out with the BOY, and
	MICHAEL embraces her, and kisses his son.  Automatically,
	the luggage is put in.  NERI replaces LAMPONE as the driver;
	and LAMPONE joins the other men.  HAGEN gets into one of the
	other cars.

	And the limo drives off, preceded and followed by the other
	sedans.

	INT DAY: LIMO (1955)

	The little BOY looks out the window as they drive.

				MICHAEL
		I have to see my father and his
		people when we get back to the Mall.

				KAY
		Oh Michael.

				MICHAEL
		We'll go to the show tomorrow
		night--we can change the tickets.

				KAY
		Don't you want dinner first?

				MICHAEL
		No, you eat...don't wait up for me.

				KAY
		Wake me up when you come to bed?

	The little BOY flies his cardboard bird out of the speeding
	limousine window.

	EXT DAY: MALL (1955)

	The limousine arrives at the Mall.  We are inside.

				KAY
		Your sister wants to ask you
		something.

				MICHAEL
		Let HER ask.

	NERI opens the door.  KAY wants to talk just a little more.

				KAY
		She's afraid to.  Michael...

	MICHAEL nods to NERI; who gives them their privacy a moment
	longer.

				KAY
		Why are you so cold to her and
		Carlo?  They live with us on the
		Mall now, but you never get close
		to them.

				MICHAEL
		I'm busy.

				KAY
		Connie and Carlo want you to be
		godfather to their little boy.

	NERI opens the door; MICHAEL starts to get out; KAY too.

	He smiles at her, tired, and a little sad.

				KAY
		Will you?

				MICHAEL
		Let me think about it, O.K.?

	She smiles; MICHAEL goes with NERI to the Main House; KAY
	and the little BOY move to the house that was Sonny's.

	INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (1955)

	VIEW ON DON CORLEONE, much older, much smaller in size.  He
	wears baggy pants, and a warm plaid shirt.  He sits in a
	chair, gazing out through the window, into the garden.

				TESSIO (O.S.)
		Barzini's people chisel my territory
		and we do nothing about it.  Pretty
		soon there won't be one place in
		Brooklyn I can hang my hat.

				MICHAEL (O.S.)
		Just be patient.

				TESSIO
		I'm not asking you for help, Mike.
		Just take off the handcuffs.

				MICHAEL (O.S.)
		Be patient.

				CLEMENZA (O.S.)
		We gotta fight sometime.  Let us at
		least recruit our regimes to full
		strength.

				MICHAEL (O.S.)
		No, I don't want to give Barzini an
		excuse to start fighting.

				TESSIO (O.S.)
		Mike, you're wrong.

				CLEMENZA (O.S.)
		Don Corleone...Don Corleone.

	The OLD MAN looks up.  CLEMENZA stand before him in the Den.
	Beside him is an anxious TESSIO.  NERI stands by the door;
	HAGEN is seated; MICHAEL sits behind the big desk.

				CLEMENZA
		You said there would come a day
		when Tessio and me could form our
		own Families.  Only with your
		benediction, of course.  I ask
		permission...

				DON CORLEONE
		My son is head of the Family now.
		If you have his permission, you
		have my good will.

				MICHAEL
		In six months you can break off
		from the Corleone Family and go on
		your own.  Carlo, I'm counting on
		you to make the move to Nevada;
		you'll be my right-hand man out
		there.  Tom Hagen is no longer the
		Consigliere.

	Everyone is a bit surprised; look to see HAGEN's reaction.
	He remains inexpressive.

				MICHAEL
		He's going to be our lawyer in
		Vegas.  Nobody goes to him with any
		other business as of now, this
		minute.  No reflection on Tom;
		that's the way I want it.  Besides,
		if I ever need any advice, who's a
		better Consigliere than my father.

				CLEMENZA
		Then in a six month time we're on
		our own; is that it?

				MICHAEL
		Maybe less...

				TESSIO
		Let us fill up our Regimes.

				MICHAEL
		No.  I want things very calm for
		another six months.

				TESSIO
		Forgive me, Godfather, let our
		years of friendship be my excuse.
		How can you hope for success there
		without your strength here to back
		you up?  The two  go hand in hand.
		And with you gone from here the
		Barzini and the Tattaglias will be
		too strong for us.

				CLEMENZA
		And I don't like Barzini.  I say
		the Corleone Family has to move
		from strength, not weakness.  We
		should build our Regimes and take
		back our lost territories in Staten
		Island, at least.

				DON CORLEONE
		Do you have faith in my judgement?

				CLEMENZA
		Yes, Godfather...

				DON CORLEONE
		Then do what Michael says...

				MICHAEL
		All I can say is that things are
		being resolved that are more
		effective than a thousand buttonmen
		on the streets.  Understood?

	There are uneasy looks all around.

				CARLO
		Understood.  I just wish I was
		doing more to help out.

				MICHAEL
		I'll come to you when I need you.

	He looks at CLEMENZA, TESSIO and HAGEN.  They all nod,
	reluctantly.

				MICHAEL
		All right, then it's resolved.

	NERI knows the meeting is over, he opens the Den's door.

	CLEMENZA and TESSIO pay their respects to the DON and leave,
	then CARLO.  NERI watches CARLO as he walks down the
	corridor, casting a nervous look back at the sinister man.

	Then NERI closes the door.

	MICHAEL relaxes.

				HAGEN
		Mike, why are you cutting me out of
		the action?

				MICHAEL
		Tom, we're going to be legitimate
		all the way, and you're the legal
		man.  What could be more important
		than that.

				HAGEN
		I'm not talking about that.  I'm
		talking about Rocco Lampone building
		a secret regime.  Why does Neri
		report directly to you, rather than
		through me or a caporegime?

				DON CORLEONE
		I told you that it wouldn't escape
		his eye.

				MICHAEL
		How did you find out?

				HAGEN
		Bookkeepers know everything.
		Rocco's men are all a little too
		good for the jobs they're supposed
		to be doing.  They get a little
		more money than the job's worth.
			  (pause)
		Lampone's a good man; he's operating
		perfectly.

				MICHAEL
		Not so perfectly if you noticed.

				HAGEN
		Mike, why am I out?

				MICHAEL
		You're not a wartime Consigliere.
		Things may get tough with the move
		we're trying.

				HAGEN
		OK, but then I agree with Tessio.
		You're going about it all wrong;
		you're making the move out of
		weakness... Barzini's a wolf, and
		if he tears you apart, the other
		families won't come running to help
		the Corleones...

				DON CORLEONE
		Tom, I never thought you were a bad
		Consigliere, I thought Santino a
		bad Don, rest in peace.  He had a
		good heart but he wasn't the right
		man to head the family when I had
		my misfortune.  Michael has all my
		confidence, as you do.  For reasons
		which you can't know, you must have
		no part in what will happen.

				HAGEN
		Maybe I can help.

				MICHAEL
			  (coldly)
		You're out, Tom.

	TOM pauses, thinks...and then he nods in acquiescence.  TOM
	leaves.

	MICHAEL looks at NERI.

				MICHAEL
		I'm going to talk to my father.

	NERI nods, and then leaves.  The DON opens the doors,
	breathes in the air, and steps outside.

	EXT DAY: THE GARDEN (1955)

				DON CORLEONE
		I see you have your Luca Brasi.

				MICHAEL
		I'll need him.

				DON CORLEONE
		There are men in this world who
		demand to be killed.  They argue in
		gambling games; they jump out of
		their cars in a rage if someone so
		much as scratches their fender.
		These people wander through the
		streets calling out "Kill me, kill
		me."  Luca Brasi was like that.
		And since he wasn't scared of
		death, and in fact, looked for
		it...I made him my weapon.  Because
		I was the only person in the world
		that he truly hoped would not kill
		him.  I think you have done the
		same with this man.

	They walk through the DON's vegetable garden.  Tomatoes,
	peppers, carefully tended, and covered with a silky netting.
	MICHAEL follows; the DON turns and looks at him.  Then
	stoops over to right a tomato plant that had been pushed over.

				DON CORLEONE
		Barzini will move against you first.

				MICHAEL
		How?

				DON CORLEONE
		He will get in touch with you
		through someone you absolutely
		trust.  That person will arrange a
		meeting, guarantee your safety...

	He rises, and looks at Michael...

				DON CORLEONE
		...and at that meeting you will be
		assassinated.

	The DON walks on further.

				DON CORLEONE
		Your wife and children...you're
		happy with them?

				MICHAEL
		Yes.

				DON CORLEONE
		Good.

	MICHAEL wants to express something...hesitates, then:

				MICHAEL
		I've always respected you...

	A long silence.  The DON smiles at MICHAEL.

				DON CORLEONE
		And I...you.

	EXT DAY: CHURCH (1955)

	KAY and MAMA walking from the black car that has just left
	them off.

				KAY
		How is your husband feeling?

				MAMA
		He's not the same since they shot
		him.  He lets Michael do all the
		work.  He just plays the fool with
		his garden, his peppers, his
		tomatoes, as if he was some peasant
		still.  But men are like that...

	She stops toward the Church.

				MAMA
		You come in, too.

	KAY shakes her head.

				MAMA
		The Priest ain't gonna bite you
		cause you're not Catholic.
			  (whispered)
		He's in the back drinkin' his wine.

	KAY laughs and follows MAMA up the steps of the Church.
	They enter.

	INT DAY: CHURCH (1955)

	Inside the Church, KAY watches as MAMA blesses herself from
	the holy water.

				MAMA
		You can.

	Tentatively, KAY dips her fingers into the water, and
	blesses herself.  Then SHE follows MAMA down the aisle, in
	awe at the high ceiling, the art, the windows, and finally
	the Altar.

	MAMA stops by the impressive tiers of candles.  There is a
	large coin box for those who wish to pay for lighting
	candles.  MAMA fumbles in her purse for change; KAY gives
	her some.

	MAMA drops the coins in the box, one by one; then takes the
	taper, and in a pattern known only to her, and with great
	dignity, she closes her eyes, says a prayer, and then lights
	twenty candles.

	She finishes, and bows her head.

	EXT DAY: BONASERA'S FUNERAL HOME

	Very few people in the streets.  TOTAL SILENCE.  But black
	flower cars as far as the eye can see, for blocks and blocks.
	An expression of respect, of honor and fear that is enormous.
	Certainly no more could be done for a President or a King.

	Each car carries an elaborate floral decoration.  We show
	these in detail; and the flowered messages: "A Benefactor to
	Mankind", "He Knew and Pitied"..."Our Don Our Leader"..."The
	Sacred Heart"...

	EXT DAY: MALL (1955)

	HIGH ANGLE ON THE CORLEONE MALL

	Silence.

	The flower cars, funeral limousines, and private cars fill
	all the areas attendant to the Corleone residence.

	Hundreds of people fill the Mall, reminiscent in size of the
	wedding of Connie and Carlo; of course, now the mood is
	somber and respectful.

	MICHAEL, MAMA, FREDO and HAGEN stand by the flowered platform
	which holds the ornate coffin.  We cannot see the remains of
	Don Corleone.

	BONASERA is nearby, ready to do service to the bereaved
	family.  One by one the mourners come by, weeping, or merely
	with grave expressions; pay their respects and continue on.

	The VIEW ALTERS,

	and we see that the line is endless.  JOHNNY FONTANE, tears
	openly falling, takes his turn.

	Children are taken by the hand, and lifted for their last
	look at the great man.

	CLEMENZA whispers into the ear of LAMPONE.  LAMPONE
	immediately arranges for the members of the Five New York
	Families to pay their respects.

	First CUNEO, then STRACHI and then ZALUCHI.  Then PHILIP
	TATTAGLIA, who merely passes by the Coffin.

	Then BARZINI in a black homburg, standing a long time.

	MICHAEL watches the scene.

	BARZINI crosses himself and passes on, immediately rejoined
	by his men.

	As BARZINI leaves, it seems as though everyone is fawning on
	him; perhaps asking for favors: But at any rate, it is clear
	from the doors opened for him, the cigars lit for him, that
	he is the new Capo di Capi--the place formerly held by Don
	Corleone.

	MICHAEL watches silently.

	BARZINI is searching for somebody with his eyes.  First
	CLEMENZA.  Then TESSIO.

	CONNIE rushes into MICHAEL's arms, tears in her eyes.  He
	embraces and comforts her.

	Everywhere MICHAEL goes, NERI is a few feet away--watching
	all who come close to him.

	EXT DAY: MALL (LATER)

	Later on the Mall; some people have left, although there are
	still hundreds of mourners.

	A young GIRL approaches TESSIO.  She's about 18.

				GIRL
		Do you remember me?

				TESSIO
		No...

				GIRL
		We danced together at Connie's
		wedding.

	TESSIO makes a gesture, which is to say 'How you've grown',
	and they move though the crowd, looking for Michael.  He
	finds him.

				TESSIO
		Mike, could I have a minute?

	MIKE; nods; and they move to a private place.  NERI is close
	by.

				TESSIO
		Barzini wants to arrange a meeting.
		Says we can straighten any of our
		problems out.

				MICHAEL
		He talked to you?

				TESSIO
			  (nods)
		I can arrange security.

	MICHAEL looks at him.

	EXT DAY: CEMETERY (1955)

	The Cemetery.  Late day.

	The hundreds of cars, limousines and flower cars line the
	stone wall that surrounds this Italian-Catholic cemetary in
	Queens Village.

	Hundreds of people stand in a cluster; others watch; take
	pictures, etc.

	MICHAEL stands with his family, his MOTHER...and TOM HAGEN.

				MICHAEL
			  (softly)
		Christ, Tom; I needed more time
		with him.  I really needed him.

				HAGEN
		Did he give you his politicians?

				MICHAEL
		Not all...I needed another four
		months and I would have had them
		all.
			  (he looks at TOM)
		I guess you've figured it all out?

				HAGEN
		How will they come at you?

				MICHAEL
		I know now.
			  (a passion wells up
			  inside of MICHAEL)
		I'll make them call me Don.

				HAGEN
		Have you agreed on a meeting?

				MICHAEL
			  (nods)
		A week from tonight.  In Brooklyn
		on Tessio's ground, where I'll be
		safe.

	HAGEN looks at him; understands.

				MICHAEL
		But after the Baptism.  I've
		decided to stand as godfather to
		Connie's baby.

	They look up.

	The coffin is lowered into an excavation, behind which
	stands an enormous stone monument; it is of a weeping angel,
	with the bold inscription: CORLEONE.

	---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

	FADE IN:

	INT DAY: NERI'S APT. (1955)

	ALBERT NERI moves around in his small Corona Apartment; he
	pulls a small trunk from under his bed.  He opens it, and we
	see in it, nearly folded, a New York City Policeman's
	uniform.  He takes it out piece by piece, almost reverently.
	Then the badge, and the identification card; with his
	picture on it.  Slowly, in the solitude of his room, he
	begins to dress.

	INT DAY: MICHAEL'S BEDROOM (1955)

	MICHAEL and KAY are getting dressed for the christening in
	their room.  MICHAEL looks very well; very calm; KAY is
	beginning to take on a matronly look.

	INT DAY: MOTEL ROOM (1955)

	In a Long Island motel.

	ROCCO LAMPONE carefully disassembles a revolver; oils it,
	checks it, and puts it back together.

	EXT DAY: CLEMENZA'S HOUSE (1955)

	PETER CLEMENZA about to get in his Lincoln.  He hesitates,
	takes a rag and cleans some dirt off of the fender, and then
	gets in, drives off.

	EXT DAY: CHURCH (1955)

	The Church.

	Various relatives and friends are beginning to gather at the
	Church.  They laugh and talk.  A MONSIGNOR is officiating.
	Not all of the participants have arrived yet.

	CONNIE is there, with a beaming CARLO.  She holds the
	infant; showing him off to interested people.

	EXT DAY: U.N. PLAZA (1955)

	NERI walks down the sidewalk in the neighborhood of the UN
	Building.  He is dressed as, and has the bearing of, a
	policeman.  He carries a huge flashlight.

	EXT DAY: MOTEL BALCONY (1955)

	LAMPONE steps out onto the little balcony of a Sea-Resort
	Motel; We can see the bright, neon lit sign advertising
	"ROOMS FACING THE SEA--VACANY".

	INT DAY: CHURCH

	The Church.

	CONNIE holds the baby; the MONSIGNOR is speaking; KAY and
	MICHAEL stand side by side around the urn.

				PRIEST
			  (to MICHAEL)
		Do you pledge to guide and protect
		this child if he is left fatherless?
		Do you promise to shield him
		against the wickedness of the world?

				MICHAEL
		Yes, I promise.

	EXT DAY: FIFTH AVE.

	NERI continues up the 55th St. and Fifth Avenue area.  He
	continues until he is in front of Rockefeller Center.  On
	his side of the street, he spots a limousine waiting directly
	across from the main entrance of the building.  Slowly he
	approaches the limo, and taps on its fender with his
	nightstick.

	The DRIVER looks up in surprise.

	NERI points to the "No Parking" sign.

	The DRIVER turns his head away.

				NERI
		OK, wise guy, you wanna summons, or
		you wanna move?

				DRIVER
			  (obviously a hood)
		You better check with your precinct.

				NERI
		Move it!

	The DRIVER takes a ten dollar bill, folds it deliberately,
	and hands it out the window, trying to put it under NERI's
	jacket.

	NERI backs up, letting the bill fall onto the street.  Then
	he crooks a finger at the DRIVER.

				NERI
		Let me see you license and
		registration.

	EXT DAY: MOTEL BALCONY

	LAMPONE on the motel balcony spots a Cadillac pulling up.
	It parks.  A young, pretty GIRL gets out.  Quickly, he
	returns into the room.

	INT DAY: HOTEL STAIRS (1955)

	CLEMENZA is climbing the back stairs of a large hotel.  He
	rounds the corner, puffs a little, and then continues upward.

	INT DAY: CHURCH

	The Church.  Close on the PRIEST's fingers as he gently
	applies oil to the infant's ears and nostrils.

				PRIEST
		Ephetha...be opened...So you may
		perceive the fragrance of God's
		sweetness.

	EXT DAY: ROCKEFELLER CENTER (1955)

	The DRIVER of the limousine in front of Rockefeller Center
	is arguing with NERI.

	Now the DRIVER looks up.

	WHAT HE SEES:

	TWO MEN in topcoats exit the building, through the revolving
	glass doors.

	NERI opens up fire, trapping BARZINI in the shattering glass
	doors.  The doors still rotate, moving the dead body of
	BARZINI within them.

	INT DAY: CHURCH

	In the Church--the VIEW on MICHAEL.  The PRIEST hands him
	the infant.

				PRIEST
		Do you renounce Satan.

				MICHAEL
		I do renounce him.

				PRIEST
		And all his works?

				MICHAEL
		I do renounce them.

	INT DAY: MOTEL MURDER (1955)

	LAMPONE, backed up by two other MEN in his regime, runs down
	the iron-rail steps, and kicks in the door on Room 7F.
	PHILIP TATTAGLIA, old and wizened and naked, leaps up; a
	semi-nude young GIRL leans up.

	They are riddled with gunfire.

	INT DAY: HOTEL STAIRS (1955)

	CLEMENZA, huffing and puffing, climbs the back stairs, with
	his package.

	INT DAY: CHURCH

	The PRIEST pours water over the forehead of the infant
	MICHAEL holds.

				PRIEST
		Do you wish to be baptized?

				MICHAEL
		I do wish to be baptized.

	INT DAY: HOTEL ELEVATOR MURDER (1955)

	CLEMENZA, out of breath, climbs the final few steps.

	He walks through some glass doors, and moves to an ornate
	elevator waiting shaft.

	The lights indicate the elevator has arrived.

	The doors open, and we see a surprised CUNEO standing with
	the dapper MOE GREENE.

	CLEMENZA fires into the small elevator with a shotgun.

	The PRIEST hands a lighted candle to MICHAEL.

				PRIEST
		I christen you Michael Francis Rizzi.

	Flash bulbs go off.  Everyone is smiles, and crowds around
	MICHAEL, KAY, CONNIE...and CARLO.

	--------------------------------------FADE OUT----------

	EXT DAY: CHURCH (1955)

	The christening party outside the Church.

	Four or five limousines have been waiting; now pull up to
	receive MAMA, CONNIE and the baby; and the others.

	Everyone is very happy; only MICHAEL seems aloof and grave.

	As the fuss is going on, a car pulls up.  LAMPONE gets out
	and works his way to MICHAEL.  He whispers in his ear.  This
	is the news MICHAEL has been waiting for.

	CONNIE holds the baby up to MICHAEL.

				CONNIE
		Kiss your Godfather.

	The infant turns its head, and MICHAEL uses that as an
	excuse to back away.

				MICHAEL
		Carlo...we've had a change in the
		plans.  Mama, Connie, Kay and the
		kids will have to take the trip out
		to Vegas without us.

				CONNIE
		Oh Mike, it's our first vacation
		together.

				CARLO
			  (anxious to please)
		Jesus, Connie...Sure, Mike...

				MICHAEL
		Go back to your house and wait for
		me...

	He kisses KAY.

				MICHAEL
			  (to KAY)
		I'll just be a couple of days...

	People are guided to the correct limousines; they start to
	drive off.

	INT DAY: DON'S KITCHEN

	TESSIO sits in the Kitchen of the Main House on the Mall.

	HAGEN enters.

				HAGEN
		You'd better make your call to
		Barzini; Michael's ready.

	TESSIO nods; moves to the telephone and dials a number.

				TESSIO
		We're on our way to Brooklyn.

	He hangs up and smiles.

				TESSIO
		I hope Mike can get us a good deal
		tonight.

				HAGEN
			  (gravely)
		I'm sure he will.

	EXT DAY: MALL (1955)

	The TWO MEN walk out onto the Mall, toward a car.  On their
	way they are stopped by TWO BODYGUARDS.

				BUTTON MAN
		The boss says he'll come in a
		separate car.  He says for you two
		to go on ahead.

				TESSIO
			  (frowning)
		Hell, he can't do that.  It screws
		up all my arrangements.

	THREE MORE BODYGUARDS appear around him.

				HAGEN
			  (gently)
		I can't go with you either, Tessio.

	He flashes at the men surrounding him; for a moment he
	panics, and then he accepts it.

				TESSIO
			  (after the pause)
		Tell Mike it was business...I
		always liked him.

				HAGEN
		He understands that.

	TESSIO looks at the men, and then pauses.

				TESSIO
			  (softly)
		Tom, can you get me off the hook?
		For old times' sake?

				HAGEN
		I can't.

	HAGEN turns, and walks away from the group.  Then about
	twenty paces away, he stops, and looks back.

	TESSIO is led into a waiting car.

	HAGEN looks away, and walks off.

	INT DAY: CARLO'S LIVING ROOM (1955)

	CARLO RIZZI is alone in his house, smoking, waiting rather
	nervously.  He moves to the window and looks out.

	WHAT HE SEES:

	EXT DAY: MALL (1955)

	MICHAEL, still dressed in a dark suit; followed by NERI,
	LAMPONE and CLEMENZA, then HAGEN.

	They move toward us.

	Excitedly, CARLO moves to the front door; opens it.

	He wears a broad smile.

				CARLO
		Godfather!

				MICHAEL
		You have to answer for Santino.

	The smile on CARLO's face slowly fades, then, in a foolish
	attempt for safety, he slams the door in their faces and
	backs into the living room.

	INT DAY: CARLO'S LIVING ROOM (1955)

	The door opens, and the grim party enters.

				MICHAEL
		You fingered Sonny for the Barzini
		people.  That little farce you
		played out with my sister.  Did
		Barzini kid you that would fool a
		Corleone?

				CARLO
			  (dignity)
		I swear I'm innocent.  I swear on
		the head of my children, I'm
		innocent.  Mike, don't do this to
		me, please Mike, don't do this to me!

				MICHAEL
			  (quietly)
		Barzini is dead.  So is Philip
		Tattaglia, so are Strachi, Cuneo
		and Moe Greene...I want to square
		all the family accounts tonight.
		So don't tell me you're innocent;
		admit what you did.

	CARLO is silent; he wants to talk but is terrified.

				MICHAEL
			  (almost kindly)
		Don't be frightened.  Do you think
		I'd make my sister a widow?  Do you
		think I'd make your children
		fatherless?  After all, I'm
		Godfather to your son.  No, your
		punishment is that you're out of
		the family business.  I'm putting
		you on a plane to Vegas--and I want
		you to stay there.  I'll send
		Connie an allowance, that's all.
		But don't keep saying you're
		innocent; it insults my intelligence
		and makes me angry.  Who approached
		you, Tattaglia or Barzini?

				CARLO
			  (sees his way out)
		Barzini.

				MICHAEL
			  (softly)
		Good, good.  Leave now; there's a
		car waiting to take you to the
		airport.

	CARLO moves to the door; opens it.  There is a car waiting;
	with a group of MEN around it.

	He looks back at MICHAEL, who reassures him.

				MICHAEL
		I'll call your wife and tell her
		what flight you're on.

	EXT DAY: MALL

	CARLO moves out to the Mall; the BUTTONMEN are putting his
	things in the trunk.

	ONE opens the front door for him.

	SOMEONE is sitting in the rear seat, though we cannot see who.

	CARLO gets into the car; out of nervousness, he looks back
	to see the other man.

	It is CLEMENZA, who nods cordially.

	The motor starts, and as the car pulls away, CLEMENZA
	suddenly throws the garrote around CARLO's neck.  He chokes
	and leaps up like a fish on a line, kicking his feet.

	The garrote is pulled tighter; CARLO's face turns color.

	His thrashing feet kick right through the front windshield.

	Then the body goes slack.

	CLEMENZA makes a foul face, and opens the window as the car
	drives off.

	EXT DAY: CARLO'S STEPS (1955)

	MICHAEL and his party.  They watch.

	Then he turns and walks off, and they follow.

	---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

	FADE IN:

	INT NITE: MICHAEL'S LIMO EN ROUTE (1955)

	MICHAEL sits alone in the back of his car; NERI is driving.

	They do not speak for a long time; it is night--car lights
	flash by.

	NERI turns back.

				NERI
		You know I would never question
		anything you say.

				MICHAEL
			  (smiles)
		Speak your mind.

				NERI
		I'll do this for you; you know I
		should.

				MICHAEL
		No.  This I have to do.

	EXT NITE: PIZZA STREET (1955)

	MICHAEL's car pulls up in a quiet neighborhood, near an
	Italian Pizzeria.  NERI opens the door.

				MICHAEL
		Sit in the car.

	INT NITE: PIZZA PLACE (1955)

	He walks alone into the restaurant.  A MAN is tossing pizza
	dough in the air.

				MICHAEL
		Where's the boss?

				MAN
		In the back.  Hey Frank, someone
		wants you.

	A MAN comes out of the shadows, with a strong Italian accent.

				MAN
		What is it?

	He stops, frozen in fear.  It is FABRIZZIO.

	VIEW ON MICHAEL.  Gunfire from under his coat.  FABRIZZIO is
	cut down.  MICHAEL throws the gun down; turns and exits.

	EXT DAY: MALL (1955)

	HIGH ANGLE ON THE CORLEONE MALL

	Several moving vans are parked in the Mall; one feels that
	these are the final days; the families are moving out; signs
	indicating that the property is for sale are evident.

	A black limousine pulls up, and before it has even stopped,
	the rear door flies open, and CONNIE attempts to run out,
	restrained by MAMA.  She manages to break free and runs
	across the Mall into Michael's house.

	INT DAY: DON'S LIVING ROOM (1955)

	Inside the Corleone house.  Big boxes have been packed;
	furniture prepared for shipping.

				CONNIE
		Michael!

	She hurries into the living room, where she comes upon
	MICHAEL and KAY.

				KAY
			  (comforting)
		Connie...

	But CONNIE avoids her, and moves directly to MICHAEL.  NERI
	is watchful.

				CONNIE
		You lousy bastard; you killed my
		husband...

				KAY
		Connie...

				CONNIE
		You waited until our father died
		and nobody could stop you and you
		killed him, you killed him!  You
		blamed him about Sonny, you always
		did, everybody did.  But you never
		thought about me, never gave a damn
		about me.
			  (crying)
		What am I going to do now, what am
		I going to do.

	TWO of Michael's BODYGUARDS move closer, ready for orders
	from him.  But he stands there, waiting for his sister to
	finish.

				KAY
		Connie, how could you say such
		things?

				CONNIE
		Why do you think he kept Carlo on
		the Mall?  All the time he knew he
		was going to kill my husband.  But
		he didn't dare while my father was
		alive.  And then he stood Godfather
		to our child.  That coldhearted
		bastard.
			  (to KAY)
		And do you know how many men he had
		killed with Carlo?  Just read the
		papers.  That's your husband.

	She tries to spit into MICHAEL's face; but in her hysteria
	she has no saliva.

				MICHAEL
		Get her home and get a doctor.

	The TWO BODYGUARDS immediately take her arms and move her,
	gently but firmly.

	KAY is shocked; never taking her look of amazement from
	MICHAEL.  He feels her look.

				MICHAEL
		She's hysterical.

	But KAY won't let him avoid her eyes.

				KAY
		Michael, it's not true.  Please
		tell me.

				MICHAEL
		Don't ask me.

				KAY
		Tell me!

				MICHAEL
		All right, this one time I'll let
		you ask about my affairs, one last
		time.

				KAY
		Is it true?

	She looks directly into his eyes, he returns the look, so
	directly that we know he will tell the truth.

				MICHAEL
			  (after a very long pause)
		No.

	KAY is relieved; she throws her arms around him, and hugs
	him.  Then she kisses him.

				KAY
			  (through her tears)
		We both need a drink.

	INT DAY: DON'S KITCHEN (1955)

	She moves back into the kitchen and begins to prepare the
	drinks.  From her vantage point, as she smilingly makes the
	drinks, she sees CLEMENZA, NERI and ROCCO LAMPONE enter the
	house with their BODYGUARDS.

	She watches with curiosity, as MICHAEL stands to receive
	them.  He stands arrogantly at ease, weight resting on one
	foot slightly behind the other.  One hand on his hip, like a
	Roman Emperor.  The CAPOREGIMES stand before him.

	CLEMENZA takes MICHAEL's hand, kissing it.

				CLEMENZA
		Don Corleone...

	The smile fades from KAY's face, as she looks at what her
	husband has become.

	INT DAY: CHURCH (1955)

	KAY wears a shawl over her hand.  She drops many coins in
	the coin box, and lifts a burning taper, and one by one, in
	a pattern known only to herself, lights thirty candles.

SECOND DRAFT

September 24, 1973





FADE IN:

The Paramount Pictures logo is presented over a simple black
background, as a single trumpet plays the familiar theme of
a waltz.  White lettering fades in:

		     Mario Puzo's THE GODFATHER

There is a pause, as the trumpet concludes, and there is the
additional title: - Part Two -

INT. DON CORLEONE'S OLD OFFICE - CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL
CORLEONE - DAY

standing impassively, like a young Prince, recently crowned
King.

CLOSE VIEW ON Michael's hand.  ROCCO LAMPONE kisses his hand.
Then it is taken away.  We can SEE only the empty desk and
chair of Michael's father, Vito Corleone.  We HEAR, over
this, very faintly a funeral dirge played in the distance,
as THE VIEW MOVES SLOWLY CLOSER to the empty desk and chair.

								DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. A SICILIAN LANDSCAPE - FULL VIEW - DAY

We can barely make out the funeral procession passing over
the burnt-brown of a dry river bed.  The figures move
slowly, seemingly from out of hundreds of years of the past.

The MUSICIANS walking unsteadily on the rocky bed, their
instruments harsh and blaring.

They are followed by six young peasant men, carrying the
crude wooden coffin on their shoulders.  Then the widow, a
strong large woman, dressed in black, and not accepting the
arms of those walking with her.

Behind her, not more than twenty relatives, few children and
paisani continue alone behind the coffin.

Suddenly, we HEAR the shots of the lupara, and the musicians
stop their playing.  The entire procession scatters in odd
directions along the rocky river bed.

The young men struggle with the burden of the heavy coffin,
throwing it out of balance and nearly crashing to the ground.
We hear a woman SCREAMING:

				WOMAN
			(Sicilian)
		They've killed young Paolo!  They've
		killed the boy Paolo!

EXT. SICILIAN LANDSCAPE - MED. VIEW - DAY

across the slain body of a fourteen year old boy, lying on
the parched ground.  In the distance we see four or five of
the mourning women, the wind blowing their black dresses and
veils, running up to the body of the boy.  They begin to
wail, and cry out in anguished Sicilian, as the widow, the
mother of the murdered boy, holds her child in her arms, his
fresh blood wetting her strong hands.

EXT. BARONIAL ESTATE - TIGHT MOVING VIEW - DAY

A boy, eight or nine, with wide, frightened eyes, being
pulled quickly by the hand.  This is VITO ANDOLINI, who is
to become The Godfather.

The VIEW ALTERS revealing that he is being pulled along by
his Mother, the Widow, across a field leading to the
ornamental gates of a Baronial Estate of some forgotten Noble.

At various positions near the gates are men with shotguns,
or lupara.  The gates are opened; and the Widow and her boy
are shown before DON FRANCESCO, a man in his sixties.  He
wears his trousers with suspenders, and an open white shirt
sloppily tucked in over his enormous belly.  He wears a hat
to protect him from the white-hot sun, and proudly displays
a gold watch and chain over his vest.

He sits in a chair, near a group of his men in the garden,
listening to the Widow, who stands before him with her only
son.

				WIDOW
			(Sicilian)
		Don Francesco.  You murdered my
		husband, because he would not bend.
		And his oldest son Paolo, because
		he swore revenge.  But Vitone is
		only nine, and dumb-witted.  He
		never speaks.

				DON FRANCESCO
			(Sicilian)
		I'm not afraid of his words.

				WIDOW
			(Sicilian)
		He is weak.

				DON FRANCESCO
			(Sicilian)
		He will grow strong.

				WIDOW
			(Sicilian)
		The child cannot harm you.

				DON FRANCESCO
			(Sicilian)
		He will be a man, and then he will
		come for revenge.

As she pleads, the Widow moves closer to the Don, until she
has practically thrown herself to her knees before him.

				WIDOW
			(Sicilian)
		I beg you, Don Francesco, spare my
		only son.  He is all I have.  In
		the name of the Holy Spirit, I
		swear he will never be a danger to
		you...

Suddenly, she reaches under her skirt, where she has hidden
a kitchen knife.

				WIDOW
			(continuing)
		But I will kill you myself!
			(she lunges at the
			Mafia chieftain)
		Vitone, go!

The boy runs as fast as he can out through the gates.  Then
there is a lupara blast.  He turns, and sees his Mother
flung a distance of five feet from the short range of the
terrible blast of the shotgun.  Then he sees the men turn
their attention to him.  One fires at him; but the boy is
quick, and disappears into a grove of olive trees.

EXT. STREETS OF CORLEONE - NIGHT

Two men roam the deserted streets of Corleone, carrying
lupare.  Every so often, they stop, and one shouts in a
loud, almost singsong voice, like a fish peddler.  Their
names are MOSCA and STROLLO.

				MOSCA
			(Sicilian)
		Our Friend promises misery to
		anyone who harbors the boy Vito
		Andolini.
			(he turns and shouts
			in the other direction)
		Our Friend promises misery to
		anyone who harbors the boy Vito
		Andolini.

INT. A HOUSE - NIGHT

A family quietly eats their dinner.  The father is the local
policeman, as indicated by his uniform jacket and gun,
hanging nearby.

				STROLLO
			(Sicilian, O.S.)
		Our Friend will be hard with any
		family who gives help to Vito
		Andolini.

One of the children looks up, about to speak.  But the
father sternly indicates that nothing must be said.  They go
on with their dinner.

EXT. THE STREETS OF CORLEONE - FULL VIEW - NIGHT

The men continue walking up and throughout the streets, far
in the distance.

				MOSCA
			(Sicilian O.S.)
		...misery to any family who harbors
		the boy, Vito...

INT. A BARN - NIGHT

Four little girls watch with wide eyes as their mother and
father bind Vito tightly in swaddled cloth, and then lift
him up to the side of a mule; counter-balancing a heavy load
of firewood.  The father looks at the boy's almost stoically
calm little face.

				FATHER
			(Sicilian)
		Vito...We pray for you.

He pulls the fabric over the boy's face.

				MOSCA
			(Sicilian O.S.)
		...Andolini...

				STROLLO
			(Sicilian O.S.)
		Our Friend promises misery to any
		family...

EXT. THE CHURCH PLAZA - NIGHT

The men continue on their night-walk, up to the plaza of the
church.

				STROLLO
			(Sicilian)
		...who harbors the boy Vitone
		Andolini.

The figure of a single man on a mule passes them.

				MOSCA
			(Sicilian)
		Let no one give help to the boy
		Vito Andolini...

The man on the mule makes his way out of the village and
disappears into the distance.

We begin to hear, very quietly, the Waltz repeated once again.

EXT. STEAMSHIP - CLOSE VIEW ON VITO - DAY

huddled in blankets, on the deck of the ship in Steerage.
He does not say a word.  The Waltz grows louder as the VIEW
ALTERS, revealing the hundreds of immigrant families huddled
together with all their earthly possessions on their way to
America.

Then, suddenly, the Waltz stops.

THE NEW YORK HARBOR - DAY

SILENCE.  We glide past the Statue of Liberty.

VIEW on the IMMIGRANTS standing on shipboard silently;
looking.  Vito is standing with them, his eyes wide.

CAMERA MOVES IN on the statue, then MOVING PAST, on to the
beautiful buildings of Ellis Island.

EXT. ELLIS ISLAND - DAY

A tugboat pulls a barge brimming with immigrants into the
Ellis Island harbor.  Uniformed officials of the Immigration
Service load them up toward the main building.

INT. ELLIS PROCESSING HALL - DAY

The hundreds of immigrant families sit on rows of benches in
the great hall.  Various painted lines lead to the steps and
processing rooms above.

There is the babble of many interviews going on
simultaneously, uncertainly, in different languages.

Vito is bundled in an old coat, with a large tag pinned on
it: "Vitone Andolini -- Corleone, Sicilia."

He stands, moves up in the line, when several other immigrant
boys, older than he, rush up an push him back in the line.
Weak from the trip, he falls to the floor.  The boys laugh,
derisive in a language he cannot understand.  He struggles
to his feet, lifting his makeshift bags; staring at them in
an icy hatred.

INT. PROCESSING ROOM - DAY

Three or four interviews are crowded into the small room;
they are conducted in English.  From the expression on
Vito's face, and from the fragmented of the English, we
realize that he doesn't understand a word of it.

				OFFICIAL
			(English)
		What is your name?

The man waits, impatiently.

				OFFICIAL
		Your name?

Vito doesn't answer.  The Official pulls the tag pinned onto
his coat and copies to down on his form, using a typewriter.

				OFFICIAL
			(speaking as he types)
		Vito...Corleone.  Step up, over
		there.

He hands the form to another official.

CLOSE VIEW on the form.  The name has been entered as Vito
Corleone.

INT. MEDICAL EXAM - DAY

Vito is stripped to the waist, as other immigrants wait.

The DOCTOR is just finishing his examination.  He shakes his
head, and then writes on the medical form.

				DOCTOR
		Can you understand me?

Vito stares blankly.

				DOCTOR
		You understand?  Smallpox.  Smallpox.

He doesn't understand.  The doctor turns to the Immigration
Official.

				DOCTOR
		Quarantine...six months.

UNDERGROUND PASSAGEWAY - MOVING VIEW - DAY

Officials move a group of immigrant men, including Vito, to
the quarantine section of the Island.

INT. QUARANTINE HALLWAY - DAY

The official stops at each doorway, and reads off a name.

				OFFICIAL
		Salvatore Ormenta.

The man moves into the room, and the group proceeds.

				OFFICIAL
		Vito Corleone.

No one responds.  The guard moves to the boy, reads his new
name tag.  And then, not unkindly:

				GUARD
		That's you.

He opens the door, and Vito enters the room.

EXT. THE STATUE OF LIBERTY - DAY

The VIEW slowly begins to pull back, revealing this to be
the view from inside the quarantine cell, where Vito stands
on his bench, looking out to the statue through the barred
window.

Then he turns, and sits in the corner.  He is silent for a
long time.

Then, in a sweet, pure voice, he sings to himself in Sicilian.

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT. CATHOLIC CHURCH - MOVING CLOSE SHOT - DAY

A nine year old boy, dressed immaculately in white, with a
large white silk bow tied to his shoulder, moving slowly
down the aisle of the church with a group of other children
dressed in white.  He has dark black hair, and his face is
unmistakably similar to young Vito's.  He moves slowly, his
hands clasped around a golden missal.  We HEAR only the pure
voice of Vito in Sicilian, his sad song reaching out from
the past, as ANTHONY CORLEONE, his Grandson, moves on the
way to his First Holy Communion more than fifty years later.

FULL VIEW

The little children move in procession down to the Altar,
where the PRIEST raises the Host, and performs the Communion
Mass in Latin.

				PRIEST
		Ecce Agnus Dei, ecce qui tollit
		peccata mundi.

MOVING VIEW ON THE PRIEST

and Altar boys, as he moves along the row of kneeling
children, blessing them, and administering their first
Communion.

CLOSE MOVING VIEW

as the innocent faces receive the Host; finally, the Priest
comes to Anthony.

				PRIEST
		Corpus Christi.

				ANTHONY
		Amen.

EXT. LAKE TAHOE ESTATE - DAY

The lawns of this great estate on the shore of Lake Tahoe
are covered with guests of a wonderful party to honor the
First Holy Communion of Anthony Corleone, the son of Mr. and
Mrs. Michael Corleone.  A full dance orchestra plays music
of the times on a pavilion bandstand built especially for
the occasion.  Speedboats roar through the water, pulling
youthful waterskiers; and the pool and private harbor are
filled with laughing, swimming guests.  It is Fall of 1958.

MED. VIEW

Anthony, in his Communion suit sits alone at the table,
looking like a lonely young Prince.

				KAY (O.S.)
		Smile, Anthony.  Smile.

He does, and a flash goes off.

				PHOTOGRAPHER (O.S.)
		Now, one with the whole family.

				KAY (O.S.)
		Mr. Corleone can't right now...

KAY CORLEONE enters from the side, leading her four year old
daughter, MARY, and MAMA CORLEONE to pose with Anthony.

				KAY (O.S.)
		...but we'll get one with the ladies.

				PHOTOGRAPHER
		All together now, c'mon, Anthony...
		CHEESE and
			(flash)

				KAY
		Thank you.

She smiles as she leaves the photographer, and then lets out
a weary sigh to Mama, as she touches the slightly protruding
belly.

				KAY
		Do you think it'll show in the
		picture?

				MAMA
		Two months never shows.  Two months
		look like you had a big lunch.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Oh, Mrs. Corleone.

A slender, aristocratic WOMAN in her late forties is waving
to KAY.

				MRS. BARRETT
		Hello, Mrs. Corleone.  I'm Fran
		Barrett, our place is just down the
		lake.  This is my husband, Marshall.

				KAY
		I'm so happy you could come.

				MR. BARRETT
		The place is transformed.  We've
		been watching workmen come and go
		all summer.

				MRS. BARRETT
		Where is Mr. Corleone?

				KAY
		A business meeting ran late...but
		he promised he wouldn't be long.

Kay puts her arm around little Anthony's shoulder.

				KAY
		This is our son Anthony Vito
		Corleone.  Today he made his First
		Holy Communion.

EXT. TAHOE GATE AND KENNELS - DAY

A confusion of cars; arriving and parking.  The squad of
parking attendants are supplemented by a whole team of the
local Police, working as high-class parking valets.

A very beautiful, statuesque woman, though slightly drunk,
DEANNA DUNN, slams the door of a powder blue Mercedes and
hurries barefoot through the great stone gate.

				DEANNA
		I will not shut my mouth, and keep
		your Goddamn hands off of me!

She is followed by a harried, FREDDIE CORLEONE, dressed with
flash in the Hollywood style, and carrying her shoes in his
hands.

				FREDO
		Honey!  Wait a minute; let's go for
		a drive.

				DEANNA
		I just had a drive; besides, I want
		to see my brother-in-law Michael.

				FREDO
			(trying to get her to
			put her shoes on)
		Yeah, but I don't want him to see
		you.

Deanna pauses reflectively a moment, allowing Fredo to get
her shoes on.

				DEANNA
		What beats me, is how you guys
		could be brothers.  You musta been
		your Mother's rotten egg.

She kicks off the shoes, giggling, and runs toward a waiter.

				DEANNA
			(lifting a glass of champagne)
		Young man, young man...thank you,
		young man.

				WAITER
			(impressed)
		Excuse me, but aren't you...

				DEANNA
		Yes, you saw me in the movies, Good
		Humor man, and yes, I had more off
		than my shoes!

				FREDO
		Goddamn bitch.

				DEANNA
		Relax, Freddie honey.  Come dance
		with me.

She extends her hand to him.

				FREDO
		Listen, Michael's got a lot of nice
		people here.  Friends of Kay's.
		He'll never forgive me if you ruin
		his party.

				DEANNA
		I hate to see you cringe in front
		of him.  How come you're so scared
		of your own kid brother?

				FREDO
		He's the head of the family.

Disgusted, she turns around, and heads toward the music.

				DEANNA
		Don't follow me!

EXT. TAHOE LAWN AND TABLES - MED. SHOT - DAY

Rushing through the tables, waving an arm jangling with gold
jewelry, and carrying several gift-wrapped packages, is a
hardened and aging CONNIE CORLEONE.  She is followed by a
blond, and wrinkled-handsome escort named MERLE.

				CONNIE
		Mama...Mama!  Here I am!

She throws her arms around her Mother, who returns the
affection somewhat reproachfully.

				MAMA
		Constanzia.  We expected you last
		week; we sent the car to pick you
		up at the airport last week.

				CONNIE
		I know, it was chaos; but anyway,
		here I am one week late.
			(lifting a shiny
			green package out of
			Merle's arms)
		This is for my Mama.  You remember
		Merle?

				MAMA
			(not giving him a
			chance to greet her)
		Yes, thank you.

				CONNIE
		How are the kids?

				MAMA
		Well, thank you, they asked for you
		all week.

				CONNIE
		I got surprises for everybody!

				MAMA
			(glancing at the wrapping)
		Bought at the airport.

				CONNIE
			(gazing about)
		This is swell.  Where's Michael?
		I've got things to get straight
		with him and I can't wait on line.

				MAMA
		You go see your children first, and
		then you wait to see your brother
		like everybody else.

EXT. THE BOATHOUSE - DAY

A porch-like foyer of the boathouse, where a group of five
or six men wait, some nervously.  Some sit, and some pace.

MED. CLOSE VIEW

on one of these men, FRANKIE PENTANGELI, approaching his
sixties, with gray hair (the little of it left).  He's a bit
scruffy, this morning's shave of his white beard is not
perfect, and he seems tired.  He is accompanied by an
associate-bodyguard, WILLY CICCI; thin and dark, and also
dressed up for the occasion.  Frankie tries to get the
attention of one of the waiters; a college-groomed young man
in white sports jacket and black bow-tie.

				PENTANGELI
		Hey, kid!  You got any red wine?

				WAITER
			(offering the tray)
		Only champagne and cocktails.

				PENTANGELI
		Forget it...

Finally, he sees someone he recognizes, Fredo, and shouts
out in a husky voice:

				PENTANGELI
		Fredo!  Sonuvabitch.  You look great.

Fredo squints in his direction; finally recognizes him.

				FREDO
		Who's that?  Pentangeli?  Frankie
		"Five-Angels"...thought you were
		never coming West.

				PENTANGELI
			(affectionately)
		Gotta check up on my boys.  Hey,
		what's with the food?  Some kid in
		a white jacket brings me a ritz
		cracker with some chopped liver.
		'Canapes,' he says.  I say, 'Can a
		peas, my ass, that's a ritz cracker
		with chopped liver.' Go get me a
		salami sandwich and a glass of wine
		or I'll send you and your white
		jacket to the dry cleaners!

They get a good laugh at this fresh breath of New York.

				FREDO
		Gee, Frankie, it's good to see you.
		Reminds me of old times.

				PENTANGELI
		You remember Willy Cicci, don't
		you, Freddie?  We was all together
		with the old man Clemenza in
		Brooklyn... before...uh...

				FREDO
		We were all upset about that.

				PENTANGELI
		That's what I'm here to talk to
		your brother about.  What's with
		him, I got to get a letter of
		introduction to have a 'sitdown'?

				FREDO
			(throwing his arm
			around him)
		C'mon, I see what I can do.

EXT. TAHOE PAVILION - MED. VIEW - DAY

The orchestra wears white summer sportcoats and black tuxedo
slacks as they play a tango behind monogrammed music stands.
A professional dance team, probably imported from Vegas,
dance the tango for the excited guests.

INT. TAHOE BOATHOUSE - DAY

A large and very beautiful room overlooking the lake.  It is
dominated by an enormous bar, behind which stands ALBERT
NERI, discreetly in the background.

MICHAEL CORLEONE sits on a large sofa, his back to us.
Standing to one side is a tired and somewhat uneasy TOM
HAGEN.  Standing before Michael is SANDRA CORLEONE, Sonny's
widow; her daughter, one of the twins, FRANCESCA CORLEONE,
and a handsome young man of twenty, GARDNER SHAW.

				SANDRA
		Michael, this is Gardner Shaw.
		Francesca and he have been seeing
		each other for six months now.
		Gardner, this is Francie's Uncle
		Michael.

				GARDNER
			(a little nervous)
		I've heard a lot about you, Mr.
		Corleone.

				MICHAEL (O.S.)
		Sit down.  Francie.

The couple sit themselves on the sofa opposite Michael.

				SANDRA
		They would like to set an engagement
		date, and...

				MICHAEL
		Let them speak for themselves.

VIEW ON MICHAEL, calm, thoughtful.  One can tell that he has
special affection for his niece.

				FRANCESCA
		We love each other, Uncle Michael.
		And, we want to be married.  I came
		to ask for your blessing.

There is a loud KNOCKING on the door; then Fredo's voice.

				FREDO (O.S.)
		Hey, Mike...guess who's here?

Neri goes to answer it, cracks the door open.

				NERI
		Not now, Freddie...

				FREDO
		Tell Mike Frankie 'Five-Angels' is
		here.

				NERI
		Not now...

Neri closes the door, and Michael looks at the nervous young
man.

				MICHAEL
		Francesca is my oldest brother's
		daughter.  He died many years ago,
		and ever since I've felt much more
		of a father than an uncle.  I love
		her very much.  I'm pleased and
		impressed that you had the thought
		to come to me before going on with
		your plans.  It shows me that
		you're a considerate man, and will
		be good to her.  What are you
		studying in college?

				GARDNER
		My major is Fine Arts, sir.

				MICHAEL
		How will Fine Arts support your new
		wife?

				GARDNER
		It's embarrassing to say, sir, but
		I'm a major stockholder in the
		family corporation.

				MICHAEL
			(smiling)
		Never be embarrassed by your wealth.
		This recent contempt for money is
		still another trick of the rich to
		keep the poor without it.
			(warmly)
		Of course I give you my blessing.
		Let's set the wedding soon...it
		will be my pleasure to give the
		bride away.

They all smile, and rise.

				MICHAEL
			(continuing)
		...and take a few courses in
		Business Administration just to be
		on the safe side!

They laugh; Michael moves toward them.  Francesca throws her
arms around him, and kisses her favorite uncle.  The flushed
young man shakes his hand heartily.

				FRANCESCA
		Thank you, Uncle Michael.

They all take their leave; Michael turns to Hagen.

				MICHAEL
		Make her dowry impressive.  He
		comes from a family who still
		thinks an Italian bride goes
		barefoot.

EXT. TAHOE SWIMMING POOLS AND HARBOR - DAY

Francesca and Gardner are greeted by her twin sister and
their young friends, who squeal and embrace at the good news.
Someone throws someone in the pool, and life is good.

MED. CLOSE

Francesca kisses her Aunt Kay.

				FRANCESCA
		Uncle Michael is the greatest man
		ever!

VIEW on Kay - happy for her niece.

INT. TAHOE BOATHOUSE - DAY

Michael sits in the darkened boathouse.  Tom Hagen paces.
Michael is looking at photographs.  Neri stands over him.

CLOSE ON MICHAEL

studying the pictures.

				NERI (O.S.)
		His name is Fred Vincent.  He owns
		a small pizza parlor in Buffalo...

CLOSE ON THE PICTURES

Snapshots of a middle-aged man, handsome, Italian.  There is
something familiar about him.

				NERI (O.S.)
			(continuing)
		...American wife and two small kids.
		We traced him and found that he's
		in the country illegally, from
		Sicily...

Michael looks at another picture.  The same man.  Only
younger, and dressed in Sicilian shepherd's clothing.  We
remember him as FABRIZZIO...Michael's traitorous bodyguard
in Sicily.

				NERI (O.S.)
		...came over around 1956.  Sponsored
		by the Barzini Family.

Michael puts the pictures down.

				MICHAEL
		It's him.  Fabrizzio.
			(almost to himself)
		Revenge is a dish that tastes best
		when it's cold.

				NERI
		How do you want me to handle it?

Michael glances at Hagen, who has been waiting in the room.

				MICHAEL
		Later.  Tom?

Hagen brings him a folder; then, as Michael glances through
it:

				HAGEN
		I've cleared it through the
		Senator's chief aide, a man named
		Turnbull.  Turnbull's a heavy
		gambler, and into us for over a
		hundred grand, so I figure his
		information is reliable.

Neri moves to the bar, to prepare Michael a drink.

				HAGEN
		The Senator can be set up; but he
		thinks of himself as a clean
		politician.  So it's got to be on
		terms he can live with: campaign
		contribution, donation to a
		charitable cause that he controls,
		things like that.  If he gets even
		the inkling that you think you're
		buying him, he'll freeze up.
		Nevada's a funny state, they like
		things both ways here... All right.
		Turnbull says the Senator will be
		here at two-thirty, and he's been
		primed.  He knows you'll want to
		meet with him alone, and he knows
		it's about the Tropicana's license.
		At any rate, he expects to be
		introduced around to some of the
		influential people here today, and
		generally treated as an ordinary
		guest.  Just go light on him,
		Mikey, sometimes the biggest crooks
		don't like to think of themselves
		as crooks...

Michael glances at Hagen, as though that last remark was
unnecessary.

				HAGEN
		I'm sorry; of course, you know that.

				MICHAEL
		Two-thirty.  That gives me time to
		see my boy.

				HAGEN
		Connie's outside.

Michael doesn't want to see her.

				HAGEN
		I promised; she said it was urgent.

Michael nods.

				MICHAEL
		All right.  Apologize to Pentangeli.

Neri opens the door; Hagen exits, and Connie steps in
impatiently, followed by Merle.

				MICHAEL
		I said I would see my sister, alone.

				MERLE
		I think this concerns me too.
			(taking a cigarette
			from the dispenser)
		You don't, do you?

Connie steps forward, kisses Michael on the cheek.

				CONNIE
		How are you, honey?  You've met
		Merle, haven't you.  He was with me
		in Vegas.

				MICHAEL
		I saw him with you.

				CONNIE
		We're going to Europe next week.  I
		want to get passage booked on the
		Queen.

				MICHAEL
		Why do you come to me?  Why don't
		you go to a travel agent?

				MERLE
		We're going to get married first.

Michael is silent.  Then he rises, and moves to the window
overlooking the lake.

				MICHAEL
		The ink on your divorce isn't dry.
		Your children see you on weekends;
		your oldest boy, Michael Francis...
		was in some trouble with the Reno
		police over some petty theft that
		you don't even know about.

				CONNIE
		Michael...

				MICHAEL
		You fly around the world with lazy
		young men who don't have any love
		for you, and use you like a whore.

				CONNIE
		You're not my father!

				MICHAEL
		Then why do you come to me?

				CONNIE
		Because I need MONEY!

				MICHAEL
			(softly)
		Connie, I want to be reasonable
		with you.  You have a house here,
		with us.  You can live here with
		your kids...and you won't be
		deprived of anything.  I don't know
		much about Merle; I don't know what
		he does for a living; what he lives
		on.  Why don't you tell him marriage
		is really out of the question; and
		that you can't see him any more.
		He'll understand.  But if you
		disobey me, and marry this pimp...it
		would disappoint me.

				CONNIE
		It was my father's money; and I'm
		entitled to what I need.  Where is
		Tom Hagen?

She turns angrily, leaving Michael standing face to face
with Merle.

				MICHAEL
		Are you finished?

				MERLE
		I think so.

				MICHAEL
		Then out.

Merle puts out his cigarette and leaves, quickly.

EXT. TAHOE PAVILION - FULL VIEW - DAY

The orchestra has struck up a "Paul Jones," where two
concentric circles of young people march in opposite
directions, until the music stops.  Then they take whomever
is opposite them as their new dance partner.

VIEW ON THE HARBOR AREA

Francesca and her twin, Gardner and their elite young
friends roar out of the private harbor, to get up on the
water skis.  We notice ROCCO LAMPONE, move along a path
leading to a separate and more private boathouse.  A small
covered craft approaches, ties off, and a group of three men
step on to the pathway, shake hands with Lampone - and
follow him to the large boathouse where Michael conducts his
business.

CLOSE VIEW

Pentangeli has led Mama up to the dance floor, and is having
some difficulty with the orchestra.

				PENTANGELI
		I can't believe that out of thirty
		professional musicians, not one of
		you is Italian!
			(as the musicians laugh)
		C'mon, give us a tarantella.

He waves his hands, conducting, and singing.  The piano
starts a vamp, the drums uncertainly join in.  A clarinet
starts to play "Pop Goes the Weasel," and soon the rest of
the orchestra is playing that.  They look to Pentangeli for
approval.  Disgusted, he goes back to his table, eating a
handful of canapes.

INT. THE BOATHOUSE - DAY

Rocco ushers an older Italian, bundled up against the cold
and wet of his boatride, to Michael.

The man shows respect to Michael, who quickly indicates that
Neri should get him a drink.

				MICHAEL
		Rocco, his friends must be hungry.
		See what you can do, but I'd like
		to keep them away from the guests.

The older man, JOHNNY 'BLUE BOY' OLA, gestures to his
bodyguards, and they follow Lampone.

				MICHAEL
		You know my lawyer, Tom Hagen.
		Johnny Ola.

				OLA
		Sure, I remember Tom from the old
		days.

Tom shakes hands with Ola, remembering him, and his
importance.

				MICHAEL
		Tom isn't going to sit in with us,
		Johnny.  He only handles specific
		areas of the family business.  Tom?

				HAGEN
		Sure, Mikey.

He gathers up some of his papers, as the three men remain
silent, waiting for him to go before they talk.  It's clear
Tom doesn't want to be excluded.

				HAGEN
		If you need anything, just...

				MICHAEL
		Just tell Rocco I'm waiting.

Hagen nods and leaves.  As soon as the door closes:

				OLA
		I just left our friend in Miami.

				MICHAEL
		How is his health?

				OLA
		Not good.

				MICHAEL
		Is there anything I can do; anything
		I can send?

				OLA
		He appreciates your concern,
		Michael, and your respect.

There's a KNOCK on the door; a moment, and then Rocco
quietly enters and takes his place without disturbing the
conversation.

				OLA
		The hotel's registered owners are
		one Jacob Lawrence, and Sidney
		Barclay, both Beverly Hills
		attorneys.  In reality it's split
		between the Old Lakeville Road
		Group from Cleveland, and our
		friend in Miami.  He takes care of
		others outside the country, you
		know who I mean.  Meyer Klingman
		runs the store, and does all right,
		but I've been instructed to tell
		you, that if you move him out, our
		friend in Miami will go along with
		you.

				MICHAEL
		He's very kind, tell him it's
		appreciated.  I'm sure it will be
		profitable all the way around.

				OLA
		He always makes money for his
		partners.  One by one, our old
		friends are gone.  Death, natural
		or not, prison, deported.  Our
		friend in Miami is the only one
		left, because he always made money
		for his partners.

The door opens suddenly, and standing there in his white
Communion suit, is Michael's boy Anthony.  A moment later,
Kay appears, and takes the boy's hand.

				KAY
		Anthony, Daddy's busy.

				MICHAEL
			(rising)
		This is my boy, and my wife.  Mr.
		John Ola of Miami.

				KAY
		I'm sorry, Michael.  Senator
		Geary's here, and Mr. and Mrs.
		Barrett wanted to thank you before
		they left.  Won't you join us, Mr.
		Ola?

				MICHAEL
		Mr. Ola's just leaving, Kay.
		Please tell the Senator I won't be
		a minute.

Pause; she stands there a moment.

				MICHAEL
			(continuing)
		Kay.

				KAY
		Yes, Michael.

EXT. THE BOATHOUSE - DAY

Kay closes the door.  It seems as though Michael has violated
some sort of promise to her by having this man here today.
She looks up toward the first boathouse.

WHAT SHE SEES:

The covered launch, and Ola's three bodyguards, eating while
they wait.

MED. VIEW

Anthony runs away from her, heading toward the house.

				KAY
		Anthony!
			(she runs after him)
		Anthony, where are you going?

Moodily, the boy stops, turns, and walks back to his table
of honor without answering her.

EXT. TAHOE TABLES AND PAVILION - VIEW ON THE PAVILION - DAY

The orchestra has taken its break; now two couples in formal
dress are performing the Quartet from Rigoletto.

VIEW ON HAGEN

sitting by himself, a little down, having a drink.  He's
waiting for Michael to re-summon him.  SANDRA, Sonny's
widow, sits opposite him.

				HAGEN
		Where's my wife?

				SANDRA
		With Mama, putting the baby to
		sleep.  Francesca's very happy.
		Michael was kind to her.  She
		idolizes him.
			(pause; she looks at
			a despondent Hagen)
		The children are all out in the
		speedboat.  I'm going to my house.

Sandra gets up, still an attractive woman, and walks alone
to the back path that leads to her home on the estate.

VIEW ON THE PAVILION

The returned orchestra strikes a big, show-biz chord,
intended to command the guests' attention.

The orchestra LEADER raises his hands for silence, and makes
an announcement over the P.A. system.

				MAESTRO
		Ladies and gentlemen, a most
		distinguished guest would like to
		say a few words: Senator and Mrs.
		Pat Geary of the state of Nevada!

A big hand, as the smiling SENATOR introduces his WIFE by
holding her arm up to the crowd, and then proceeds alone to
the bandstand.

MED. VIEW

Michael stands with Kay and Mrs. Geary.  The Senator's
presence seems to be a statement of political and social
status.

A little distance away, his beautiful son Anthony sits
quietly, in an unmistakably morose mood.

INT. TAHOE - SANDRA'S HOUSE - DAY

We HEAR the applause and whistles echoing in the distance.
Sandra stands in her bedroom, looking at the door.  We SEE a
photograph of SONNY, and also one of their wedding.

A moment goes by, and then Tom Hagen enters, closing the
door behind him.

We begin to HEAR Senator Geary's amplified voice resounding
over the lake.  Hagen moves to Sandra.  She takes him in her
arms, comforting, holding his head against her full breast.

				HAGEN
			(quietly)
		He doesn't want my help any more.
		He doesn't need it.

				SANDRA
		We don't know that's true, he never
		said that.

				HAGEN
		I can feel it in the way he talks
		to me.

He moves to the dresser; pours himself a drink.

				HAGEN
		Just now when Johnny Ola showed up,
		he asked me to leave them alone.
		Ola is Hyman Roth's Sicilian
		contact.  I was on the inside of
		ten, twenty meetings with him.  But
		today Mike asked me to leave, like
		an outsider.

				SANDRA
		Talk to him.  Tell him how you feel.

				HAGEN
		It's as though he blames me for the
		ground the family lost when I was
		Consigliere to Sonny.

Sandra pulls Hagen to her, and kisses him passionately on
the mouth.

				HAGEN
		I love Michael, I want to help him,
		be close to him.  I don't want to
		end up a third string lawyer making
		property settlements for the hotels.

Sandra knows he needs her.  Slowly she begins to undress.

				SANDRA
		We have a little time now.

EXT. THE PAVILION - VIEW ON SENATOR GEARY - DAY

				SENATOR GEARY
		...my thanks, and the thanks of the
		young people of the State of
		Nevada, for this most impressive
		endowment...
			(he holds a check in
			his hand)
		...made to the University in the
		name of Anthony Vito Corleone.
		Thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Michael
		Corleone.

Applause.  Senator Geary returns the microphone to the
Maestro who adds:

				MAESTRO
		And now, the Nevada Boys' Choir
		have prepared a special thank you
		for Mr. Michael Corleone.

He turns to a small Choir Master, who leads the Boys' Choir
in a choral arrangement of "MR. WONDERFUL."

VIEW ON SENATOR GEARY

shaking hands with Michael, as Press Photographers snap
pictures, showing the check; showing a special award of
Gratitude from the State; Mrs. Corleone and Mrs. Geary; all
together; Michael and his son; Senator Geary and Michael's
son; and on and on.  In the midst of this:

				SENATOR GEARY
		Where can we meet alone?

Michael indicates the boathouse a distance away, where Neri
seems to be waiting for them.  Then Michael leans to Rocco:

				MICHAEL
		Find Hagen.

Rocco sets off; as more pictures are taken, and the:

BOYS' CHOIR

sings its lovely arrangement of "Mr. Wonderful."

INT. TAHOE BOATHOUSE - MED. VIEW - DAY

Michael, the Senator, Neri and Rocco make a group in the
dark, large room.

				MICHAEL
		It was very kind of you to come to
		my home on this occasion, Senator.
		My wife has been very concerned
		with making a good impression on
		the people who are our neighbors,
		and your appearance here has made
		her very happy.  If I can ever
		perform a service for you, you only
		have to ask.

The door opens, and Hagen sheepishly makes his way in.

				MICHAEL
		My lawyer, Tom Hagen.  He arranged
		this all through your man Turnbull.

				SENATOR GEARY
		I thought we would meet alone.

				MICHAEL
		I trust these men with my life.
		They are my right arms; I cannot
		insult them by sending them away.

				SENATOR GEARY
			(taking out some medication)
		Some water.

He addresses that to Neri, who resentfully goes to fetch the
Senator a glass of water.

				SENATOR GEARY
		Alright, Corleone.  I'm going to be
		very frank with you.  Maybe more
		frank than any man in my position
		has ever spoken to you before.

Michael nods, indicating that he should do so.

				SENATOR GEARY
		The Corleone family controls two
		major hotels in Vegas; one in Reno.
		The licenses were grandfathered in,
		so you had no difficulties with the
		Gaming Commission.  But I have the
		idea from sources...
			(takes the water from
			Neri and swallows his pills)
		...that you're planning to move in
		on the Tropicana.  In another week
		or so you'll move Klingman out,
		which leaves you with only one
		technicality.  The license, which
		is now in Klingman's name.

				MICHAEL
		Turnbull is a good man.

				SENATOR GEARY
		Let's forget the bullshit, I don't
		want to stay here any longer than I
		have to.  You can have the license
		for two hundred and fifty thousand
		in cash, plus a monthly fee equal
		to five percent of the gross...

Michael is taken aback; he looks at Hagen.

				SENATOR GEARY
		...of all three Corleone hotels.

Hagen is frustrated; all his information was wrong.

				MICHAEL
		Senator Geary, I speak to you as a
		businessman who has made a large
		investment in your state.  I have
		made that state my home; plan to
		raise my children here.  The
		license fee from the Gambling
		Commission costs one thousand
		dollars; why would I ever consider
		paying more?

				SENATOR GEARY
		I'm going to squeeze you, Corleone,
		because I don't like you; I don't
		like the kind of man you are.  I
		despise your masquerade, and the
		dishonest way you pose yourself and
		your fucking family.

VIEW ON HAGEN

glances at Michael.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

makes no outward reaction.

				MICHAEL
			(quietly)
		We're all part of the same
		hypocrisy, Senator.  But never
		think it applies to my family.

				SENATOR GEARY
		All right, then let me say you'll
		pay me because it's in your
		interests to pay me.

VIEW ON GEARY

rising.

				SENATOR GEARY
		I'll expect your answer, with
		payment, by tomorrow morning.  Only
		don't contact me...from now on,
		deal only through Turnbull.

He is almost out the door.

				MICHAEL
		Senator...
			(cold and calm)
		...you can have my answer now if
		you'd like.

Geary turns back.

				MICHAEL
		My offer is this.  Nothing...not
		even the thousand dollars for the
		Gaming Commission, which I'd
		appreciate if you would put up
		personally.

Geary returns Michael's hard look; then laughs and leaves.
Slowly Michael turns to Hagen.

VIEW ON HAGEN

embarrassed at being so off the mark.

				MICHAEL
		It's all right, Tom, we'll talk
		later.  Tell Frankie Pentangeli I'd
		like him to have dinner at my
		family table before we do business.

EXT. THE PAVILION - NIGHT

Now the light has faltered, and the young waiters have put
up the night lights.  The tables are all properly set for
dinner, with candles on each one.

The orchestra is playing quiet, unobtrusive dinner music,
and many of the guests have begun to help themselves to the
impressive buffet, under a party tent.

MED. VIEW

Michael sits at a large table with Kay, his son Anthony,
Mama, Hagen and TERESA, Connie and Merle' Fredo and Deanna,
and Frankie Pentangeli.

				MAMA
		Cent' Anne.

This, the table of honor, all raise their glasses and repeat
the toast.

				DEANNA
		What's 'cent' Anne?'

				FREDO
		A hundred years...it's a toast.

				CONNIE
		It means we should all live happily
		for one hundred years.  The family.
		If my Father were alive, it'd be
		true.

				MAMA
		Connie.

				CONNIE
		Merle, have you met my sister-in-
		law Deanna?

				DEANNA
		What a pleasure, Merle.
			(shaking hands)


				MAMA
			(Sicilian)
		Those two are perfect for each other.

				MERLE
		What's that mean?

				CONNIE
		Mama!

				PENTANGELI
			(Sicilian)
		Michael, in all respect, I didn't
		come three thousand miles for dinner.

				MICHAEL
			(Sicilian)
		I know.

				PENTANGELI
			(Sicilian)
		When do we talk?

				MICHAEL
			(Sicilian)
		After dinner.

By now, the conversation has become exclusively Sicilian,
with Merle and Deanna, looking from side to side like in a
tennis match.  Finally, Kay, to be polite:

				KAY
		Anthony, you were talking to Mr.
		Pentangeli?

				ANTHONY
		His name is "Five-Angels."

				PENTANGELI
		Yeah, the kid and me talked Sicilian.
		A one-way conversation!

INT. TAHOE BOATHOUSE - NIGHT

Pentangeli is angry; but because it is Michael he is talking
to, he keeps his voice low and represses his desire to shout.

				PENTANGELI
		Sure, Pete Clemenza died of a heart
		attack, but the Rosato Brothers
		gave it to him.

				MICHAEL
		We were all heartbroken at the
		news; but that wasn't cause to
		start a war.

				PENTANGELI
		Okay, now it's my family in
		Brooklyn; and I wanna keep up
		Clemenza's loyalty to you.  But how
		can I run my family with you
		challenging my every move?  You're
		too far from the street, Mike, the
		only way to reason with the Rosato
		Brothers is to whack 'em and whack
		'em fast.

				MICHAEL
		You were unfair with them.

				PENTANGELI
		Says who?

				MICHAEL
		Clemenza promised Rosato three
		territories in the Bronx after he
		died, and then you took over and
		welched.

				PENTANGELI
		Clemenza promised them nothing, he
		hated the sonsuvbitches.

				MICHAEL
		They feel cheated.

				PENTANGELI
		Michael, you're sitting up here in
		the Sierra Mountains with champagne
		cocktails making judgment on the
		way I run my family.

				MICHAEL
			(suddenly in Sicilian)
		Your family still carries the name
		Corleone, and you will run it like
		a Corleone!

				PENTANGELI
			(Sicilian)
		And while I feed my family in New
		York, you put the knife in my back
		in Miami.

				MICHAEL
			(firm)
		Frankie, you're a good old man, and
		you've been loyal to my Father for
		years...so I hope you can explain
		what you mean.

				PENTANGELI
		The Rosatos are running crazy;
		taking hostages, spitting in my
		face, because they're backed by the
		Jew in Miami.

				MICHAEL
		I know.  That's why I want you to
		be fair with them.

				PENTANGELI
		How can you be fair with animals?
		They recruit niggers and spicks;
		they do violence in their own
		Grandmother's neighborhoods.  And
		everything is dope and whores; the
		gambling is left to last.  Let me
		run my family without you on my
		back.  I want them taken care of.

				MICHAEL
		No.  There are things that I have
		planned with Hyman Roth.  I don't
		want them disturbed.

				PENTANGELI
		You give your loyalty to a Jew over
		your own blood.

				MICHAEL
		Frankie, you know my father
		respected Roth, did business with
		him.

				PENTANGELI
		He did business...but he never
		trusted him.

Pentangeli takes his hat, and leaves.

				NERI
		Should he go?

				MICHAEL
		The old man had too much vino
		rosso, or he'd never talk openly
		that way.  Let him go back to New
		York; I've already made my plans.
			(he checks his watch)
		It's late; I've spent so little
		time at the party.

EXT. THE LAWNS AND TABLES - FULL VIEW - NIGHT

By now the sun has fallen and the lawns of the Corleone
estate are lit by moonlight.  Beautifully dressed couples
dance as the orchestra plays a foxtrot of the late fifties.

VIEW ON THE DANCE FLOOR

Deanna has been dancing with Fredo; she has gotten drunk and
it teasing her husband by flirting with other men on the
floor.

				DEANNA
		I wanta dance...whatsa matter with
		that?

				FREDO
		Dancing is alright; you're falling
		on the floor.

				DEANNA
		Whatsamatter, you don't want me to
		dance with him 'cause he's a man!

				FREDO
		Deanna, I'm going to belt you right
		in the mouth!

				DEANNA
		These Eye-ties are really crazy
		when it comes to their wives.

By now guests are starting to notice the disturbance;
Michael is with Kay, and some friends; Rocco catches his eye.

				DEANNA (O.S.)
		Jesus, never marry a WOP, they
		treat their wives like shit.

VIEW on Kay, listening, embarrassed by her flashy sister-in-
law.

VIEW ON FREDO AND DEANNA

Rocco passes by Fredo and whispers:

				ROCCO
		Freddie, Mike says take care of it,
		or I have to.

				DEANNA
		He's a friend of your brother!

Without another word, Rocco grabs firm hold of her and
whisks her out of the crowd.

				DEANNA
		"Shuffle off to Buffa...
		Shuffle off to Buffa...
		Shuffle off to Buffalooooo..."

Freddie mops his forehead, and moves to Michael.

				FREDO
		Hey Mike, what can I say?

				MICHAEL
		Forget it, just go take care of her.

EXT. THE HARBOR DECK - NIGHT

A large group of Tahoe teenagers join the Corleone youngsters

EXT. DANCE FLOOR AND PAVILION - MOVING TWO SHOT - NIGHT

Kay and Michael dancing in the moonlight.

				MICHAEL
		How's the baby?

				KAY
		Sleeping inside me.

				MICHAEL
		Does it feel like a boy?

				KAY
		Yes, Michael, it does.

				MICHAEL
		I'm sorry about some of the people
		I had to see today.  It was bad
		timing... but it couldn't be helped.

				KAY
		It made me think of what you told
		me once.  In five years, the
		Corleone family will be completely
		legitimate.  That was seven years
		ago.

He has no answer for her; except that he loves and values
her, and holds her tight, as they dance amid their guests,
all dressed elegantly for the social event of the season.

The VIEW LOOSENS to show the entire, night-lit party.

A single organ plays some standard wedding music.

The VIEW PANS up to the altar, where Connie and Merle, in
the same clothing they wore to the Tahoe party, are being
married by a Justice of the Peace.

The Justice goes through the bored, simple ceremony, and we
begin to HEAR an echo of the waltz Connie danced with her
father, when she was married all those years ago in Long
Island.

EXT. THE TROPICANA - LAS VEGAS - MED. VIEW - DAY

A dark car pulls up to the glitter of the neon facade.
Albert Neri, alone, leaves it to the parking valets, and
moves quickly through the automatic doors, into the main
casino.  We still hear the CORLEONE WALTZ.

INT. THE TROPICANA - DAY

Albert Neri enters the room; glances around a moment, and
then heads toward the crap table, where a short, middle-aged
man, KLINGMAN, stands by the pit boss.  Several security
guards of the casino, are at their posts.

				NERI
		Are you Klingman?

				KLINGMAN
		Who's asking?

				NERI
		Where can we talk?

				KLINGMAN
		Right here.

				NERI
		I represent the interests of the
		Corleone family.  We make the
		invitation to you to tie up your
		affairs and be out of the hotel by
		Monday morning.

				KLINGMAN
		Who do you think you're talking to?

				NERI
		You said you were Klingman.

				KLINGMAN
		You don't come in here, talk to an
		owner in Las Vegas like that.

				NERI
		You missed my point; you are no
		longer an owner.

				KLINGMAN
		Get out of my hotel.

Neri stands in front of him, smiling.

				KLINGMAN
		Boys, get him out of here.

Quickly, Neri moves toward Klingman, and slaps him hard
several times in the face, knocking off his glasses... Red-
faced, Klingman gets down on his knees to pick them up once,
again.  Glasses on, he looks to his guards.

WHAT HE SEES

They stand, motionless.

Humiliated, Klingman moves across the casino floor, past a

		Keep it going.

EXT. A STREET IN BUFFALO, NEW YORK - NIGHT

The neon lights that spell out "FRED'S PIZZERIA" go out;

INT. NEW YORK THEATRE - 1915 - NIGHT

VITO CORLEONE is a shy young man of 23, holding his hat in
his hand, being led down the crowded aisle of this Italian
Vaudeville theatre by an energetic and fulfilled GENCO
ABBANDANDO, his friend in America.  This entire sequence is
played in Sicilian.

				GENCO
		Come on, you've got to see her!

VIEW ON THE STAGE

A tattered melodrama is in progress in Neapolitan.  The sets
are two-dimensional, and flap whenever there's an entrance
or exit.

The hero, PEPPINO, is weeping as he sings about how he's
left his Mother in Italy, while he is in this new country,
America.

VIEW ON THE AUDIENCE

All poor, Italo-Americans.  Genco finds a few seats, and
leads Vito to them, stepping on a few shoes in the process.
They have barely come to their seats, when an excited Genco
nudges Vito, and points to the stage.  People shout that
they should sit down.

VIEW ON THE STAGE

There is a knock on the door, and a young girl enters,
delivering a letter to Peppino in his tenement in America.
The girl is pretty; and obviously the object of Genco's
affection.  The letter brings bad news.  Peppino's Mother is
dead.  He weeps, and sings the final song, which most of the
audience knows: SENZA MAMMA.

VIEW ON THE AUDIENCE

Genco is enthralled with the young actress.  The people in
the audience are singing along with Peppino.

VIEW ON THE STAGE

The actress, object of Genco's affection, makes a dramatic
exit.

VIEW ON THE AUDIENCE

Genco pulls on Vito's jacket, indicating that now that his
love is offstage, they should leave.  Vito rises with him,
and they make their way all the way down the aisle.

INT. BACKSTAGE THEATRE - MOVING VIEW - NIGHT

Genco hurrying down the backstage corridor, hoping to catch
a glimpse of the actress.  He is followed by Vito.  Suddenly,
Genco stops short.

GENCO'S VIEW

A heavy-set, fierce looking Italian wearing an expensive
light-colored suit and a cream colored fedora.  This is
FANUCCI.  He is discussing a business matter with the
theatre IMPRESARIO; a large, strong looking man, who is
sweating nonetheless.  He doesn't seem to be giving in to
Fanucci.  He holds a locked strongbox.

watching.  The two men argue in Italian.

MED. VIEW

The young ACTRESS crosses into the area, unaware of the
difficulties.  The impresario sees her, and frightened,
motions that she should keep away.

				IMPRESARIO
		Carla!

But Fanucci grabs her easily by her slender wrist, and with
lightning speed, produces a knife which he holds against her
cheek.  The impresario wrings his hands in agony.

				IMPRESARIO
			(Sicilian)
		No...please, not my daughter.

Whereupon he begins to unlock the box which holds the
receipts for the night's box-office.

VIEW ON GENCO AND VITO

hiding, watching.  At first, Genco is enraged, as though he
would rush up to help his enamorata.

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
		The Black Hand.

Then he backs away.  Vito looks at him shocked and
disappointed in this cowardly behavior.  Genco shakes his
head, and points, as though to say that where Fanucci is
concerned, there is nothing to be done.

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
			 (whispered)
		Let's get out of here.

VIEW ON FANUCCI

has released the girl.  Her father pulls her away from him,
and slaps her for no reason; then he pays Fanucci.

				FANUCCI
			(Sicilian)
		Because you protested, it will cost
		a hundred more.

EXT. NEW YORK ALLEY - NIGHT

Genco and Vito; Genco leans against the wall, breathlessly,
as though he's had a near escape.

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
		I know what you are thinking,
		Vitone, but you don't understand
		yet how things are.  Fanucci is of
		the Black Hand.  Everyone in the
		neighborhood pays him, even my
		father.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		He's an Italian?

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
		A pig of a Neaponitan.
			(spits)


				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		Why?  Why does he bother other
		Italians?

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
		Because he knows them; he knows
		they have no one to protect them.
		Vitone?  What do you think of my
		angel?

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		Beautiful.

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
		Beautiful.

				VITO
		For you, she is beautiful.  For me,
		there is only my wife!

				GENCO
		I know.  That's why I brought you
		with me!

Genco embraces his good friend, and they laughingly walk
down the alley.

The stage door opens, and Fanucci exits, a sinister figure
in white, moving down the alley just in front of them, into
the night.

The two friends hold their breath, until he disappears.

EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - MOVING VIEW - DAY

Vito moves through the street, carrying groceries that he is
to deliver.

It is cold, and so vendors are huddled around fires they
have lit in old cans and drums.

He turns up an alleyway, and then stops.

VIEW UP THE ALLEY

With great strength, Fanucci lifts one of them up into the
air and throws him down hard to the concrete; but another,
holding onto his back, manages to produce a switchblade
knife and awkwardly reaching around from behind the moving
man, slits Fanucci's throat from one side to the other.

Fanucci groans like some great hurt animal.  Blood pours
from the deep, smile-like slit in his throat.

He throws the young man off his back.

VIEW ON VITO

stepping back in the alley.

VIEW ON FANUCCI

He takes off his white fedora, and runs down the alley
toward Vito, catching the flowing blood in his hat.

The young attackers scurry off in various directions.

INT. ABBANDANDO GROCERY STORE - DAY

A tiny shop featuring imported food: trays of cured meats,
prosciutto, copagole, mortadella lies on the counter covered
with netting to keep away the thousands of flies.

Olive oil is sold in bulk, as well as wine, cheese and bacala.

Genco works here for his father, and is busy slicing paper
thin prosciutto for a customer, by hand.  Vito works in the
back as a stock clerk.

Finished with his customer, Genco moves to his friend.

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
		I bet you can't guess what happened?

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		What?

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
		Some guys from Ninth Avenue jumped
		Fanucci today; slit his throat from
		ear to ear.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		No, I didn't know.  Is he dead?

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
		Nah.  Those guys aren't murderers.
		They wanted to scare him, that's
		all.  Make him look bad.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		In Sicily, when you attack a man,
		you had better finish him.

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
		I wish they had.  He takes fifty
		dollars a week from my father's
		cash drawer.  But you can't kill a
		man like Fanucci.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		Why?

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
		Because he's what we say...
		"connected"... You wait, see what
		happens to those guys from Ninth
		Avenue.

A customer enters; and Genco moves away to serve him.

CLOSE VIEW ON VITO

recalling what he had seen and thought.

EXT. NEW YORK ALLEYWAY - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

A young man, one of those who had tried to kill Fanucci,
runs down an alleyway, breathlessly.  Then he stops, and
looks behind himself.  Whoever was following him is gone.
He turns and walks ahead.  Then the mammoth, white-suited
figure of Fanucci leaps down before him from the fire-escape.
He grins at the young man, and then raises his neck, showing
the gruesome wound that marks his throat.

He takes out his pistol and fires point-blank at his attacker.

INT. TINY TENEMENT - FULL VIEW - NIGHT

The very small, railroad type flat where Vito lives with his
new family.

It is late at night, and he is exhausted.

He returns home; where his young wife, CARMELLA, goes
through the silent ritual of preparing a simple meal for him.
He sits and eats quietly.

INT. TENEMENT ROOM - NIGHT

Vito and Carmella enter the darkened bedroom, and approach a
metal crib.  Vito reaches down and takes the small hand of
the baby between his thick peasant fingers.  Carmella waits
a respectful distance behind him.

INT. ABBANDANDO GROCERY - DAY

The shop bell RINGS; SINGER ABBANDANDO turns to see a
smiling Fanucci tipping his hat, like an old customer.

				FANUCCI
		Buon giorno.

Immediately, Vito turns back to his work, and Signor
Abbandando moves to Fanucci with a sigh.

Vito notices the two men talking quietly at one side of the
store, while he goes about his work.  Genco works his way
closer to his friend.

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
		What did I tell you.  The one who
		cut him was found in an alley.  And
		the family of the others paid
		Fanucci all their savings to make
		him forswear his vengeance.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
			 (surprised)
		And he agreed?

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
		He took the money.  Now he wants
		double from everybody in the
		neighborhood, including Papa.

Vito watches the heated, but inevitable transaction.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
			 (almost to himself)
		A real mafioso doesn't sell his
		vengeance.

MED. VIEW

Signor Abbandando seems to be arguing with Fanucci, and
every so often they turn and relate to where Vito is working.
Then Fanucci leaves, the little bell RINGING; and Signor
Abbandando reluctantly moves to Vito.

				SIG. ABBANDANDO
			(Sicilian)
		Vitone.  How is your son?

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		We are all well.

It is clear that he has something difficult to tell the
young man.

				SIG. ABBANDANDO
		Vitone...I...Fanucci has a nephew.

Vito looks at him a while, as the old man struggles to tell
him.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		And you must give him my job.

The old man nods, regretfully.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		You have been kind to me since I
		was a boy; taken care of me, and
		been as a father.  I will always be
		grateful to you.  Thank you.

Vito takes off his apron, and leaves, passing the youth who
loiters by the counter.

EXT. THE STREET - DAY

making his way from the store.

				SIG. ABBANDANDO
			(Sicilian o.s.)
		Vitone!

He turns, and Abbandando has followed him out of the shop,
holding a basket of some groceries.

				SIG. ABBANDANDO
		Here...for your family.

				VITO
		No...please understand...I cannot
		accept.

INT. VITO'S TENEMENT - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

Vito and his wife sit quietly at the table; the two are
quiet and sad.

Suddenly, we HEAR a noise, and Vito is astonished to see a
young man, PETER CLEMENZA, leaning out of the window on the
other side of the air shaft which separates their apartments.

				CLEMENZA
		Hey Paisan!  Hold this for me until
		I ask for it.  Hurry up!

Automatically Vito reaches over to the empty space at the
air shaft, and takes the bundle of rags.  Clemenza's round
face is strained and urgent, obviously in some kind of
trouble.  Suddenly, he closes the window and there is
activity that we cannot see in the other apartment.

Vito looks to his wife, and then closes the window and
window dressing and takes the bundle into a private part of
his kitchen and begins to unwrap it.

WHAT HE SEES:

Five oily guns.  He immediately wraps them again, and
carries them to a private closet, and hides it, and returns
to his wife.  He sits down back at the table; and she knows
not to ask him what has happened.

EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - DAY

Vito is walking through the crowded streets with a group of
workmen; they all wear work clothes, and paper hats on their
heads.

Vito looks to his left, and realizes that Clemenza is
walking silently with him; by contrast, Clemenza dresses well.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
			 (casually)
		Do you have my goods still?

Vito nods.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		Did you look inside?

Vito, his face impassive, shakes his head 'no.'

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		I'm not interested in things that
		don't concern me.

INT. DOWNTOWN ITALIAN SOCIAL CLUB - DAY

Vito and Clemenza drinking wine; they've become friends.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		I have a friend who has a fine rug.
		Maybe your wife would like it.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		We have no money for a rug.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		No.  He would give it away.  I know
		how to repay a consideration.

Vito thinks, then nods.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		She would like it.

INT. HALLWAY WEALTHY APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

The two men proceed up the hallway; Vito is impressed with
the opulence.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		Your friend lives in a fine building.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		Oh yes, the very best.

Clemenza knocks on the door as though he is well known here;
then rings.  No answer.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		Ah, he's not at home.  Oh, well, he
		wouldn't mind.

Quickly and expertly he takes out a tool and pries open the
door.

INT. WEALTHY APARTMENT - FULL VIEW - DAY

Vito looks in awe at the luxurious apartment, which features
a fabulous rich red wool rug.

Clemenza immediately moves some of the furniture away, and
drops to the floor.

				CLEMENZA
		A little help.

Vito joins him, and the two begin rolling the rug.  We HEAR
a BUZZER RING.  Clemenza immediately drops his side of the
roll, and moves to the window.  He pulls a gun from his
jacket.

VIEW ON Vito watching.  He moves so he can see out the window.

THEIR VIEW

A Policeman stands at the exterior door, waiting.  He rings
the buzzer again.

VIEW ON CLEMENZA

cocking his gun.  Vito realizes that if the Policeman should
pursue it any further he is a dead man.  The Policeman gives
up and leaves.

Clemenza puts away his gun.

INT. VITO'S TENEMENT HALLWAY - DAY

The two men run up the steps, laughing, carrying the fine rug.

INT. VITO'S TENEMENT - DAY

They are on their knees cutting the rug to fit the small

EXT. DOWNTOWN WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

Clemenza knocks on the steel door of this downtown building.
Vito waits with him, holding some packages; and another
youth, TESSIO, tall and thin and deadly waits with them.

The door is lifted, and they are greeted by a bright,
middle-aged Italian named AUGUSTINO who leads them into a
machine shop.

INT. MACHINE SHOP - NIGHT

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		Good, you waited for us.

Clemenza looks up on a higher level.

HIS VIEW

There is a nine year old boy, operating a drill press.

MED. VIEW

				TESSIO

		Who is he?

				AUGUSTINO
			(Sicilian)
		My son, Carmine...it's all right.

The men then quickly open the packages they've brought;
revealing gun, including a more sophisticated machine weapon.

Augustino takes them and expertly begins to clean and
prepare them.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
			 (to Vito)
		Paisan Augustino was a gunsmith in
		the Italian army.  We do each other
		favors.

				AUGUSTINO
			(Sicilian)
			 (while he works)
		My boy is studying the flute.  He
		plays very well.  He helps me at
		night so we can buy him a silver
		flute someday.  Now he has one made
		of wood.  Carmine...play...play for
		my friends.

wide-eyed... he shuts off the press; and takes out a shabby
wooden flute.  And begins to play a simple and pure melody.

EXT. WAREHOUSE AREA - NIGHT

Tessio and Clemenza quickly load racks of cheap dresses.

Vito sits behind the wheel of the truck.  He seems reserved,
and we get the impression that he is studying every move his
two friends are making.

INT. TENEMENT STAIRS - DAY

Clemenza runs up a flight of stairs with an armful of
dresses.  He knocks on a door, and a pretty HOUSEWIFE answers.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		Lady, I got a bargain on these
		dresses.  Five dollars each.  You
		gotta pay at least fifteen, maybe
		twenty in a store.  Look at them,
		first class.

He holds the dresses up and the woman seems interested.  She
handles a couple of them and stands aside so Clemenza can
enter her apartment.

				WOMAN
			(Sicilian)
		I don't know which one I like best.

She holds the dresses against her body, Clemenza approving
of each one; and then she goes to her purse and takes out
five singles and gives them to him.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		You'd look beautiful in all of
		these.  You should buy at least two.

				WOMAN
			(Sicilian)
		Are you kidding?  My husband will
		kill me if he knows I paid five
		dollars for one dress.

She holds one up, then another.  She is torn.  Clemenza
shakes his head and straightens the dress on her body.  His
hand brushes her arm; she looks at him smiling.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		You can have two for five.

She smiles back.

EXT. TENEMENT BUILDING - DAY

Clemenza jumps down the stairs, and out to the middle of the
street, where Vito and Tessio are waiting in the car with
some of the stock.

				TESSIO
			(Sicilian)
		What took so long?

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		She couldn't decide.

Tessio and Clemenza each take more armsful of dresses and
divide the neighborhood.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		Vito, take the rest of the stock
		over to Dandine's warehouse; he'll
		move it to a wholesaler.

The three part.  Vito drives the truck off.

MOVING VIEW

Vito drives the truck through the downtown streets; he turns
a corner and stops for a light.

Suddenly, to his left, he sees the formidable figure of
Fanucci.

He grabs young Corleone by the shoulder.

CLOSE VIEW ON FANUCCI

frightening, revealing the large circular scar, now healed.

				FANUCCI
			(Sicilian)
		Ahhh, young fellow.  People tell me
		you're rich, you and your two
		friends.  Yet, you don't show
		enough respect to send a few
		dresses to my home.  You know I
		have three daughters.

Vito says nothing.  Fanucci thumbs through the stock.

				FANUCCI
			(Sicilian)
		This is my neighborhood.  You and
		your friends have to show me a
		little respect, ah?  This truck you
		hijacked was in my neighborhood.
		You should let me wet my beak a
		little.

Fanucci takes a few of the dresses.

				FANUCCI
			(Sicilian)
		I understand each of you cleared
		around six hundred dollars.  I
		expect two hundred dollars for my
		protection and I'll forget the
		insult.  After all, young people
		don't know the courtesies due a man
		like myself.

Vito smiles at him and nods.

				FANUCCI
			(Sicilian)
		Otherwise the police will come to
		see you and your wife and children
		will be dishonored and destitute.
		Of course, if my information as to
		your gains is incorrect, I'll dip
		my beak just a little.  Just a
		little, but no less than one
		hundred dollars, and don't try to
		deceive me, eh paisan?

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
			 (quietly)
		My two friends have my share of the
		money.  I'll have to speak to them
		after we deliver these to the
		wholesaler.

				FANUCCI
			(Sicilian)
		You tell your friends I expect them
		to let me wet my beak in the same
		manner.  Don't be afraid to tell
		them.  Clemenza and I know each
		other well, he understands these
		things.  Let yourself be guided by
		him.  He has more experience in
		these matters.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
			 (shrugging innocently)
		You must understand, this is all
		new to me...

				FANUCCI
			(Sicilian)
		I understand...

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		But thank you for speaking to me as
		a Godfather.

				FANUCCI
			(Sicilian)
			 (impressed)
		You're a good fellow.

He takes Vito's hands and clasps them in his own.

				FANUCCI
			(Sicilian)
		You have respect.  A fine thing in
		the young.  Next time, speak to me
		first, eh?  Perhaps I can help you
		make your plans.

Fanucci turns with the dresses draped over his arms, waving
to Vito.

Vito throws the truck in gear, and drives off.

CLOSE VIEW ON VITO

We know that throughout this encounter he has seethed with
an icy rage.

INT. VITO'S APARTMENT - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

He wife serves a dinner for her husband and his two friends.
They discuss Fanucci as they eat.

				TESSIO
			(Sicilian)
		Do you think he'd be satisfied with
		the two hundred dollars?  I think
		he would.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		That scar-faced bastard will find
		out what we got from the wholesaler.
		He won't take a dime less than
		three hundred dollars.

				TESSIO
			(Sicilian)
		What if we don't pay?

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
			 (gestures, it's hopeless)
		You know his friends...real animals.
		And his connections with the police.
		Sure he'd like us to tell him our
		plans so he can set us up for the
		cops and earn their gratitude.
		Then they would owe him a favor;
		that's how he operates.  We'll have
		to pay.  Three hundred, are we
		agreed?

				TESSIO
			(Sicilian)
		What can we do?

Clemenza doesn't even bother checking for Vito's opinion.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		They say Fanucci has a license from
		Maranzalla himself to work this
		neighborhood.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		If you like, why not give me fifty
		dollars each to pay Fanucci.  I
		guarantee he will accept that
		amount from me.

				TESSIO
			(Sicilian)
		When Fanucci says two hundred he
		means two hundred.  You can't talk
		with him.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		I'll reason with him.  Leave
		everything in my hands.  I'll
		settle this problem to your
		satisfaction.

Tessio and Clemenza regard him suspiciously.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		I never lie to people I've accepted
		as my friends.  Speak to Fanucci
		yourself tomorrow.  Let him ask you
		for the money, but don't pay it,
		and don't in any way quarrel with
		him.  Tell him you have to get the
		money and will send me as your
		messenger.  Let him understand that
		you're willing to pay what he asks,
		don't bargain.  I'll go to his
		house, and quarrel with him.  He
		likes me; enjoys explaining how
		things are here.  He uses ten
		sentences when he only needs one,
		so while he talks, I'll kill him.

Clemenza, irritated, makes a large belch, and washes his
food down with wine.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		Vitone!
			(to Tessio)
		Our driver has drunk too much wine.

				TESSIO
			(Sicilian)
			 (laughs at himself)
		He's going to kill Fanucci.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
			 (stern)
		Then, after that, what?  Joe
		'Little Knife' Pisani; Willie
		Bufalino, maybe, Mr. Maranzalla
		himself, c'mon!

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		Fanucci is not connected; he is
		alone.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
			 (sarcastically)
		What?  You read it in the papers?

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		This man informs to the police;
		this man allows his vengeance to be
		bought off... No, he is alone.

				TESSIO
			(Sicilian)
		If you're wrong...

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		If I'm wrong, they will kill me.

Both Clemenza and Tessio are impressed with their young
friend; his willingness to risk his life on his perception
of the situation.

EXT. NEW YORK STREET - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

A ten piece Italian street band plays in front of the church
to commemorate the first night of the Festa di San Gennaro.
People swarm in crowds, delighted by the music, as out of
the church four men carry the statue of San Gennaro down to
the street.

MOVING VIEW

Clemenza moves along the booths that have been set up along
the street: sausage cooking on an open fire; pork livers and
sweetbeards.  He stops for a sandwich, and makes an irritated
gesture when the vendor expects to be paid.  He crosses to a
church-sponsored booth with a great Wheel of Fortune, and
slaps a dollar on a number.  Standing next to him is Vito;
they embrace.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
			 (quietly)
		All three daughters are at church;
		he is alone.  It's important that
		you let his neighbors see you leave.
		Tessio has broken the latch on the
		skylight of his building.

The wheel stops; they both lose.

				CLEMENZA
			(English)
		See, Brother Carmello, even the
		church makes numbers.

				PRIEST
			(English)
		It's only the way we collect that's

Vito has left while Clemenza jokes with the Priest.

EXT. FESTA STREET - NIGHT

Vito passes the booths of food, crossing toward a small and
dark club.

INT. SOCIAL CLUB - NIGHT

We can still HEAR the crowds and music of the festa.  Vito
enters; the club is empty, except for the large white figure
sitting alone at a small table.  Fanucci barely acknowledges
Vito as he joins him.

Without a word, Vito counts out two hundred dollars on the
table.  Fanucci looks, then takes off his fedora and puts it
on the table over the money.

				FANUCCI
			(Sicilian)
		I think there's only two hundred
		dollars under my hat.
			(he peeks)
		I'm right.  Only two hundred dollars.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		I'm a little short.  I've been out
		of work.  Let me owe you the money
		for a few weeks.

				FANUCCI
			(Sicilian)
		Ah, you're a sharp young fellow.
		How is it I've never noticed you
		before
			(he takes the two
			hundred and pours
			some wine for Vito)
		You're too quiet for your own
		interest.  I could find some work
		for you to do that would be very
		profitable.
			(he rises)
		No hard feelings, eh?  If I can
		ever do you a service let me know.
		You've done a good job for yourself
		tonight.

EXT. FESTA STREET - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

By now the musicians have left, but still families are
walking the street, and stopping at the booths.

Fanucci stands there a moment; he is known by everyone, and
considers himself highly loved.

Then Fanucci begins the walk through the festa, on his way
home.

EXT. ROOFTOPS - MOVING VIEW - NIGHT

Vito silently moves along the rooftop; paralleling Fanucci's
walk.

We HEAR the sounds of the festa, and every so often catch a
glimpse of the patterned lights, and the crowds below.

walking through the crowded streets.  The statue of San
Gennaro is arranged in some midnight religious ceremony.

Vito makes the leap that separates two buildings; then
crosses toward the large skylight in the center of the
building.

EXT. THE STREETS - NIGHT

The procession in the streets is preceded by ten altar boys;
and the glittering Monstrance, something of an altar carried
out into the streets.

The priest begins this nocturnal service, as the crowds in
the street kneel down in prayer.

INT. FANUCCI'S BUILDING - NIGHT

Fanucci unlocks the door to his building; we can HEAR the
services in the background.

EXT. THE ROOFTOP - NIGHT

Vito tries the trap door on the roof; it is stuck firmly
shut; despite Clemenza's instructions.  He struggles with
it, but no luck.

From the distance, the Choir begins to Latin.  Vito moves
around the skylight, to an identical trap, tries this one;
it opens.

Vito reaches down into the trap, and pulls out the newly

the building.

INT. FANUCCI'S HALLWAY - DOWN ANGLE - NIGHT

Fanucci proceeds up the staircase with loud, heavy steps.
An OLD WOMAN on one of the flights sees him, and immediately
moves to her apartment.

				FANUCCI
			(Sicilian)
		What's the matter, Signora?  You
		don't say 'good evening'?

				WOMAN
			(Sicilian)
		'Good evening,' Signor Fanucci.

She quickly disappears behind her door.  Fanucci laughs,
continues up, singing to himself.  The MASS outside is
always in evidence.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Vito climbs down from the attic, and finds Fanucci's rear
door open.  He slips in, and makes his way past the open
windows, out of which pour the music and chanting of the
Mass.  Slowly and quietly he pulls them down, shut.

He moves quietly to a glass door, and peeks out.

WHAT HE SEES:

Three young women, Fanucci's DAUGHTERS, laughing and talking.

VIEW ON VITO

A slip up.  Tessio had said they were out.  He steps outside
to the alley where he can look into the apartment.

ANOTHER VIEW

Fanucci opens the door of his apartment, and enters.

CLOSE VIEW ON VITO

He begins to wrap the gun.

VIEW ON THE DAUGHTERS

Their father greets them with a kiss; and a little religious
gift he has bought for each.

CLOSE ON THE GUN

wrapped in this primitive method of a silencer.  The VIEW
TILTS to Vito, caught in the dilemma of having to kill all
or none of them.  Then something catches his eye.

WHAT HE SEES:

A small gray alley cat is attracted to the young man, comes
up to him and rubs itself against him.  Vito rubs the
animal, speaking softly in Sicilian, then, gaining its
confidence, lifts it up and carefully lets it into Fanucci's
apartment.

He steps back, holding the gun.  We HEAR some Italian
shouted in the house; a loud sound from the cat, and some of
the thumping footsteps of Fanucci.

VIEW ON VITO

holding the wrapped gun, waiting.

WHAT HE SEES:

The white blob of Fanucci opening the door and cursing in
Italian as he throws the cat out.

VIEW ON VITO

squeezing the trigger; the muffled, but still LOUD BLAST
resounding in the building.

VIEW ON FANUCCI

He holds onto the door frame, trying to stand erect, trying
to reach for his gun.  The force of his struggle has torn
the buttons off his jacket and made it swing loose.  His gun
is exposed but so is a spidery vein on the white shirtfront
of his stomach.  Carefully, as if plunging a needle into
this vein, Vito Corleone fires a second bullet.

Fanucci falls to his knees, propping the door open, giving a
terrible groan.  We begin to hear the VOICES of girls inside
the apartment.

Vito quickly opens his wallet, removes the two hundred,
quickly fires one last bullet into Fanucci's sweaty cheek.
Now the towel the gun was wrapped with catches fire,
literally on Vito's hand; quickly he throws it to the
ground, stamps it out...and disappears upward.

EXT. THE ROOFTOPS - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

Vito moves like a cat along the rooftops; we HEAR the
conclusion of the Mass down below.

CLOSE ON VITO

Pausing; we can SEE the great spectacle of lights and
candles on the streets below.

He empties the gun of bullets and smashes the barrel against
the side of the roof ledge.  He reverses it in his hand, and
breaks the butt into two separate halves against the chimney.
He smashes it again, and the pistol breaks into barrel and
handle, two separate pieces.

He then moves along the rooftop, dropping the two separate
fragments into various air shafts.

EXT. THE STREET PROCESSION - MOVING VIEW - NIGHT

The Priest, having completed the ceremony, follows as the
Monstrance is carried off through the streets, as the Choir
sings.

EXT. THE ROOFTOPS - MOVING VIEW - NIGHT

Vito is a dark figure, moving with agility across the
rooftops.

INT. FANUCCI'S VESTIBULE - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

The corpse that was Fanucci, stained with blood.

EXT. PROCESSION - CLOSE VIEW - NIGHT

The statue of San Gennaro, followed by the altar boys.

EXT. CORLEONE TENEMENT - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

Vito's wife; her baby and several friends and neighbors sit
happily on the front stoop of their tenement.  Some of the
men drink wine poured out of a pitcher; we can still HEAR
the music and night sounds of the Festa.

A neighbor is singing a Neapolitan song.

Quietly, without a word, and with only a momentary glance
from his wife, Vito joins the little group; takes a glass of
wine, and listens to the song.

CLOSE VIEW ON VITO

listening to the song.  He reaches out and takes the small
hand of his son.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		Santino, your papa loves you.

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT. ANTHONY'S TAHOE ROOM - NIGHT

The room is large, lit from the outside by a bright evening.
We can see the outline of many toys on the shelves built
along the wall.  We see the dark figure of Michael Corleone
enter the room and approach the bed where his son Anthony
lies curled in messy blankets.  Michael quietly arranges his
small hands and feet and covers the little boy.  Suddenly,
Anthony turns, his eyes open.  He is staring, perfectly
awake, at his father.

				MICHAEL
		Can't you sleep?

No answer.

				MICHAEL
		Are you alright?

				ANTHONY
		Yes.

				MICHAEL
		Did you like your party?

				ANTHONY
		I got lots of presents.

				MICHAEL
		Do you like them?

				ANTHONY
		I didn't know the people who gave
		them to me.

				MICHAEL
		They were friends.

He kisses his boy, and then turns.

				ANTHONY
		Did you see my present for you?

				MICHAEL
		No, where is it?

				ANTHONY
		On your pillow.

				MICHAEL
		I'm leaving very early tomorrow,
		before you wake up.

				ANTHONY
		I know.  How long will you be gone?

				MICHAEL
		Just a few days.

				ANTHONY
		Will you take me?

				MICHAEL
		I can't.

				ANTHONY
		Why do you have to go?

				MICHAEL
		To do business.

				ANTHONY
		I can help you.

				MICHAEL
		Some day you will.

Michael kisses him again.

INT. MICHAEL-KAY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

The room is lit from a small night lamp on Michael's side of
the large bed.

Kay is huddled in blankets, asleep.  Michael closes the door
to his room, moves to his side of the bed, and glances down
to the pillow.

VIEW ON THE PILLOW

is a child's drawing of a long limousine, with a man in a
hat sitting in the back seat.

An arrow pointing to him is marked "DAD." Under it, a nine
year old's handwriting says: "Do you like it?  Check YES __
I liked it or NO __ I didn't like it." Michael turns,
looking for a pencil, and moves to the dresser, where he
places a check next to "YES."

He starts to cross back toward his side of the bed, when Kay
turns, almost in her sleep:

				KAY
		Michael?  Why are the drapes open?

His eyes dart back to the curved, beautifully leaded windows
of the room.  The DRAPES are opened.  Then, without a
second's hesitation, he leaps to the floor, still holding
his son's drawing, as a spray of machine gun bullets sweep
across the windows; glass shattering all over the room.

Kay screams out; rising, still half-asleep.  Michael crawls
toward her, and pulls her down to the floor to him.

Then, for a moment, there is silence, soon filled by the
shouts of men; as flashes of light sweep by the window, as
guards with flashlights come running.

Michael holds Kay to him, knowing they have both survived,
and then gently:

				MICHAEL
		Go with the kids.

EXT. THE TAHOE ESTATE - NIGHT

Suddenly, the great floodlights are turned on, bathing lawns
in an intense blue light.

Groups of ordinarily dressed security men drawn in from all
directions; a state of confusion prevails.  There is no sign
of the attackers.

VIEW BY MICHAEL'S HOUSE

Michael is joined by Rocco Lampone, his gun drawn.

				ROCCO
		They're still on the property.
		Maybe you better stay inside.

				MICHAEL
		Keep them alive.

Six men take up posts by Michael's house.

				ROCCO
		We'll try.

				MICHAEL
		It's important.

He returns inside.

EXT. MAIN GATE AND KENNELS - NIGHT

The character of the summer estate has changed: bright
floodlights illuminate the main points of entry: the main
gate; the waterway; the stone wall that encompasses the
estate on all sides.

Several men with flashlights reinforce the guard at the main
gate.

FULL VIEW

Off in the distance, we see another group of men with
flashlights combing the waterline.  We hear indistinguishable
shouts.

VIEW ON THE KENNELS

The wire gates are opened, and the trained dogs go out
yelping into the outer edge of the estate.

ROOFTOP

One of Rocco's men turns the large floodlight scanning
darkened forest areas, where men could hide.

MOVING VIEW

Men with flashlights and dogs.  Moving through the dark areas.

LOOSE VIEW

A small Corleone launch, with a bright spotlight slowly
cruises the boundaries of the estate.  We SEE the silhouette
of men with guns, quietly waiting and watching.

EXT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Some of the bodyguards by the shattered windows of Michael's
bedroom.

The curtains are drawn from inside.

INT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Kay, the children, and some women servants have come down
from the various rooms into the central living area, that
can be most easily secured.  The little girl is still
asleep; they make you think of an immigrant family, with
their blankets and frightened faces, all waiting in a
central room.

Michael goes up to Kay, squeezes her hand, and whispers:

				MICHAEL
		It will be all right.  We were lucky.

She says nothing; but her face expresses the anger she feels
over the jeopardy Michael has placed his children in.  She
holds her young daughter in her arms.

The door opens, and Rocco enters.  He quickly realizes he is
holding his gun in plain view in front of the family, and
puts it away.  Michael moves to him, and they talk a distance
away from Kay.

				ROCCO
		Your family all seem to be okay in
		the other houses; your Mother's
		still sleeping.

				MICHAEL
		And?

				ROCCO
		No sign of them yet; but they're
		still on the Estate.

We HEAR loud shouting from outside.

				DEANNA (O.S.)
		Goddamn you!  You're all nuts here,
		I'm not goin' to calm down...

MICHAEL'S VIEW

Through the door, that Rocco opens.

Deanna, in her nightgown, has been frightened by the
gunshots; while Fredo in his bathrobe, tries to get her back
into the house.

				FREDO
		Deanna, will you get back into the
		house!

				DEANNA
		I'm getting out of here I said;
		these guys all have guns!

				MICHAEL
		Fredo, can't you shut that woman up!
			(to Rocco's men)
		Get her in here!

The bodyguards, gracefully help Fredo bring the hysterical
Deanna into the safety of the house.

				DEANNA
			(whimpering)
		I don't want to stay here...

				FREDO
		Mike, what can I do, she's a
		hysterical woman...

				KAY
		Leave her alone!  You're talking as
		though she has no right to be
		frightened when there are machine
		guns going off in her backyard.

				MICHAEL
			(to Rocco)
		Have Tom Hagen meet me in the
		Harbor House.

EXT. TAHOE ESTATE - HIGH ANGLE - NIGHT

Michael walks the short distance from his house, to the
boathouse where he conducts his business away from his family.

A small group of bodyguards, carrying machine guns, make the
walk with him from all sides, a respectful distance away.
It gives the appearance of a lonely President moving in his
compound, followed by teams of Secret Service men.

The boathouse is already secured by teams of men, hastily
wakened from their lodge house; a barracks-like structure
where reinforcements are lodged just for this kind of
emergency.

FULL VIEW

In the distance, we can see the teams of men and dogs, with
their lights, guns and shouts, combing every inch of the
estate.

INT. THE BOATHOUSE - EMPTY VIEW - NIGHT

Michael alone in the great room.  He moves to a walk-in
safe, quickly runs through the combination, and opens it.
He takes out an envelope, and puts it into his pocket;
there's a KNOCK on the door, and Hagen enters.  He had been
asleep, and has quickly thrown on a robe.

				MICHAEL
		Sit down, Tom.

EXT. TAHOE BOATHOUSE - NIGHT

From outside the leaded windows, a disoriented Hagen sits
down; Michael starts to talk to him; obviously about
something very serious.

The patrol securing the boathouse, walk past the window.
Michael says something to Tom, who rises, and pulls the
drapes, obscuring OUR VIEW.

INT. TAHOE BOATHOUSE - NIGHT

Michael talks intimately to Tom.

				MICHAEL
		There's a lot I can't tell you, Tom.
		I know that's upset you in the
		past; and you've felt that it was
		because of some lack of trust or
		confidence.  But it is because I do
		trust you that I've kept so much
		secret from you.  It's precisely
		that at this moment, you are the
		only one that I can completely
		trust.  In time, you'll understand
		everything.

				HAGEN
			(nods with this statement)
		But your people... Neri... Rocco;
		you don't think...

				MICHAEL
		No, I have confidence in their
		loyalty... but this is life and
		death, and Tom, you are my brother.

Hagen in very moved.

				HAGEN
		Mikey, I hoped...

				MICHAEL
		No Tom, just listen.  All my people
		are businessmen; their loyalty is
		based on that.  One thing I learned
		from my father is to try to think
		as the people around you think...and
		on that basis, anything is possible.
		Fredo has a good heart, but he is
		weak...and stupid, and stupid
		people are the most dangerous of
		all.  I've kept you out of things,
		Tom, because I've always known that
		your instincts were legitimate, and
		I wanted you to know very little of
		things that would make you an
		accomplice, for your own protection.
		I never blamed you for the setbacks
		the family took under Sonny; I know
		you were in a position of limited
		power, and you did your best to
		advise and caution him.  What I am
		saying is that now, for how long I
		do not know, you will be the Don.
		If what I think has happened is
		true; I will leave tonight, and
		absolutely no one will know how to
		contact me.  And even you are not
		to try to reach me unless it is
		absolutely necessary.  I give you
		complete power: over Neri... Fredo,
		everyone.  I am trusting you with
		the lives of my wife and children,
		and the future of this family,
		solely resting on your judgment and
		talent.

VIEW ON HAGEN

A man who has steadily declined over the last five years,
realizing that total power and responsibility is being
placed on him.

				MICHAEL
			(continuing)
		...But Tom, you must know that I do
		this only because I believe you are
		the only one who is capable of
		taking over for me.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

taking out the envelope.

				MICHAEL
		I've prepared this; have had it for
		over a month.  It won't explain
		everything; but indicates where I
		will be, so in a sense, it is my
		life.
			(he hands the envelope
			to Hagen)
		Also, there are three tasks that
		must be executed immediately.  Pop
		would have given those to Luca --
		You knew Pop as well as anyone, act
		as though you were him.  It
		discusses Kay as well; that will be
		the most difficult.  The men who
		tried to kill me tonight, will
		never leave the estate.

				HAGEN
		Will we...be able to get who
		ordered it out of them?

				MICHAEL
		I don't think so.  Unless I'm very
		wrong...they're already dead.
		Killed by someone inside...very
		frightened that they botched it.
		That's why I am going to disappear
		in a few minutes, and leave
		everything to you.

				HAGEN
		But if you're wrong...

				MICHAEL
		If I'm wrong...

There is a KNOCK on the door.

				MICHAEL
		...I don't think I'm wrong.
			(he indicates the knock)
		Yes.

The door opens; it is Rocco; Michael rises, after making a
knowing glance toward Tom, and moves to talk quietly to a
frightened and agitated Rocco.

EXT. STONE WALL AND STREAM - MOVING VIEW - NIGHT

A group of men with flashlights and guns lead Michael, Tom
and Rocco to the stone bridge spanning the stream which runs
through the estate.

LOW CLOSE VIEW

Michael's dispassionate face, looking down.  THE VIEW MOVES
to Hagen's, and then down to the murky water under the
bridge, where we see the bodies of three strangers, lying in
the moving water; machine-type guns nearby, with their
throats cut.  Light from the many flashlights illuminates
the grotesque scene.

				MICHAEL (O.S.)
		Fish them out.

Several of the men wade down into the stream; Rocco helps,
and even Tom steps down to get a better look at who they
were.  They are total strangers; Rocco examines the type of
guns they used.

When they climb back onto the ground, Michael is gone.
Everyone notices it, but no one says anything.

Hagen stands there, holding the envelope Michael had given
him in his hand.

He realizes that now, he is the DON.

				HAGEN
		Get rid of the bodies.  Tomorrow
		morning I want a report made to the
		local police, and paper, that some
		explosives we keep on the property
		were accidentally ignited.

The men respond; Hagen makes the lonely walk back to the
lighted section of the compound, which now resembles a
prison camp.

							FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. STATE SENATE FLOOR - DAY

The Senate is in session; Senator Geary is on the floor
during a vote.  An aide approaches him, with a slip of paper.

INT. GEARY'S OFFICE - DAY

The Senator steps behind his desk.

				SENATOR GEARY
		All right, Mr. Hagen, you've got
		ten minutes.

He flicks the switch of a small tape recorder.

				SENATOR GEARY
		...and the tape will be running.

				HAGEN
		Actually, I've come with good news;
		the Corleone family has done you a
		favor.

The Senator immediately shuts the tape recorder off.

				SENATOR GEARY
		What the hell are you talking about?

				HAGEN
		We know you're a busy man, with
		plenty of enemies -- we saw the
		opportunity to do you a favor, and
		we did.  No strings.

				SENATOR GEARY
		No strings.

				HAGEN
		You know there's a Senate
		Investigating Committee recently
		set up; we thought it would be
		unfortunate if they were to trace
		anything though-provoking to your
		name.

				SENATOR GEARY
		No one can trace anything to me; I
		pride myself on that.

				HAGEN
		Do you gamble?

				SENATOR GEARY
		A little; what's so thought-
		provoking about that?

				HAGEN
		Do you owe markers?

				SENATOR GEARY
		Maybe two, three thousand dollars.

Hagen leans forward, and deposits a handful of paper on the
Senator's desk.

				HAGEN
		The Corleone family has paid them
		off for you...as an expression of
		our esteem.

Geary quickly looks through the paid markers.

				SENATOR GEARY
		There's thirty grand worth of paid
		off markers -- I never owed that
		much.

				HAGEN
		Our mistake.  But what does it
		matter; it was our money.
			(rising)
		We don't even expect thanks.

				SENATOR GEARY
		You paid off thirty grand I never
		owed.

				HAGEN
		We'll keep it quiet; the people who
		know are trustworthy...the Committee
		needn't find out.

				SENATOR GEARY
		And what's the price of their not
		finding out.

				HAGEN
		Simple.  Be friendly like us.  Not
		hostile.

				SENATOR GEARY
			(he despises Hagen)
		Thanks...friend.

EXT. TAHOE ESTATE - FULL VIEW - DAY

There are more men on duty than usual; not that there are
guns apparent, but it's clear that the boundaries are being
patrolled.

VIEW BY MICHAEL'S HOUSE

Kay exits her house, followed by her children; she helps
them into her station wagon like any housewife, and drives
along the path leading to the main gate.

She's about to drive through, when one of the men steps in
front of her, raising his hand.

				KAY
			(graciously)
		Yes.

				MAN
		I'm sorry, Mrs. Corleone.  We're
		not to let you through.

				KAY
			(disbelieving)
		I'm going to the market.

				MAN
		If you could just give us a list,
		we'll pick up anything you want.

				KAY
		Whose orders are these?

				MAN
		Mr. Hagen's, ma'am.

We notice Hagen walking to them in the background.

				HAGEN
		Kay.

VIEW THROUGH THE GATE

Hagen approaches the car; Kay gets out so they can talk away
from the children.

				HAGEN
		I wanted to explain this myself...
		I had business in Carson City.

He walks with her a little way from the others; the children
run out of the station wagon, and start to play.

				HAGEN
		It's Michael's request...for your
		safety.  We can send out for
		anything you need.

				KAY
		I'm supposed to stay in my house.

				HAGEN
		Within the compound will be fine.

				KAY
		I was supposed to take the children
		to New England next week.

				HAGEN
		That's off now.

				KAY
		I'm going to see my parents.

				HAGEN
		Kay, Michael didn't tell me a lot;
		and what he did tell me, I can't
		repeat.  But the responsibility for
		you and the kids was the most
		important thing he left me with.

				KAY
		How long does this go on?

				HAGEN
		I don't know.
			(pause)
		I'm sorry, Kay...

				KAY
		Am I a prisoner?

				HAGEN
		That's not the way we look at it.

Angrily, without another word, Kay turns away from him, and
walks to her children, ignoring the running station wagon.

EXT. ITALIAN LUXURY LINER - DAY

The luxury liner making its way across the Atlantic.

INT. ITALIAN LUXURY LINER - MED. VIEW - DAY

The PURSER followed by several white uniformed associates
knocks on the door of something designated the "Leonardo
Suite." He is holding a telegram.

The door opens, and a tanned Merle peeks out of the door.

				PURSER
			(holding up the telegram)
		I'm terribly sorry to disturb you
		but we have received two telegrams.

				MERLE
			(reluctantly)
		Well...come in.

This entourage enters the suite, an impressive and
beautifully spacious luxury suite.  Connie is relaxing.

				CONNIE
		What is it?

				PURSER
		Yes.  One is from our office in New
		York.  The check that you wrote for
		your passage has been returned.

				CONNIE
		Can't be...

				MERLE
		Why don't you wire your bank?

				PURSER
		The other telegram is from your
		bank.  Your account has been closed
		and the company is warned not to
		extend any credit.

				CONNIE
		I'll take care of it in Naples.

				PURSER
		The company hopes so.  But for now,
		we have orders to change your
		accommodations.

And with that, the men in white begin to pack Connie and
Merle's luggage.

				CONNIE
		That son of a bitch!

INT. ITALIAN LUXURY LINER - TINY THIRD CLASS CABIN - NIGHT

Connie and Merle are attempting to sleep in the miniature
cabin in bunk beds.  The little space is crowded with their
trunks and luggage.  Merle can barely hang onto the bunk,
the boat pitches so violently below.

EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - MED. VIEW - DAY

A train speeds across the countryside.

INT. THE TRAIN - DAY

Inside the corridor, a porter advances, and knocks on the
door of a stateroom.  A voice tells him to enter.  OUR VIEW
enters with him as he carries a tray of lunch.  From this
POV we see Michael Corleone sitting in the compartment.

				PORTER
		Mr. Paul?

				MICHAEL
		Yes.

				PORTER
		You ordered lunch?

				MICHAEL
		Put it right there.

The porter does so; as he places the tray down, he catches a
glimpse of a second person in the compartment with Michael.

HIS VIEW

A very fierce, almost maniacal looking man, BUSSETTA.  He
nods that the porter should leave.

				MICHAEL
		Thank you.

The porter takes his advice and leaves quickly, closing the
door behind him.

VIEW THROUGH THE WINDOW

Michael and his mysterious companion have lunch together on
the moving train.

EXT. GULFSTREAM RACE TRACK IN MIAMI - HIGH FULL VIEW - DAY

The empty parking lot of the Gulfstream track, on an off-
race day.

CLOSER VIEW

Michael sits behind the wheel of a nondescript late model
car.  Bussetta sits in the rear.

Another car swings into the lot.  Michael starts his car,
and pulls out of the lot; the second car following.

NEW VIEW

This car pulls out and begins to follow them.  Michael
glances back by adjusting the rear view mirror, and nods to
Bussetta.

Michael's car begins to slow down, allowing the other car to
overtake them.

The overtaking car hesitates a moment, moving side by side
with them.

Michael glances toward the driver.

MICHAEL'S VIEW

We recognize Johnny Ola, who waves a greeting to Michael,
and then continues on to lead him.

EXT. SUBURBAN MIAMI NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

Ola's car leads Michael's through a middle-class suburban
area of $30,000 to $40,000 homes.  There are small channels
with sporting and fishing boats parked near the houses.
Ola's car pulls up in front of a very simple, tract-type
home.  Michael's car parks nearby.

				MICHAEL
			(Sicilian)
			 (to Bussetta)
		You'll wait in the car.

Ola has gotten out of his car and walks up the little path
to the front door.  Michael waits.

Ola rings the bell, and after a moment, a rather pretty,
middle-aged WOMAN answers, remaining behind the screen door.
Ola says a few things to her and she disappears, leaving the
door open.

Ola comes down the steps, looks at Michael, nodding to him.
Ola then gets into his car and drives off.  Michael walks up
the walkway and enters the little house, closing the door
behind him.

This woman, TERRI ROTH, is in the kitchen, looking out at
Michael.

				TERRI
		I'm just going to make lunch.  How
		about a tuna fish sandwich?

				MICHAEL
		Thank you, Mrs. Roth.

She hurries halfway up the staircase.

				TERRI
		Hyman...HYMAN, your friend is here.
			(turning to Michael)
		Why don't you go right upstairs, Mr.
		Paul?

				MICHAEL
		Fine.

He continues upstairs; she goes into the kitchen.

				TERRI
		I'll give a yell when lunch is ready.

Michael continues up to a small den on the second floor; we
can HEAR the sound of a baseball game coming over the
television.

INT. HYMAN ROTH'S DEN - DAY

Michael enters the den: it's very comfortable, but somewhat
like a senior citizen's retirement home in Florida.

MICHAEL'S VIEW

There, sitting before the television is a small man in his
middle sixties, thin, with a wizened face, looking like a
small-time retired Jewish businessman.  This is HYMAN ROTH.

				ROTH
		Sit down, this is almost over.  You
		follow the baseball games?

				MICHAEL
		Not for a few years.

				ROTH
		I like sporting events -- I really
		enjoy watching them in the afternoon.
		One of the things I love about this
		country.  I loved baseball ever
		since Arnold Rothstein fixed the
		World Series of 1919...I heard you
		had some trouble.

				MICHAEL
		Yes.

				ROTH
		What a mistake; people behaving
		like that, with guns.
			(he shakes his head)
		It was my understanding we left all
		that behind.  But, let me tell you,
		the important thing is that you're
		all right.  Good health is the most
		important thing; more than success;
		more than power; more than money.

				MICHAEL
		The incident of the other night is
		a nuisance that I can take care of.
		I came to you because I want
		nothing to affect our agreement; I
		wanted to clear everything I'm
		going to do with you, just in case.

				ROTH
		You're a considerate young man.

				MICHAEL
		You're a great man, Mr. Roth, I
		have much to learn from you.

				ROTH
			(warmly)
		However I can help you...

				MICHAEL
		The Rosato Brothers have performed
		services for you in the past; I
		understand that they are under your
		protection.

				ROTH
			(simply)
		We do favors for each other...

				MICHAEL
		Technically, they are still under
		the Clemenza wing of the Corleone
		Family, now run by Frankie
		Pentangeli.  After Clemenza died,
		the Rosatos wanted territory of
		their own.  Pentangeli refused, and
		came to me, asking for permission
		to eliminate them.  I, of course,
		knew of their relationship with
		you, and in gratitude for your help
		with the Tropicana matter, turned
		him down.  Pentangeli was furious,
		and paid one hundred and fifty
		thousand dollars to have me killed.
		I was lucky and he was stupid.
		I'll visit him soon.
			(leaning toward the
			old man, sincerely)
		The important thing is that nothing
		jeopardize our plans, yours and
		mine.  This thing of ours, that we
		will build.

The old man touches Michael's hand, warmly.

				ROTH
		Nothing is more important.

				MICHAEL
			(quietly)
		Pentangeli is a dead man; do you
		object?

				ROTH
		It's always bad for business; but
		you have no choice.

				MICHAEL
		Then it's done.  I must choose his
		replacement: it cannot be Rosato.

				ROTH
		Of course you must keep control of
		your family.

He turns to Michael, turning the volume higher on the
television, and moving closer to his young partner.

				ROTH
		Michael, these things are
		unimportant.  Who should be the
		manager of a dime store, Joe or
		Jack?  Unimportant.  You do what
		you think is right.  You're a young
		man, and I'm old and sick.  What we
		do together in the next few months
		will be history, Michael; it has
		never been done before.  We will do
		this historical thing together, and
		even your Father could never dream
		it would be possible.  We are
		bigger than U.S. Steel, you and
		me... because in America, anything
		is possible!
			(pause)
		But soon I will be dead, and it
		will all belong to you.

There is a KNOCK on the door, and Terri Roth pushes the door
open with her hip.

				TERRI
		My goodness, you'll rupture your
		eardrums, Hyman.

She puts the tray down, and turns down the television.

EXT. ROTH'S HOUSE - MED. VIEW - DAY

The sinister Bussetta waits patiently in the rear seat of
the car, outside Roth's modest house.

EXT. DOWNTOWN NEW YORK - MOVING VIEW - DAY

A black Cadillac moves down the street, slowed by the
Festivities of the Festa that is in progress: people milling
around, buying souvenirs at the many stands set up.

Sausage and grilled meats are prepared, just as they were
years ago.  Electric lights are strung from the street
lamps, and brightly colored banners pronounce the "Festa of
the Madonna."

MOVING CLOSE VIEW

Willy Cicci drives, frustrated that he cannot go any faster.
Next to him, Frankie Pentangeli sits, catching a few seconds'
snooze.

MED. VIEW

The black car pulls up; another car that had been following
it parks nearby.

One of Pentangeli's button men gets out of the car, and
steps into a small Italian restaurant; he exits quickly, and
nods affirmatively toward Pentangeli's Cadillac.

The group of them step out quickly, men huddled around
Pentangeli, and enter the restaurant.

INT. THE RESTAURANT - DAY

The restaurant is quite empty, despite the excitement out on
the street.

Pentangeli immediately sits at a table with a tall, dark,
snappily dressed young man, CARMINE ROSATO.

Nearby, on the other side of the room is Rosato's brother,
TONY, seated with a group of their men.

At another table in the restaurant is a table of Pentangeli's
people: they are joined by bodyguards.

				PENTANGELI
		Rosato, where's your brother?

				ROSATO
		Sitting right behind you.

Pentangeli glances behind himself.

				PENTANGELI
		He don't want to talk?

				ROSATO
		We worked it all out beforehand.

				PENTANGELI
		Are we going to eat or what?

				ROSATO
		Sure, on me.  I got Diner's Club.

				PENTANGELI
			(sarcastically)
		Forget it; I'm suddenly without an
		appetite.  You're making big
		trouble, Carmine.

				ROSATO
		You weren't straight with us,
		Frankie, what else could we do?

				PENTANGELI
		We could have talked first, saved a
		lot of running around.

				ROSATO
		You wasn't listening, you didn't
		want to talk.

				PENTANGELI
		Don't I look like I'm listening?

				ROSATO
		We want Brooklyn one hundred
		percent.  No more taxes to you.  We
		want to be only loosely connected
		with your family -- sort of a
		under-family all of our own.  Then
		we can act on all internal matters
		without talking.  Also we want you
		to inform Michael Corleone that we
		can deal directly with him.

				PENTANGELI
		I'm a little hungry, maybe I'll
		order something.  Joe.
			(one of his men)
		Get me some bracciole or something.
		And pay cash.
			(to Rosato)
		And in return for these concessions,
		what do you do for me?

				ROSATO
		We will release the hostages,
		number one.  Number two, we're here
		for you to count on when you need
		us.  We're independent, but we're
		here if you need us.  In general,
		we'll cooperate with you and your
		businesses, and you in turn will
		cooperate with us.  Pari persu.

				PENTANGELI
		Pari Persu; what the fuck is Pari
		persu...?

				ROSATO
		My lawyer went over this beforehand.

				PENTANGELI
		What assurances do I have that
		there will be no more kidnapping,
		no more hits?

				ROSATO
		The same assurance we got from you.

				PENTANGELI
		What if I say shove it?

				ROSATO
		Then Carmine Fucillo and Tony Blue
		DeRosa will need to be fitted for
		slabs.

				PENTANGELI
		You want a war?

				ROSATO
		We got no choice.

				PENTANGELI
		You know if there's a way I'll go
		to the commission and the commission
		will side with me.  That puts me
		and the other New York families
		against you.

				ROSATO
		We got friends in the commission.

				PENTANGELI
			(getting angry)
		I'm talking about Italians!

				ROSATO
		What about Michael Corleone?

				PENTANGELI
		He supports me.

				ROSATO
		Maybe, yes... maybe no.

One of Pentangeli's men approaches with a plate of Italian
food.

Pentangeli stands up, angered by this remark of Rosato's; he
pushes the dish of food out of the surprised Bodyguard's
hands.

				PENTANGELI
		You drove old Pete Clemenza to his
		grave, Carmine; you and your
		brother.  Turning on him; trouble
		in his territories -- you and your
		demands.  I hold you responsible,
		just as though you shot him in the
		head.  And I ain't gonna let that
		go for long!

Pentangeli walks out of the restaurant; there's a little
tension between the bodyguards of the two factions.

				ROSATO (O.S.)
		Hey, Five-Angels...

He gives him the arm.

Frankie's face turns red, like he wants to have it out here
and now; but Willy Cicci calms his down, and they all make
their move out.

EXT. THE RESTAURANT - DAY

Pentangeli gets into the car.

				PENTANGELI
		Nobody I hate calls me Five-Angels
		to my face!

He slams the door.

EXT. PENTANGELI'S LONG BEACH ESTATE - DAY

Part of the old estate of Don Corleone.  By now, the wall
has been torn down, and the other houses sold off.

His car is parked; Pentangeli steps out, still angry over
the confrontation.  As he approaches the house, he notices
something strained about the bodyguards who discreetly guard
his house.  No one seems to want to tell him.

				PENTANGELI
		What's up?

Pentangeli glances over to the front door foyer.

PENTANGELI'S VIEW

The strange and silent Bussetta, the man who now always
travels with Michael.

INT. PENTANGELI'S HOUSE - DAY

Pentangeli enters; he sees his WIFE, standing oddly in the
hallway.

				PENTANGELI
			(Sicilian)
		What's this?

				WIFE
		Michael Corleone.

				PENTANGELI
		One Michael Corleone...Dove?

				WIFE
			(Sicilian)
		He's in your study.

He knows it is very very serious for Michael to be here in
his home.

He automatically moves into his study.

INT. PENTANGELI'S STUDY - DAY

Michael stands quietly in the room.  This was once his
father's study, although it is totally redecorated.
Pentangeli starts sweating, and moves toward the young Don,
and kisses his hand.

				PENTANGELI
		Don Corleone, I wish you let me
		know you was coming.  We could have
		prepared something for you.

				MICHAEL
		I didn't want you to know I was
		coming.  You heard what happened in
		my home?

				PENTANGELI
		Michael, yes, we was all relieved...

				MICHAEL
			(furious)
		In my home!  In the same room where
		my wife was sleeping; where my
		children come in their pajamas, and
		play with their toys.

He's terrified Pentangeli with his anger; then, just as
suddenly, he talks quietly, calmly.

				MICHAEL
		I want you to help me take my
		revenge.

				PENTANGELI
		Michael, anything.  What is it I
		can do for you?

				MICHAEL
		I want you to settle these troubles
		with the Rosato Brothers.

				PENTANGELI
		I was just going to contact you,
		Michael; we just had a 'sit-down' -
		in fact, I just come from there.

				MICHAEL
		I want you to settle on their terms.

				PENTANGELI
		Mike, I don't understand.  Don't
		ask me to do that.

				MICHAEL
		Trust me; do as I ask.

				PENTANGELI
		It would be the beginning of the
		end for my family.  How can I keep
		all my other territories in like if
		I let two wise-guys stand up and
		demand this and that, and then give
		it to them?

				MICHAEL
		Frankie...do you respect me?  Do I
		have your loyalty?

				PENTANGELI
		Always... But sometimes I don't
		understand.  I know I'll never have
		your kind of brains, in big deals.
		But Mike, this is a street thing.
		And Hyman Roth in Miami is behind
		the Rosato Brothers.

				MICHAEL
		I know.

				PENTANGELI
		Then why do you want me to lay down
		to them?

				MICHAEL
			(coldly, but convincing)
		Frankie, Roth tried to have me
		killed.  I'm sure it was him, but I
		don't know yet why.

				PENTANGELI
		Jesus Christ, Michael, then let's
		hit 'em now, while we still got the
		muscle.

				MICHAEL
		This was my father's old study.
		When I was a kid, we had to be
		quiet when we played near here.
		When I was older, I learned many
		things from him here.  I was happy
		that this house never went to
		strangers; first Clemenza took it
		over, and then you.  My father
		taught me, in this room, never to
		act until you know everything
		that's behind things.  Never.  If
		Hyman Roth sees that I interceded
		with you in the Rosato Brothers'
		favor, he'll think his relationship
		with me is still sound.  I'm going
		somewhere to meet him tomorrow.  We
		have friends in some very important
		business that we're making.  Do
		this for me; you make the peace
		with the Rosato Brothers on their
		terms.  Let the word out that I
		forced you; you're not happy wit
		hit, but acquiesced, just because
		of me.  It will get back to Hyman
		Roth.  Do this, Frankie.  You can
		trust me.

				PENTANGELI
		Sure, Mike.  I'll go along.

				MICHAEL
		Good.

They embrace; Michael kisses him.  He looks at the young
Don, thoughtfully.

INT. TROPICANA HOTEL - CLOSE VIEW - DAY

The money trays are carefully unloaded from the gaming
tables, and put on a cart with others.

The cart, preceded and followed by security guards, is then
wheeled through the casino, into a private, counting room.

INT. COUNTING ROOM - MED. VIEW - DAY

The guards leave the room; the door is locked after them,
leaving only Hagen.  Neri and an ACCOUNTANT, a very fat man.
The numbered boxes are opened, and cash and checks are
spread out on the counting table.

The accountant begins with amazing speed and skill, to count
and divide the money.

				NERI
		Fifteen percent skim?

				HAGEN
		Twenty-five this time.

The accountant stops, and looks up to Neri.

				NERI
		It might show.

				HAGEN
		Mike wants it.

Neri nods, and the accountant continues.  Neri opens a door,
allowing a sandy-haired man, a COURIER, into the room.  The
cream is placed into his pouch personally by Neri.

				NERI
		We've never sent this much with one
		courier.

				HAGEN
			(to the courier)
		Your plans are a little different
		this time.  You skip Miami, and go
		straight to Geneva.  It's to be
		deposited to this number.
			(handing him a small envelope)
		And it's got to be there by Monday
		morning, no slip-up.

				COURIER
		I think I was 'picked-up' last trip.
		That hour layover I had at Kennedy.
		I went over and bought a paper...

Neri has finished putting the 'creamed' money into the pouch.

				NERI
		Those were our people.

				COURIER
		Okay, just thought you should know.

He is just about to close and lock the pouch, when Hagen
gestures that he should wait, and adds more stacks of
carefully packaged bills into the pouch.  Then Neri locks
it, and handcuffs it to the courier's arm, looking
inquiringly at Hagen.

				HAGEN
		Let them count.

The courier is shown out through a private door, and then
the first door is opened.  Two accountants come in with the
guards, and the trays are opened, and the counting process
is begun all over again, this time with the State Tally
sheets.

INT. TROPICANA CORRIDOR - MOVING VIEW - DAY

The courier continues on his way; followed by Hagen and Neri.

				NERI
		What's up?

				HAGEN
		No questions.

				NERI
		I got to ask questions, Tom,
		there's three million dollars cash
		in that pouch; Mike is gone and I
		have no word from him.

				HAGEN
		Al, as far as you're concerned, I'm
		the Don.

				NERI
		How do I know you haven't gone into
		business for yourself?

This hurts Tom; but he is a reasonable man, and he knows he
owes Neri some explanation.

				HAGEN
		You've been through a lot with us
		so I'm going to give you the truth.
		Mike knows it was someone within
		the compound that set him up for
		that hit.  So nobody is to know
		where he is, not you, not Rocco,
		not even his brother Fredo.  Sorry,
		Al, I know how you feel about
		Mike...but he still remembers Tessio.

EXT. KEY WEST - NIGHT

Michael is led to a desolate, night-lit private dock.  He is
followed by the ever-present Bussetta, and they are helped
onto a light-weight, luxury cabin cruiser.  The crew cast
off various ropes, and the boat sets out into the night.

							FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. TAHOE ESTATE - DAY

A seaplane lands nicely by the private Corleone harbor;
Hagen disembarks with his inevitable overloaded briefcase.
He continues down the ramp, past several Buttonmen, dressed
in summer casual attire, and who resemble secret service men
rather than thugs.

His wife THERESA lies on a blanket on the great lawn, with
her youngest children, who run to their father for a kiss.

				THERESA
		Hungry?

				HAGEN
		Just a little.

				THERESA
		I've invited Mama, Sandra and the
		kids for barbecue.

				HAGEN
		What about Kay?

				THERESA
		I couldn't find her.  She's been so
		broody, sticks to herself.

EXT. TAHOE LAWN BARBECUE - MED. VIEW - DAY

Hagen and Sonny's boys are throwing a football around on the
lawn; the littler kids running after them.

Coals are burning in the old style stone barbecue, and
several tables are set for the family.

In the distance, there is always evidence of the bodyguards.

Theresa, Mama and Sandra prepare the steaks.

Hagen relaxes in a sports shirt.

				HAGEN
		Let me try Kay.

He crosses the lawn, to the house on the beach where Michael
and his family live.  Is about to knock on the door:

				HAGEN'S SON
		Hey, Pop, heads up!

The football is flying in his direction; he catches it and
throws it back.  Then he cracks the door open, and peeks in.

INT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - DAY

				HAGEN
		Kay?

He steps in, the beautiful summer living room is neat, but
empty.

				HAGEN
		Anyone hungry?

He moves through the house more quickly; into the dining and
recreation room areas.  A cat jumps off a pile of cushions
and runs across the room.

				HAGEN
		Hello?

				SANDRA (O.S.)
		She's gone, Tom.

Sandra has followed him into Michael's house.

				HAGEN
		What do you mean gone?

				SANDRA
		The Barretts from Rubicon Bay came
		by in a new speedboat.  Rocco tried
		to say she wasn't in, but Kay
		spotted them and asked if they
		would take her and the kids for a
		ride.  That was three hours ago.

				HAGEN
			(furious)
		Why didn't someone tell me!

				SANDRA
		I wanted to tell you alone; your
		wife doesn't know what's going on.

Hagen rushes out of the house.

EXT. TAHOE LAWN - DAY

Hagen moves quickly out of Michael's house; moving across
the lawn to the boathouse.

				HAGEN'S SON
		Hey, Dad!

This time he ignores the thrown ball, and moves directly to
Rocco, who is by some men near the boathouse.

				HAGEN
		Rocco!

				ROCCO
		I know.  I went down to the Barrett
		house.  But she's gone.  They drove
		her and the kids to North Tahoe
		airport.

				HAGEN
		Goddamn it, where were you?

				ROCCO
		I was in my house.  Willy tried,
		but it would have taken some
		strong-arm to stop her, and he
		figured you wouldn't want that.

INT. THE BOATHOUSE - DAY

They enter the boathouse.

				HAGEN
			(to one of the men)
		Get me a Scotch and water.

The man hurries behind the bar.

				ROCCO
		She took a flight to San Francisco.
		We figure she's going to connect to
		New Hampshire; her parents' place.

				HAGEN
			(almost to himself)
		I can't let him down.

He swallows the drink down in several gulps.  And then looks
up to his men watching him.  He's embarrassed to have shown
such weakness.

				HAGEN
		All right, let me think a minute.

Rocco clears the men out.

				ROCCO
		Me too, Tom?

				HAGEN
		Yeah, give me a minute.

Rocco gone, Hagen moves behind the enormous bar, and pours
himself a giant drink.  He drinks that, and calms himself.

				HAGEN
		Oh Christ, Pop.  It was so good
		when you were alive.  I felt I
		could handle anything...

EXT. VIEW FROM BOAT - FULL VIEW - DAY

A beautiful coastal view of a tropical Caribbean city.  An
extraordinary view, high buildings, palm trees, all set
right on the bay.

MED. CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL

on the cruiser, Bussetta a little distance away, watching,
but never speaking.  The dark-skinned CAPTAIN of the cruiser
keeps pointing repeatedly.

				CAPTAIN
		Habana, Habana.

EXT. HAVANA STREET - MOVING VIEW - DAY

Michael and Bussetta are driven in a Mercury sedan, making
its way through the streets of Havana.

CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL

looking out the window.

MICHAEL'S POV

Crowded streets, occasional roving bands playing for the
tourists; there is much evidence of tourism: Americans
walking through the streets with cameras.  Occasionally, we
see a Cuban with a row of numbers attached to his hat,
carrying a big sheet of the daily lottery numbers.  From all
of these street impressions, the city is booming with
activity, but there is also much evidence of whores and
pimps and little children begging in the streets.

MED. VIEW

The big American car stops at an intersection.  Bussetta is
sitting in the forward passenger side; while Michael is in
the back.  He hears tapping on the window; he turns and sees
four Cuban boys tapping on his window and extending their
hands, and rubbing their stomachs as though they were hungry.
The Cuban driver rolls down his window and shouts them away
in Spanish.

INT. HAVANA CASINO LOBBY - MOVING VIEW - NIGHT

Michael is led through a beautiful wooden lobby of the
hotel, done in Spanish style, apparently just recently
completed.  He is approached by a thin, mousy man, SAM ROTH,
who ushers him toward the casino entrance.

				SAM ROTH
		Hiya, Mr. Corleone, I'm Sam Roth.
		Welcome to the Capri; my brother's
		upstairs.  You wanta take a rest
		before you see him, or can I get
		you something, anything at all?

				MICHAEL
		No, I'm fine.

He leads Michael into the main casino.

				SAM ROTH
		This is it!  We think it makes
		Vegas look like the corner crap game.

				MICHAEL
		Very impressive.

				SAM ROTH
		Jake, Jake, come over here.  Mike,
		I want you to meet Jake Cohen; he
		manages the casino for us.

				COHEN
			(appreciating
			Michael's status)
		Mr. Corleone.

Sam turns to Bussetta and extends his glad-hand.

				SAM ROTH
		Pleasure to meet you, I'm sure...

He gets no response whatsoever from Bussetta.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT

An extremely tall, well-built Cuban, tanned and wearing an
attractive mustache, LEON, in his middle forties, reads from
a prepared paper.  His sentences are translated by a smaller
man, standing to his rear.

				LEON
			(Spanish)
		Most respected gentlemen, allow me
		to welcome you to the City of
		Havana, the Republic of Cuba on
		behalf of His Excellency, Fulgencio
		Batista.

THE VIEW BEGINS TO MOVE along the various men gathered for
this meeting.

				LEON (O.S.)
		I'd like to thank this distinguished
		group of American Industrialists,
		for continuing to work with Cuba,
		for the greatest period of
		prosperity in her entire history.
		Mr. William Proxmiro, representing
		the General Fruit Company... Messrs.
		Corngold and Dant, of the United
		Telephone and Telegraph Company; Mr.
		Petty, regional Vice-President of
		the Pan American Mining Corporation;
		and, of course, our friend Mr.
		Robert Allen, of South American
		Sugar.  Mr. Nash of the American
		State Department.  And Mr. Hyman
		Roth of Miami, and Michael Corleone
		of Nevada representing our
		Associates in Tourism and Leisure
		Activities.

VIEW ON THE ENTIRE GROUP

Leon pauses to take a drink of water.  Then proudly, he
lifts a shiny yellow telephone for all to see.

				LEON
		The President would like to take
		this opportunity to thank U T&T for
		their lovely gift: a solid gold
		telephone!  He thought all you
		gentlemen would care to take a look
		at it.

He hands the heavy phone set to one of his aides, and it is
passed in turn to each of the men in attendance.

				CORNGOLD
		Your Excellency, perhaps you could
		discuss the status of rebel activity
		and how this may affect our
		businesses.

MED. CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL

He receives the telephone, and glances at it before passing
it on to Hyman Roth.

				LEON (O.S.)
		Of course.  The rebel movement is
		basically unpopular, and since July
		of 1958 has been contained in the
		Oriente Province, in the mountains
		of the Sierra Muestre.

Michael passes the phone on to Roth.

				LEON
			(continuing)
		We began a highly successful
		offensive against them in March,
		and activities within the city
		itself are at a minimum.  I can
		assure you we'll tolerate no
		guerrillas in the casinos or
		swimming pools!

General subdued laughter.

A CUBAN STREET - LATE DAY

Police are stopping traffic.  Michael's Mercury is among the
cars; a police officer, seeing that some important person is
being driven, walks up to the driver.  He leans forward, and
says something in Spanish to the driver.

The driver, in turn, leans over to Michael.

				DRIVER
		He says it will just be a short
		time and they'll let us through.

Michael looks out the window.

MICHAEL'S VIEW

The old building has been totally surrounded by police and
military vehicles.  Right at this moment, they are waiting
lazily, but soldiers are there with automatic weapons ready.
There is a momentary commotion inside the building, and the
men brace up.  A Captain of the Army detachment says
something in Spanish over a megaphone; and his men put their
weapons at the ready, as other policemen lead a group of
civilians out of the building with their hands up.

They are moved over to some military truck, where they are
frisked before being loaded.

All of a sudden, one of the civilian rebels breaks loose,
and rushes toward the command vehicle.  He hurls himself
into the vehicle, as two police try to pull him out.  A
second later, and there is an explosion; the man obviously
having hidden a grenade on his body, sacrificing his own
life to take the life of the Captain.

There is a commotion, but the military quickly quell it.

CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL

watching.  The police rush to Michael's car and guide it
outside of the trouble area.

MED. VIEW

as they lead and escort the Mercury out of the area.

EXT. HAVANA COUNTRY CLUB - CLOSE VIEW - DAY

Some glasses; rum is poured into them; then Coca Cola.
Quarter limes are squeezed.

				SAM ROTH (O.S.)
		Rum... Coca Cola...a squeeze of
		fresh lime...

Sam prepares the drinks for his brother, Hyman, and a group
of men, including Michael.

				MAN
		Cuba Libres.

				MICHAEL
		I was told the Cubans now call this
		drink: "La Mentira."

				ROTH
		I still don't speak Spanish, Michael.

				MICHAEL
		It means... "The Lie."

A moment's hesitation, then a few of the men laugh.  Now two
Cubans in white carry a table which has a lovely small cake
on it.

				SAM ROTH
		The cake is here.

They all raise their glasses to the old man.

				EVERYONE
			(ad lib)
		Happy Birthday!

Roth glances at the cake and its inscription, is pleased.

				ROTH
		I hope my age is correct: I am
		always accurate about my age.

Some laugh.  He nods, and they begin to cut it, put a piece
on plates, and carry them to the different men.

				ROTH
		Everything we've learned in Vegas
		is true here; but we can go further.
		The bigger, the swankier, the
		plusher the store, the more a sense
		of legitimacy, and the bigger
		business we do.
			(looking at the plate
			brought to him)
		A smaller piece.  What we've
		proposed to the Cuban Government is
		that it put up half the cash on a
		dollar for dollar basis.
			(accepting a smaller piece)
		Thank you.  We can find people in
		the United States who will put up
		our share for a small piece of the
		action, yet we will retain control.

				ONE OF THE MEN
		How much?

				ROTH
		A hundred million dollars.  But
		only if this Government relaxes its
		restrictions on importing building
		materials; we'll need some new
		laws, too, but that will be no
		difficulty.

				ANOTHER MAN
		What are import duties now?

				ROTH
		As much as seventy percent.  Also,
		I'm working out an arrangement with
		the Minister of Labor so that all
		our pit bosses, stick-men and
		Dealers, can be considered
		specialized technicians eligible
		for two year visas.  As of now
		they're only allowed in Cuba for
		six months at a time.  In short,
		we're in a full partnership with
		the Cuban Government.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

is handed a piece of cake.  Roth moves over to a folder of
documents.

				ROTH
			(continuing)
		Here are applications from Friends
		all over the States.  I understand
		Santo Virgilio in Tampa is trying
		to make his own deal.  Well, the
		Cuban Government will brush him off.
		The Lakeville Road Boys are going
		to take over the Nacionale here.
		I'm planning a new hotel casino to
		be known as Riviera.  The new Capri
		will go to the Corleone Family.

MED. VIEW

The cake is sliced and carried to each of the men.

				ROTH
		Then there's the Sevilla Biltmore;
		the Havana Hilton, which is going
		to cost twenty-four million --
		Cuban banks will put up half, the
		Teamsters will bankroll the rest.
		Generally, there will be friends
		for all our friends including the
		Lieutenant Governor of Nevada;
		Eddie Levine of Newport will bring
		in the Pennino Brothers, Dino and
		Eddie; they'll handle actual casino
		operations.

And seeing that all of his friends have been served, Roth
raises his fork.

				ROTH
		Enjoy.

				MICHAEL
		I saw an interesting thing today.
		A man was being arrested by the
		Military Police; probably an urban
		guerrilla.  Rather than be taken
		alive, he exploded a grenade hidden
		in his jacket, taking the command
		vehicle with him.

The various men look up as Michael eats his cake, wondering
what the point of it is.

				MICHAEL
		It occurred to me: the police are
		paid to fight, and the Rebels are
		not.

				SAM ROTH
		So?

				MICHAEL
		So, that occurred to me.

VIEW ON ROTH

He understands Michael's point, if the others do not.

				ROTH
		This country has had rebels for the
		last fifty years; it's part of
		their blood.  Believe me, I know...
		I've been coming here since the
		twenties; we were running molasses
		out of Havana when you were a baby.
		To trucks owned by your father.
			(he chuckles warmly
			over the memory)
		We'll talk when we're alone.

And he returns his attention to the men who are gathered
with him on his birthday.

EXT. ROTH'S PRIVATE TERRACE - DAY

Michael sits alone with the old man, on a terrace that
overlooks the city.

				ROTH
		You have to be careful what you say
		in front of the others... they
		frighten easy.  It's always been
		that way, most men frighten easy.

				MICHAEL
		We're making a big investment in
		Cuba.  That's my only concern.

				ROTH
		My concern is that the three
		million never arrived at Batista's
		numbered account in Switzerland.
		He thinks it's because you have
		second thoughts about his ability
		to stop the rebels.

				MICHAEL
		The money was sent.

				ROTH
		Then you have to trace it.  Michael,
		people here look at me as a reliable
		man.  I can't afford not to be
		looked on as a reliable man.  But
		you know all that; there's nothing
		you can learn from me.  You
		shouldn't have to put up with a
		sick old man as a partner.

				MICHAEL
		I wouldn't consider anyone else.

				ROTH
		Except the President of the United
		States.

He laughs slyly, as though this is some private joke between
them.  Then his laughter becomes a cough, which he painfully
stifles with a handkerchief.

				ROTH
		If only I could live to see it,
		kid; to be there with you.  How
		beautifully we've done it, step by
		step.  Here, protected, free to
		make our profits without the
		Justice Department, the FBI; ninety
		miles away in partnership with a
		friendly government.  Ninety miles,
		just a small step, looking for a
		man who desperately wants to be
		President of the United States, and
		having the cash to make it possible.

				MICHAEL
		You'll be there to see it; you'll
		be there.

INT. MICHAEL'S SUITE - NIGHT

The telephone has just rung; Michael listens.

				OPERATOR
		We have your call to Tahoe, Nevada,
		sir.

				MICHAEL
		Thank you.
			(click, click)
		Tom?  Tom, is that you?

				ROCCO (O.S.)
		No, Tom's out of town.  This is
		Rocco.  Who is this?

Michael is openly disturbed that Hagen is not there.  He
hangs up without answering.

EXT. NEW ENGLAND HOUSE - DAY

Tom Hagen steps out of a taxicab a bit tentatively, and then
steps toward the door of a pleasant New England house.  He
rings the bell and waits, hat in hand.  A moment later, the
door opens, and Kay is standing there.

				KAY
		I'm not surprised to see you, Tom.

INT. SMALL ROOM - NEW ENGLAND HOUSE - MED. VIEW - DAY

Out to the yard, where we can see glimpses of little Anthony
playing by himself.

				KAY (O.S.)
		I can't love a man like that; I
		can't live with him, I can't let
		him be father to my children.  Look.

The little boy, moodily by himself.

VIEW ON KAY

obviously moved.

				KAY
		He's not like a little boy... he
		doesn't talk to me; he doesn't want
		to play; he doesn't like other
		children, he doesn't like toys.
		It's as though he's waiting for the
		time he can take his Father's place.
			(almost in tears)
		You know what he told me when he
		was four years old.  He said he had
		killed his Grandfather...

VIEW ON HAGEN

listening, calmly.

				KAY
		... He said he had shot his
		Grandfather with a gun, and then he
		died in the garden.  And he asked
		me... he asked me, Tom, if that
		meant now his father would shoot
		him out of... revenge.
			(she cries)
		How does a four year old boy learn
		the word... 'revenge'?

				HAGEN
		Kay... Kay...

VIEW ON KAY

				KAY
		What kind of a family is this...
		are we human beings?  He knows his
		Father killed his Uncle Carlo.  He
		heard Connie.

				HAGEN
		You don't know that's true.  But
		Kay, just for the sake of an
		argument, let's assume it is, I'm
		not saying it is, remember, but...
		What if I gave you what might be
		some justification for what he
		did... or rather some possible
		justification for what he possibly
		did.

				KAY
		That's the first time I've seen the
		lawyer side of you, Tom.  It's not
		your best side.

				HAGEN
		Okay, just hear me out.  What if
		Carlo had been paid to help get
		Sonny killed?  What if his beating
		of Connie that time was a deliberate
		plot to get Sonny out into the open?
		Then what?  And what if the Don, a
		great man, couldn't bring himself
		to do what he had to do, avenge his
		son's death by killing his
		daughter's husband?  What if that,
		finally, was too much for him, and
		he made Michael his successor,
		knowing that Michael would take
		that load off his shoulders, would
		take that guilt?

				KAY
		He's not the same as when I met him.

				HAGEN
		If he were, he'd be dead by now.
		You'd be a widow.  You'd have no
		problem.

				KAY
		What the hell does that mean?  Come
		on, Tom, speak out straight once in
		your life.  I know Michael can't,
		but you're not Sicilian, you can
		tell a woman the truth; you can
		treat her like an equal, a fellow
		human being.

There is a long silence.

Then Hagen shakes his head; he can tell her no more.

				HAGEN
		If you told Michael what I've told
		you today, I'm a dead man.

				KAY
		When is it finally over?  I want it
		to be over before my baby is born.

				HAGEN
		I don't know.  I hope soon; but
		it's not over yet, and that's why
		you and the kids have to come back
		to me.

He looks at her; it's clear that he has been entrusted with
her safety and her children's.

He is a kind, good man, and seems very nervous and
overwrought.

VIEW ON THE WINDOW

Little Anthony is pressing his face against the glass pane,
as though he senses the adults are discussing something of
importance to him.

INT. TROPICANA HOTEL-CASINO - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

The Baccarat table.  Busy, hundred dollar bills being played.

				LOUDSPEAKER
		Mr. Corleone; Mr. Freddie Corleone,
		telephone please.

				PIT BOSS
		Not here.

VIEW ON THE CRAP TABLES

The play is fast; pit boss presiding; but no sign of Fredo.

				LOUDSPEAKER
		Telephone for Mr. Corleone.

ANOTHER PART OF THE CASINO

We see Neri, ominous, presiding over the entire store.  He
picks up a pit telephone.

				NERI
		He's backstage.
			(and hangs up disgustedly)

INT. TROPICANA BACKSTAGE AREA - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

Fredo is entertaining two showgirls done up in feathers and
what-have-you.

				FREDO
		C'mon, you got fifteen minutes
		before the finale!  I want to show
		you a trick with feathers.

				STAGEHAND
		Phone for you.

				FREDO
		Don't go away; wait a minute.

He takes the phone; we can catch a VIEW of the show going on
from the wings.

				FREDO
			(on the phone)
		Yeah.  Okay.  Who?  Mikey?  But...
		Si... si, caposco.
			(in Sicilian)
		Sure... how much?  I understand.
		Jesus, three million... I won't let
		you down.  Sure.

He hangs up thoughtfully.

				ONE OF THE GIRLS
		Freddie; we still got twelve
		minutes before the finale!

				FREDO
		Yeah... some other time.

EXT. NEW YORK BAR - DAY

There is a light rain.  Pentangeli steps out of his car;
points to Willy Cicci.

				PENTANGELI
		Wait in the car.

He walks up the street, to the bar, where he is greeted by
the tall, handsome Carmine Rosato.  They shake hands.
Pentangeli looks in his hand.

CLOSE VIEW

Rosato has put a crisp one hundred dollar bill in his hand,
folded sharply in two.

				PENTANGELI
		What's this?

				ROSATO
		That's a lucky C note for our new
		deal.

He puts his arm around Pentangeli, and they walk into the bar.

INT. THE BAR - DAY

The bar is fairly empty; and very dark.  Pentangeli and
Rosato step up to the bar; the bartender momentarily stops
polishing glasses to pour a couple of drinks.

				ROSATO
		We were all real happy about your
		decision, Frankie; you're not goin'
		to regret it.

He holds up the glass.

				PENTANGELI
		I don't like the C-note.  I take it
		like an insult.

Suddenly, a garrote is thrown around Pentangeli's throat;
and he is forcefully yanked back into the shadows, all the
way into a wooden telephone booth.

CLOSE VIEW

The folded hundred dollar bill resting on the bar.

MED. CLOSE - THE PHONE BOOTH

We see only Pentangeli's feet and legs, struggling.  We HEAR
the terrible sounds of a man being strangled.

CLOSE ON ROSATO

Calm, and then he sees something that disturbs him.

				ROSATO
		Shit, your friend the cop!

Suddenly, the side door opens, and a shaft of sunlight cuts
through the darkness.

				COP
		Everything all right in there,
		Ritchie?  The door was open.

CLOSE ON THE PHONE BOOTH

Pentangeli's feet stop moving.

				RITCHIE
		Just cleaning up.
			(strained voice)
		You okay?

				COP
		Is that something on the floor?

				ROSATO
		Take him!

				VOICE
		Okay.

				RITCHIE
		Not here; not a cop, not here!

Two figures race through the shadows and race through the
doors.

				COP
			(shouting to his
			partner, in uniform)
		Stutz!  Watch out, Stutz!

EXT. THE BAR - DAY

We see that a patrol car had stopped for its routine visit.
STUTZ, the second patrolman, is just stepping out of his
car; Pentangeli's bodyguard, seeing the commotion, leaps out.
Three men, including Rosato, rush out.  There is gunfire;
Cicci is wounded.

MED. CLOSE

The patrolmen is grazed across the face; trying to stop the
flow of blood with his hand.

NEW VIEW

The three assailants jump into the car and drive off.

INT. THE BAR - DAY

The stricken Pentangeli comes back to life.  He can barely
move his lips.

				PENTANGELI
		The bastard.  The dirty bastard, he
		gave me a C-note.  He gave me a C-
		note.

He sees the patrolman leaning over him.

EXT. PATROL CAR - DAY

The Sergeant is on the car radio.

				SERGEANT
		Frankie Pentangeli murder attempt.
		Patrolman Stutz shot.  Sahara
		Lounge - Utica Avenue and Claredon
		Road.  White Cadillac three or four
		men took off from scene.  Need
		ambulance; Stutz is bad.  Taking
		Pentangeli into custody...

INT. ROTH'S SUITE IN HAVANA - MED. CLOSE VIEW ON ROTH - DAY

His wizened face, pale.  Right now, though, his eyes have a
sparkle as he watches three million dollars in cold cash
being counted on a card table in front of him.

His brother Sam is present, and the sandy-haired Courier, a
little nervous; the one who had left from the Tropicana with
the Corleone skim-money.  Also Johnny Ola.  The money is
evidently all there; Roth picks up a packet; probably a
hundred thousand dollars, and throws it over to the Courier.

				ROTH
		Make it fast; I don't want to
		chance him being seen.

				COURIER
			(frightened)
		What about the arrangements?  How
		can I be sure about the arrangements?

				OLA
		Relax.  You're under our protection;
		the Corleone family will never find
		you.

Ola leads the Courier to the adjoining room where two
smartly dressed Military (Cuban) Police are standing, and a
civilian.  The Courier sees them, looks back to Ola.  One of
the police steps forward, placing the Courier under arrest;
handcuffing him.

				COURIER
		Hey, what's this?

The other takes the packet of money, and hands it to the
civilian, who places it in the briefcase he carries.  The
other officer kneels down and fastens leg manacles.

				COURIER
		The arrangements... YOU BASTARDS!
		What...

The Captain strikes him expertly across the side of his head
with his pistol.

Ola closes the door on this scene.

EXT. THE HAVANA CAPRI - DAY

Fredo Corleone steps out of a car, squints up at the sunshine
and palm trees.  He is holding on tightly to a small satchel,
which he won't let the bellman carry along with his other
things.

INT. MICHAEL'S SUITE - MED. CLOSE VIEW - DAY

Michael and Fredo in a brother's embrace; they kiss each
other.  Fredo is still in his jacket, holding the satchel.

				FREDO
		Mikey.  How are you?

He glances up at Bussetta, who doesn't say a word.  Fredo
extends his hand.

				FREDO
		Hiya, Freddie Corleone.

				MICHAEL
		Mio fratello.

Then Bussetta offers his hand back to Fredo.

				FREDO
			(taking off his jacket)
		What a trip, Jesus Christ, the
		whole time I'm thinking what if
		someone knew what I got in here.

He undoes the combination of the briefcase starts taking out
cash.  Then he stops, remembering that there's a stranger in
the room.

				FREDO
		Oh, 'scuse me.

				MICHAEL
		It's all right.  He stays with me
		all the time.

				FREDO
		Oh.  Mikey, what's up?  I'm totally
		in the dark.

				MICHAEL
		We're making an investment in Havana.

				FREDO
		Great, Havana's great.  Lots of
		activity in Havana!  Anybody I know
		here.  Five-Angels?  Anybody?

				MICHAEL
		Johnny Ola... Hyman Roth.

				FREDO
		I never met them.

				MICHAEL
		Pentangeli's dead.  He was ambushed
		by the Rosato Brothers.
			(pause)
		Didn't you know that?

				FREDO
		No.  No, I didn't.  Who tells me
		anything?  I been kept in the dark
		so long, I'm getting used to it.

				MICHAEL
		I want you to help me, Fredo.

				FREDO
		That's what I'm here for.

				MICHAEL
		Tonight I want to relax with you.
		The Senator from Nevada is here
		with some people from Washington.
		I want to show them a good time in
		Havana.

				FREDO
		Count on me; that's my specialty.

				MICHAEL
		I'd like to come along.  There's
		been a lot of strain, and I've been
		cooped up in this room for three
		days.

				FREDO
		Me and you, great!  Gimme an hour
		to wash my face and do my research
		and we'll have these Washington
		suckers right where you want 'em.
			(then a thought
			strikes him)
		Poor Frankie Five-Angels.  He
		always wanted to die in bed...with
		a broad.

INT. ROTH'S SUITE - MED. VIEW - DAY

Michael stands at Roth's door carrying the briefcase that
Fredo had brought.

A hotel DOCTOR takes Hyman Roth's blood pressure, while his
wife waits nervously.

				DOCTOR
			(Spanish)
		You must not exert yourself; I will
		write out a prescription and come
		back tomorrow.

				HOTEL MAN
		He's going to write a prescription.

				ROTH
		I want my own doctor; fly him in
		from Miami.  I don't trust a doctor
		who can't speak English.

The doctor is shown out.  Roth gestures to the hotel man,
who also leaves.  Then he looks to his wife.

				ROTH
		Honey, go down to the casino?

				TERRI
		If you feel better...

				ROTH
		I do.  Play the Bingo game.

They kiss, and she leaves.  Also Bussetta and Ola remain.

				ROTH
		My sixth sense tells me you have a
		bag full of money in your hand.

Ola locks the door; Michael nods, and opens the bag, spilling
its contents on the card table.

				MICHAEL
		This doubles my investment.

				ROTH
		Still no word of your courier?
		We'll find him.  But at least this
		will satisfy our friends here.
		You've been invited to the New Year
		reception at the Presidential Home.
		I understand your brother is here
		as well; I hope he'll come.

				MICHAEL
		Six million dollars in cash is a
		high price for a piece of a country
		in the middle of a revolution.

Roth looks patiently at Michael, as though he were a child
who hadn't minded the lesson that he had been taught over
and over again.

				ROTH
		You're a careful kid, and that's
		good.  But look.  An international
		dispatch on the wire service.
		American journalism, not propaganda.
		The government troops have all but
		eliminated the rebels.  All but
		their radio station.

				MICHAEL
		I've read it; I'm pleased that the
		government is doing so well.  As a
		heavy investor, I'm pleased.  How
		did the doctor find you?

				ROTH
		Terrible.  I'd give twice this
		amount to take a piss without it
		hurting.

				MICHAEL
		Who had Frankie Pantangeli killed?

				ROTH
			(taken a bit off-balance)
		Why...the Rosato Brothers.

				MICHAEL
		I know that; but who gave the go
		ahead.

Roth glances to Ola; he is not a fool; he realizes Michael
has begun to suspect him.

				MICHAEL
		I know it wasn't me...so that
		leaves you.

				ROTH
		There was this kid that I grew up
		with; he was a couple years younger
		than me, and sort of looked up to
		me, you know.  We did our first
		work together, worked our way out
		of the street.  Things were good
		and we made the most of it.  During
		prohibition, we ran molasses up to
		Canada and made a fortune; your
		father too.  I guess as much as
		anyone, I loved him and trusted him.
		Later on he had an idea to make a
		city out of a desert stop-over for
		G.I.'s on the way to the West Coast.
		That kid's name was Moe Greene, and
		the city he invented was Las Vegas.
		This was a great man; a man with
		vision and guts; and there isn't
		even a plaque or a signpost or a
		statue of him in that town.  Someone
		put a bullet through his eye; no
		one knows who gave the order.  When
		I heard about it I wasn't angry.  I
		knew Moe; I knew he was headstrong,
		and talking loud, and saying stupid
		things.  So when he turned up dead,
		I let it go, and said to myself:
		this is the business we've chosen.
		I never asked, who gave the go
		ahead because it had nothing to do
		with business.

He regards Michael silently a moment.

				ROTH
			(continuing)
		There's three million dollars on
		that table.  I'm going to lie down,
		maybe take a nap.  When I wake up,
		if it's still there, I'll know I
		have a partner.  If it's gone, then
		I'll know I don't.

The old man turns, and moves in his slippers, toward his
bedroom.

INT. THE CORRIDOR - DAY

Michael closes the door, and moves down the hallway.  He is
followed by Bussetta, who had waited in the corridor.

				MICHAEL
			(Sicilian)
		How sick do you think the old man is?

				BUSSETTA
			(Sicilian)
		He'll live longer than me.

INT. TROPICOR NIGHT CLUB - VIEW ON THE SHOW - NIGHT

A Havana extravaganza, with tall, beautiful showgirls done
up in flamboyant, 'South-of-the-Border' Carmen Miranda
costumes; the lead singer is a six foot blonde doing "Rum
and Coca Cola" in that style.  Her name is YOLANDA.

MED. VIEW

At a large round table, located in an obvious VIP section of
the high, tropically draped room with living ferns and other
tropical planting with artificial stars.

Michael rises, to be introduced by Fredo to some conservative
looking Senatorial types, including Senator Pat Geary of
Nevada.  We notice Bussetta standing nearby.

				FREDO
		Does everyone know everyone, or
		nobody knows nobody.  Here, my
		brother, Michael Corleone... well,
		you know Senator Geary.

Geary warmly shakes Michael's hand.

				SENATOR GEARY
		Good to see you, Mike; I'm glad we
		can spend this time together.

				FREDO
		This is Senator Payton from Florida;
		Judge DeMalco from New York...
		Senator Ream... Mr. Questadt from
		California, he's a lawyer with the
		Price-Control Administration.  And
		Fred Corngold of U T&T.

They all make themselves comfortable.  A waiter with a tray
of drinks appears.

				FREDO
		Gentlemen... your pleasure?  Cuba
		Libres, Pina Coladas, you name it.

				SENATOR GEARY
		I'll take a Yolanda.

Laughter.

				FREDO
		Later, later.  All those girls look
		like they're on stilts!

The various tropical drinks are distributed.

				SENATOR GEARY
		To a night in Havana!

They all join in.

				FREDO
			(aside to Michael)
		Jeeze, it's great you came along,
		Mike... You know, we've never spent
		a night out on the town together.
		I always thought you looked down on
		me for liking a good time.

				MICHAEL
		I never looked down on you, Fredo.
		You don't look down at a brother.

INT. THE CASINO - NIGHT

By now the group has made its way into the casino.  Some of
them are crowded around the crap table; Senator Geary is
with the enormous and beautiful Yolanda, who barely speaks
English.  There are other girls with some of the men; not
with Michael, who gambles dollars while talking to Corngold.

				CORNGOLD
		Our information is that Castro is
		dead.  There are maybe a few
		hundred die-hards in the Sierra
		Muestra; but government troops are
		going to clean them out any day.

Johnny Ola approaches Michael.

				OLA
		Mike, can I talk to you.

Michael follows Ola toward the Baccarat table; a watchful
Bussetta moves, a distance away, with them.

				OLA
		Listen, this Senator from Florida
		already has a hundred grand worth
		of markers on the table.

We can see Senator Ream at the table, making thousand dollar
bets on the Bank.

				OLA
		They asked him to sign paper to
		take down the markers; but he got
		mad; told them to wait until he was
		finished.

				MICHAEL
		Let him gamble.

				OLA
		Okay.  You know he doesn't have
		that kind of money.

				FREDO
		Mike said let him gamble.

Fredo puts his arm around his brother; he is high with the
first attention Mike has ever given him, as though finally
he is being taken seriously; as though his brother needs him.

				FREDO
		Mike, I got something special up my
		sleeve for these boys.  You ever
		hear of "Superman?" And I don't
		mean the comic book.

				MICHAEL
		No.

				FREDO
		Wait'll you see!

INT. HAVANA BAR - NIGHT

Our group are in a large Havana bar; the walls totally
covered with hundreds of fifths of different types of rum
and other liquor.

A couple of the girls from the show are out with the men;
Yolanda herself is giving them a private song and dance.

Fredo is a little loaded, and especially attentive to
Michael this night.

				FREDO
		Mikey, why would they ever hit poor
		old Frankie Five-Angels?  I loved
		that ole sonuvabitch.  I remember
		when he was just a 'button,' when
		we were kids.  We used to put
		bedsheets on our heads, you know,
		like we were ghosts.  An' ole
		Frankie come peek into our room,
		we'd jump up, and he'd always
		pretend like he was really scared.
		You remember?

				MICHAEL
		It was hard to have him killed.

				FREDO
		You?  What do you mean you, I
		thought...

				MICHAEL
		It was hard to have him killed.

				FREDO
		You?  What do you mean you, I
		thought...

				MICHAEL
		It was Frankie tried to have me hit.

				FREDO
		No.  I mean, are you sure?

				MICHAEL
		You know otherwise, Freddie?

				FREDO
		Me?  NO, no, I don't know anything.
		Fellas!  You're all falling asleep.
		We got to see Superman.

CLOSE ON MICHAEL

A growing feeling about his brother.

EXT. GARISH HAVANA STREET - NIGHT

The street is lit with tons of neon signs; it is alive with
people; some roving bands of musicians.  Everywhere are
little boys running around, begging for money.  And in
doorways and windows are silent, dark-skinned women.

				SENATOR REAM
			(pushing away from
			the palm outstretched
			little hands of the boys)
		Goddamn beggers.  Goddamn city of
		beggars and pimps and whores.  And
		we bend over backwards to support
		them with the goddamn sugar quota.

				FREDO
			(to Geary)
		What's eating him?

				SENATOR GEARY
		He lost a quarter million dollars
		at the casino.

				SENATOR REAM
		...goddamn city of whores...

				SENATOR GEARY
		He gave them a bad check.

INT. 'SUPERMAN SHOW' - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

A large room with a succession of platforms arranged step-
like around a circular area which becomes a stage.

There are a hundred or so people, practically all men,
tourists and business men, standing on the different levels,
forming the audience.

In the center of the stage is a thick, telephone type pole,
to which is tied a young Cuban girl, in a flimsy white
sacrificial slip.  A small band, mostly drummers, play some
Latin music.

MED. VIEW

Fredo's party standing on the ramp, looking down at the
spectacle.  They're a little woozy from the drinks and late
hour.  Michael is with them, but now we sense he is using
this time, with all exhausted and drunk, to come to some
important conclusions.

				QUESTADT
		Why do we have to stand?

				FREDO
		Everyone stands.  But it's worth
		it, watch!

VIEW ON THE ARENA

Now two high priestesses, scantily clad, bring in a tall and
muscular Cuban, done up in chains and loin cloth, as though
he were a captured slave.  This is SUPERMAN

VIEW ACROSS THE MEN TO THE STAGE

				FREDO
		That's him; that's Superman!

Some preliminary pornographic proceedings go on, as the
priestesses lead the slave to the virgin tied to the post.
The music is percussive and wild.

MED. VIEW ON THE MEN

				SENATOR GEARY
		Ohmygod.  I don't believe it.

				QUESTADT
		It's got to be fake.

				FREDO
		That's why they call him Superman.
		Johnny Ola told me about this; I
		didn't believe it.

CLOSE on Michael turning away.  Not because of the spectacle
which he finds disgusting, but at what his brother is saying.

				FREDO (O.S.)
		... but seeing is believing.  Ole
		Johnny knows all the places.  I
		tol' you... can you believe it?

If Michael would ever allow himself to cry, it would be now.

				FREDO
			(continuing)
		The old man Roth, would never come;
		but Johnny knows these places like
		the back of his hand...

							FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. MICHAEL'S SUITE - MED. VIEW - MORNING

Michael is alone in his bedroom; it seems as though he
hasn't slept very much, but sits by his window, looking out
at the city.  He is troubled and tired.

His radio is on:

				RADIO
			(Spanish)
		"This is Rebel Radio: Rebel troops
		of Column Four 'Jose Marti' took
		the town of Baire yesterday at 8:30
		p.m.  The enemy has retreated..."

EXT. CUBAN STREET - MORNING

This street in Havana is like a Caribbean tourist city with
no indication of the revolution in progress.

Michael walks along the street, alone, past the Cubans on
their way to work; past the American ladies who have gotten
up early for their shopping spree.

				RADIO
			(Spanish)
			 (continuing)
		... An important military action is
		developing along a 35-kilometer
		stretch of the Central Highway.
		Numerous enemy garrisons are left
		with two alternatives, surrender or
		annihilation...

One full block away, Bussetta rides in the front seat of the
dark Mercury, driving slowly, giving Michael his privacy,
but never letting him out of Bussetta's sight.

CLOSE ON MICHAEL

watching.

MICHAEL'S VIEW

Shopkeepers happily luring the tourists into their shops in
broken English.  Havana is prosperous.

				RADIO
			(continuing)
		... Victories in war depend on a
		minimum on weapons and to a maximum
		on morale...

VIEW ON MICHAEL

glances back to the dark car following him.  In a moment, it
pulls up to him, and he gets into the back seat.

EXT. AMERICAN MILITARY MISSION - VIEW ON MICHAEL - DAY

standing by his car, looking through the cyclone fencing
that borders this military training camp operated by the
American Army near the city.

				RADIO
		... War is not a simple question of
		rifles, bullets, guns and planes...

CLOSER VIEW INTO THE CAMP

EXT. HAVANA STREET - DAY

A street singer, followed by a guitarist sings Jose Marti's
words of "Guantanamera." It is solemn, as though it is a
song of protest, a song of the revolution.

Nearby, in a restaurant, Michael has lunch with Fredo.

				MICHAEL
		How is your wife, Fredo...your
		marriage?

				FREDO
			(eating)
		You know her; drives me crazy, one
		minute she's a popsicle, the next
		she's all vinegar.  Sometimes I
		think... I think - I should a
		married someone, like you did.  To
		have kids, to have a family.

Michael turns, distracted for a moment at something the
singer has sung.

				MICHAEL
		"Yo soy un hombre sincero..."
		I am a sincere man,
		From the land of the palms...

				FREDO
		What's that?

				MICHAEL
		The song.  Are you sincere with me,
		Fredo?

				FREDO
		Sincere.  What are you talking
		about, of course I'm sincere with
		you, Mike.

				MICHAEL
		Then I'm going to confide in you;
		trust you with something.

				FREDO
			(Sicilian)
		Mike, are you crazy, I'm your
		brother.

				MICHAEL
		Tonight we've been invited to a
		reception at the Presidential
		Palace; to bring in the New Year.
		You and I will go in a special car
		that's being sent.  They'll have
		cocktails... then dinner, and a
		reception with the President.  When
		it's over, it will be suggested
		that you take Questadt and his
		friends from Washington to spend
		the night with some women.  I'll go
		home alone in the car; and before I
		reach the hotel, I'll be
		assassinated.

				FREDO
		...Who?

				MICHAEL
		The same man who tried in Nevada...
		Hyman Roth, not Pentangeli.

				FREDO
		But, you told me yourself...

				MICHAEL
		It was never Pentangeli... I've
		always known that.  It was Roth all
		along.  He talks to me as a son; as
		his successor, but the old man
		thinks he'll live forever.

				FREDO
		What do you want me to do?

				MICHAEL
		To go tonight, with me, as though
		we know nothing.  I've already made
		my move.

				FREDO
		What is it?  Can I help?

				MICHAEL
		The old man will never bring in the
		New Year.

Fredo realizes what he means; looks immediately to Bussetta,
who had been sitting near the door and the musicians.  He is
gone.

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - MOVING VIEW ON BUSSETTA - NIGHT

The first time ever away from Michael, moving toward us
quickly.  He stops, knocks on the door of Roth's suite.
Then quickly for a man his size, he moves without noise to
the adjoining door, opens it with a key, and disappears
inside.

A moment elapses on the empty corridor, and then a roused
Johnny Ola, opens the first door.  He steps out into the
corridor, to see who had knocked.  Confused, he is about to
return inside, when Bussetta easily breaks his neck in two
from behind.

INT. THE SUITE - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

as Bussetta quietly pulls the limp body of Johnny Ola, his
head bent at an impossible angle, and lays it at the foot of
the couch.

EXT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT

Guards who are regular troops patrol the Palace in twos,
carrying machine weapons.

Now an elite officer, checks the identification of the
various cars carrying dignitaries, as they are driven up to
the Palace.  The one being inspected at the moment contains
Fredo and Michael.  We can see the beautifully dressed
people on their way to the reception, and sense the cheerful
mood of this New Year's Eve.

INT. THE SUITE - NIGHT

Bussetta bends over Ola's body, tying the wrists and knees
with electrical extensions.  He then easily carries the body
to the small balcony which all the rooms have.

EXT. THE BALCONY - NIGHT

Bussetta swings the body over the side of the balcony
railing; tying the extension cord to the railing, and
suspending the body so that it is invisible both from the
inside and out during the night.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - VIEW ON THE MAIN FOYER - NIGHT

The PRESIDENT, his WIFE and six oldest CHILDREN great
formally the many beautifully and affluently dressed guests.
He speaks to them in Spanish, as one by one they file to him.

Michael and Fredo are presented in a group with several
other Americans, including several of the American
businessmen with interests in Cuba.

EXT. STREETS OF HAVANA - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

The excitement of the night is beginning to build; people
are out in the streets; poor people, but they are
enthusiastic and lively.

NEW VIEW

Traffic stops, as an ambulance speeds its way to a hospital;
SIREN going.

INT. THE SUITE - NIGHT

Bussetta delicately picks up a small satin cushion that had
fallen from the couch, and replaces it as though nothing had
happened.  Slowly he cracks the door open which adjoins
Roth's bedroom.  There is a slight commotion; whispered
voices.

BUSSETTA'S VIEW

Terri, Mrs. Roth, is crying.  A group of men lift Hyman
Roth's frail body onto a stretcher.

CLOSE ON BUSSETTA

realizes that this is the man he is to kill.

CLOSER VIEW ON ROTH

He is alive; breathing hard with his mouth dry and open.
The doctor examines him, and then gives instructions to the
orderly who carries him out, presumably to the ambulance.

Bussetta closes the door on this VIEW.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT

An orchestra plays for the guests, as an army of waiters
serve champagne and hors d'oeuvres.  Michael relaxes with
Senator Geary, Major Leon, and several of the Americans.

				QUESTADT
		The embargo on arms shipments from
		the U.S. to your government, was
		just a necessary public relations
		move... Only last month, your air
		force received a major shipment of
		rockets...

Michael glances at his watch; Fredo concentrates on this.

				SENATOR GEARY
		We believe in non-intervention...
		but the agreement stipulates that
		our forces may be withdrawn... but
		as you've seen, we have not
		withdrawn them.

				CORNGOLD
		And my guess is that President
		Eisenhower won't pull out while we
		have over three billion invested
		over here.

				MICHAEL
		Fredo.  Where are you going?

				FREDO
		Nowhere, Mike.  I wanted to get a
		refill.  How about you?

EXT. HAVANA HOSPITAL - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

The ambulance makes its way up to the emergency section of
the hospital.  The orderlies quickly carry the old man
inside.  His wife and the doctor, and several of his men,
follow in another car.

THE VIEW ALTERS

and we see Bussetta waiting in the shadows.

EXT. HAVANA STREETS - NIGHT

The growing crowds of Cubans begin their celebration.

NEW VIEW

A Cuban military detachment speeds along in the night,
motorcyclists clear a path through the celebrants.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - FULL VIEW - NIGHT

A full sitdown dinner is being served the guests.  Michael
sits at a table at dinner with several of the distinguished
Cubans, and some of the American businessmen.

				QUESTADT
		What's kept Mr. Roth?

Fredo looks up at Michael.

In the back of the room, we notice the detachment of military
moving quickly through the reception room on their way to
the President's private quarters.  Michael notices it as well.

INT. THE HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - FULL VIEW - NIGHT

The activity at the end of the hall has come to rest; we can
tell that the doctor tells Mrs. Roth that she should go, the
old man will be taken to a room where he can rest.
Gradually, these people leave him in the care of the hospital
staff.

Bussetta watches from the distance of the hallway; after the
old man has been moved, he quietly walks down the hallway to
the room.

HIS VIEW

A nurse sits in the room in attendance; Hyman Roth is
asleep, his mouth wide open, breathing noisily.

VIEW ON BUSSETTA

hears footsteps, quickly steps away from the door, and into
another room.

Some nurses and attendants speak to the nurse in the room in
Spanish; one has brought a small bottle of wine, and
obviously they are inviting the nurse to have a New Year's
toast with them.  They laugh; and the nurse steps away from
the room for a moment.

Bussetta moves slowly back into the room, alone with the
helpless Roth.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - FULL VIEW ON THE GUESTS - NIGHT

seeing in the New Year; a great banner is hoisted up in
Spanish, welcoming 1959.

Hands are shaken; kisses exchanged.

MED. CLOSE VIEW

Michael and Fredo in an embrace; they kiss one another.

				MICHAEL
		I've arranged for a plane; we're
		going to Miami in an hour.  Try not
		to make a big thing of it.

He kisses his brother once again.

				MICHAEL
			(Sicilian)
		I know it was you, Fredo.  You've
		broken my heart.

Slowly, understanding, Fredo backs away from his brother,
taking the kiss another way.

A little distance away, Major Leon notices an old woman, one
of the President's maids, moving across the alcove, carrying
her suitcases.

				LEON
		What a pity; she's crying.  Must
		have been fired, and she's been
		with the President's family for
		twenty years.

EXT. HAVANA STREETS - NIGHT

The gathered crowd joyously welcomes the New Year.  We
notice the continual military movement.

MED. VIEW

A family surreptitiously leaves their home, carrying
suitcases and belongings.

INT. ROTH'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

Bussetta raises a hospital pillow, and easily begins to
smother the thin old man, who can barely struggle.

OUT IN THE HALL

A detachment of military move quickly, accompanied by some
of Roth's men, as though they have important news that must
be dealt with.

They pass the small group of aides and nurses welcoming the
New Year.

Seeing them, the nurse assigned to him, puts down her glass
and moves quickly to the room.

She opens the door, and lays bare the sight of Bussetta
smothering Roth.  Bussetta turns quickly; and one of the
military takes out his pistol and shoots several times at
his head.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT

The entire reception has been disrupted for an announcement;
all the guests in their formal dress and evening gowns,
standing with frightened faces like first class passengers
on a doomed ship.  The President himself, his back to our
VIEW, is making an announcement in Spanish.  While he
speaks, we notice continuous movement of his personal staff,
carrying suitcases and possessions.

				PRESIDENT
		...Because of serious setbacks of
		our troops in Guantanamo and
		Santiago, we feel reluctantly, that
		we must leave the Capital at once.
		Myself and my family must bid you
		goodbye, and good fortune.  We will
		go directly to Ciudad Trujillo.

The crowd is stunned; already whispers are moving throughout
the guests.

The only one who is not completely taken off guard is
Michael, who quietly steps back, and disappears from the room.

				PRESIDENT
		...My only regret is that there
		could not have been more warning...
		As my last official act as
		President, I hereby appoint a
		provisional government with Dr.
		Carlos M. Piedra, as its President.

By now, there is only one thought among the guests: how can
they get out, and with what.

EXT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT

We see evidence of the confusion at this late hour; already
cars are beginning to move; people leaving the Palace in
haste.  Michael moves quickly toward his car.  He sees
Fredo, watching him in fear.

				MICHAEL
		Come with me.  It's your only way
		of getting out!

VIEW ON FREDO

Terrified of his brother, and what he knows; Fredo backs
away into the growing noise and confusion of the crowd.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

Finally, he has to step into the car and it roars off.

EXT. HAVANA STREETS - NIGHT

Rebel cars with loudspeakers have already picked up the news
that Batista has conceded...this throws the crowds already
gathered for the New Year into cheers of joy.

They harass a wealthy family who are trying to get away in
their car.

The people pull them out of the car, opening their suitcases,
out of which spill piles of cash and jewelry into street.

Michael's car makes its way as the crowd cheers: "El animale
se fue!"

EXT. THE UNITED STATES EMBASSY - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

Crowds of panicked and frightened tourists, and Batistianos
are trying to get to the safety of the Embassy with the
families and possessions.

We see Geary, and some of the Americans we had met, working
their way through the crowds, shouting that they are
Americans in order to get preference on the line.  Often
that declaration brings 'boos' from the crowds.

Sometimes the joyous Cubans will let a family through, but
again, taking away the suitcases, rich leather, filled with
money and valuables.  Money seems to be stuffed everywhere.

EXT. THE YACHT CLUB - NIGHT

All forms of private transportation are jammed with people
trying to get out, holding cash in their hands for anyone
with a yacht or small boat to get them to Florida.

A car pulls up; and we see Sam Roth, Terri Roth and some of
their men, carry the sickly, but still alive Hyman Roth to a
private cruiser which is protected by men with machine guns.

Within seconds, they are on their way to Miami.

EXT. THE PRIVATE AIRPORT - NIGHT

Things are no different at the airport; where anything that
can fly is being jammed with refugees and their money.

A wealthy family is arguing with the pilot of a fast
airplane; trying to force cash on him, and his family into
the plane.  The PILOT steadfastly refuses, although checking
his watch, as though his passengers are late.  He speaks
only English.

				PILOT
		No, this is a private plane.  No,
		this plane is taken.

Finally Michael's Mercury pulls up, and Michael approaches
the Pilot.

				MICHAEL
		He isn't here.

				PILOT
		We've got to leave, they'll take
		this thing apart.

				MICHAEL
		All right.  Go now.

The Pilot lets Michael in, as the Cuban screams curses at
them, and begins searching for another plane for his family.

INT. THE PLANE - VIEW ON THE PILOT - NIGHT

as the propeller turns over.

EXT. THE AIRPORT - FULL VIEW - NIGHT

Groups of the cheering, celebrating Cubans sing
"Guantanamera," now as a song of triumph.

INT. THE PLANE - MOVING VIEW - MICHAEL - NIGHT

Closer to him, his personal and business life caught in the
middle of history.

EXT. NEW YORK STREET - MED. VIEW - DAY (1920)

He stops to pick out some choice oranges and peaches from a
fruit stand.  Then he reaches into his pocket for change.

				VENDOR
		No, no.  It is my pleasure to make
		this a gift.

CLOSE VIEW ON VITO

				VITO
		You are kind.  If ever I can do
		something for you, in return,
		please come to me.

INT. VITO'S TENEMENT - DAY

Despite his new position of 'respect,' there is little
changed about his home.  Only that they have lived there a
while now, and the rooms are fuller with the inevitable
possessions a young family acquires.

He kisses his wife, who seems a big apprehensive.  He shows
her the fruit; and from her reaction knows she has something
on her mind.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		What is it?

				CARMELLA
			(Sicilian)
		Come...

They step into the tiny parlor, where we see an older woman,
waiting nervously.

				CARMELLA
		The Signora is a friend of mine.
		She has a favor to ask of you.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		Why do you come to me?

				SIGNORA COLOMBO
			(Sicilian)
		She told me to ask you.

He seems surprised; looks to his wife.

				CARMELLA
		She is having some trouble.  Her
		landlord has received complaints
		because of her dog.  He told her to
		get rid of it, but her boy loved
		it, so they tried to hide it.  When
		the landlord found out, he was so
		angry, he ordered her to leave.
		Even if she truly will let the dog
		go.

				SIGNORA COLOMBO
			(Sicilian)
		He said he would have the police
		put us out.

				VITO
			(thoughtfully)
		I can give you some money to help
		you move, is that what you want?

				SIGNORA COLOMBO
		My friends are all here; how can I
		move to another neighborhood with
		strangers?  I want you to speak to
		the landlord to let me stay.

Vito nods to the frightened old woman.

				VITO
		It's done then.  You won't have to
		move; I'll speak to him tomorrow
		morning.

Carmella breaks into a smile; which her husband des not
acknowledge.

The old woman starts to leave the room; but she is not
convinced.

				SIGNORA COLOMBO
		You're sure he'll say yes, the
		landlord?

				VITO
		I'm sure he's a good-hearted fellow.
		Once I explain how things are with
		you, I'm sure he'll take pity on
		your misfortunes.  Don't let it
		trouble you any more.
			(as he shows her out)
		Guard your health, for the sake of
		your children.

EXT. TENEMENT BLOCK - DAY

SIGNOR ROBERTO, a pompous, rather well-dressed Patrone
angrily walks down the steps of one of his tenement buildings.

He carries a check list, and makes marks with a pencil
concerning the condition of his various buildings; a broken
window here, some missing tile there.  He bends over to pick
up some garbage left by a thoughtless tenant, muttering to
himself, when he sees the shoes and legs of a young worker.

				VITO (O.S.)
		Signore Roberto...

He rises to be face to face with a polite Vito Corleone.

				VITO
		The friend of my wife, a poor widow
		with no man to protect her, tells
		me that for some reason she has
		been ordered to move from your
		building.  She is in despair.  She
		has no money, she has no friends
		except those that live here.

Signor Roberto brusquely answers, and continues on his way.

				ROBERTO
		I have already rented the apartment
		to another family.

MOVING SHOT ON THE TWO

				VITO
		I told her I would speak to you,
		that you are a reasonable man who
		acted out of some misunderstanding.
		She has gotten rid of the animal
		that caused all the trouble, so why
		shouldn't she stay.  As one Italian
		to another, I ask you the favor.

				ROBERTO
		I've already rented it; I cannot
		disappoint the new tenants.  They're
		paying a higher rent.

				VITO
		How much more a month?

				ROBERTO
		Eh...
			(we sense he is lying)
		Five dollars more.

Vito reaches into his pocket, and takes out a roll of bills.

				VITO
		Here is the six month's increase in
		advance.  You needn't speak to her
		about it, she's a proud woman.  See
		me again in another six months.
		But of course, you'll let her keep
		her dog.

				ROBERTO
		Like hell!  And who the hell are
		you to give me orders.  Watch your
		manners or you'll be on your
		Sicilian ass in the street there.

Vito raises his hands in surprise; his voice is reasonable.

				VITO
		I'm asking you a favor, only that.
		One never knows when one might need
		a friend, isn't that true?  Here,
		take this money as a sign of my
		good-will, and make your own
		decision.  I won't quarrel with it.
			(he puts the money in
			Roberto's hand)
		Do me this little favor, just take
		it and think carefully.  Tomorrow
		morning if you want to give me the
		money back, by all means do so.  If
		you want the woman out of your
		house, how can I stop you?  It's
		your property, after all.  If you
		don't want the dog in there, I can
		understand.  I dislike dogs myself.
			(he pats Roberto on
			the shoulder)
		Do me this service, eh?  I won't
		forget it.  Ask your friends in
		this neighborhood about me, they'll
		tell you I'm a man who believes in
		showing his gratitude.

Without a word more, Vito leaves a hypnotized Roberto
standing in front of the tenement, his hand clasping the
money.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - DAY

A thin young man, almost gawky, walks down the street in
this Italian neighborhood, his name is HYMAN SUCHOWSKY.

He carries his tools as he comes home from work.  He is
pursued and tormented by a couple of Italian youths, about
his own age, eighteen.

				ITALIAN BOY
		Kid, where do you live?

				ANOTHER
		Where'd you get those nigger lips?

He tries not to be intimidated; finally one of the boys,
steps in front of him and stops him.

				ITALIAN BOY
		Say 'bread' in Italian.

				ANOTHER
		He dunno.

				ITALIAN BOY
		Go on; how do you say 'bread' in
		Italian?  If you're from the
		neighborhood, you should know how
		to say 'bread' in Italian.

An amused Peter Clemenza steps forward from a local coffee
house, to preside over the fuss.  He's a 'big' man in the
neighborhood, and loves a fight.

				CLEMENZA
		What's up?

				ITALIAN BOY
		This kid lives around here, but he
		can't say bread in Italian.

				CLEMENZA
		That's 'cause he's Jew.  Look at
		those pregnant lips!

He giggles at his own joke.

				ITALIAN BOY
		Are you a Jewboy?

The boy doesn't answer, tries to keep going.

				ITALIAN BOY
		Well, if you're not a Jew, say
		'bread' in Italian.  See, he can't.

And with that, he rounds a blow squarely to the boy's face,
sending him sprawling to the cement, his tools flying with a
clatter.

The other Italian immediately joins in with a few kicks to
the boy's stomach.  Hyman tries to fight back; grabs a hold
of his tormentor's foot, and brings him down on the cement
as well.  For a moment, they are rolling around on the
sidewalk, two against one, Hyman taking the worst of it.

				CLEMENZA
		Alright, alright, cut it out.

				SECOND ITALIAN
		What for?  He killed Jesus Christ!

Clemenza pulls him off, and kicks him in the ass.

				CLEMENZA
		I said cut it out!
			(to the beaten kid)
		What's your name?

				HYMAN
		Hyman Suchowsky.

				ITALIAN BOY
		I don't believe it.  In our
		neighborhood, with a name like that!

				CLEMENZA
		What are those tools?  You work on
		cars?

				HYMAN
		Yeah.

				CLEMENZA
		Maybe I know how you can make a
		couple of extra bucks working as a
		mechanic.

The boy seems agreeable.

				CLEMENZA
		But you gotta know how to keep your
		mouth shut, and fer Chrissakes, get
		rid of that name.  I'll call you
		Johnny Lips.
			(he giggles at his
			own humor again)
		Come on...

He leads the boy down the street, whispering to him, on the
side:

				CLEMENZA
		Bread in Italian is pane.  P-A-N-E,
		pane.  Don't forget.

INT. NEW GENCO WAREHOUSE - DAY

A newly acquired warehouse, stocked with cases of the new
product "GENCO PURA" olive oil.  It is the beginning of a
new business, in the American tradition.  Now they have one
rattling old truck, and a few stock boys.

Genco has become the accountant-business manager, based on
the experience working with his father.  But it is clear,
that Vito is the leader, and undisputed 'President' of the
new enterprise.

Genco moves through the darkness of the warehouse, to the
small divided area that Vito uses as his office.

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
		The 'patrone' is here.

				VITO
		Chi?

				GENCO
		Roberto.  Who owns the 'rat-holes.'

Vito nods that he will see him; and soon Roberto enters, on
tiptoe, his hat in his hand, and in a apologetic voice.

				ROBERTO
		Excuse me, I hope I am not a
		disturbance, Don Corleone.

				VITO
		Yes.

				ROBERTO
		What a terrible misunderstanding.
		Of course, Signora Colombo can stay
		in the flat.  Who were those
		miserable tenants to complain about
		noise from a poor animal...when
		they pay such low rent.

Then abruptly, he puts the roll of money on Vito's table,
and steps back a respectful distance.

				ROBERTO
		Your good heart in helping the poor
		widow has shamed me, and I want to
		show that I, too, have some
		Christian charity.  Her rent will
		remain what it was.

				VITO
		What was that?

				ROBERTO
		In fact, reduced, bu five dollars!

Vito embraces him warmly.

				VITO
		I accept your generosity...

				ROBERTO
		I won't keep you another minute...

He quickly takes his leave, bowing several times, and then
makes it back to the safety of the warehouse; he sighs,
deflates his lungs, and mops his brow; his bones have turned
too jelly with fear at his narrow escape.  He all but runs
out of the warehouse.

Genco laughs as he watches.

				GENCO
		We won't see him for weeks!  He'll
		stay in bed in the Bronx!

Clemenza has been waiting with his new mechanic.  We notice
the subtle difference in the way he treats Vito.  He is no
longer a junior apprentice in their petty crimes; but an
imposing leader.

				CLEMENZA
		This kid is good with cars; he
		kiijed at the truck, and says he
		can keep it going.

Vito looks over the lanky young man.

				CLEMENZA
		What's your name?

				HYMAN
		Suchowsky.  Hyman Suchowsky.

				CLEMENZA
		He's gonna dump that; I call him
		Johnny Lips.

				VITO
		Who is the greatest man you can
		think of?

				CLEMENZA
		Go on, answer him when he talks to
		you.  Tell him: Columbus, Marconi...
		Garibaldi.

				HYMAN
		Arnold Rothstein.

				VITO
		Then take that as your name: Hyman
		Rothstein.

Genco is out in the alley; he calls out with glee.

				GENCO
		Vitone!  Look at this!

Vito moves out to the smiling Genco; Clemenza and the newly
christened Hyman Rothstein follow a distance behind.

EXT. THE ALLEY - DAY

Genco stands beaming, as two workers raise up high, the
freshly painted sign: "GENCO OLIVE OIL COMPANY."

				GENCO
			(enthusiastically)
		God bless America!  We're in
		business!

The young men watch as the sign is hoisted into place.  OUR
VIEW goes from one to the other: Clemenza, Genco, Vito and
Hyman Rothstein.

INT. SENATE CAUCUS ROOM - MED. CLOSE VIEW - DAY

Willy Cicci, Pentangeli's associate and bodyguard takes a
drink of water.

				SENATOR (O.S.)
		Mr. Cicci.  From the year 1927 to
		the present time, you were an
		employee of the "Genco Olive Oil
		Company."

				CICCI
		That's right.

				SENATOR (O.S.)
		But in actuality, you were a member

				CICCI
		The Corleone Family, Senator.  We
		called it, "The Family."

				SENATOR (O.S.)
		What position did you occupy?

				CICCI
		At first, like everybody, I was a

		No, I don't know, explain that
		exactly.

				CICCI
		When the boss says push the button
		on a guy, I push the button, see,
		Senator?

The Senators treat Cicci with a surface courtesy, as if he
were a curious kind of animal, not really human.  Cicci
reacts to this by being even more brutally forthright than
he has to be, to show his contempt for what he considers a
hypocrisy.

The VIEW ALTERS from Senator Kane to the Committee's
attorney, Mr. Questadt.

				QUESTADT
		You mean you killed people at the
		behest of your superiors?

				CICCI
		That's right, counsellor.

				QUESTADT
		And the head of your family was
		Michael Corleone.

				CICCI
		Yeah, counsellor, Michael Corleone.

				SENATOR KANE
		Did you ever get such an order
		directly from Michael Corleone?

				CICCI
		No, Senator, I never talked to him.

				SENATOR SAVOY
			(very autocratic,
			deep South,
			gentlemanly man)
		There was always a buffer, someone
		in between you who gave you orders.

				CICCI
		Yeah, a buffer, the Family had a
		lot of buffers.

EXT. THE TROPICANA IN VEGAS - MED. VIEW - DAY

A limousine pulls up at a private area near the side of the
hotel.  Michael exits the limousine followed by Hagen and
Neri.

				MICHAEL
		Do you think they have somebody to
		back up Cicci?

				HAGEN
		No.  But if they do have somebody,
		you'll do three years for perjury
		if you give them so much as a wrong
		middle name.

Michael smiles to him, but it's a cold, deadly smile.

				HAGEN
		Michael, take the Fifth all the
		way, that way you can't get into
		trouble.

EXT. PRIVATE BALCONY OF CORLEONE APARTMENT AT TROPICANA - DAY

A Corleone bodyguard waits outside on the balcony overlooking
the pool area.  Through the translucent draperies, we see a
grouping of me.

INT. CORLEONE APARTMENT AT THE TROPICANA - DAY

Michael, Hagen, Neri and Rocco are seated in this luxury in
the hotel.  Michael sits in a comfortable chair in his
apartment.  Neri comes and brings him a drink without
asking, but Michael refuses it.

				MICHAEL
		Al, get me a wet towel.  Does Kay
		know I'm back?

Hagen nods.

				MICHAEL
		Did the boy get something from me
		for Christmas?

				HAGEN
		I took care of it.

				MICHAEL
		What was it, so I'll know.

				HAGEN
		A little care he can ride in with
		an electric motor.

Neri comes around with a wet face towel, which Michael uses
to cool his eyes.  He puts the used towel down on the table.

				MICHAEL
		Fellas, can you wait outside a
		minute?

They know what he means and leave the apartment, going out
to the balcony where we can see them but they cannot hear.
Only Hagen remains.

				MICHAEL
		Where's my brother?

				HAGEN
		Roth got out on a private boat.
		He's in a hospital in Miami.  Had a
		stroke but he's recovered okay.
		Bussetta's dead.

				MICHAEL
		I asked about Fredo?

				HAGEN
		The new government arrested him,
		held him for a couple of days with
		a lot of the other casino people,
		including Roth's brother, Sam.  The
		American Embassy arranged flights
		for citizens; I'm not sure, but I
		think he's somewhere in New York.

				MICHAEL
		I want you to reach Fredo.  I know
		he's scared, but have one of our
		people reach him.  Assure him that
		there will be no reprisals.  Tell
		him that I know Roth misled him.

				HAGEN
		My information is that Fredo
		thought it was a kidnapping.  Roth
		assured him nothing would happen to
		you.

				MICHAEL
			(indicating Rocco and
			Neri on the balcony)
		They can come in now.

				HAGEN
		Wait... there's something else.

				MICHAEL
		Alright.

Hagen pauses; doesn't know how to begin.

				MICHAEL
			(impatiently)
		Go on, tell me.

				HAGEN
		Kay had a miscarriage; she lost the
		baby.

After a moment:

				MICHAEL
		Was it a boy or a girl?

				HAGEN
		Mike, at three and a half...

				MICHAEL
		What is it, can't you give me
		straight answers anymore!

				HAGEN
		It was a boy.

				MICHAEL
		And Kay...she's all right?

				HAGEN
		She took the Senate Investigation
		worse.

				MICHAEL
		Does she blame it on me?  The baby?

				HAGEN
		I don't know.

EXT. TAHOE ESTATE - DAY

The first snow of the New Year has fallen; the trees are
bare, and there is hush all over this part of the Sierras.
Michael is driven in his car, looking out at the familiar
sight of the home he has been forced to be away from.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

looking out from his window.  The last time he had seen the
estate it was warm, and the trees were full.

MOVING VIEW

approaching the great stone gates; closed.  The bodyguards
are not readily visible, but they are there.  The iron gates
are opened, and one of the men makes a simple nod of respect,
as the car pulls in.

NEW VIEW

Inside the estate, the private roads have been freshly
plowed, and occasionally a worker will pause to watch the
car as it passes.

The Grandchildren are in school now, and so the estate is
especially quiet.  Although there are signs that children
live here; a bicycle, a sled, a swing and gymnastic set, wet
and with a rim of snow still on it.

INT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - VIEW FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE - DAY

to the outside, where Michael walks slowly.  He stops and
looks at a little Italian red sportscar made for children.

NEW VIEW

The front door opens, and Michael enters his own home.  It
is very quiet, no one is at home to greet him.  He can see
the evidence of his family; things his wife and his children
have been using, and left on a sofa or a table.

He moves toward his and Kay's bedroom, where we can HEAR the
SOUND of a sewing machine running.

Quietly he opens the door.

MICHAEL'S VIEW

into the bedroom.  Kay is sitting by the window, lit by the
cold afternoon light, at work with her sewing machine.  She
hasn't noticed that he's in the room yet, and goes on with
her work.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

stands there a moment, watching, not making a sound.  And
then without a word, he steps back, and closes the door, so
that she doesn't see him.

VIEW FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE

onto Michael, moving outside, walking through the snow, he
moves to the house next to his own.

INT. CONNIE'S HOUSE - DAY

This is the house where Mama lives with Connie's children,
Connie so rarely is there.

He steps in; his mother is asleep in a chair in the living
room.  He moves to her, and bends low, whispers.

				MICHAEL
		Mom... Mom...

She opens her eyes, which are red and small with age.

				MICHAEL
			(Sicilian)
		It's Michael.  How are you, Mom?

				MAMA
			(Sicilian)
		I'm alright.  Will you stay home
		for awhile?

				MICHAEL
			(Sicilian)
		There are still things I have to do.

				MAMA
			(Sicilian)
		Well, we can all have a nice dinner
		together tonight.  How are your eyes?

				MICHAEL
		Alright.  They bother me once in
		awhile.
			(a pause as he thinks)
		Tell me, when Pop had troubles...
		did he ever think, even to himself,
		that he had gone the wrong way;
		that maybe by trying to be strong
		and trying to protect his family,
		that he could... that he could...
		lose it instead?

				MAMA
			(Sicilian)
		You talk about the baby.  She can
		have another baby.

				MICHAEL
			(Sicilian)
		No, I meant lose his family.

				MAMA
			(as best she ever
			understood it)
		Your family?  How can you ever lose
		your family?

				MICHAEL
			(almost to himself)
		But times are different...

FULL VIEW IN ROOM - MICHAEL AND HIS MOTHER

Quietly we HEAR the music of a small band playing an Italian
march.  From the orchestration, we know it is from the past.

							DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. TRAIN STATION AT CORLEONE - DAY

Vitone and his young family: Mama, Santino, Fredo and the
baby Michael are met at the small station in Sicily by
friends, and Mama's relatives.  There is a small band,
playing for the occasion.  A small man has brought a motor
car to pick the family up; and there are certain dark men,
with shotguns slung over their shoulders to preside over the
occasion.

The family is helped into the car; the luggage is packed on
the roof, and the car drives off.  The second car, with
bodyguards following.

EXT. DON TOMASINO'S VILLA OUTSIDE OF CORLEONE - DAY

The villa is bloomed with flowers and DON TOMASINO at this
point is a man in his late twenties.  He embraces Vitone and
pats the heads of his children, and leads them all into the
garden.

INT. THE VILLA - SUMPTUOUS MED. VIEW - LATE DAY

A sumptuous table is set for the visiting family from
America.  There is a warm atmosphere as Vito, his wife and
children eat.  Tomasino and his family received presents
from Carmella and to Tomasino's mother, and gifts are given
to all of the children.

All typically American representing some of the prosperity
and interests in the consumer goods that followed a great war.

EXT. CORLEONE PLAZA - DAY

The family exits the church on the plaza of the town.  Vito
shakes hands warmly with the priest.

INT. VILLAGE COTTAGE - NIGHT

The door is open -- the footsteps of a man enter the room.
We follow these footsteps without quite knowing to whom they
belong.  They lead us to a bed, where we see asleep an OLD
MAN.  He sleeps in his undershirt and is sweating, covered
by mosquito netting.

VIEW ALTERS

and we realize that it is young Vito looking at the MAN.

We remember that the man is MOSCA, one of three men, who
almost twenty years before had hunted down Vito when he was
a boy.  With lightning speed, Vito slashes through the
mosquito netting with a knife.  And with the movement
precise as a butcher's he disembowls this man.

EXT. OLIVE OIL WAREHOUSE - FULL VIEW

Vito has brought his wife and children to see the Olive Oil
Depot which is the link to his New York importing business.
They go inside.

INT. OLIVE OIL WAREHOUSE - DAY

They are led by one of Vito's associates through rows and
rows of large vats of olive oil.  Vito very proudly shows
his associates in Italy the olive oil can that will be used
in the United States.  They all stand around at the link to
their new importing business and share a toast of wine.

EXT. THE BAY - DAY

A team of Sicilian fisherman are at work mending their nets.
One sings accompanied by a guitar.

VIEW MOVES TO ONE OF THE OLD FISHERMAN

He is recognized as the second of the men who had hunted
Vito down.  STROLLO.  As he walks we notice there is a
figure that is moving through the drying sails and barrels,
it is Vito.  He moves quietly, stepping up behind the old
man.  In an instant, he has thrown a garrote around his
throat, twisting it tight, so that there is very little
sound.

Then, almost silently dragging him through the space hidden
by the drying sails.

EXT. THE IMPRESSIVE ESTATE OF DON FRANCESCO - DAY

We see an old car approach.  Its driver is the young Tomasino.
Sitting in the car with him is Vito.

The car stops at the gates, and an old guard sees and
recognizes Tomasino, opens the gates allowing them to enter.

MED. VIEW

on an almost decrepit DON FRANCESCO.  He must be in his
early nineties, sitting as powerful and as impressive as
ever, in his throne-like chair from which he manages the
power as the Mafia Chieftan of this village.  Young Don
Tomasino is speaking.

We notice in a little distance in the rear, there are some
younger shepherds with shotguns thrown over their shoulders.

				TOMASINO
			(Sicilian)
		Don Francesco, if you will honor
		me, by allowing me to introduce my
		associate in America, in New York.
		His name is Vito Corleone.

The old man and his eyes glance up at a notion of a man who
has taken the name of this town as his name.

				TOMASINO
		We will supply him with olive oil
		exclusively in the town of Corleone.
		His company is called the "Genco
		Olive Oil Company." Here we have
		brought you an indication of how he
		will sell the product.

Tomasino respectfully puts a can of olive oil where the old
man can look at it.  The old man nods, accepting the notion
of this business.

				TOMASINO
			(Sicilian)
		We have come to ask your blessing
		and permission to continue this
		enterprise.

				DON FRANCESCO
			(Sicilian)
			 (in a shrill, high,
			raspy voice)
		Where is this young man?

				TOMASINO
		He is right here, standing next to
		me, Don Francesco.

				DON FRANCESCO
			(Sicilian)
		Have him come closer, I can't see
		very well.

Vito takes those several steps, so that he is standing right
in front of the old man.

VIEW ON DON FRANCESCO

looking up, squinting against the sun.

DON FRANCESCO'S VIEW

Strangely backlit, almost blurry image of the young man from
America.

				DON FRANCESCO
			(Sicilian)
		What is your name?

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		Vito Corleone.

				DON FRANCESCO
			(Sicilian)
		You took the name of this town, eh?
		What was your father's name?

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		Antonio Andolini.

CLOSE VIEW ON THE OLD MAN

The recognition of the name throws a shudder through him.
It is as though he recognizes that this is the boy; the son
of his old enemy, whom he had killed, and whose sons he had
tried to wipe out.  The old man raises his feeble hands
signalling his guard, and in his weak voice, he shouts:

				DON FRANCESCO
			(Sicilian)
		Kill him!  Kill him!

But he is too late; Vito steps forward.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		In the name of my Father, and my
		Brother...

And uses the knife, ritualistically plunging it into the old
man's belly, and then up to his throat, which is severed.

VIEW ON TOMASINO

has drawn his pistol and quickly shoots one of the guards,
helping Vito to escape back into the motor car.

VIEW ON A GUARD

raising his shotgun.

VIEW ON THE MOTOR CAR

Just as Tomasino is about to get into the car, the shotgun
is fired, and he is hit in the legs.

Vito manages to pull him up into the car, and they make
their escape.

EXT. RAILROAD STATION IN CORLEONE - DAY

Some of the townspeople have come bringing flowers and gifts
for Vito and his family.

His wife is radiant with the flowers given her.

The train has arrived and the crowd shout "Ciao, come back
soon."

THE VIEW ALTERS

revealing his good friend Tomasino, waving from his
wheelchair.

VIEW ON VITO

and his wife.  She holds up the baby Michael, and helps him
wave his hand.

INT. SENATE CAUCUS ROOM - MED. CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL - DAY

				SENATOR KANE (O.S.)
		Are you the son of Vito Corleone?

				MICHAEL
		Yes.

				SENATOR KING
		Did he use at times an alias?  Was
		this alias in certain circles
		GODFATHER?

				MICHAEL
		It was not an alias.  GODFATHER was
		a term of affection, used by his
		friends, one of respect.

				SENATOR WEEKLER
			(Senator from New
			York, very smooth,
			partly liberal,
			Tammany Hall)
		Let me agree with that.  Many of my
		constituents are Italian and have
		been honored with that certain
		friendship by my close Italian
		friends.  Up to this point before I
		have to leave this hearing to join
		my own committee, let me say, that
		this hearing on the Mafia is in no
		way a slur on the Italians by the
		Senate; nor is it meant to be; nor
		will I allow it to be.  Italian
		Americans are the hardest working,
		most law abiding patriotic Americans
		of our country.  It is a shame and
		a pity that a few rotten apples
		give them a bad name.  We are here
		to weed those rotten apples out of
		the vast healthy barrel of Italian
		Americans, who are one of the
		backbones of our country.

There is a pause for a while, while the New York Senator
poses for the TV cameras and leaves the hearing so that he
will not be associated with hearing the rough stuff.

				SENATOR KANE
		I'm sure we all agree with our
		esteemed colleague.  Now, Mr.
		Corleone, you have been advised as
		to your legal rights.  We have had
		testimony from a preceding witness
		who states you are head of the most
		powerful Mafia family in this
		country.  Are you?

				MICHAEL
		No.

				SENATOR KANE
		This witness has testified that you
		are personally responsible for the
		murder of a New York Police Captain
		in the year 1947 and with him a man
		named Virgil Sollozzo.  Do you deny
		this?

				MICHAEL
		I deny his every charge.

				SENATOR KANE
		Is it true that in the year 1950
		you devised the murder of the heads
		of the Five Families in New York,
		to assume and consolidate your
		nefarious power?

				MICHAEL
		That is a complete falsehood.

				SENATOR KANE
		Is it true that you own a
		controlling interest in three of
		the major hotels in Las Vegas?

				MICHAEL
		That is not true.  I own some stock
		in some of the hotels, but only
		very small amounts.  I also own
		some American Telephone and IBM
		stock.

Michael had checked this point with Hagen, before answering,
and then once again after the answer.

				SENATOR ROGERS
		Why is it necessary for your
		counsel to advise you on that
		question?

				MICHAEL
		Senator, I've observed the head of
		General Motors before a Senate
		Committee, and his lawyer whispered
		in his ear.  That was not commented
		upon in the way you have just done.

				SENATOR KANE
		Mr. Corleone, do you have any hotel
		interests in the state of Arizona?
		Or any gambling interests in that
		state?

				MICHAEL
		I do not.

				SENATOR KANE
		Do you have interests or control
		over gambling and narcotics in the
		state of New York.

				MICHAEL
		I do not.

A pause.  Silence, as the Chairman whispers something to his
assistant.

Tom Hagen takes a paper out of his briefcase, and addresses
the Chair.

				HAGEN
		Senator, my client would like to
		read a statement for the record.

				SENATOR KANE
		I don't think that's necessary.

				HAGEN
		Sir, my client has answered every
		question asked by this committee
		with the utmost cooperation and
		sincerity.  He has not taken that
		Fifth Amendment as it was his right
		to do, and which because of the
		extreme legal complexity of this
		hearing, counsel advised him to do.
		So, I think in all fairness this
		committee should hear his statement
		and put it in the record.

				SENATOR KANE
		Very well.

At this point Senator Rogers contemptuously walks out of the
hearing room.

				MICHAEL
			(reading)
		In the hopes of clearing my family
		name, in the sincere desire to give
		my children their fair share of the
		American way of life without a
		blemish on their name and background
		I have appeared before this
		committee and given it all the
		cooperation in my power.  I consider
		my being called before this
		committee an act of prejudice to
		all Americans of Italian extraction.
		I consider it a great dishonor to
		me personally to have to deny that
		I am a criminal.  I wish to have
		the following noted for the record.
		That I served my country faithfully
		and honorably in World War II and
		was awarded the Distinguished
		Service Cross for actions in
		defense of my country.  That I have
		never been arrested or indicted for
		any crime whatsoever... that no
		proof linking me to any criminal
		conspiracy, whether it is called
		Mafia or Cosa Nostra or whatever
		other name you wish to give, has
		ever been made public.  Only one
		man has made charges against me,
		and that man is known to be a
		murderer, arsonist and rapist.  And
		yet this committee had used this
		person to besmirch my name.  My
		personal protest can only be made
		to the people of this country.  I
		can only thank God that in this
		country we have a legal system and
		courts of law to protect innocent
		people from wild accusation.  I
		thank God for our democratic due
		process of Law that shields me from
		the false charges made by this
		committee's witness.  I have not
		taken refuge behind the Fifth
		Amendment, though counsel advised
		me to do so.  I challenge this
		committee to produce any witness or
		evidence against me, and if they do
		not, I hope they will have the
		decency to clear my name with the
		same publicity with which they have
		now besmirched it.  I ask this
		without malice, in the interests of
		fair play.

The television cameras have documented this moment, as Hagen
hands the document over to the committee lawyer.

				SENATOR ROGERS
		We are all impressed.  The committee
		will now recess over the weekend.
		However, it will continue Monday
		morning, at eleven a.m.  At that
		time, this committee will then
		produce a witness directly linking
		Mr. Corleone to the charges we have
		made.  And then, Mr. Corleone may
		very well by liable for indictments
		of perjury.  However, this document
		will be made a matter of record.

EXT. ARMY POST - DAY

An army post somewhere in the East.  It is safely guarded.

INT. HOUSE ON THE POST - DAY

where Pentangeli is being held by his constant companions,
the two FBI MEN.

				PENTANGELI
		Ten to one shot, you said.  Ten to
		one shot in my favor, and I lose.

				FBI MAN #1
		Get a good night's sleep.  We got a
		new suit, new shirt, new tie, and
		I'm going to shave you myself.
		Tomorrow we want you to look
		respectable for fifty million of
		your fellow Americans.

				PENTANGELI
		My life won't be worth a nickel
		after tomorrow.

				FBI MAN #1
		We have a special home for you for
		the rest of your life.  Nobody gets
		near you.  You're not going any
		place.

				PENTANGELI
		Yeah, some deal I made.

				FBI MAN #2
		You live like a king.  You'll be a
		hero.  You'll live better in here
		than most people on the outside.

				PENTANGELI
		Some deal.
			(pause)
		I just wish Mike had took the Fifth.

				FBI MAN #1
		Why'd you do it, Frankie?  After
		all these years, why'd you turn
		against him?

				PENTANGELI
		I didn't turn against nobody; he
		turned against me.

EXT. THE BOATHOUSE ALCOVE - DAY

A somewhat frightened Fredo Corleone sits in the easy chair
overlooking the lake in this canopied section of the
boathouse.  Rocco sits with him.

INT. BOATHOUSE - DAY

Michael is in the dark room with Hagen and Neri.

				MICHAEL
		How did they get their hands on
		Pentangeli?

				HAGEN
		Roth engineered it, Michael.  He
		made Pentangeli think you hit him.
		Deliberately letting him get off
		alive.  Then the New York detectives
		turned Frankie over to the FBI.  My
		informants say he was half dead and
		scared stiff -- talking out loud
		that you had turned on him and
		tried to kill him.  Anyway, they
		had him on possession, dealing in
		heroin, murder one and a lot more.
		There's no way we can get to him
		and you've opened yourself to five
		points of perjury.

				NERI
		They've got him airtight.  He's in
		a military base, twenty-four hour
		guards.  Trying to kill him is like
		trying to like the President --
		it's impossible.

				MICHAEL
		What does Fredo know?

				HAGEN
		He says he doesn't know anything,
		and I believe him.  Roth played
		this one beautifully.

				MICHAEL
		Alright.  I'm going to go outside
		and talk to Fredo.

EXT. BOATHOUSE FOYER - DAY

Fredo sits on the couch.  When Rocco sees Michael, he
automatically takes his leave.  Michael sits in the chair
opposite Fredo.

				FREDO
			(after a pause)
		I don't have a lot to say, Michael.

				MICHAEL
		We have time.

				FREDO
		I was kept pretty much in the dark.
		I didn't know all that much.

				MICHAEL
		What about now, is there anything
		you can help me out with?

				FREDO
		I know they get Pentangeli, that's
		all I know.

Fredo gets up, walks to the glass panel that separates the
terrace from the lake.

				FREDO
		I didn't know it was a hit.  I
		swear to you I didn't know.  Johnny
		Ola contacted me in Beverly Hills --
		said he wanted to talk.  He said
		you and Roth were in on some big
		deal, and there was a place for me
		in it if I could help them out.
		They said you were being tough on
		the negotiation, and if they had a
		little bit of help, they could
		close it fast and it would be good
		for you.

				MICHAEL
		And you believed that story.

				FREDO
		He said there was something good in
		it for me...me on my own.

				MICHAEL
		I've always taken care of you.

				FREDO
		Taken care of me.  Mike, you're my
		kid brother, and you take care of
		my.  Did you ever think of that.
		Ever once?  Send Fredo off to do
		this, send Fredo to take care of
		that... take care of some little
		unimportant night club here, and
		there; pick somebody up at the
		airport.  Mike, I'm your older
		brother; I was stepped over!

				MICHAEL
		It's the way Pop wanted it.

				FREDO
		It wasn't the way I wanted it!  I
		can handle things.  I'm not dumb
		Christ, not like everyone says.
		I'm smart; and I want respect.

				MICHAEL
		There's nothing more you can tell
		me about this investigation?

				FREDO
		The lawyer; Questadt, he belongs to
		Roth.

				MICHAEL
		You're nothing to me now, Fredo;
		not a brother, not a friend, I
		don't want to know you, or what
		happens to you.  I don't want to
		see you at the hotels, or near my
		home.  When you visit our Mother, I
		want to know a day in advance, so I
		won't be there.  Do you understand?

Michael turns, and starts to leave.  A frightened voice
behind him:

				FREDO
		Mikey?

Michael doesn't stop, doesn't turn back.  He continues off
through the veranda, and out the summer doors.

Neri stops by him.

				MICHAEL
		I don't want anything to happen to
		him while my Mother's alive.

Michael leaves.

EXT. ARMY POST - DAY

Five cars brimming with Army guards and Agents are waiting
to move Pentangeli.  There is one empty car.

INT. GUARDED HOUSE - DAY

The two FBI Agents are helping Pentangeli get dressed.  He's
in brightly colored striped shorts and bare-chested.  The
Agents help him with the shirt and tie.  One holds out the
trousers but Pentangeli ignores it and looks at himself in
the mirror.

				FBI MAN #1
		Ready, Frankie.

				PENTANGELI
		Let's go.

The Agents open the door, and precede him, surveying the
area.  They check the cars waiting, each with two Agents.
They check the gate and note the military sentries.  Then
they stand aside, and let Pentangeli come out.  They get
close to his side, and it is obvious they will protect his
life with their own.

EXT. ARMY POST - DAY

The Agents put him in the front seat of the empty car, and
get in with him, one at each side.  Another Agent drives.
Now, the first cars start out; the Sentries opening the
gates, and letting the caravan pass.

An Army supply truck comes very close to them, and the
Agents next to Pentangeli become very tense.  Pentangeli
grins.  Then the truck passes on, and they relax.

INT. SENATE CAUCUS ROOM - DAY

The room is crowded with TV journalists, cameras, etc.  We
pick Pentangeli up, closely guarded, being led to witness
chair.

Pentangeli is seated, and made to take his oath.  FBI Agents
are all around him.

MED. VIEW

Anyone given entrance to the caucus room is being frisked.
The five Senators take their places.

VIEW ON HAGEN

waiting at his long table, very nervous.  He seems startled
by the appearance of Pentangeli.

VIEW ON PENTANGELI

catching Hagen's eye.  It's as though he is pleading for
some kind of understanding of the fact that he has become a
traitor.

VIEW ON HAGEN

cold; then he turns away.

VIEW ON THE ENTRANCE

The bustle is settling down; then Michael Corleone enters,
and with him is someone very peculiar and out of keeping for
this setting.  A burly-chested imposing man of middle age.
Very powerful-looking with frightening magnetic eyes.  His
dress is odd: boots, rough tie, and shirt.  He could be the
tenor out of a Sicilian opera.  He is clearly a country Don,
direct from Sicily, and he dominates the room.

VIEW ON PENTANGELI

At first his view is blocked.  Then he sees Michael and is a
bit shamefaced, but still defiant.

PENTANGELI'S POV

Michael returns his glances without emotion.  Then the VIEW
ALTERS, revealing the Sicilian.

VIEW ON PENTANGELI

He is terror stricken; obviously he recognizes the man.

VIEW ON HAGEN'S TABLE

Michael and the Sicilian sit by Hagen, where they can stare
directly at Pentangeli; he is frozen with fear.

VIEW ON THE SENATOR

Notices the tension in the room.  The Chairman commences:

				SENATOR KANE
		We have here a witness who will
		testify further on Michael
		Corleone's rule of the criminal
		empire that controls gambling in
		this country and perhaps in other
		countries.  This witness had no
		buffer between himself and Michael
		Corleone.  He can corroborate our
		charges on enough counts for this
		committee to consider a charge of
		perjury against Michael Corleone.
			(then he turns to Pentangeli)
		Your name please, for the record.

				PENTANGELI
		Frank Pentangeli.

				SENATOR KANE
		Were you a member of the Corleone
		Family?  Were you under the
		Caporegime Peter Clemenza, under
		Vito Corleone, known as the
		Godfather?

There is a long silence.

VIEW ON PENTANGELI

He seems unable to speak.

VIEW ON THE SICILIAN

gazing at him.

VIEW ON PENTANGELI

				PENTANGELI
		I never knew no Godfather.  I got
		my own family.

Senator Kane is stunned.  The two FBI men are alert, their
eyes searching the room for what has intimidated their
witness at the last moment.

				SENATOR KANE
		Mr. Pentangeli, you are
		contradicting your confessions to
		our investigators; I ask you again,
		were you a member of a crime
		organization headed by Michael
		Corleone?

				PENTANGELI
		No.  I never heard of it.  I never
		heard of nothing like that.  I was
		in the olive oil business with his
		father a long time ago.  That's all.

				SENATOR KANE
		We have your confession that you
		murdered on the orders of Michael
		Corleone.  Do you deny that
		confession and do you know what
		denying that confession will mean
		to you?

The die is cast and like a good soldier, Pentangeli will go
all the way now.  So he is brazen in his defiance of the
Senator.

				PENTANGELI
		The FBI guys promised me a deal.
		So I made up a lot of stuff about
		Michael Corleone.  Because then,
		that's what they wanted.  But it
		was all lies.  Everything.  They
		said Michael Corleone did this,
		Michael Corleone did that.  So I
		said, "Yeah, sure."

He makes a big grin to show how he has made fools of
everybody.

VIEW ON THE FBI AGENTS

glancing around the room; their eyes have settled on the
Sicilian.  One of them scribbles a note on a piece of paper,
and passes it to the Committee lawyer.  Then in turn it goes
to Senator Kane.

				SENATOR KANE
		Mr. Hagen, would you kindly identify
		to this committee that gentleman
		sitting on your right hand?

				HAGEN
			(coolly)
		Yes, sir.  His name is Vincenzo
		Pentangeli.

				SENATOR KANE
		Is he related to the witness?

				HAGEN
		He is, I believe, a brother.

VIEW ON MICHAEL AND VINCENZO PENTANGELI

They wait with no expression.

				SENATOR KANE
			(to Vincenzo Pentangeli)
		Sir, I would like you to take the
		stand.

Vincenzo stares at him, uncomprehending.  There may just be
a shadow of contempt.  He doesn't answer.

				HAGEN
		Sir, the gentleman does not
		understand English.  He would not
		in any case, take the stand.  He
		came, at his own expense, to aid
		his brother in his trouble.  He is
		not under any jurisdiction of our
		government and his reputation in
		his own country is impeccable.

				SENATOR KANE
			(furious)
		The witness is excused; take him out.

The guards and FBI Agents quickly remove Pentangeli, as
everybody else in the room is required to sit still.

				HAGEN
		Senator Kane.

				SENATOR KANE
		This meeting is adjourned.

				HAGEN
			(rising and shouting)
		This committee owes an apology!

				SENATOR KANE
		The committee is adjourned until
		further notice.

For the first time, in the midst of the confusion, Hagen
smiles.  A bitter, contemptuous smile.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

The modest champion.  He rises and they take their leave.

VIEW ON THE TWO FBI AGENTS

They watch the Corleone party as they exit.

INT. WASHINGTON HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY

The Corleone nurse is waiting, playing with the little girl
MARY.  A distance away, the boy, Anthony, is standing by
himself.

INT. MICHAEL'S SUITE - WASHINGTON HOTEL - DAY

The door to Michael's suite opens; Rocco leans in.

				ROCCO
		It's Kay.

Michael is sitting in an easy chair; he seems to have
difficulty with his eyes.

				MICHAEL
		On the phone?

				ROCCO
		No, she's here.

Michael rises, surprised.  Rocco steps back, and Kay enters.

				MICHAEL
		I had no idea...

				KAY
		I wanted to see you before you went
		back to Nevada.  Also, the
		children - Michael, they're here.

				MICHAEL
		Where?

				KAY
		In a minute.  They're outside with
		Esther.  I'm very happy for you...
		I suppose I knew that you're simply
		too smart for anyone ever to beat
		you.

				MICHAEL
		Why don't you sit down?

				KAY
		I'm not going to stay long; I can't.

				MICHAEL
		There are a lot of things I want to
		talk to you about.  Things I've
		been thinking about -- changes I
		want to make.

				KAY
		I think it's too late for changes,
		Michael.  I promised myself I
		wouldn't talk about it and I've
		gone and spoiled it.

				MICHAEL
		Why too late?

				KAY
		Tell me, Michael.  What really
		happened with Pentangeli?

				MICHAEL
		His brother came to help him.

				KAY
		I didn't even know he had a brother.
		And where is he now?

				MICHAEL
		On a plane back to Sicily.

				KAY
		And that's all he had to do.  Just
		show his face.

				MICHAEL
		That's all.  You see, in Sicily, in
		the old days... there was only one
		legitimate reason to kill a blood
		relative... only one.  IF he was a
		traitor.

				KAY
		You would have killed his brother?

				MICHAEL
		Kay, you've got it wrong.  That
		kind of thing's all over, I promised
		you.  This was between the two
		brothers.  Years ago Frankie had a
		young girlfriend; he called her his
		co-wife.  That was his joke, but he
		meant it.  He wouldn't divorce his
		wife... because she was a great
		cook.  He said he girlfriend made a
		spaghetti sauce once and it was so
		terrible he knew he could never
		marry her.  He set her up in a
		house in Jersey.  She had to be
		faithful... and she had to have kids.
		And she did, two, a boy and a girl.
		He had her checked out and watched
		so she couldn't cheat... but the
		girl couldn't stand that kind of
		life.  She begged him to let her go.
		He did.  He gave her money and made
		her give up the kids.  Then Frankie
		took them to Italy, and had them
		brought up by his brother Vincenzo.
		Where he knew they'd by safe.

Kay begins to realize.

				MICHAEL
		When he saw his brother in the
		hearing room, he knew what was at
		stake.
			(pause)
		I don't think Vincenzo would have
		done it.  He loves the kids, too.
		Omerta, Kay.  Honor, silence.  It
		had nothing to do with me.  It was
		between those brothers.

				KAY
		I'll bring the children up now;
		they want to say goodbye.

				MICHAEL
		Kay, I told you...

				KAY
		Goodbye, Michael.

				MICHAEL
		I won't let you leave!  Christ, do
		you think I'm going to let you leave.

				KAY
			(meekly)
		Michael.

				MICHAEL
		No, I don't want to hear anything.
		There are things between men and
		women that will not change; things
		that have been the same for
		thousands of years.  You are my
		wife, and they are my children...
		and I love you and I will not let
		you leave, because you are MINE!

				KAY
		Oh, I do feel things for you,
		Michael; but now, I think it's pity.
		For the first time since I've known
		you, you seem so helpless.  You
		held me a prisoner once; will you
		try again?

				MICHAEL
		If that's what it takes; then yes,
		I will.

				KAY
		At this moment, I feel no love for
		you at all.  I never thought that
		could happen, but it has.

				MICHAEL
		We'll go back tonight.  Bring the
		children.

				KAY
		You haven't heard me.

He moves to her; he does love her, and is tender with her.

				MICHAEL
		How can I let you leave; how can I
		let you take my children away?
		Don't you know me?  You understand,
		it's an impossibility.  I would
		never let it happen; no, never, not
		if it took all my strength, all my
		cunning.  But in time, soon, you'll
		feel differently.  You see, you'll
		be happy that I stopped you.  I
		know you.  You'll forget about
		this; you'll forget about the baby
		we lost... and we'll go on, you and
		I.

				KAY
		The baby I lost...

				MICHAEL
		I know what it meant... and I'm
		prepared to make it up to you.  I
		will make changes; I can.
			(he clenches his fist tightly)
		I CAN change; that I have learned,
		that I have the strength to change...
		And we have another child, a boy...
		and you'll forget the miscarriage.

				KAY
		It wasn't a miscarriage.  And you
		with your cunning, couldn't you
		figure it out!  It was an abortion;
		an abortion, like our marriage is
		an abortion, something unholy and
		evil.  I don't want your son; I
		wouldn't bring another of your sons
		into this world.  An abortion,
		Michael... it was a son, and I had
		it killed, but this must all end!

VIEW ON MICHAEL

He had no hint, not in his wildest imagination could he have
guessed that she would do such a thing.

				KAY
		And I know that now it's over; I
		knew it then, there would be no way
		you could ever forgive me, not with
		this Sicilian thing that goes back
		two thousand years.

He is silent, though raging -- then, with all his passion,
and his strength, he raises his arms, and strikes her across
her neck, literally knocking her down to the floor, and
hurting her badly.

				MICHAEL
			(coldly)
		You won't take my children.

							FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. THE CORLEONE ESTATE AT TAHOE - FULL VIEW - DAY

A collection of dark cars and black limousines are gathered
to one side.  A few drivers wait quietly.

And then, to the other extreme of the estate, is a small
grouping of about twenty to thirty people, gathered near
Michael's house.

MED. CLOSE SHOT

Connie Corleone, dressed simply and now showing her age
without the carefully applied makeup which we have been used
to, kneels down before the shrine of Santa Theresa, and puts
down a bouquet of flowers, along with others that have been
placed there.  We see that some have the simple silk ribbon
with the word "Mama" hand-lettered upon it.

Her two children stand close behind her; they had been
raised by their Grandmother.

Connie steps back, and moves through the small group of
friends and relatives, into Michael's house.

INT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - CONNIE'S VIEW - DAY

Fredo, kneeling by the coffin of his mother in a portion of
the house that has been set aside for the wake.  Fredo
concludes his prayer, wipes away the tears in his eyes and
steps away from the coffin.

He stops when he notices Neri, a little distance away,
looking at him.

VIEW ON NERI

After a moment, he nods respectfully to Fredo, and steps
forward, moving to the old woman's coffin.  Fredo moves to
Hagen, who is there with his wife and children.

				FREDO
		Tom.  Where's Mike?

				HAGEN
			(difficult to tell him)
		He's waiting for you to leave.

				FREDO
		Can I talk to him?

				HAGEN
		No chance.  I'm sorry, Freddie.

				CONNIE
			(who has heard this)
		Can I see him?

				HAGEN
		He's in the boathouse.

INT. THE BOATHOUSE - MED. VIEW - DAY

Michael sits quietly in the darkened room in one of the big
sofas, dressed immaculately in suit and tie.  His two
children, also dressed for the wake sit opposite him in the
other oversized sofa, their shoes not touching the floor.
We regard this tableau for a long moment.

				CONNIE (O.S.)
			(quietly)
		Michael?  It's Connie.

She comes in, and sits down by his knees.

				CONNIE
		I want to stay close to home now,
		is that alright?

Michael nods.

				CONNIE
		Is Kay coming?

				MICHAEL
		No.

				CONNIE
		Michael, Fredo's in the house with
		Mama.  He asked for you, and Tom
		said he couldn't see you.

				MICHAEL
		Tom is right.

				CONNIE
		Kids, why don't you go outside for
		a while?

The children don't move; Connie realizes they will only
listen to Michael.

				CONNIE
		I want to talk to you, Michael.

				MICHAEL
		The children can stay.

				CONNIE
		I hated you for so long, Michael;
		for so many years.  I think I did
		things to myself, to hurt myself,
		so that you would know -- and you
		would be hurt too.  But I understand
		you now; I think I do.  You were
		being strong for all of us, like
		Papa was.  And I forgive you, and
		want to be close to you now.  Can't
		you forgive Fredo; he's so sweet,
		and helpless without you.

Slowly, Michael puts his hand on her hair, and touches her
gently.

				CONNIE
		You need me, Michael.  I want to be
		with you now.

INT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - DAY

Friends, relatives; Francesca and her new husband, Gardner
and their baby; Sandra Corleone; Teresa, her children; all
the familiar faces of the family are present, quietly paying
their respects to Mama.

Some of the men can be seen in the kitchen, drinking wine,
and talking in low voices.

Fredo is there, broken-hearted over the loss of his Mother;
like some lost child with no friends.

MED. VIEW

Michael enters the room, followed by Connie, who tends
little Mary and Anthony.

He approaches his brother, and then embraces.  Fredo breaks
into tears.

				FREDO
		Christ, Mike.  Jesus Christ, Mike.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

embracing his brother, he glances up.

VIEW ON NERI

quiet, and deadly.

EXT. THE TAHOE ESTATE - MED. VIEW - DAY

Tom Hagen is talking in the distance to his wife, and one of
his older sons; he kisses, and moves toward the boathouse.
After crossing the lawn, he stops.

VIEW ON SANDRA CORLEONE

waiting there; obviously wanting to talk to him.  He
continues, and she walks with him.

MOVING VIEW ON THE TWO

as they cross toward the boathouse.

				SANDRA
		You're going to talk to him now.

				HAGEN
		Yes.

				SANDRA
		Will you tell him?

				HAGEN
		I don't know.

She stops him.

				SANDRA
		Tom, think of yourself for once.
		Don't let this opportunity slip
		through your fingers; don't do it.
		We're all trapped here, don't you
		see?

He continues past her, without answering her.  Continues up
to the boathouse.  He stops before he enters.

HAGEN'S VIEW

Fredo is sitting by the edge of the harbor with Michael's
son Anthony; he is helping him with some fishing rig.

INT. THE BOATHOUSE - VIEW ON MICHAEL - DAY

looking through the window at his son and brother.  Neri
sits in the room, dressed informally.

				MICHAEL
			(without looking back)
		Sit down, Tom.  Have you heard
		about our friend and partner, Mr.
		Hyman Roth?

				HAGEN
		I know he's in Israel.

				NERI
			(hands Hagen the paper)
		The High Court of Israel turned
		down his request to live as a
		'returned Jew.' His passport's been
		invalidated except for return to
		the U.S.  He landed in Buenos Aires
		yesterday, offered a gift of one
		million dollars if they would give
		him citizenship.  They turned him
		down.

				HAGEN
			(reading)
		He's going to try Panama...

				MICHAEL
		They won't take him; not for a
		million, not for ten million.

				HAGEN
		His medical condition is reported
		as... "terminal."

				MICHAEL
		He's been dying of the same heart
		attack for twenty years.

				HAGEN
		That plane goes to Miami...

				MICHAEL
		I want it met.

				HAGEN
			(understanding)
		Mike, it's impossible.  He'll be
		met by the Internal Revenue; the
		Customs Service, and half the FBI.

				MICHAEL
		I don't like it when you use the
		word impossible; nothing is
		impossible...

				HAGEN
		Mike, it would be like trying to
		kill the President; there's no way
		we can get to him.

				MICHAEL
		I'm surprised at you, Tom.  If
		there's anything certain; certain
		in life; if history has taught us
		anything, it's that you can kill...
			(he stops, then coldly)
		ANYBODY.  But perhaps your
		relucatance is because you've come
		to tell me that you're moving your
		family to Vegas, that you've been
		offered the Vice-Presidency of the
		Houstan Hotels there.  Or weren't
		you going to tell me at all?

				HAGEN
		Are you so hungry for traitors; do
		you want to find them everywhere?

				MICHAEL
		They are everywhere!

				HAGEN
		I turned Houstan down; I didn't see
		why I should tell you about an
		offer I turned down.
			(Michael begins to
			confuse him)
		Are you sure, Mikey?  Are you sure
		of what we're doing; what we'll
		gain; what does the family gain?
		Forget that, Mike; I already know
		the answer.

				MICHAEL
		I know you do, Tom.  Then I can
		count on you to help me do the
		things I have to do.  If not, call
		Houstan, and become a Vice-President.
		Take your family and your mistress
		and move them to Las Vegas.

				HAGEN
		Why do you hurt me, Michael?  I've
		always been loyal to you.

				MICHAEL
		Good.  Then you're staying.

				HAGEN
		I'm staying.
			(he pauses...then,
			without being asked)
		Don't ever enjoy the cruel part of
		all this; Sonny never listened to
		me about that.
			(then he sits down,
			and opens his briefcase)
		Now, explain everything to me.

EXT. THE HARBOR - DAY

Fredo sits with Anthony, with a silly-looking fishing hat on
his head, covered with lure and flies.

				FREDO
		Anthony, ole buddy, your Uncle
		Fredo's gonna teach you how to
		catch the big fish.  You know, when
		I was a kid, I did this amazing
		thing.  I went out on a fishing
		trip; me and my brothers and my
		Pop, and no one could catch a fish
		except me.  And this was my secret:
			(confidentially)
		Every time I would put the line
		down I would say a "Hail Mary" and
		every time I said a "Hail Mary" I
		would catch a fish.  Now, when it's
		sunset, we're gonna go out on the
		lake, and we're gonna try it.

INT. GUARDED HOUSE - DAY

The guards step aside as Tom Hagen enters the foyer of the
house.  He shows a court order to them and they lead him up
the stairs where he knocks on the door.

INT. GUARDED HOUSE - DAY

There is a KNOCK at the door.  The two guards show Hagen in
and Hagen presents the court order to one of the FBI men.

				HAGEN
		I think I prefer to see my client
		privately.

				PENTANGELI
		The room has a bug in it.

				HAGEN
			(to the FBI men)
		I'd like to go outside with him, in
		the open air.

				FBI MAN #1
		This room is not bugged.

				HAGEN
		You have guards outside and the
		electric fence.  There's no security
		reason for not letting us talk in
		the yard.

				FBI MAN #1
		Okay.

They pass out of the room.

EXT. THE ARMY POST - DAY

Hagen and Pentangeli outside, by the electric fence.  They
cannot be overheard.  Pentangeli takes out some cigars and
offers Hagen one.  Hagen takes it and Pentangeli lights both
their cigars.  They puff on them contentedly.  They are
comfortable together, almost.

				HAGEN
		Everything is going to be okay,
		Frankie, don't worry.

				PENTANGELI
		Did my brother go back?

				HAGEN
		Yeah, but don't worry.

				PENTANGELI
		He's ten times tougher than me, my
		brother.  He's old-fashioned.

				HAGEN
		Yeah.  He wouldn't even go out to
		dinner.  Just wanted to go home.

				PENTANGELI
		That's my brother.  Nothing could
		get him away from that two mule
		town.  He coulda been big over
		here -- he could of had his own
		Family.

				HAGEN
		You're right.

				PENTANGELI
		Tom, what do I do now?

The light is beginning to turn reddish as the sun falls.

				HAGEN
		Frankie, you were always interested
		in politics, in history.  I remember
		you talking about Hitler back in
		'43.  We were young then.

				PENTANGELI
		Yeah, I still read a lot.  They
		bring me stuff.

				HAGEN
		You were around the old timers who
		dreamed up how the Families should
		be organized, how they based it on
		the old Roman Legions, and called
		them 'Regimes'... with the 'Capos'
		and 'Soldiers,' and it worked.

				PENTANGELI
		Yeah, it worked.  Those were great
		old days.  We was like the Roman
		Empire.  The Corleone family was
		like the Roman Empire.

				HAGEN
			(sadly)
		Yeah, it was once.

They both puff on their cigars.  Pentangeli lets himself be
carried away by thoughts of old days of glory; Hagen thinks
of other days too.

				HAGEN
			(very gently)
		The Roman Empire... when a plot
		against the Emperor failed, the
		plotters were always given a chance
		to let their families keep their
		fortunes.

				PENTANGELI
		Yeah, but only the rich guys.  The
		little guys got knocked off.  If
		they got arrested and executed, all
		their estate went to the Emperor.
		If they just went home and killed
		themselves, up front, nothing
		happened.

				HAGEN
		Yeah, that was a good break.  A
		nice deal.

Pentangeli looks at Hagen; he understands.

				PENTANGELI
		They went home and sat in a hot
		bath and opened their veins, and
		bled to death.  Sometimes they gave
		a little party before they did it.

Hagen throws away his cigar.  Pentangeli puffs on his.

				HAGEN
		Don't worry about anything, Frankie
		Five-Angels.

				PENTANGELI
		Thanks, Tom.  Thanks.

They shake hands.  The FBI Agents come out to let Hagen out
the gate.  Pentangeli is led back to the house.

				FBI MAN #1
		Your lawyer tell you he can get
		that 600 years reduced to 500?

Pentangeli puffs on his cigar and reflects.

				PENTANGELI
		You boys sure you can't get me a
		broad for tonight?  Give me a
		little party?

				FBI MAN #2
		We got some nice books.

Pentangeli puffs on his cigar and gives the Agent a smile an
old man gives a child.  He starts upstairs.

				PENTANGELI
		I guess I'll just take a hot bath.

EXT. THE ARMY POST - DAY

Hagen walks away; glances back.  Then gets into his waiting
car and drives off.

INT. THE BOATHOUSE - FULL VIEW - SUNSET

Michael sits alone in the empty boathouse; in the shadows.

INT. BOAT DOCK - SUNSET

Neri stands by the dock area under the boathouse.  He pushes
the button which lowers a boat by winch and tackle.  He
wears a fishing cap.

He steps into the boat, and pulls the small outboard, which
glides the boat out into the harbor.

MED. VIEW

The boat pulls up alongside Fredo and Anthony.

				FREDO
		Here we go; and remember the secret.

He lifts Anthony into the boat.

				CONNIE (O.S.)
		Anthony.

THEIR VIEW

Connie, in houseclothes, is calling Anthony.

				FREDO
		He's here; we're goin' fishing.

				CONNIE
		He can't go; Michael wants to take
		him into Reno.

				FREDO
		Ah.  Okay, kid, you got to go to
		Reno with your Pop.

He lifts the boy out of the boat, and puts him on the shore.

				FREDO
		I'll catch one for you, with the
		secret.

				CONNIE
		Hurry, Anthony.

Neri stands the motor; and the boat with the two fisherman
glides off.

INT. HIGH SECURITY HOUSE IN ARMY POST - NIGHT

The FBI man knocks on the bathroom door in the house where
they have kept Pentangeli.

				FBI MAN #1
		Frankie, open up.  You okay?

No answer; he hammers on the door.  Using his elbow, and
then a kick he breaks into the bathroom.

HIS VIEW

Pentangeli lying in a tub of water.  His stomach shows above
it.  His wrists are cut and covered with blood.  The bath
water has a purplish tone.

				FBI MAN
		Mr. Roth, we have to take you into

				ROTH
		Yes, I know.

Some flashbulbs go off.

				REPORTER
		Can you give us your reaction to

				ROTH
		I am a retired investor on a

				REPORTER
		Is it true you are worth over three
		hundred million dollars, Mr. Roth?

				ROTH
		I'm a retired investor, living on a

One of the newspapermen laughing we recognize to be Rocco
Lampone.

He moves closer to Roth, and shoves his revolver right
against his head, and in a second, on camera, assassinates
Roth.  People scream, as Rocco attempts to run down the
airport corridor, limping as he does.

FBI men easily pick him off.

							FADE OUT.

EXT. THE DRIVEWAY BY MICHAEL'S HOUSE - DAY

A taxi cab waits by the house; its driver sleeping with a
newspaper over his face.

INT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - DAY

The cleaning woman, Esther, who had been with Kay for years,
sits by the dining room table, weeping profusely.  Behind
her, in the recreation room, we can see the tableau of Kay
sitting on the couch, her little daughter Mary, between her
knees, talking quietly about things we cannot hear.  Her son
Anthony sits by himself, in another chair by the side of the
room.

MED. VIEW

Connie comes into the house quickly, and moves toward them.

				CONNIE
		Kay, you have to go.

This prompts Esther to weep all the more.  Kay hugs her
daughter, and kisses her many times.

				CONNIE
		You have to hurry; he's coming.

Kay puts her coat on; then stands, and reaches out for her
son.

				KAY
		Anthony, kiss Mama goodbye.

He doesn't move.

				CONNIE
			(angrily)
		Anthony, you kiss your Mother
		goodbye!

He rises, and walks to her.  Hugs her lifelessly.

MED. CLOSE VIEW

on Kay, kissing her boy.

				KAY
		Anthony, say goodbye; your Mama
		loves you.

				ANTHONY
		Goodbye.

She restrains any tears; she has become too strong for tears.
Kay starts to go; picks up Mary, kisses her, and starts to go.

NEW VIEW

She steps out the kitchen door; then she cannot help herself.
Crouches down, outside, and calls to her son.

				KAY
		Anthony, kiss me once.

Then she looks up, and slowly rises.

HER VIEW

Michael has stepped into the dining room.  He seems older
somehow; as though some sickness has taken more years away
from him.

VIEW ON KAY

looks at him; instinctively, she takes a step back.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

slowly steps toward her.

VIEW ON KAY

Another step back; the door is still open.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

He moves closer to the door; stops, looks at her.  And then
closes it obscuring any view of her.

EXT. TAHOE ESTATE - DAY

It is late fall -- most of the leaves have fallen on the
grounds and there is quite a wind.

MED. VIEW

The water is whipped up by the wind, and the waves are high
as they break against the pavilion.  We HEAR the MUSIC of
time passing, of Michael, of the Godfather over these images.

VIEW ON THE SWIMMING POOLS

They have not been used in several months; they are drained
and the bottoms are mossy and dark.

VIEW ON THE MAIN GATE

Leaves blowing past it; we don't see the button men; only a
hint of someone in the gatehouse.

VIEW ON THE HOUSES

Some of the houses have had the summer awnings taken down,
and put away.  Some of the windows have been boarded up.

VIEW ON THE KENNELS

There are still the guard dogs; some sleeping, some moving
impatiently.

As the MUSIC concludes its statement.

MED. VIEW

The peninsula of the private Corleone Harbor.  We see the
figures of two people, seated at a table.

MED. VIEW

Michael sits at a table having a sparse lunch.  He is
attended by his sister Connie, who seems to be the closest
person now living on the estate with him.  We see from the
way she pampers him with his lunch, that she has fallen into
the role of a surrogate Mother-Wife.  He seems older than
his years, as though his illness, diabetes, has taken its
toll.

				CONNIE
		Don't worry; I'm sure he got here
		on time.  The roads from the
		airport are so windy, it takes
		forever; I've driven them myself.

She picks up some of the serving plates that he has left
untouched.

				CONNIE
		I'll bring him out to you as soon
		as he comes.

She moves back to the main house.

MED. CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL

He turns and looks at the rough water of the lake for a
moment.  He slowly takes a sip of wine.

EXT. A PLACE IN THE GARDEN - DAY

There are a few chairs.

MED. VIEW ON ANTHONY CORLEONE

He is eighteen years old.

				ANTHONY
		Hello, Dad.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

squinting up at his son.

				MICHAEL
		Anthony.

He rises, and reaches up to his son, who is now taller than
he; he embraces him.

				MICHAEL
		You've grown so tall... so tall in
		the last year.  You're much taller
		than me.

				ANTHONY
		I was taller than you when I was
		fourteen.

				MICHAEL
		Sit down.  Your Aunt Connie and I
		waited for you to have some lunch,
		but now it's all dried out.

				ANTHONY
		I'm not hungry.

				MICHAEL
		Well, that's alright... alright.
		Good.  You'll graduate in another
		year, isn't that right?  You know...
		I never finished college.  I was a
		good student, but I never finished.
		Of course, there was a war then.

Connie approaches them.

				CONNIE
		Don't let me interrupt anything,
		this will just take a second.  Here.
			(she takes out a
			small needle, and
			begins to prepare it)
		Your father has to have his insulin
		shot.  Why don't you go to your
		room and put your things away,
		Anthony.

She begins to give Michael the shot.

				MICHAEL
		Hurry back; we'll talk.  We'll talk.

Anthony goes on his way to the house with his things.
Connie gives Michael the shot.

				CONNIE
		Whenever I see that lake so cold, I
		think of poor Fredo, drowned.  Lake
		Tahoe is very cold.  They say if a
		person drowns in it, that the body
		will remain mid-suspended --
		perfectly preserved.  Some say it
		will remain forever.

She finishes the shot, puts her things away.

				CONNIE
		Your boy will be right back.

She leaves.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

Alone in the garden.

OUR VIEW begins to MOVE CLOSER to him.  We begin to HEAR
MUSIC of the forties; happy music, swing music, as we move
CLOSER to Michael.

INT. OLD CORLEONE HOUSE - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

SONNY CORLEONE, his arm wrapped around a smiling red-faced
Carlo Rizzi, pulls him into the Corleone dining room.

				SONNY
		Hey, who knows my buddy Carlo Rizzi.
		Here... my brother Fredo, here's my
		Mom.  Mom, whatcha got cooking?
		And Carlo, this is my kid sister
		Connie.  Here, pull up a chair,
		Carol is sitting next to Connie.
		Oh, the droopy kid over there is
		Mike.  The college boy.

An older, lanky man enters the room, his arms laden with
presents.  This is TESSIO.

				TESSIO
		Buon Natale, everybody.  Buon
		Natale...
			(he smiles at Tom Hagen)
		Hi, Tom, how's every little thing?

				HAGEN
			(helping him with the presents)
		Wonderful, Sal.

Now the study door opens, and DON CORLEONE enters.

				DON CORLEONE
		Is dinner ready?

				MOM
		Two minutes.

The Don happily regards his family; his sons and daughters
and even some Grandchildren.  He raises a glass.

				DON CORLEONE
		A good life, a long life to all my
		children, and friends.  To my
		grandchildren, and those that will
		be.  To our family.

They all drink.

They refill glasses; then Tessio proposes a toast.

				TESSIO
		To our Godfather.

They all drink.

INT. THE DINING ROOM - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

The family is happily at Christmas dinner.  Don Corleone
seated at the head of the table.

				SONNY
		What'd you think of those Japs, eh?
		The nerve of those Japs, coming
		right here in our own backyard
		dropping bombs!

				HAGEN
		Well, we could have expected it
		after the embargo.

				SONNY
		Hey!  Expect it or not, those Japs
		don't have a right to drop bombs in
		our backyard.  Whose side you on?

				MAMA
		Please, do we have to talk about
		the war at the table?  On Christmas,
		much less.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

He has been listening to this discussion.

				MICHAEL
		Pop, I've decided I'm going to
		enlist.

A quiet hush descends over the table, as though everyone
knows the effect this will have on the old man.  Sonny tries
to make light of it.

				SONNY
		Kid, stay in college.  The girls
		are cuter, if you know what I mean.

				HAGEN
		Pop had to pull a lot of strings to
		get you your deferment.

				MICHAEL
		I never asked for it; I don't want
		it.

VIEW ON DON CORLEONE

Disturbed; but wise and prudent.

				DON CORLEONE
		My son wants to talk about this,
		and so we'll talk, but not at the
		dinner table.

He rises, and starts across the room toward his study.  Then
he looks back.

				DON CORLEONE
		Michael.

He disappears into his study.  Michael rises, glances around.
People are generally tense over the situation.  Michael
follows his father into the study.

INT. DON CORLEONE'S OLD STUDY - NIGHT

The Don closes the door behind his son, and then moves
across the room.  He stops at the little bar there, and
pours himself a brandy.

				DON CORLEONE
		Would you like some?

				MICHAEL
		No, Dad.

				DON CORLEONE
		Now what is this talk about joining
		the army?  Eh?

				MICHAEL
		It's not talk; I'm doing it.

				DON CORLEONE
		You would risk your life for
		strangers?

				MICHAEL
		Not for strangers; for my country.

				DON CORLEONE
		Anyone not in your family, is a
		stranger.  Believe me, when trouble
		comes, your country won't take care
		of you.

				MICHAEL
		That's how it was in the old world,
		Pop, but this is not Sicily.

				DON CORLEONE
		I know.  I know, Michael.  It's
		Christmas, your brothers and sister
		are all here -- we are happy.
		Let's not spoil this.  Go your own
		way, but when you are ready, come
		to me the way a son should.  I have
		hopes for you...

looking at his father with a mixture of great love, and also
fear, and confusion.

SECOND DRAFT

September 24, 1973





FADE IN:

The Paramount Pictures logo is presented over a simple black
background, as a single trumpet plays the familiar theme of
a waltz.  White lettering fades in:

		     Mario Puzo's THE GODFATHER

There is a pause, as the trumpet concludes, and there is the
additional title: - Part Two -

INT. DON CORLEONE'S OLD OFFICE - CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL
CORLEONE - DAY

standing impassively, like a young Prince, recently crowned
King.

CLOSE VIEW ON Michael's hand.  ROCCO LAMPONE kisses his hand.
Then it is taken away.  We can SEE only the empty desk and
chair of Michael's father, Vito Corleone.  We HEAR, over
this, very faintly a funeral dirge played in the distance,
as THE VIEW MOVES SLOWLY CLOSER to the empty desk and chair.

								DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. A SICILIAN LANDSCAPE - FULL VIEW - DAY

We can barely make out the funeral procession passing over
the burnt-brown of a dry river bed.  The figures move
slowly, seemingly from out of hundreds of years of the past.

The MUSICIANS walking unsteadily on the rocky bed, their
instruments harsh and blaring.

They are followed by six young peasant men, carrying the
crude wooden coffin on their shoulders.  Then the widow, a
strong large woman, dressed in black, and not accepting the
arms of those walking with her.

Behind her, not more than twenty relatives, few children and
paisani continue alone behind the coffin.

Suddenly, we HEAR the shots of the lupara, and the musicians
stop their playing.  The entire procession scatters in odd
directions along the rocky river bed.

The young men struggle with the burden of the heavy coffin,
throwing it out of balance and nearly crashing to the ground.
We hear a woman SCREAMING:

				WOMAN
			(Sicilian)
		They've killed young Paolo!  They've
		killed the boy Paolo!

EXT. SICILIAN LANDSCAPE - MED. VIEW - DAY

across the slain body of a fourteen year old boy, lying on
the parched ground.  In the distance we see four or five of
the mourning women, the wind blowing their black dresses and
veils, running up to the body of the boy.  They begin to
wail, and cry out in anguished Sicilian, as the widow, the
mother of the murdered boy, holds her child in her arms, his
fresh blood wetting her strong hands.

EXT. BARONIAL ESTATE - TIGHT MOVING VIEW - DAY

A boy, eight or nine, with wide, frightened eyes, being
pulled quickly by the hand.  This is VITO ANDOLINI, who is
to become The Godfather.

The VIEW ALTERS revealing that he is being pulled along by
his Mother, the Widow, across a field leading to the
ornamental gates of a Baronial Estate of some forgotten Noble.

At various positions near the gates are men with shotguns,
or lupara.  The gates are opened; and the Widow and her boy
are shown before DON FRANCESCO, a man in his sixties.  He
wears his trousers with suspenders, and an open white shirt
sloppily tucked in over his enormous belly.  He wears a hat
to protect him from the white-hot sun, and proudly displays
a gold watch and chain over his vest.

He sits in a chair, near a group of his men in the garden,
listening to the Widow, who stands before him with her only
son.

				WIDOW
			(Sicilian)
		Don Francesco.  You murdered my
		husband, because he would not bend.
		And his oldest son Paolo, because
		he swore revenge.  But Vitone is
		only nine, and dumb-witted.  He
		never speaks.

				DON FRANCESCO
			(Sicilian)
		I'm not afraid of his words.

				WIDOW
			(Sicilian)
		He is weak.

				DON FRANCESCO
			(Sicilian)
		He will grow strong.

				WIDOW
			(Sicilian)
		The child cannot harm you.

				DON FRANCESCO
			(Sicilian)
		He will be a man, and then he will
		come for revenge.

As she pleads, the Widow moves closer to the Don, until she
has practically thrown herself to her knees before him.

				WIDOW
			(Sicilian)
		I beg you, Don Francesco, spare my
		only son.  He is all I have.  In
		the name of the Holy Spirit, I
		swear he will never be a danger to
		you...

Suddenly, she reaches under her skirt, where she has hidden
a kitchen knife.

				WIDOW
			(continuing)
		But I will kill you myself!
			(she lunges at the
			Mafia chieftain)
		Vitone, go!

The boy runs as fast as he can out through the gates.  Then
there is a lupara blast.  He turns, and sees his Mother
flung a distance of five feet from the short range of the
terrible blast of the shotgun.  Then he sees the men turn
their attention to him.  One fires at him; but the boy is
quick, and disappears into a grove of olive trees.

EXT. STREETS OF CORLEONE - NIGHT

Two men roam the deserted streets of Corleone, carrying
lupare.  Every so often, they stop, and one shouts in a
loud, almost singsong voice, like a fish peddler.  Their
names are MOSCA and STROLLO.

				MOSCA
			(Sicilian)
		Our Friend promises misery to
		anyone who harbors the boy Vito
		Andolini.
			(he turns and shouts
			in the other direction)
		Our Friend promises misery to
		anyone who harbors the boy Vito
		Andolini.

INT. A HOUSE - NIGHT

A family quietly eats their dinner.  The father is the local
policeman, as indicated by his uniform jacket and gun,
hanging nearby.

				STROLLO
			(Sicilian, O.S.)
		Our Friend will be hard with any
		family who gives help to Vito
		Andolini.

One of the children looks up, about to speak.  But the
father sternly indicates that nothing must be said.  They go
on with their dinner.

EXT. THE STREETS OF CORLEONE - FULL VIEW - NIGHT

The men continue walking up and throughout the streets, far
in the distance.

				MOSCA
			(Sicilian O.S.)
		...misery to any family who harbors
		the boy, Vito...

INT. A BARN - NIGHT

Four little girls watch with wide eyes as their mother and
father bind Vito tightly in swaddled cloth, and then lift
him up to the side of a mule; counter-balancing a heavy load
of firewood.  The father looks at the boy's almost stoically
calm little face.

				FATHER
			(Sicilian)
		Vito...We pray for you.

He pulls the fabric over the boy's face.

				MOSCA
			(Sicilian O.S.)
		...Andolini...

				STROLLO
			(Sicilian O.S.)
		Our Friend promises misery to any
		family...

EXT. THE CHURCH PLAZA - NIGHT

The men continue on their night-walk, up to the plaza of the
church.

				STROLLO
			(Sicilian)
		...who harbors the boy Vitone
		Andolini.

The figure of a single man on a mule passes them.

				MOSCA
			(Sicilian)
		Let no one give help to the boy
		Vito Andolini...

The man on the mule makes his way out of the village and
disappears into the distance.

We begin to hear, very quietly, the Waltz repeated once again.

EXT. STEAMSHIP - CLOSE VIEW ON VITO - DAY

huddled in blankets, on the deck of the ship in Steerage.
He does not say a word.  The Waltz grows louder as the VIEW
ALTERS, revealing the hundreds of immigrant families huddled
together with all their earthly possessions on their way to
America.

Then, suddenly, the Waltz stops.

THE NEW YORK HARBOR - DAY

SILENCE.  We glide past the Statue of Liberty.

VIEW on the IMMIGRANTS standing on shipboard silently;
looking.  Vito is standing with them, his eyes wide.

CAMERA MOVES IN on the statue, then MOVING PAST, on to the
beautiful buildings of Ellis Island.

EXT. ELLIS ISLAND - DAY

A tugboat pulls a barge brimming with immigrants into the
Ellis Island harbor.  Uniformed officials of the Immigration
Service load them up toward the main building.

INT. ELLIS PROCESSING HALL - DAY

The hundreds of immigrant families sit on rows of benches in
the great hall.  Various painted lines lead to the steps and
processing rooms above.

There is the babble of many interviews going on
simultaneously, uncertainly, in different languages.

Vito is bundled in an old coat, with a large tag pinned on
it: "Vitone Andolini -- Corleone, Sicilia."

He stands, moves up in the line, when several other immigrant
boys, older than he, rush up an push him back in the line.
Weak from the trip, he falls to the floor.  The boys laugh,
derisive in a language he cannot understand.  He struggles
to his feet, lifting his makeshift bags; staring at them in
an icy hatred.

INT. PROCESSING ROOM - DAY

Three or four interviews are crowded into the small room;
they are conducted in English.  From the expression on
Vito's face, and from the fragmented of the English, we
realize that he doesn't understand a word of it.

				OFFICIAL
			(English)
		What is your name?

The man waits, impatiently.

				OFFICIAL
		Your name?

Vito doesn't answer.  The Official pulls the tag pinned onto
his coat and copies to down on his form, using a typewriter.

				OFFICIAL
			(speaking as he types)
		Vito...Corleone.  Step up, over
		there.

He hands the form to another official.

CLOSE VIEW on the form.  The name has been entered as Vito
Corleone.

INT. MEDICAL EXAM - DAY

Vito is stripped to the waist, as other immigrants wait.

The DOCTOR is just finishing his examination.  He shakes his
head, and then writes on the medical form.

				DOCTOR
		Can you understand me?

Vito stares blankly.

				DOCTOR
		You understand?  Smallpox.  Smallpox.

He doesn't understand.  The doctor turns to the Immigration
Official.

				DOCTOR
		Quarantine...six months.

UNDERGROUND PASSAGEWAY - MOVING VIEW - DAY

Officials move a group of immigrant men, including Vito, to
the quarantine section of the Island.

INT. QUARANTINE HALLWAY - DAY

The official stops at each doorway, and reads off a name.

				OFFICIAL
		Salvatore Ormenta.

The man moves into the room, and the group proceeds.

				OFFICIAL
		Vito Corleone.

No one responds.  The guard moves to the boy, reads his new
name tag.  And then, not unkindly:

				GUARD
		That's you.

He opens the door, and Vito enters the room.

EXT. THE STATUE OF LIBERTY - DAY

The VIEW slowly begins to pull back, revealing this to be
the view from inside the quarantine cell, where Vito stands
on his bench, looking out to the statue through the barred
window.

Then he turns, and sits in the corner.  He is silent for a
long time.

Then, in a sweet, pure voice, he sings to himself in Sicilian.

INT. CATHOLIC CHURCH - MOVING CLOSE SHOT - DAY

A nine year old boy, dressed immaculately in white, with a
large white silk bow tied to his shoulder, moving slowly
down the aisle of the church with a group of other children
dressed in white.  He has dark black hair, and his face is
unmistakably similar to young Vito's.  He moves slowly, his
hands clasped around a golden missal.  We HEAR only the pure
voice of Vito in Sicilian, his sad song reaching out from
the past, as ANTHONY CORLEONE, his Grandson, moves on the
way to his First Holy Communion more than fifty years later.

FULL VIEW

The little children move in procession down to the Altar,
where the PRIEST raises the Host, and performs the Communion
Mass in Latin.

		Ecce Agnus Dei, ecce qui tollit
		peccata mundi.

children, blessing them, and administering their first
Communion.

		Amen.

EXT. LAKE TAHOE ESTATE - DAY

The lawns of this great estate on the shore of Lake Tahoe
are covered with guests of a wonderful party to honor the
First Holy Communion of Anthony Corleone, the son of Mr. and
Mrs. Michael Corleone.  A full dance orchestra plays music
of the times on a pavilion bandstand built especially for
the occasion.  Speedboats roar through the water, pulling
youthful waterskiers; and the pool and private harbor are
filled with laughing, swimming guests.  It is Fall of 1958.

MED. VIEW

Anthony, in his Communion suit sits alone at the table,
looking like a lonely young Prince.

				KAY (O.S.)
		Smile, Anthony.  Smile.

He does, and a flash goes off.

				PHOTOGRAPHER (O.S.)
		Now, one with the whole family.

				KAY (O.S.)
		Mr. Corleone can't right now...

KAY CORLEONE enters from the side, leading her four year old
daughter, MARY, and MAMA CORLEONE to pose with Anthony.

				KAY (O.S.)
		...but we'll get one with the ladies.

				PHOTOGRAPHER
		All together now, c'mon, Anthony...
		CHEESE and

				KAY
		Thank you.

She smiles as she leaves the photographer, and then lets out
a weary sigh to Mama, as she touches the slightly protruding
belly.

				KAY
		Do you think it'll show in the
		picture?

				MAMA
		Two months never shows.  Two months
		look like you had a big lunch.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Oh, Mrs. Corleone.

A slender, aristocratic WOMAN in her late forties is waving
to KAY.

				MRS. BARRETT
		Hello, Mrs. Corleone.  I'm Fran
		Barrett, our place is just down the
		lake.  This is my husband, Marshall.

				KAY
		I'm so happy you could come.

				MR. BARRETT
		The place is transformed.  We've
		been watching workmen come and go
		all summer.

				MRS. BARRETT
		Where is Mr. Corleone?

				KAY
		A business meeting ran late...but
		he promised he wouldn't be long.

Kay puts her arm around little Anthony's shoulder.

				KAY
		This is our son Anthony Vito
		Corleone.  Today he made his First
		Holy Communion.

EXT. TAHOE GATE AND KENNELS - DAY

A confusion of cars; arriving and parking.  The squad of
parking attendants are supplemented by a whole team of the
local Police, working as high-class parking valets.

A very beautiful, statuesque woman, though slightly drunk,
DEANNA DUNN, slams the door of a powder blue Mercedes and
hurries barefoot through the great stone gate.

				DEANNA
		I will not shut my mouth, and keep
		your Goddamn hands off of me!

She is followed by a harried, FREDDIE CORLEONE, dressed with
flash in the Hollywood style, and carrying her shoes in his
hands.

				FREDO
		Honey!  Wait a minute; let's go for
		a drive.

				DEANNA
		I just had a drive; besides, I want
		to see my brother-in-law Michael.

				FREDO
			(trying to get her to
			put her shoes on)
		Yeah, but I don't want him to see
		you.

Deanna pauses reflectively a moment, allowing Fredo to get
her shoes on.

				DEANNA
		What beats me, is how you guys
		could be brothers.  You musta been
		your Mother's rotten egg.

She kicks off the shoes, giggling, and runs toward a waiter.

				DEANNA
			(lifting a glass of champagne)
		Young man, young man...thank you,
		young man.

				WAITER
			(impressed)
		Excuse me, but aren't you...

				DEANNA
		Yes, you saw me in the movies, Good
		Humor man, and yes, I had more off
		than my shoes!

				FREDO
		Goddamn bitch.

				DEANNA
		Relax, Freddie honey.  Come dance
		with me.

She extends her hand to him.

				FREDO
		Listen, Michael's got a lot of nice
		people here.  Friends of Kay's.
		He'll never forgive me if you ruin
		his party.

				DEANNA
		I hate to see you cringe in front
		of him.  How come you're so scared
		of your own kid brother?

				FREDO
		He's the head of the family.

Disgusted, she turns around, and heads toward the music.

				DEANNA
		Don't follow me!

EXT. TAHOE LAWN AND TABLES - MED. SHOT - DAY

Rushing through the tables, waving an arm jangling with gold
jewelry, and carrying several gift-wrapped packages, is a
hardened and aging CONNIE CORLEONE.  She is followed by a
blond, and wrinkled-handsome escort named MERLE.

				CONNIE
		Mama...Mama!  Here I am!

She throws her arms around her Mother, who returns the
affection somewhat reproachfully.

				MAMA
		Constanzia.  We expected you last
		week; we sent the car to pick you
		up at the airport last week.

				CONNIE
		I know, it was chaos; but anyway,
		here I am one week late.
			(lifting a shiny
			green package out of
			Merle's arms)
		This is for my Mama.  You remember
		Merle?

				MAMA
			(not giving him a
			chance to greet her)
		Yes, thank you.

				CONNIE
		How are the kids?

				MAMA
		Well, thank you, they asked for you
		all week.

				CONNIE
		I got surprises for everybody!

				MAMA
			(glancing at the wrapping)
		Bought at the airport.

				CONNIE
			(gazing about)
		This is swell.  Where's Michael?
		I've got things to get straight
		with him and I can't wait on line.

				MAMA
		You go see your children first, and
		then you wait to see your brother
		like everybody else.

EXT. THE BOATHOUSE - DAY

A porch-like foyer of the boathouse, where a group of five
or six men wait, some nervously.  Some sit, and some pace.

MED. CLOSE VIEW

on one of these men, FRANKIE PENTANGELI, approaching his
sixties, with gray hair (the little of it left).  He's a bit
scruffy, this morning's shave of his white beard is not
perfect, and he seems tired.  He is accompanied by an
associate-bodyguard, WILLY CICCI; thin and dark, and also
dressed up for the occasion.  Frankie tries to get the
attention of one of the waiters; a college-groomed young man
in white sports jacket and black bow-tie.

				PENTANGELI
		Hey, kid!  You got any red wine?

				WAITER
			(offering the tray)
		Only champagne and cocktails.

				PENTANGELI
		Forget it...

Finally, he sees someone he recognizes, Fredo, and shouts
out in a husky voice:

				PENTANGELI
		Fredo!  Sonuvabitch.  You look great.

Fredo squints in his direction; finally recognizes him.

				FREDO
		Who's that?  Pentangeli?  Frankie
		"Five-Angels"...thought you were
		never coming West.

				PENTANGELI
			(affectionately)
		Gotta check up on my boys.  Hey,
		what's with the food?  Some kid in
		a white jacket brings me a ritz
		cracker with some chopped liver.
		'Canapes,' he says.  I say, 'Can a
		peas, my ass, that's a ritz cracker
		with chopped liver.' Go get me a
		salami sandwich and a glass of wine
		or I'll send you and your white
		jacket to the dry cleaners!

They get a good laugh at this fresh breath of New York.

				FREDO
		Gee, Frankie, it's good to see you.
		Reminds me of old times.

				PENTANGELI
		You remember Willy Cicci, don't
		you, Freddie?  We was all together
		with the old man Clemenza in
		Brooklyn... before...uh...

				FREDO
		We were all upset about that.

				PENTANGELI
		That's what I'm here to talk to
		your brother about.  What's with
		him, I got to get a letter of
		introduction to have a 'sitdown'?

				FREDO
			(throwing his arm
			around him)
		C'mon, I see what I can do.

EXT. TAHOE PAVILION - MED. VIEW - DAY

The orchestra wears white summer sportcoats and black tuxedo
slacks as they play a tango behind monogrammed music stands.
A professional dance team, probably imported from Vegas,
dance the tango for the excited guests.

INT. TAHOE BOATHOUSE - DAY

A large and very beautiful room overlooking the lake.  It is
dominated by an enormous bar, behind which stands ALBERT
NERI, discreetly in the background.

MICHAEL CORLEONE sits on a large sofa, his back to us.
Standing to one side is a tired and somewhat uneasy TOM
HAGEN.  Standing before Michael is SANDRA CORLEONE, Sonny's
widow; her daughter, one of the twins, FRANCESCA CORLEONE,
and a handsome young man of twenty, GARDNER SHAW.

				SANDRA
		Michael, this is Gardner Shaw.
		Francesca and he have been seeing
		each other for six months now.
		Gardner, this is Francie's Uncle
		Michael.

				GARDNER
			(a little nervous)
		I've heard a lot about you, Mr.
		Corleone.

				MICHAEL (O.S.)
		Sit down.  Francie.

The couple sit themselves on the sofa opposite Michael.

				SANDRA
		They would like to set an engagement
		date, and...

				MICHAEL
		Let them speak for themselves.

VIEW ON MICHAEL, calm, thoughtful.  One can tell that he has
special affection for his niece.

				FRANCESCA
		We love each other, Uncle Michael.
		And, we want to be married.  I came
		to ask for your blessing.

There is a loud KNOCKING on the door; then Fredo's voice.

				FREDO (O.S.)
		Hey, Mike...guess who's here?

Neri goes to answer it, cracks the door open.

				NERI
		Not now, Freddie...

				FREDO
		Tell Mike Frankie 'Five-Angels' is
		here.

				NERI
		Not now...

Neri closes the door, and Michael looks at the nervous young
man.

				MICHAEL
		Francesca is my oldest brother's
		daughter.  He died many years ago,
		and ever since I've felt much more
		of a father than an uncle.  I love
		her very much.  I'm pleased and
		impressed that you had the thought
		to come to me before going on with
		your plans.  It shows me that
		you're a considerate man, and will
		be good to her.  What are you
		studying in college?

				GARDNER
		My major is Fine Arts, sir.

				MICHAEL
		How will Fine Arts support your new
		wife?

				GARDNER
		It's embarrassing to say, sir, but
		I'm a major stockholder in the
		family corporation.

				MICHAEL
			(smiling)
		Never be embarrassed by your wealth.
		This recent contempt for money is
		still another trick of the rich to
		keep the poor without it.
			(warmly)
		Of course I give you my blessing.
		Let's set the wedding soon...it
		will be my pleasure to give the
		bride away.

They all smile, and rise.

				MICHAEL
			(continuing)
		...and take a few courses in
		Business Administration just to be
		on the safe side!

They laugh; Michael moves toward them.  Francesca throws her
arms around him, and kisses her favorite uncle.  The flushed
young man shakes his hand heartily.

				FRANCESCA
		Thank you, Uncle Michael.

They all take their leave; Michael turns to Hagen.

				MICHAEL
		Make her dowry impressive.  He
		comes from a family who still
		thinks an Italian bride goes
		barefoot.

EXT. TAHOE SWIMMING POOLS AND HARBOR - DAY

Francesca and Gardner are greeted by her twin sister and
their young friends, who squeal and embrace at the good news.
Someone throws someone in the pool, and life is good.

MED. CLOSE

Francesca kisses her Aunt Kay.

				FRANCESCA
		Uncle Michael is the greatest man
		ever!

VIEW on Kay - happy for her niece.

INT. TAHOE BOATHOUSE - DAY

Michael sits in the darkened boathouse.  Tom Hagen paces.
Michael is looking at photographs.  Neri stands over him.

CLOSE ON MICHAEL

studying the pictures.

				NERI (O.S.)
		His name is Fred Vincent.  He owns
		a small pizza parlor in Buffalo...

CLOSE ON THE PICTURES

Snapshots of a middle-aged man, handsome, Italian.  There is
something familiar about him.

				NERI (O.S.)
			(continuing)
		...American wife and two small kids.
		We traced him and found that he's
		in the country illegally, from
		Sicily...

Michael looks at another picture.  The same man.  Only
younger, and dressed in Sicilian shepherd's clothing.  We
remember him as FABRIZZIO...Michael's traitorous bodyguard
in Sicily.

				NERI (O.S.)
		...came over around 1956.  Sponsored
		by the Barzini Family.

Michael puts the pictures down.

				MICHAEL
		It's him.  Fabrizzio.
			(almost to himself)
		Revenge is a dish that tastes best
		when it's cold.

				NERI
		How do you want me to handle it?

Michael glances at Hagen, who has been waiting in the room.

				MICHAEL
		Later.  Tom?

Hagen brings him a folder; then, as Michael glances through
it:

				HAGEN
		I've cleared it through the
		Senator's chief aide, a man named
		Turnbull.  Turnbull's a heavy
		gambler, and into us for over a
		hundred grand, so I figure his
		information is reliable.

Neri moves to the bar, to prepare Michael a drink.

				HAGEN
		The Senator can be set up; but he
		thinks of himself as a clean
		politician.  So it's got to be on
		terms he can live with: campaign
		contribution, donation to a
		charitable cause that he controls,
		things like that.  If he gets even
		the inkling that you think you're
		buying him, he'll freeze up.
		Nevada's a funny state, they like
		things both ways here... All right.
		Turnbull says the Senator will be
		here at two-thirty, and he's been
		primed.  He knows you'll want to
		meet with him alone, and he knows
		it's about the Tropicana's license.
		At any rate, he expects to be
		introduced around to some of the
		influential people here today, and
		generally treated as an ordinary
		guest.  Just go light on him,
		Mikey, sometimes the biggest crooks
		don't like to think of themselves
		as crooks...

Michael glances at Hagen, as though that last remark was
unnecessary.

				HAGEN
		I'm sorry; of course, you know that.

				MICHAEL
		Two-thirty.  That gives me time to
		see my boy.

				HAGEN
		Connie's outside.

Michael doesn't want to see her.

				HAGEN
		I promised; she said it was urgent.

Michael nods.

				MICHAEL
		All right.  Apologize to Pentangeli.

Neri opens the door; Hagen exits, and Connie steps in
impatiently, followed by Merle.

				MICHAEL
		I said I would see my sister, alone.

				MERLE
		I think this concerns me too.
			(taking a cigarette
			from the dispenser)
		You don't, do you?

Connie steps forward, kisses Michael on the cheek.

				CONNIE
		How are you, honey?  You've met
		Merle, haven't you.  He was with me
		in Vegas.

				MICHAEL
		I saw him with you.

				CONNIE
		We're going to Europe next week.  I
		want to get passage booked on the
		Queen.

				MICHAEL
		Why do you come to me?  Why don't
		you go to a travel agent?

				MERLE
		We're going to get married first.

Michael is silent.  Then he rises, and moves to the window
overlooking the lake.

				MICHAEL
		The ink on your divorce isn't dry.
		Your children see you on weekends;
		your oldest boy, Michael Francis...
		was in some trouble with the Reno
		police over some petty theft that
		you don't even know about.

				CONNIE
		Michael...

				MICHAEL
		You fly around the world with lazy
		young men who don't have any love
		for you, and use you like a whore.

				CONNIE
		You're not my father!

				MICHAEL
		Then why do you come to me?

				CONNIE
		Because I need MONEY!

				MICHAEL
			(softly)
		Connie, I want to be reasonable
		with you.  You have a house here,
		with us.  You can live here with
		your kids...and you won't be
		deprived of anything.  I don't know
		much about Merle; I don't know what
		he does for a living; what he lives
		on.  Why don't you tell him marriage
		is really out of the question; and
		that you can't see him any more.
		He'll understand.  But if you
		disobey me, and marry this pimp...it
		would disappoint me.

				CONNIE
		It was my father's money; and I'm
		entitled to what I need.  Where is
		Tom Hagen?

She turns angrily, leaving Michael standing face to face
with Merle.

				MICHAEL
		Are you finished?

				MERLE
		I think so.

				MICHAEL
		Then out.

Merle puts out his cigarette and leaves, quickly.

EXT. TAHOE PAVILION - FULL VIEW - DAY

The orchestra has struck up a "Paul Jones," where two
concentric circles of young people march in opposite
directions, until the music stops.  Then they take whomever
is opposite them as their new dance partner.

VIEW ON THE HARBOR AREA

Francesca and her twin, Gardner and their elite young
friends roar out of the private harbor, to get up on the
water skis.  We notice ROCCO LAMPONE, move along a path
leading to a separate and more private boathouse.  A small
covered craft approaches, ties off, and a group of three men
step on to the pathway, shake hands with Lampone - and
follow him to the large boathouse where Michael conducts his
business.

CLOSE VIEW

Pentangeli has led Mama up to the dance floor, and is having
some difficulty with the orchestra.

				PENTANGELI
		I can't believe that out of thirty
		professional musicians, not one of
		you is Italian!
			(as the musicians laugh)
		C'mon, give us a tarantella.

He waves his hands, conducting, and singing.  The piano
starts a vamp, the drums uncertainly join in.  A clarinet
starts to play "Pop Goes the Weasel," and soon the rest of
the orchestra is playing that.  They look to Pentangeli for
approval.  Disgusted, he goes back to his table, eating a
handful of canapes.

INT. THE BOATHOUSE - DAY

Rocco ushers an older Italian, bundled up against the cold
and wet of his boatride, to Michael.

The man shows respect to Michael, who quickly indicates that
Neri should get him a drink.

				MICHAEL
		Rocco, his friends must be hungry.
		See what you can do, but I'd like
		to keep them away from the guests.

The older man, JOHNNY 'BLUE BOY' OLA, gestures to his
bodyguards, and they follow Lampone.

				MICHAEL
		You know my lawyer, Tom Hagen.
		Johnny Ola.

				OLA
		Sure, I remember Tom from the old
		days.

Tom shakes hands with Ola, remembering him, and his
importance.

				MICHAEL
		Tom isn't going to sit in with us,
		Johnny.  He only handles specific
		areas of the family business.  Tom?

				HAGEN
		Sure, Mikey.

He gathers up some of his papers, as the three men remain
silent, waiting for him to go before they talk.  It's clear
Tom doesn't want to be excluded.

				HAGEN
		If you need anything, just...

				MICHAEL
		Just tell Rocco I'm waiting.

Hagen nods and leaves.  As soon as the door closes:

				OLA
		I just left our friend in Miami.

				MICHAEL
		How is his health?

				OLA
		Not good.

				MICHAEL
		Is there anything I can do; anything
		I can send?

				OLA
		He appreciates your concern,
		Michael, and your respect.

There's a KNOCK on the door; a moment, and then Rocco
quietly enters and takes his place without disturbing the
conversation.

				OLA
		The hotel's registered owners are
		one Jacob Lawrence, and Sidney
		Barclay, both Beverly Hills
		attorneys.  In reality it's split
		between the Old Lakeville Road
		Group from Cleveland, and our
		friend in Miami.  He takes care of
		others outside the country, you
		know who I mean.  Meyer Klingman
		runs the store, and does all right,
		but I've been instructed to tell
		you, that if you move him out, our
		friend in Miami will go along with
		you.

				MICHAEL
		He's very kind, tell him it's
		appreciated.  I'm sure it will be
		profitable all the way around.

				OLA
		He always makes money for his
		partners.  One by one, our old
		friends are gone.  Death, natural
		or not, prison, deported.  Our
		friend in Miami is the only one
		left, because he always made money
		for his partners.

The door opens suddenly, and standing there in his white
Communion suit, is Michael's boy Anthony.  A moment later,
Kay appears, and takes the boy's hand.

				KAY
		Anthony, Daddy's busy.

				MICHAEL
			(rising)
		This is my boy, and my wife.  Mr.
		John Ola of Miami.

				KAY
		I'm sorry, Michael.  Senator
		Geary's here, and Mr. and Mrs.
		Barrett wanted to thank you before
		they left.  Won't you join us, Mr.
		Ola?

				MICHAEL
		Mr. Ola's just leaving, Kay.
		Please tell the Senator I won't be
		a minute.

Pause; she stands there a moment.

				MICHAEL
			(continuing)
		Kay.

				KAY
		Yes, Michael.

EXT. THE BOATHOUSE - DAY

Kay closes the door.  It seems as though Michael has violated
some sort of promise to her by having this man here today.
She looks up toward the first boathouse.

WHAT SHE SEES:

The covered launch, and Ola's three bodyguards, eating while
they wait.

MED. VIEW

Anthony runs away from her, heading toward the house.

				KAY
		Anthony!
			(she runs after him)
		Anthony, where are you going?

Moodily, the boy stops, turns, and walks back to his table
of honor without answering her.

EXT. TAHOE TABLES AND PAVILION - VIEW ON THE PAVILION - DAY

The orchestra has taken its break; now two couples in formal
dress are performing the Quartet from Rigoletto.

VIEW ON HAGEN

sitting by himself, a little down, having a drink.  He's
waiting for Michael to re-summon him.  SANDRA, Sonny's
widow, sits opposite him.

				HAGEN
		Where's my wife?

				SANDRA
		With Mama, putting the baby to
		sleep.  Francesca's very happy.
		Michael was kind to her.  She
		idolizes him.
			(pause; she looks at
			a despondent Hagen)
		The children are all out in the
		speedboat.  I'm going to my house.

Sandra gets up, still an attractive woman, and walks alone
to the back path that leads to her home on the estate.

VIEW ON THE PAVILION

The returned orchestra strikes a big, show-biz chord,
intended to command the guests' attention.

The orchestra LEADER raises his hands for silence, and makes
an announcement over the P.A. system.

				MAESTRO
		Ladies and gentlemen, a most
		distinguished guest would like to
		say a few words: Senator and Mrs.
		Pat Geary of the state of Nevada!

A big hand, as the smiling SENATOR introduces his WIFE by
holding her arm up to the crowd, and then proceeds alone to
the bandstand.

MED. VIEW

Michael stands with Kay and Mrs. Geary.  The Senator's
presence seems to be a statement of political and social
status.

A little distance away, his beautiful son Anthony sits
quietly, in an unmistakably morose mood.

INT. TAHOE - SANDRA'S HOUSE - DAY

We HEAR the applause and whistles echoing in the distance.
Sandra stands in her bedroom, looking at the door.  We SEE a
photograph of SONNY, and also one of their wedding.

A moment goes by, and then Tom Hagen enters, closing the
door behind him.

We begin to HEAR Senator Geary's amplified voice resounding
over the lake.  Hagen moves to Sandra.  She takes him in her
arms, comforting, holding his head against her full breast.

				HAGEN
			(quietly)
		He doesn't want my help any more.
		He doesn't need it.

				SANDRA
		We don't know that's true, he never
		said that.

				HAGEN
		I can feel it in the way he talks
		to me.

He moves to the dresser; pours himself a drink.

				HAGEN
		Just now when Johnny Ola showed up,
		he asked me to leave them alone.
		Ola is Hyman Roth's Sicilian
		contact.  I was on the inside of
		ten, twenty meetings with him.  But
		today Mike asked me to leave, like
		an outsider.

				SANDRA
		Talk to him.  Tell him how you feel.

				HAGEN
		It's as though he blames me for the
		ground the family lost when I was
		Consigliere to Sonny.

Sandra pulls Hagen to her, and kisses him passionately on
the mouth.

				HAGEN
		I love Michael, I want to help him,
		be close to him.  I don't want to
		end up a third string lawyer making
		property settlements for the hotels.

Sandra knows he needs her.  Slowly she begins to undress.

				SANDRA
		We have a little time now.

EXT. THE PAVILION - VIEW ON SENATOR GEARY - DAY

				SENATOR GEARY
		...my thanks, and the thanks of the
		young people of the State of
		Nevada, for this most impressive
		endowment...
			(he holds a check in
			his hand)
		...made to the University in the
		name of Anthony Vito Corleone.
		Thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Michael
		Corleone.

Applause.  Senator Geary returns the microphone to the
Maestro who adds:

				MAESTRO
		And now, the Nevada Boys' Choir
		have prepared a special thank you
		for Mr. Michael Corleone.

He turns to a small Choir Master, who leads the Boys' Choir
in a choral arrangement of "MR. WONDERFUL."

VIEW ON SENATOR GEARY

shaking hands with Michael, as Press Photographers snap
pictures, showing the check; showing a special award of
Gratitude from the State; Mrs. Corleone and Mrs. Geary; all
together; Michael and his son; Senator Geary and Michael's
son; and on and on.  In the midst of this:

				SENATOR GEARY
		Where can we meet alone?

Michael indicates the boathouse a distance away, where Neri
seems to be waiting for them.  Then Michael leans to Rocco:

				MICHAEL
		Find Hagen.

Rocco sets off; as more pictures are taken, and the:

BOYS' CHOIR

sings its lovely arrangement of "Mr. Wonderful."

INT. TAHOE BOATHOUSE - MED. VIEW - DAY

Michael, the Senator, Neri and Rocco make a group in the
dark, large room.

				MICHAEL
		It was very kind of you to come to
		my home on this occasion, Senator.
		My wife has been very concerned
		with making a good impression on
		the people who are our neighbors,
		and your appearance here has made
		her very happy.  If I can ever
		perform a service for you, you only
		have to ask.

The door opens, and Hagen sheepishly makes his way in.

				MICHAEL
		My lawyer, Tom Hagen.  He arranged
		this all through your man Turnbull.

				SENATOR GEARY
		I thought we would meet alone.

				MICHAEL
		I trust these men with my life.
		They are my right arms; I cannot
		insult them by sending them away.

				SENATOR GEARY
			(taking out some medication)
		Some water.

He addresses that to Neri, who resentfully goes to fetch the
Senator a glass of water.

				SENATOR GEARY
		Alright, Corleone.  I'm going to be
		very frank with you.  Maybe more
		frank than any man in my position
		has ever spoken to you before.

Michael nods, indicating that he should do so.

				SENATOR GEARY
		The Corleone family controls two
		major hotels in Vegas; one in Reno.
		The licenses were grandfathered in,
		so you had no difficulties with the
		Gaming Commission.  But I have the
		idea from sources...
			(takes the water from
			Neri and swallows his pills)
		...that you're planning to move in
		on the Tropicana.  In another week
		or so you'll move Klingman out,
		which leaves you with only one
		technicality.  The license, which
		is now in Klingman's name.

				MICHAEL
		Turnbull is a good man.

				SENATOR GEARY
		Let's forget the bullshit, I don't
		want to stay here any longer than I
		have to.  You can have the license
		for two hundred and fifty thousand
		in cash, plus a monthly fee equal
		to five percent of the gross...

Michael is taken aback; he looks at Hagen.

				SENATOR GEARY
		...of all three Corleone hotels.

Hagen is frustrated; all his information was wrong.

				MICHAEL
		Senator Geary, I speak to you as a
		businessman who has made a large
		investment in your state.  I have
		made that state my home; plan to
		raise my children here.  The
		license fee from the Gambling
		Commission costs one thousand
		dollars; why would I ever consider
		paying more?

				SENATOR GEARY
		I'm going to squeeze you, Corleone,
		because I don't like you; I don't
		like the kind of man you are.  I
		despise your masquerade, and the
		dishonest way you pose yourself and
		your fucking family.

VIEW ON HAGEN

glances at Michael.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

makes no outward reaction.

				MICHAEL
			(quietly)
		We're all part of the same
		hypocrisy, Senator.  But never
		think it applies to my family.

				SENATOR GEARY
		All right, then let me say you'll
		pay me because it's in your
		interests to pay me.

VIEW ON GEARY

rising.

				SENATOR GEARY
		I'll expect your answer, with
		payment, by tomorrow morning.  Only
		don't contact me...from now on,
		deal only through Turnbull.

He is almost out the door.

				MICHAEL
		Senator...
			(cold and calm)
		...you can have my answer now if
		you'd like.

Geary turns back.

				MICHAEL
		My offer is this.  Nothing...not
		even the thousand dollars for the
		Gaming Commission, which I'd
		appreciate if you would put up
		personally.

Geary returns Michael's hard look; then laughs and leaves.
Slowly Michael turns to Hagen.

VIEW ON HAGEN

embarrassed at being so off the mark.

				MICHAEL
		It's all right, Tom, we'll talk
		later.  Tell Frankie Pentangeli I'd
		like him to have dinner at my
		family table before we do business.

EXT. THE PAVILION - NIGHT

Now the light has faltered, and the young waiters have put
up the night lights.  The tables are all properly set for
dinner, with candles on each one.

The orchestra is playing quiet, unobtrusive dinner music,
and many of the guests have begun to help themselves to the
impressive buffet, under a party tent.

MED. VIEW

Michael sits at a large table with Kay, his son Anthony,
Mama, Hagen and TERESA, Connie and Merle' Fredo and Deanna,
and Frankie Pentangeli.

				MAMA
		Cent' Anne.

This, the table of honor, all raise their glasses and repeat
the toast.

				DEANNA
		What's 'cent' Anne?'

				FREDO
		A hundred years...it's a toast.

				CONNIE
		It means we should all live happily
		for one hundred years.  The family.
		If my Father were alive, it'd be
		true.

				MAMA
		Connie.

				CONNIE
		Merle, have you met my sister-in-
		law Deanna?

				DEANNA
		What a pleasure, Merle.
			(shaking hands)


				MAMA
			(Sicilian)
		Those two are perfect for each other.

				MERLE
		What's that mean?

				CONNIE
		Mama!

				PENTANGELI
			(Sicilian)
		Michael, in all respect, I didn't
		come three thousand miles for dinner.

				MICHAEL
			(Sicilian)
		I know.

				PENTANGELI
			(Sicilian)
		When do we talk?

				MICHAEL
			(Sicilian)
		After dinner.

By now, the conversation has become exclusively Sicilian,
with Merle and Deanna, looking from side to side like in a
tennis match.  Finally, Kay, to be polite:

				KAY
		Anthony, you were talking to Mr.
		Pentangeli?

				ANTHONY
		His name is "Five-Angels."

				PENTANGELI
		Yeah, the kid and me talked Sicilian.
		A one-way conversation!

INT. TAHOE BOATHOUSE - NIGHT

Pentangeli is angry; but because it is Michael he is talking
to, he keeps his voice low and represses his desire to shout.

				PENTANGELI
		Sure, Pete Clemenza died of a heart
		attack, but the Rosato Brothers
		gave it to him.

				MICHAEL
		We were all heartbroken at the
		news; but that wasn't cause to
		start a war.

				PENTANGELI
		Okay, now it's my family in
		Brooklyn; and I wanna keep up
		Clemenza's loyalty to you.  But how
		can I run my family with you
		challenging my every move?  You're
		too far from the street, Mike, the
		only way to reason with the Rosato
		Brothers is to whack 'em and whack
		'em fast.

				MICHAEL
		You were unfair with them.

				PENTANGELI
		Says who?

				MICHAEL
		Clemenza promised Rosato three
		territories in the Bronx after he
		died, and then you took over and
		welched.

				PENTANGELI
		Clemenza promised them nothing, he
		hated the sonsuvbitches.

				MICHAEL
		They feel cheated.

				PENTANGELI
		Michael, you're sitting up here in
		the Sierra Mountains with champagne
		cocktails making judgment on the
		way I run my family.

				MICHAEL
			(suddenly in Sicilian)
		Your family still carries the name
		Corleone, and you will run it like
		a Corleone!

				PENTANGELI
			(Sicilian)
		And while I feed my family in New
		York, you put the knife in my back
		in Miami.

				MICHAEL
			(firm)
		Frankie, you're a good old man, and
		you've been loyal to my Father for
		years...so I hope you can explain
		what you mean.

				PENTANGELI
		The Rosatos are running crazy;
		taking hostages, spitting in my
		face, because they're backed by the
		Jew in Miami.

				MICHAEL
		I know.  That's why I want you to
		be fair with them.

				PENTANGELI
		How can you be fair with animals?
		They recruit niggers and spicks;
		they do violence in their own
		Grandmother's neighborhoods.  And
		everything is dope and whores; the
		gambling is left to last.  Let me
		run my family without you on my
		back.  I want them taken care of.

				MICHAEL
		No.  There are things that I have
		planned with Hyman Roth.  I don't
		want them disturbed.

				PENTANGELI
		You give your loyalty to a Jew over
		your own blood.

				MICHAEL
		Frankie, you know my father
		respected Roth, did business with
		him.

				PENTANGELI
		He did business...but he never
		trusted him.

Pentangeli takes his hat, and leaves.

				NERI

				MICHAEL
		The old man had too much vino
		rosso, or he'd never talk openly
		that way.  Let him go back to New
		York; I've already made my plans.

		It's late; I've spent so little

EXT. THE LAWNS AND TABLES - FULL VIEW - NIGHT

By now the sun has fallen and the lawns of the Corleone
estate are lit by moonlight.  Beautifully dressed couples
dance as the orchestra plays a foxtrot of the late fifties.

VIEW ON THE DANCE FLOOR

Deanna has been dancing with Fredo; she has gotten drunk and
it teasing her husband by flirting with other men on the
floor.

				DEANNA
		I wanta dance...whatsa matter with
		that?

				FREDO
		Dancing is alright; you're falling
		on the floor.

				DEANNA
		Whatsamatter, you don't want me to
		dance with him 'cause he's a man!

				FREDO
		Deanna, I'm going to belt you right
		in the mouth!

				DEANNA
		These Eye-ties are really crazy
		when it comes to their wives.

By now guests are starting to notice the disturbance;
Michael is with Kay, and some friends; Rocco catches his eye.

				DEANNA (O.S.)
		Jesus, never marry a WOP, they
		treat their wives like shit.

VIEW on Kay, listening, embarrassed by her flashy sister-in-
law.

VIEW ON FREDO AND DEANNA

Rocco passes by Fredo and whispers:

				ROCCO
		Freddie, Mike says take care of it,
		or I have to.

				DEANNA
		He's a friend of your brother!

Without another word, Rocco grabs firm hold of her and
whisks her out of the crowd.

				DEANNA
		"Shuffle off to Buffa...
		Shuffle off to Buffa...
		Shuffle off to Buffalooooo..."

Freddie mops his forehead, and moves to Michael.

				FREDO
		Hey Mike, what can I say?

				MICHAEL
		Forget it, just go take care of her.

Kay and Michael dancing in the moonlight.

				MICHAEL
		How's the baby?

				KAY
		Sleeping inside me.

				MICHAEL
		Does it feel like a boy?

				KAY
		Yes, Michael, it does.

				MICHAEL
		I'm sorry about some of the people
		I had to see today.  It was bad
		timing... but it couldn't be helped.

				KAY
		It made me think of what you told
		me once.  In five years, the
		Corleone family will be completely
		legitimate.  That was seven years
		ago.

He has no answer for her; except that he loves and values
her, and holds her tight, as they dance amid their guests,
all dressed elegantly for the social event of the season.

A single organ plays some standard wedding music.

The VIEW PANS up to the altar, where Connie and Merle, in

married by a Justice of the Peace.

The Justice goes through the bored, simple ceremony, and we

father, when she was married all those years ago in Long
Island.

EXT. THE TROPICANA - LAS VEGAS - MED. VIEW - DAY

A dark car pulls up to the glitter of the neon facade.
Albert Neri, alone, leaves it to the parking valets, and
moves quickly through the automatic doors, into the main
casino.  We still hear the CORLEONE WALTZ.

INT. THE TROPICANA - DAY

Albert Neri enters the room; glances around a moment, and
then heads toward the crap table, where a short, middle-aged
man, KLINGMAN, stands by the pit boss.  Several security
guards of the casino, are at their posts.

				NERI
		Are you Klingman?

				KLINGMAN
		Who's asking?

				NERI
		Where can we talk?

				KLINGMAN
		Right here.

				NERI
		I represent the interests of the
		Corleone family.  We make the
		invitation to you to tie up your
		affairs and be out of the hotel by
		Monday morning.

				KLINGMAN
		Who do you think you're talking to?

				NERI
		You said you were Klingman.

				KLINGMAN
		You don't come in here, talk to an
		owner in Las Vegas like that.

				NERI
		You missed my point; you are no
		longer an owner.

				KLINGMAN
		Get out of my hotel.

Neri stands in front of him, smiling.

				KLINGMAN
		Boys, get him out of here.

Quickly, Neri moves toward Klingman, and slaps him hard
several times in the face, knocking off his glasses... Red-
faced, Klingman gets down on his knees to pick them up once,
again.  Glasses on, he looks to his guards.

WHAT HE SEES

They stand, motionless.

Humiliated, Klingman moves across the casino floor, past a

follows.

bodyguards watching every move he makes.

INT. NEW YORK THEATRE - 1915 - NIGHT

VITO CORLEONE is a shy young man of 23, holding his hat in
his hand, being led down the crowded aisle of this Italian
Vaudeville theatre by an energetic and fulfilled GENCO
ABBANDANDO, his friend in America.  This entire sequence is
played in Sicilian.

				GENCO
		Come on, you've got to see her!

VIEW ON THE STAGE

A tattered melodrama is in progress in Neapolitan.  The sets
are two-dimensional, and flap whenever there's an entrance
or exit.

The hero, PEPPINO, is weeping as he sings about how he's
left his Mother in Italy, while he is in this new country,
America.

VIEW ON THE AUDIENCE

All poor, Italo-Americans.  Genco finds a few seats, and
leads Vito to them, stepping on a few shoes in the process.
They have barely come to their seats, when an excited Genco
nudges Vito, and points to the stage.  People shout that
they should sit down.

VIEW ON THE STAGE

There is a knock on the door, and a young girl enters,
delivering a letter to Peppino in his tenement in America.
The girl is pretty; and obviously the object of Genco's
affection.  The letter brings bad news.  Peppino's Mother is
dead.  He weeps, and sings the final song, which most of the
audience knows: SENZA MAMMA.

VIEW ON THE AUDIENCE

Genco is enthralled with the young actress.  The people in
the audience are singing along with Peppino.

VIEW ON THE STAGE

The actress, object of Genco's affection, makes a dramatic
exit.

VIEW ON THE AUDIENCE

Genco pulls on Vito's jacket, indicating that now that his
love is offstage, they should leave.  Vito rises with him,
and they make their way all the way down the aisle.

INT. BACKSTAGE THEATRE - MOVING VIEW - NIGHT

Genco hurrying down the backstage corridor, hoping to catch
a glimpse of the actress.  He is followed by Vito.  Suddenly,
Genco stops short.

GENCO'S VIEW

A heavy-set, fierce looking Italian wearing an expensive
light-colored suit and a cream colored fedora.  This is
FANUCCI.  He is discussing a business matter with the
theatre IMPRESARIO; a large, strong looking man, who is
sweating nonetheless.  He doesn't seem to be giving in to
Fanucci.  He holds a locked strongbox.

VIEW ON VITO

watching.  The two men argue in Italian.

MED. VIEW

The young ACTRESS crosses into the area, unaware of the
difficulties.  The impresario sees her, and frightened,
motions that she should keep away.

				IMPRESARIO
		Carla!

But Fanucci grabs her easily by her slender wrist, and with
lightning speed, produces a knife which he holds against her
cheek.  The impresario wrings his hands in agony.

				IMPRESARIO
			(Sicilian)
		No...please, not my daughter.

Whereupon he begins to unlock the box which holds the
receipts for the night's box-office.

VIEW ON GENCO AND VITO

hiding, watching.  At first, Genco is enraged, as though he
would rush up to help his enamorata.

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
		The Black Hand.

Then he backs away.  Vito looks at him shocked and
disappointed in this cowardly behavior.  Genco shakes his
head, and points, as though to say that where Fanucci is
concerned, there is nothing to be done.

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
			 (whispered)
		Let's get out of here.

VIEW ON FANUCCI

has released the girl.  Her father pulls her away from him,
and slaps her for no reason; then he pays Fanucci.

				FANUCCI
			(Sicilian)
		Because you protested, it will cost
		a hundred more.

EXT. NEW YORK ALLEY - NIGHT

Genco and Vito; Genco leans against the wall, breathlessly,
as though he's had a near escape.

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
		I know what you are thinking,
		Vitone, but you don't understand
		yet how things are.  Fanucci is of
		the Black Hand.  Everyone in the
		neighborhood pays him, even my
		father.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		He's an Italian?

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
		A pig of a Neaponitan.
			(spits)


				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		Why?  Why does he bother other
		Italians?

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
		Because he knows them; he knows
		they have no one to protect them.
		Vitone?  What do you think of my
		angel?

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		Beautiful.

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
		Beautiful.

				VITO
		For you, she is beautiful.  For me,
		there is only my wife!

				GENCO
		I know.  That's why I brought you
		with me!

Genco embraces his good friend, and they laughingly walk
down the alley.

The stage door opens, and Fanucci exits, a sinister figure
in white, moving down the alley just in front of them, into
the night.

The two friends hold their breath, until he disappears.

EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - MOVING VIEW - DAY

Vito moves through the street, carrying groceries that he is
to deliver.

It is cold, and so vendors are huddled around fires they
have lit in old cans and drums.

He turns up an alleyway, and then stops.

VIEW UP THE ALLEY

With great strength, Fanucci lifts one of them up into the
air and throws him down hard to the concrete; but another,
holding onto his back, manages to produce a switchblade
knife and awkwardly reaching around from behind the moving
man, slits Fanucci's throat from one side to the other.

Fanucci groans like some great hurt animal.  Blood pours
from the deep, smile-like slit in his throat.

He throws the young man off his back.

VIEW ON VITO

stepping back in the alley.

VIEW ON FANUCCI

He takes off his white fedora, and runs down the alley
toward Vito, catching the flowing blood in his hat.

The young attackers scurry off in various directions.

INT. ABBANDANDO GROCERY STORE - DAY

A tiny shop featuring imported food: trays of cured meats,
prosciutto, copagole, mortadella lies on the counter covered
with netting to keep away the thousands of flies.

Olive oil is sold in bulk, as well as wine, cheese and bacala.

Genco works here for his father, and is busy slicing paper
thin prosciutto for a customer, by hand.  Vito works in the
back as a stock clerk.

Finished with his customer, Genco moves to his friend.

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
		I bet you can't guess what happened?

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		What?

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
		Some guys from Ninth Avenue jumped
		Fanucci today; slit his throat from
		ear to ear.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		No, I didn't know.  Is he dead?

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
		Nah.  Those guys aren't murderers.
		They wanted to scare him, that's
		all.  Make him look bad.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		In Sicily, when you attack a man,
		you had better finish him.

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
		I wish they had.  He takes fifty
		dollars a week from my father's
		cash drawer.  But you can't kill a
		man like Fanucci.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		Why?

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
		Because he's what we say...
		"connected"... You wait, see what
		happens to those guys from Ninth
		Avenue.

A customer enters; and Genco moves away to serve him.

CLOSE VIEW ON VITO

recalling what he had seen and thought.

EXT. NEW YORK ALLEYWAY - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

A young man, one of those who had tried to kill Fanucci,
runs down an alleyway, breathlessly.  Then he stops, and
looks behind himself.  Whoever was following him is gone.
He turns and walks ahead.  Then the mammoth, white-suited
figure of Fanucci leaps down before him from the fire-escape.
He grins at the young man, and then raises his neck, showing
the gruesome wound that marks his throat.

He takes out his pistol and fires point-blank at his attacker.

INT. TINY TENEMENT - FULL VIEW - NIGHT

The very small, railroad type flat where Vito lives with his
new family.

It is late at night, and he is exhausted.

He returns home; where his young wife, CARMELLA, goes
through the silent ritual of preparing a simple meal for him.
He sits and eats quietly.

INT. TENEMENT ROOM - NIGHT

Vito and Carmella enter the darkened bedroom, and approach a
metal crib.  Vito reaches down and takes the small hand of
the baby between his thick peasant fingers.  Carmella waits
a respectful distance behind him.

INT. ABBANDANDO GROCERY - DAY

The shop bell RINGS; SINGER ABBANDANDO turns to see a
smiling Fanucci tipping his hat, like an old customer.

				FANUCCI
		Buon giorno.

Immediately, Vito turns back to his work, and Signor
Abbandando moves to Fanucci with a sigh.

Vito notices the two men talking quietly at one side of the
store, while he goes about his work.  Genco works his way
closer to his friend.

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
		What did I tell you.  The one who
		cut him was found in an alley.  And
		the family of the others paid
		Fanucci all their savings to make
		him forswear his vengeance.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
			 (surprised)
		And he agreed?

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
		He took the money.  Now he wants
		double from everybody in the
		neighborhood, including Papa.

Vito watches the heated, but inevitable transaction.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
			 (almost to himself)
		A real mafioso doesn't sell his
		vengeance.

MED. VIEW

Signor Abbandando seems to be arguing with Fanucci, and
every so often they turn and relate to where Vito is working.
Then Fanucci leaves, the little bell RINGING; and Signor
Abbandando reluctantly moves to Vito.

				SIG. ABBANDANDO
			(Sicilian)
		Vitone.  How is your son?

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		We are all well.

It is clear that he has something difficult to tell the
young man.

				SIG. ABBANDANDO
		Vitone...I...Fanucci has a nephew.

Vito looks at him a while, as the old man struggles to tell
him.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		And you must give him my job.

The old man nods, regretfully.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		You have been kind to me since I
		was a boy; taken care of me, and
		been as a father.  I will always be
		grateful to you.  Thank you.

Vito takes off his apron, and leaves, passing the youth who
loiters by the counter.

EXT. THE STREET - DAY

making his way from the store.

				SIG. ABBANDANDO
			(Sicilian o.s.)
		Vitone!

He turns, and Abbandando has followed him out of the shop,
holding a basket of some groceries.

				SIG. ABBANDANDO
		Here...for your family.

				VITO
		No...please understand...I cannot
		accept.

INT. VITO'S TENEMENT - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

Vito and his wife sit quietly at the table; the two are
quiet and sad.

Suddenly, we HEAR a noise, and Vito is astonished to see a
young man, PETER CLEMENZA, leaning out of the window on the
other side of the air shaft which separates their apartments.

				CLEMENZA
		Hey Paisan!  Hold this for me until
		I ask for it.  Hurry up!

Automatically Vito reaches over to the empty space at the
air shaft, and takes the bundle of rags.  Clemenza's round
face is strained and urgent, obviously in some kind of
trouble.  Suddenly, he closes the window and there is
activity that we cannot see in the other apartment.

Vito looks to his wife, and then closes the window and
window dressing and takes the bundle into a private part of
his kitchen and begins to unwrap it.

WHAT HE SEES:

Five oily guns.  He immediately wraps them again, and
carries them to a private closet, and hides it, and returns
to his wife.  He sits down back at the table; and she knows
not to ask him what has happened.

EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - DAY

Vito is walking through the crowded streets with a group of
workmen; they all wear work clothes, and paper hats on their
heads.

Vito looks to his left, and realizes that Clemenza is
walking silently with him; by contrast, Clemenza dresses well.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
			 (casually)
		Do you have my goods still?

Vito nods.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		Did you look inside?

Vito, his face impassive, shakes his head 'no.'

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		I'm not interested in things that
		don't concern me.

INT. DOWNTOWN ITALIAN SOCIAL CLUB - DAY

Vito and Clemenza drinking wine; they've become friends.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		I have a friend who has a fine rug.
		Maybe your wife would like it.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		We have no money for a rug.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		No.  He would give it away.  I know
		how to repay a consideration.

Vito thinks, then nods.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		She would like it.

INT. HALLWAY WEALTHY APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

The two men proceed up the hallway; Vito is impressed with
the opulence.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		Your friend lives in a fine building.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		Oh yes, the very best.

Clemenza knocks on the door as though he is well known here;
then rings.  No answer.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		Ah, he's not at home.  Oh, well, he
		wouldn't mind.

Quickly and expertly he takes out a tool and pries open the
door.

INT. WEALTHY APARTMENT - FULL VIEW - DAY

Vito looks in awe at the luxurious apartment, which features
a fabulous rich red wool rug.

Clemenza immediately moves some of the furniture away, and
drops to the floor.

				CLEMENZA
		A little help.

Vito joins him, and the two begin rolling the rug.  We HEAR
a BUZZER RING.  Clemenza immediately drops his side of the
roll, and moves to the window.  He pulls a gun from his
jacket.

VIEW ON Vito watching.  He moves so he can see out the window.

THEIR VIEW

A Policeman stands at the exterior door, waiting.  He rings

middle-aged Italian named AUGUSTINO who leads them into a
machine shop.

Augustino takes them and expertly begins to clean and

Tessio and Clemenza quickly load racks of cheap dresses.

Vito sits behind the wheel of the truck.  He seems reserved,
and we get the impression that he is studying every move his
two friends are making.

INT. TENEMENT STAIRS - DAY

Clemenza runs up a flight of stairs with an armful of
dresses.  He knocks on a door, and a pretty HOUSEWIFE answers.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		Lady, I got a bargain on these
		dresses.  Five dollars each.  You
		gotta pay at least fifteen, maybe
		twenty in a store.  Look at them,
		first class.

He holds the dresses up and the woman seems interested.  She
handles a couple of them and stands aside so Clemenza can
enter her apartment.

				WOMAN
			(Sicilian)
		I don't know which one I like best.

She holds the dresses against her body, Clemenza approving
of each one; and then she goes to her purse and takes out
five singles and gives them to him.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		You'd look beautiful in all of
		these.  You should buy at least two.

				WOMAN
			(Sicilian)
		Are you kidding?  My husband will
		kill me if he knows I paid five
		dollars for one dress.

She holds one up, then another.  She is torn.  Clemenza
shakes his head and straightens the dress on her body.  His
hand brushes her arm; she looks at him smiling.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		You can have two for five.

She smiles back.

EXT. TENEMENT BUILDING - DAY

Clemenza jumps down the stairs, and out to the middle of the
street, where Vito and Tessio are waiting in the car with
some of the stock.

				TESSIO
			(Sicilian)
		What took so long?

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		She couldn't decide.

Tessio and Clemenza each take more armsful of dresses and
divide the neighborhood.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		Vito, take the rest of the stock
		over to Dandine's warehouse; he'll
		move it to a wholesaler.

The three part.  Vito drives the truck off.

MOVING VIEW

Vito drives the truck through the downtown streets; he turns
a corner and stops for a light.

Suddenly, to his left, he sees the formidable figure of
Fanucci.

He grabs young Corleone by the shoulder.

CLOSE VIEW ON FANUCCI

frightening, revealing the large circular scar, now healed.

				FANUCCI
			(Sicilian)
		Ahhh, young fellow.  People tell me
		you're rich, you and your two
		friends.  Yet, you don't show
		enough respect to send a few
		dresses to my home.  You know I
		have three daughters.

Vito says nothing.  Fanucci thumbs through the stock.

				FANUCCI
			(Sicilian)
		This is my neighborhood.  You and
		your friends have to show me a
		little respect, ah?  This truck you
		hijacked was in my neighborhood.
		You should let me wet my beak a
		little.

Fanucci takes a few of the dresses.

				FANUCCI
			(Sicilian)
		I understand each of you cleared
		around six hundred dollars.  I
		expect two hundred dollars for my
		protection and I'll forget the
		insult.  After all, young people
		don't know the courtesies due a man
		like myself.

Vito smiles at him and nods.

				FANUCCI
			(Sicilian)
		Otherwise the police will come to
		see you and your wife and children
		will be dishonored and destitute.
		Of course, if my information as to
		your gains is incorrect, I'll dip
		my beak just a little.  Just a
		little, but no less than one
		hundred dollars, and don't try to
		deceive me, eh paisan?

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
			 (quietly)
		My two friends have my share of the
		money.  I'll have to speak to them
		after we deliver these to the
		wholesaler.

				FANUCCI
			(Sicilian)
		You tell your friends I expect them
		to let me wet my beak in the same
		manner.  Don't be afraid to tell
		them.  Clemenza and I know each
		other well, he understands these
		things.  Let yourself be guided by
		him.  He has more experience in
		these matters.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
			 (shrugging innocently)
		You must understand, this is all

				FANUCCI
			(Sicilian)
		I understand...

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		But thank you for speaking to me as
		a Godfather.

				FANUCCI
			(Sicilian)

		You're a good fellow.

He takes Vito's hands and clasps them in his own.

				FANUCCI

		You have respect.  A fine thing in
		the young.  Next time, speak to me
		first, eh?  Perhaps I can help you
		make your plans.

Fanucci turns with the dresses draped over his arms, waving
to Vito.

Vito throws the truck in gear, and drives off.

We know that throughout this encounter he has seethed with
an icy rage.

INT. VITO'S APARTMENT - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

He wife serves a dinner for her husband and his two friends.
They discuss Fanucci as they eat.

				TESSIO
			(Sicilian)
		Do you think he'd be satisfied with
		the two hundred dollars?  I think
		he would.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		That scar-faced bastard will find
		out what we got from the wholesaler.
		He won't take a dime less than
		three hundred dollars.

				TESSIO
			(Sicilian)
		What if we don't pay?

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
			 (gestures, it's hopeless)
		You know his friends...real animals.
		And his connections with the police.
		Sure he'd like us to tell him our
		plans so he can set us up for the
		cops and earn their gratitude.
		Then they would owe him a favor;
		that's how he operates.  We'll have
		to pay.  Three hundred, are we
		agreed?

				TESSIO
			(Sicilian)
		What can we do?

Clemenza doesn't even bother checking for Vito's opinion.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		They say Fanucci has a license from
		Maranzalla himself to work this
		neighborhood.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		If you like, why not give me fifty
		dollars each to pay Fanucci.  I
		guarantee he will accept that
		amount from me.

				TESSIO
			(Sicilian)
		When Fanucci says two hundred he
		means two hundred.  You can't talk
		with him.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		I'll reason with him.  Leave
		everything in my hands.  I'll
		settle this problem to your
		satisfaction.

Tessio and Clemenza regard him suspiciously.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		I never lie to people I've accepted
		as my friends.  Speak to Fanucci
		yourself tomorrow.  Let him ask you
		for the money, but don't pay it,
		and don't in any way quarrel with
		him.  Tell him you have to get the
		money and will send me as your
		messenger.  Let him understand that
		you're willing to pay what he asks,
		don't bargain.  I'll go to his
		house, and quarrel with him.  He
		likes me; enjoys explaining how
		things are here.  He uses ten
		sentences when he only needs one,
		so while he talks, I'll kill him.

Clemenza, irritated, makes a large belch, and washes his
food down with wine.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
		Vitone!
			(to Tessio)
		Our driver has drunk too much wine.

				TESSIO
			(Sicilian)
			 (laughs at himself)
		He's going to kill Fanucci.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
			 (stern)
		Then, after that, what?  Joe
		'Little Knife' Pisani; Willie
		Bufalino, maybe, Mr. Maranzalla
		himself, c'mon!

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		Fanucci is not connected; he is
		alone.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
			 (sarcastically)
		What?  You read it in the papers?

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		This man informs to the police;
		this man allows his vengeance to be
		bought off... No, he is alone.

				TESSIO
			(Sicilian)
		If you're wrong...

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		If I'm wrong, they will kill me.

Both Clemenza and Tessio are impressed with their young
friend; his willingness to risk his life on his perception
of the situation.

EXT. NEW YORK STREET - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

A ten piece Italian street band plays in front of the church
to commemorate the first night of the Festa di San Gennaro.
People swarm in crowds, delighted by the music, as out of
the church four men carry the statue of San Gennaro down to
the street.

MOVING VIEW

Clemenza moves along the booths that have been set up along
the street: sausage cooking on an open fire; pork livers and
sweetbeards.  He stops for a sandwich, and makes an irritated
gesture when the vendor expects to be paid.  He crosses to a
church-sponsored booth with a great Wheel of Fortune, and
slaps a dollar on a number.  Standing next to him is Vito;
they embrace.

				CLEMENZA
			(Sicilian)
			 (quietly)
		All three daughters are at church;
		he is alone.  It's important that
		you let his neighbors see you leave.
		Tessio has broken the latch on the
		skylight of his building.

The wheel stops; they both lose.

				CLEMENZA
			(English)
		See, Brother Carmello, even the
		church makes numbers.

				PRIEST
			(English)
		It's only the way we collect that's
		different.

Vito has left while Clemenza jokes with the Priest.

EXT. FESTA STREET - NIGHT

Vito passes the booths of food, crossing toward a small and
dark club.

INT. SOCIAL CLUB - NIGHT

We can still HEAR the crowds and music of the festa.  Vito
enters; the club is empty, except for the large white figure
sitting alone at a small table.  Fanucci barely acknowledges
Vito as he joins him.

Without a word, Vito counts out two hundred dollars on the
table.  Fanucci looks, then takes off his fedora and puts it
on the table over the money.

				FANUCCI
			(Sicilian)
		I think there's only two hundred
		dollars under my hat.
			(he peeks)
		I'm right.  Only two hundred dollars.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		I'm a little short.  I've been out
		of work.  Let me owe you the money
		for a few weeks.

				FANUCCI
			(Sicilian)
		Ah, you're a sharp young fellow.
		How is it I've never noticed you
		before
			(he takes the two
			hundred and pours
			some wine for Vito)
		You're too quiet for your own
		interest.  I could find some work
		for you to do that would be very
		profitable.
			(he rises)
		No hard feelings, eh?  If I can
		ever do you a service let me know.
		You've done a good job for yourself
		tonight.

EXT. FESTA STREET - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

By now the musicians have left, but still families are
walking the street, and stopping at the booths.

Fanucci stands there a moment; he is known by everyone, and
considers himself highly loved.

Then Fanucci begins the walk through the festa, on his way
home.

EXT. ROOFTOPS - MOVING VIEW - NIGHT

Vito silently moves along the rooftop; paralleling Fanucci's
walk.

We HEAR the sounds of the festa, and every so often catch a
glimpse of the patterned lights, and the crowds below.

EXT. FESTA STREETS - MOVING VIEW ON FANUCCI - NIGHT

walking through the crowded streets.  The statue of San
Gennaro is arranged in some midnight religious ceremony.

The VIEW LIFTS UP, to the rooftops.

EXT. THE ROOFTOPS - NIGHT

Vito makes the leap that separates two buildings; then
crosses toward the large skylight in the center of the
building.

EXT. THE STREETS - NIGHT

The procession in the streets is preceded by ten altar boys;
and the glittering Monstrance, something of an altar carried
out into the streets.

The priest begins this nocturnal service, as the crowds in
the street kneel down in prayer.

INT. FANUCCI'S BUILDING - NIGHT

Fanucci unlocks the door to his building; we can HEAR the
services in the background.

EXT. THE ROOFTOP - NIGHT

Vito tries the trap door on the roof; it is stuck firmly
shut; despite Clemenza's instructions.  He struggles with
it, but no luck.

From the distance, the Choir begins to Latin.  Vito moves
around the skylight, to an identical trap, tries this one;
it opens.

EXT. THE MONSTRANCE - MED. VIEW ON THE PRIEST - NIGHT

performing the services in Latin.  The ten altar boys are in
attendance.

EXT. THE ROOFTOP - NIGHT

Vito reaches down into the trap, and pulls out the newly
oiled gun that has been left for him.  He slides down into
the building.

INT. FANUCCI'S HALLWAY - DOWN ANGLE - NIGHT

Fanucci proceeds up the staircase with loud, heavy steps.
An OLD WOMAN on one of the flights sees him, and immediately
moves to her apartment.

				FANUCCI
			(Sicilian)
		What's the matter, Signora?  You
		don't say 'good evening'?

				WOMAN
			(Sicilian)
		'Good evening,' Signor Fanucci.

She quickly disappears behind her door.  Fanucci laughs,
continues up, singing to himself.  The MASS outside is
always in evidence.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Vito climbs down from the attic, and finds Fanucci's rear
door open.  He slips in, and makes his way past the open
windows, out of which pour the music and chanting of the
Mass.  Slowly and quietly he pulls them down, shut.

He moves quietly to a glass door, and peeks out.

WHAT HE SEES:

Three young women, Fanucci's DAUGHTERS, laughing and talking.

VIEW ON VITO

A slip up.  Tessio had said they were out.  He steps outside
to the alley where he can look into the apartment.

ANOTHER VIEW

Fanucci opens the door of his apartment, and enters.

CLOSE VIEW ON VITO

He begins to wrap the gun.

VIEW ON THE DAUGHTERS

Their father greets them with a kiss; and a little religious
gift he has bought for each.

CLOSE ON THE GUN

wrapped in this primitive method of a silencer.  The VIEW
TILTS to Vito, caught in the dilemma of having to kill all
or none of them.  Then something catches his eye.

WHAT HE SEES:

A small gray alley cat is attracted to the young man, comes
up to him and rubs itself against him.  Vito rubs the
animal, speaking softly in Sicilian, then, gaining its
confidence, lifts it up and carefully lets it into Fanucci's
apartment.

He steps back, holding the gun.  We HEAR some Italian
shouted in the house; a loud sound from the cat, and some of
the thumping footsteps of Fanucci.

VIEW ON VITO

holding the wrapped gun, waiting.

WHAT HE SEES:

The white blob of Fanucci opening the door and cursing in
Italian as he throws the cat out.

VIEW ON VITO

squeezing the trigger; the muffled, but still LOUD BLAST
resounding in the building.

VIEW ON FANUCCI

He holds onto the door frame, trying to stand erect, trying
to reach for his gun.  The force of his struggle has torn
the buttons off his jacket and made it swing loose.  His gun
is exposed but so is a spidery vein on the white shirtfront
of his stomach.  Carefully, as if plunging a needle into
this vein, Vito Corleone fires a second bullet.

Fanucci falls to his knees, propping the door open, giving a
terrible groan.  We begin to hear the VOICES of girls inside
the apartment.

Vito quickly opens his wallet, removes the two hundred,
quickly fires one last bullet into Fanucci's sweaty cheek.
Now the towel the gun was wrapped with catches fire,
literally on Vito's hand; quickly he throws it to the
ground, stamps it out...and disappears upward.

EXT. THE ROOFTOPS - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

Vito moves like a cat along the rooftops; we HEAR the
conclusion of the Mass down below.

CLOSE ON VITO

Pausing; we can SEE the great spectacle of lights and
candles on the streets below.

He empties the gun of bullets and smashes the barrel against
the side of the roof ledge.  He reverses it in his hand, and
breaks the butt into two separate halves against the chimney.
He smashes it again, and the pistol breaks into barrel and
handle, two separate pieces.

He then moves along the rooftop, dropping the two separate
fragments into various air shafts.

EXT. THE STREET PROCESSION - MOVING VIEW - NIGHT

The Priest, having completed the ceremony, follows as the
Monstrance is carried off through the streets, as the Choir
sings.

EXT. THE ROOFTOPS - MOVING VIEW - NIGHT

Vito is a dark figure, moving with agility across the
rooftops.

INT. FANUCCI'S VESTIBULE - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

The corpse that was Fanucci, stained with blood.

EXT. PROCESSION - CLOSE VIEW - NIGHT

The statue of San Gennaro, followed by the altar boys.

EXT. CORLEONE TENEMENT - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

Vito's wife; her baby and several friends and neighbors sit
happily on the front stoop of their tenement.  Some of the
men drink wine poured out of a pitcher; we can still HEAR
the music and night sounds of the Festa.

A neighbor is singing a Neapolitan song.

Quietly, without a word, and with only a momentary glance
from his wife, Vito joins the little group; takes a glass of
wine, and listens to the song.

CLOSE VIEW ON VITO

listening to the song.  He reaches out and takes the small
hand of his son.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		Santino, your papa loves you.

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT. ANTHONY'S TAHOE ROOM - NIGHT

The room is large, lit from the outside by a bright evening.
We can see the outline of many toys on the shelves built
along the wall.  We see the dark figure of Michael Corleone
enter the room and approach the bed where his son Anthony
lies curled in messy blankets.  Michael quietly arranges his
small hands and feet and covers the little boy.  Suddenly,
Anthony turns, his eyes open.  He is staring, perfectly
awake, at his father.

				MICHAEL
		Can't you sleep?

No answer.

				MICHAEL
		Are you alright?

				ANTHONY
		Yes.

				MICHAEL
		Did you like your party?

				ANTHONY
		I got lots of presents.

				MICHAEL
		Do you like them?

				ANTHONY
		I didn't know the people who gave
		them to me.

				MICHAEL
		They were friends.

He kisses his boy, and then turns.

				ANTHONY
		Did you see my present for you?

				MICHAEL
		No, where is it?

				ANTHONY
		On your pillow.

				MICHAEL
		I'm leaving very early tomorrow,
		before you wake up.

				ANTHONY
		I know.  How long will you be gone?

				MICHAEL
		Just a few days.

				ANTHONY
		Will you take me?

				MICHAEL
		I can't.

				ANTHONY
		Why do you have to go?

				MICHAEL
		To do business.

				ANTHONY
		I can help you.

				MICHAEL
		Some day you will.

Michael kisses him again.

INT. MICHAEL-KAY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

The room is lit from a small night lamp on Michael's side of
the large bed.

Kay is huddled in blankets, asleep.  Michael closes the door
to his room, moves to his side of the bed, and glances down
to the pillow.

VIEW ON THE PILLOW

is a child's drawing of a long limousine, with a man in a
hat sitting in the back seat.

An arrow pointing to him is marked "DAD." Under it, a nine
year old's handwriting says: "Do you like it?  Check YES __
I liked it or NO __ I didn't like it." Michael turns,
looking for a pencil, and moves to the dresser, where he
places a check next to "YES."

He starts to cross back toward his side of the bed, when Kay
turns, almost in her sleep:

				KAY
		Michael?  Why are the drapes open?

His eyes dart back to the curved, beautifully leaded windows
of the room.  The DRAPES are opened.  Then, without a
second's hesitation, he leaps to the floor, still holding
his son's drawing, as a spray of machine gun bullets sweep
across the windows; glass shattering all over the room.

Kay screams out; rising, still half-asleep.  Michael crawls
toward her, and pulls her down to the floor to him.

Then, for a moment, there is silence, soon filled by the
shouts of men; as flashes of light sweep by the window, as
guards with flashlights come running.

Michael holds Kay to him, knowing they have both survived,
and then gently:

				MICHAEL
		Go with the kids.

EXT. THE TAHOE ESTATE - NIGHT

Suddenly, the great floodlights are turned on, bathing lawns
in an intense blue light.

Groups of ordinarily dressed security men drawn in from all
directions; a state of confusion prevails.  There is no sign
of the attackers.

VIEW BY MICHAEL'S HOUSE

Michael is joined by Rocco Lampone, his gun drawn.

				ROCCO
		They're still on the property.
		Maybe you better stay inside.

				MICHAEL
		Keep them alive.

Six men take up posts by Michael's house.

				ROCCO
		We'll try.

				MICHAEL
		It's important.

He returns inside.

EXT. MAIN GATE AND KENNELS - NIGHT

The character of the summer estate has changed: bright
floodlights illuminate the main points of entry: the main
gate; the waterway; the stone wall that encompasses the
estate on all sides.

Several men with flashlights reinforce the guard at the main
gate.

FULL VIEW

Off in the distance, we see another group of men with
flashlights combing the waterline.  We hear indistinguishable
shouts.

VIEW ON THE KENNELS

The wire gates are opened, and the trained dogs go out
yelping into the outer edge of the estate.

ROOFTOP

One of Rocco's men turns the large floodlight scanning
darkened forest areas, where men could hide.

MOVING VIEW

Men with flashlights and dogs.  Moving through the dark areas.

LOOSE VIEW

A small Corleone launch, with a bright spotlight slowly
cruises the boundaries of the estate.  We SEE the silhouette
of men with guns, quietly waiting and watching.

EXT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Some of the bodyguards by the shattered windows of Michael's
bedroom.

The curtains are drawn from inside.

INT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Kay, the children, and some women servants have come down
from the various rooms into the central living area, that
can be most easily secured.  The little girl is still
asleep; they make you think of an immigrant family, with
their blankets and frightened faces, all waiting in a
central room.

Michael goes up to Kay, squeezes her hand, and whispers:

				MICHAEL
		It will be all right.  We were lucky.

She says nothing; but her face expresses the anger she feels
over the jeopardy Michael has placed his children in.  She
holds her young daughter in her arms.

The door opens, and Rocco enters.  He quickly realizes he is
holding his gun in plain view in front of the family, and
puts it away.  Michael moves to him, and they talk a distance
away from Kay.

				ROCCO
		Your family all seem to be okay in
		the other houses; your Mother's
		still sleeping.

				MICHAEL
		And?

				ROCCO
		No sign of them yet; but they're
		still on the Estate.

We HEAR loud shouting from outside.

				DEANNA (O.S.)
		Goddamn you!  You're all nuts here,
		I'm not goin' to calm down...

MICHAEL'S VIEW

Through the door, that Rocco opens.

Deanna, in her nightgown, has been frightened by the
gunshots; while Fredo in his bathrobe, tries to get her back
into the house.

				FREDO
		Deanna, will you get back into the
		house!

				DEANNA
		I'm getting out of here I said;
		these guys all have guns!

				MICHAEL
		Fredo, can't you shut that woman up!
			(to Rocco's men)
		Get her in here!

The bodyguards, gracefully help Fredo bring the hysterical
Deanna into the safety of the house.

				DEANNA
			(whimpering)
		I don't want to stay here...

				FREDO
		Mike, what can I do, she's a
		hysterical woman...

				KAY
		Leave her alone!  You're talking as
		though she has no right to be
		frightened when there are machine
		guns going off in her backyard.

				MICHAEL
			(to Rocco)
		Have Tom Hagen meet me in the
		Harbor House.

EXT. TAHOE ESTATE - HIGH ANGLE - NIGHT

Michael walks the short distance from his house, to the
boathouse where he conducts his business away from his family.

A small group of bodyguards, carrying machine guns, make the
walk with him from all sides, a respectful distance away.
It gives the appearance of a lonely President moving in his
compound, followed by teams of Secret Service men.

The boathouse is already secured by teams of men, hastily
wakened from their lodge house; a barracks-like structure
where reinforcements are lodged just for this kind of
emergency.

FULL VIEW

In the distance, we can see the teams of men and dogs, with
their lights, guns and shouts, combing every inch of the
estate.

INT. THE BOATHOUSE - EMPTY VIEW - NIGHT

Michael alone in the great room.  He moves to a walk-in
safe, quickly runs through the combination, and opens it.
He takes out an envelope, and puts it into his pocket;
there's a KNOCK on the door, and Hagen enters.  He had been
asleep, and has quickly thrown on a robe.

				MICHAEL
		Sit down, Tom.

EXT. TAHOE BOATHOUSE - NIGHT

From outside the leaded windows, a disoriented Hagen sits
down; Michael starts to talk to him; obviously about
something very serious.

The patrol securing the boathouse, walk past the window.
Michael says something to Tom, who rises, and pulls the
drapes, obscuring OUR VIEW.

INT. TAHOE BOATHOUSE - NIGHT

Michael talks intimately to Tom.

				MICHAEL
		There's a lot I can't tell you, Tom.
		I know that's upset you in the
		past; and you've felt that it was
		because of some lack of trust or
		confidence.  But it is because I do
		trust you that I've kept so much
		secret from you.  It's precisely
		that at this moment, you are the
		only one that I can completely
		trust.  In time, you'll understand
		everything.

				HAGEN
			(nods with this statement)
		But your people... Neri... Rocco;
		you don't think...

				MICHAEL
		No, I have confidence in their
		loyalty... but this is life and
		death, and Tom, you are my brother.

Hagen in very moved.

				HAGEN
		Mikey, I hoped...

				MICHAEL
		No Tom, just listen.  All my people
		are businessmen; their loyalty is
		based on that.  One thing I learned
		from my father is to try to think
		as the people around you think...and
		on that basis, anything is possible.
		Fredo has a good heart, but he is
		weak...and stupid, and stupid
		people are the most dangerous of
		all.  I've kept you out of things,
		Tom, because I've always known that
		your instincts were legitimate, and
		I wanted you to know very little of
		things that would make you an
		accomplice, for your own protection.
		I never blamed you for the setbacks
		the family took under Sonny; I know
		you were in a position of limited
		power, and you did your best to
		advise and caution him.  What I am
		saying is that now, for how long I
		do not know, you will be the Don.
		If what I think has happened is
		true; I will leave tonight, and
		absolutely no one will know how to
		contact me.  And even you are not
		to try to reach me unless it is
		absolutely necessary.  I give you
		complete power: over Neri... Fredo,
		everyone.  I am trusting you with
		the lives of my wife and children,
		and the future of this family,
		solely resting on your judgment and
		talent.

VIEW ON HAGEN

A man who has steadily declined over the last five years,
realizing that total power and responsibility is being
placed on him.

				MICHAEL
			(continuing)
		...But Tom, you must know that I do
		this only because I believe you are
		the only one who is capable of
		taking over for me.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

taking out the envelope.

				MICHAEL
		I've prepared this; have had it for
		over a month.  It won't explain
		everything; but indicates where I
		will be, so in a sense, it is my
		life.
			(he hands the envelope
			to Hagen)
		Also, there are three tasks that
		must be executed immediately.  Pop
		would have given those to Luca --
		You knew Pop as well as anyone, act
		as though you were him.  It
		discusses Kay as well; that will be
		the most difficult.  The men who
		tried to kill me tonight, will
		never leave the estate.

				HAGEN
		Will we...be able to get who
		ordered it out of them?

				MICHAEL
		I don't think so.  Unless I'm very
		wrong...they're already dead.
		Killed by someone inside...very
		frightened that they botched it.
		That's why I am going to disappear
		in a few minutes, and leave
		everything to you.

				HAGEN
		But if you're wrong...

				MICHAEL
		If I'm wrong...

There is a KNOCK on the door.

				MICHAEL
		...I don't think I'm wrong.
			(he indicates the knock)
		Yes.

The door opens; it is Rocco; Michael rises, after making a
knowing glance toward Tom, and moves to talk quietly to a
frightened and agitated Rocco.

EXT. STONE WALL AND STREAM - MOVING VIEW - NIGHT

A group of men with flashlights and guns lead Michael, Tom
and Rocco to the stone bridge spanning the stream which runs
through the estate.

LOW CLOSE VIEW

Michael's dispassionate face, looking down.  THE VIEW MOVES
to Hagen's, and then down to the murky water under the
bridge, where we see the bodies of three strangers, lying in
the moving water; machine-type guns nearby, with their
throats cut.  Light from the many flashlights illuminates
the grotesque scene.

				MICHAEL (O.S.)
		Fish them out.

Several of the men wade down into the stream; Rocco helps,
and even Tom steps down to get a better look at who they
were.  They are total strangers; Rocco examines the type of
guns they used.

When they climb back onto the ground, Michael is gone.
Everyone notices it, but no one says anything.

Hagen stands there, holding the envelope Michael had given
him in his hand.

He realizes that now, he is the DON.

				HAGEN
		Get rid of the bodies.  Tomorrow
		morning I want a report made to the
		local police, and paper, that some
		explosives we keep on the property
		were accidentally ignited.

The men respond; Hagen makes the lonely walk back to the
lighted section of the compound, which now resembles a
prison camp.

							FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. STATE SENATE FLOOR - DAY

The Senate is in session; Senator Geary is on the floor
during a vote.  An aide approaches him, with a slip of paper.

INT. GEARY'S OFFICE - DAY

The Senator steps behind his desk.

				SENATOR GEARY
		All right, Mr. Hagen, you've got
		ten minutes.

He flicks the switch of a small tape recorder.

				SENATOR GEARY
		...and the tape will be running.

				HAGEN
		Actually, I've come with good news;
		the Corleone family has done you a
		favor.

The Senator immediately shuts the tape recorder off.

				SENATOR GEARY
		What the hell are you talking about?

				HAGEN
		We know you're a busy man, with
		plenty of enemies -- we saw the
		opportunity to do you a favor, and
		we did.  No strings.

				SENATOR GEARY
		No strings.

				HAGEN
		You know there's a Senate
		Investigating Committee recently
		set up; we thought it would be
		unfortunate if they were to trace
		anything though-provoking to your
		name.

				SENATOR GEARY
		No one can trace anything to me; I
		pride myself on that.

				HAGEN
		Do you gamble?

				SENATOR GEARY
		A little; what's so thought-
		provoking about that?

				HAGEN
		Do you owe markers?

				SENATOR GEARY
		Maybe two, three thousand dollars.

Hagen leans forward, and deposits a handful of paper on the
Senator's desk.

				HAGEN
		The Corleone family has paid them
		off for you...as an expression of
		our esteem.

Geary quickly looks through the paid markers.

				SENATOR GEARY
		There's thirty grand worth of paid
		off markers -- I never owed that
		much.

				HAGEN
		Our mistake.  But what does it
		matter; it was our money.
			(rising)
		We don't even expect thanks.

				SENATOR GEARY
		You paid off thirty grand I never
		owed.

				HAGEN
		We'll keep it quiet; the people who
		know are trustworthy...the Committee
		needn't find out.

				SENATOR GEARY
		And what's the price of their not
		finding out.

				HAGEN
		Simple.  Be friendly like us.  Not
		hostile.

				SENATOR GEARY
			(he despises Hagen)
		Thanks...friend.

EXT. TAHOE ESTATE - FULL VIEW - DAY

There are more men on duty than usual; not that there are
guns apparent, but it's clear that the boundaries are being
patrolled.

VIEW BY MICHAEL'S HOUSE

Kay exits her house, followed by her children; she helps
them into her station wagon like any housewife, and drives
along the path leading to the main gate.

She's about to drive through, when one of the men steps in
front of her, raising his hand.

				KAY
			(graciously)
		Yes.

				MAN
		I'm sorry, Mrs. Corleone.  We're
		not to let you through.

				KAY
			(disbelieving)
		I'm going to the market.

				MAN
		If you could just give us a list,
		we'll pick up anything you want.

				KAY
		Whose orders are these?

				MAN
		Mr. Hagen's, ma'am.

We notice Hagen walking to them in the background.

				HAGEN
		Kay.

VIEW THROUGH THE GATE

Hagen approaches the car; Kay gets out so they can talk away
from the children.

				HAGEN
		I wanted to explain this myself...
		I had business in Carson City.

He walks with her a little way from the others; the children
run out of the station wagon, and start to play.

				HAGEN
		It's Michael's request...for your
		safety.  We can send out for
		anything you need.

				KAY
		I'm supposed to stay in my house.

				HAGEN
		Within the compound will be fine.

				KAY
		I was supposed to take the children
		to New England next week.

				HAGEN
		That's off now.

				KAY
		I'm going to see my parents.

				HAGEN
		Kay, Michael didn't tell me a lot;
		and what he did tell me, I can't
		repeat.  But the responsibility for
		you and the kids was the most
		important thing he left me with.

				KAY
		How long does this go on?

				HAGEN
		I don't know.
			(pause)
		I'm sorry, Kay...

				KAY
		Am I a prisoner?

				HAGEN
		That's not the way we look at it.

Angrily, without another word, Kay turns away from him, and
walks to her children, ignoring the running station wagon.

EXT. ITALIAN LUXURY LINER - DAY

The luxury liner making its way across the Atlantic.

INT. ITALIAN LUXURY LINER - MED. VIEW - DAY

The PURSER followed by several white uniformed associates
knocks on the door of something designated the "Leonardo
Suite." He is holding a telegram.

The door opens, and a tanned Merle peeks out of the door.

				PURSER
			(holding up the telegram)
		I'm terribly sorry to disturb you
		but we have received two telegrams.

				MERLE
			(reluctantly)
		Well...come in.

This entourage enters the suite, an impressive and
beautifully spacious luxury suite.  Connie is relaxing.

				CONNIE
		What is it?

				PURSER
		Yes.  One is from our office in New
		York.  The check that you wrote for
		your passage has been returned.

				CONNIE
		Can't be...

				MERLE
		Why don't you wire your bank?

				PURSER
		The other telegram is from your
		bank.  Your account has been closed
		and the company is warned not to
		extend any credit.

				CONNIE
		I'll take care of it in Naples.

				PURSER
		The company hopes so.  But for now,
		we have orders to change your
		accommodations.

And with that, the men in white begin to pack Connie and
Merle's luggage.

				CONNIE
		That son of a bitch!

INT. ITALIAN LUXURY LINER - TINY THIRD CLASS CABIN - NIGHT

Connie and Merle are attempting to sleep in the miniature
cabin in bunk beds.  The little space is crowded with their
trunks and luggage.  Merle can barely hang onto the bunk,
the boat pitches so violently below.

EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - MED. VIEW - DAY

A train speeds across the countryside.

INT. THE TRAIN - DAY

Inside the corridor, a porter advances, and knocks on the
door of a stateroom.  A voice tells him to enter.  OUR VIEW
enters with him as he carries a tray of lunch.  From this
POV we see Michael Corleone sitting in the compartment.

				PORTER
		Mr. Paul?

				MICHAEL
		Yes.

				PORTER
		You ordered lunch?

				MICHAEL
		Put it right there.

The porter does so; as he places the tray down, he catches a
glimpse of a second person in the compartment with Michael.

HIS VIEW

A very fierce, almost maniacal looking man, BUSSETTA.  He
nods that the porter should leave.

				MICHAEL
		Thank you.

The porter takes his advice and leaves quickly, closing the
door behind him.

VIEW THROUGH THE WINDOW

Michael and his mysterious companion have lunch together on
the moving train.

EXT. GULFSTREAM RACE TRACK IN MIAMI - HIGH FULL VIEW - DAY

The empty parking lot of the Gulfstream track, on an off-
race day.

CLOSER VIEW

Michael sits behind the wheel of a nondescript late model
car.  Bussetta sits in the rear.

Another car swings into the lot.  Michael starts his car,
and pulls out of the lot; the second car following.

NEW VIEW

This car pulls out and begins to follow them.  Michael
glances back by adjusting the rear view mirror, and nods to
Bussetta.

Michael's car begins to slow down, allowing the other car to
overtake them.

The overtaking car hesitates a moment, moving side by side
with them.

Michael glances toward the driver.

MICHAEL'S VIEW

We recognize Johnny Ola, who waves a greeting to Michael,
and then continues on to lead him.

EXT. SUBURBAN MIAMI NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

Ola's car leads Michael's through a middle-class suburban
area of $30,000 to $40,000 homes.  There are small channels
with sporting and fishing boats parked near the houses.
Ola's car pulls up in front of a very simple, tract-type
home.  Michael's car parks nearby.

				MICHAEL
			(Sicilian)
			 (to Bussetta)
		You'll wait in the car.

Ola has gotten out of his car and walks up the little path
to the front door.  Michael waits.

Ola rings the bell, and after a moment, a rather pretty,
middle-aged WOMAN answers, remaining behind the screen door.
Ola says a few things to her and she disappears, leaving the
door open.

Ola comes down the steps, looks at Michael, nodding to him.
Ola then gets into his car and drives off.  Michael walks up
the walkway and enters the little house, closing the door
behind him.

This woman, TERRI ROTH, is in the kitchen, looking out at
Michael.

				TERRI
		I'm just going to make lunch.  How
		about a tuna fish sandwich?

				MICHAEL
		Thank you, Mrs. Roth.

She hurries halfway up the staircase.

				TERRI
		Hyman...HYMAN, your friend is here.
			(turning to Michael)
		Why don't you go right upstairs, Mr.
		Paul?

				MICHAEL
		Fine.

He continues upstairs; she goes into the kitchen.

				TERRI
		I'll give a yell when lunch is ready.

Michael continues up to a small den on the second floor; we
can HEAR the sound of a baseball game coming over the
television.

INT. HYMAN ROTH'S DEN - DAY

Michael enters the den: it's very comfortable, but somewhat
like a senior citizen's retirement home in Florida.

MICHAEL'S VIEW

There, sitting before the television is a small man in his
middle sixties, thin, with a wizened face, looking like a
small-time retired Jewish businessman.  This is HYMAN ROTH.

				ROTH
		Sit down, this is almost over.  You
		follow the baseball games?

				MICHAEL
		Not for a few years.

				ROTH
		I like sporting events -- I really
		enjoy watching them in the afternoon.
		One of the things I love about this
		country.  I loved baseball ever
		since Arnold Rothstein fixed the
		World Series of 1919...I heard you
		had some trouble.

				MICHAEL
		Yes.

				ROTH
		What a mistake; people behaving
		like that, with guns.
			(he shakes his head)
		It was my understanding we left all
		that behind.  But, let me tell you,
		the important thing is that you're
		all right.  Good health is the most
		important thing; more than success;
		more than power; more than money.

				MICHAEL
		The incident of the other night is
		a nuisance that I can take care of.
		I came to you because I want
		nothing to affect our agreement; I
		wanted to clear everything I'm
		going to do with you, just in case.

				ROTH
		You're a considerate young man.

				MICHAEL
		You're a great man, Mr. Roth, I
		have much to learn from you.

				ROTH
			(warmly)
		However I can help you...

				MICHAEL
		The Rosato Brothers have performed
		services for you in the past; I
		understand that they are under your
		protection.

				ROTH
			(simply)
		We do favors for each other...

				MICHAEL
		Technically, they are still under
		the Clemenza wing of the Corleone
		Family, now run by Frankie
		Pentangeli.  After Clemenza died,
		the Rosatos wanted territory of
		their own.  Pentangeli refused, and
		came to me, asking for permission
		to eliminate them.  I, of course,
		knew of their relationship with
		you, and in gratitude for your help
		with the Tropicana matter, turned
		him down.  Pentangeli was furious,
		and paid one hundred and fifty
		thousand dollars to have me killed.
		I was lucky and he was stupid.
		I'll visit him soon.
			(leaning toward the
			old man, sincerely)
		The important thing is that nothing
		jeopardize our plans, yours and
		mine.  This thing of ours, that we
		will build.

The old man touches Michael's hand, warmly.

				ROTH
		Nothing is more important.

				MICHAEL
			(quietly)
		Pentangeli is a dead man; do you
		object?

				ROTH
		It's always bad for business; but
		you have no choice.

				MICHAEL
		Then it's done.  I must choose his
		replacement: it cannot be Rosato.

				ROTH
		Of course you must keep control of
		your family.

He turns to Michael, turning the volume higher on the
television, and moving closer to his young partner.

				ROTH
		Michael, these things are
		unimportant.  Who should be the
		manager of a dime store, Joe or
		Jack?  Unimportant.  You do what
		you think is right.  You're a young
		man, and I'm old and sick.  What we
		do together in the next few months
		will be history, Michael; it has
		never been done before.  We will do
		this historical thing together, and
		even your Father could never dream
		it would be possible.  We are
		bigger than U.S. Steel, you and
		me... because in America, anything
		is possible!
			(pause)
		But soon I will be dead, and it
		will all belong to you.

There is a KNOCK on the door, and Terri Roth pushes the door
open with her hip.

				TERRI
		My goodness, you'll rupture your
		eardrums, Hyman.

She puts the tray down, and turns down the television.

EXT. ROTH'S HOUSE - MED. VIEW - DAY

The sinister Bussetta waits patiently in the rear seat of
the car, outside Roth's modest house.

EXT. DOWNTOWN NEW YORK - MOVING VIEW - DAY

A black Cadillac moves down the street, slowed by the
Festivities of the Festa that is in progress: people milling
around, buying souvenirs at the many stands set up.

Sausage and grilled meats are prepared, just as they were
years ago.  Electric lights are strung from the street
lamps, and brightly colored banners pronounce the "Festa of
the Madonna."

MOVING CLOSE VIEW

Willy Cicci drives, frustrated that he cannot go any faster.
Next to him, Frankie Pentangeli sits, catching a few seconds'
snooze.

MED. VIEW

The black car pulls up; another car that had been following
it parks nearby.

One of Pentangeli's button men gets out of the car, and
steps into a small Italian restaurant; he exits quickly, and
nods affirmatively toward Pentangeli's Cadillac.

The group of them step out quickly, men huddled around
Pentangeli, and enter the restaurant.

INT. THE RESTAURANT - DAY

The restaurant is quite empty, despite the excitement out on
the street.

Pentangeli immediately sits at a table with a tall, dark,
snappily dressed young man, CARMINE ROSATO.

Nearby, on the other side of the room is Rosato's brother,
TONY, seated with a group of their men.

At another table in the restaurant is a table of Pentangeli's
people: they are joined by bodyguards.

				PENTANGELI
		Rosato, where's your brother?

				ROSATO
		Sitting right behind you.

Pentangeli glances behind himself.

				PENTANGELI
		He don't want to talk?

				ROSATO
		We worked it all out beforehand.

				PENTANGELI
		Are we going to eat or what?

				ROSATO
		Sure, on me.  I got Diner's Club.

				PENTANGELI
			(sarcastically)
		Forget it; I'm suddenly without an
		appetite.  You're making big
		trouble, Carmine.

				ROSATO
		You weren't straight with us,
		Frankie, what else could we do?

				PENTANGELI
		We could have talked first, saved a
		lot of running around.

				ROSATO
		You wasn't listening, you didn't
		want to talk.

				PENTANGELI
		Don't I look like I'm listening?

				ROSATO
		We want Brooklyn one hundred
		percent.  No more taxes to you.  We
		want to be only loosely connected
		with your family -- sort of a
		under-family all of our own.  Then
		we can act on all internal matters
		without talking.  Also we want you
		to inform Michael Corleone that we
		can deal directly with him.

				PENTANGELI
		I'm a little hungry, maybe I'll
		order something.  Joe.
			(one of his men)
		Get me some bracciole or something.
		And pay cash.
			(to Rosato)
		And in return for these concessions,
		what do you do for me?

				ROSATO
		We will release the hostages,
		number one.  Number two, we're here
		for you to count on when you need
		us.  We're independent, but we're
		here if you need us.  In general,
		we'll cooperate with you and your
		businesses, and you in turn will
		cooperate with us.  Pari persu.

				PENTANGELI
		Pari Persu; what the fuck is Pari
		persu...?

				ROSATO
		My lawyer went over this beforehand.

				PENTANGELI
		What assurances do I have that
		there will be no more kidnapping,
		no more hits?

				ROSATO
		The same assurance we got from you.

				PENTANGELI
		What if I say shove it?

				ROSATO
		Then Carmine Fucillo and Tony Blue
		DeRosa will need to be fitted for
		slabs.

				PENTANGELI
		You want a war?

				ROSATO
		We got no choice.

				PENTANGELI
		You know if there's a way I'll go
		to the commission and the commission
		will side with me.  That puts me
		and the other New York families
		against you.

				ROSATO
		We got friends in the commission.

				PENTANGELI
			(getting angry)
		I'm talking about Italians!

				ROSATO
		What about Michael Corleone?

				PENTANGELI
		He supports me.

				ROSATO
		Maybe, yes... maybe no.

One of Pentangeli's men approaches with a plate of Italian
food.

Pentangeli stands up, angered by this remark of Rosato's; he
pushes the dish of food out of the surprised Bodyguard's
hands.

				PENTANGELI
		You drove old Pete Clemenza to his
		grave, Carmine; you and your
		brother.  Turning on him; trouble
		in his territories -- you and your
		demands.  I hold you responsible,
		just as though you shot him in the
		head.  And I ain't gonna let that
		go for long!

Pentangeli walks out of the restaurant; there's a little
tension between the bodyguards of the two factions.

				ROSATO (O.S.)
		Hey, Five-Angels...

He gives him the arm.

Frankie's face turns red, like he wants to have it out here
and now; but Willy Cicci calms his down, and they all make
their move out.

EXT. THE RESTAURANT - DAY

Pentangeli gets into the car.

				PENTANGELI
		Nobody I hate calls me Five-Angels
		to my face!

He slams the door.

EXT. PENTANGELI'S LONG BEACH ESTATE - DAY

Part of the old estate of Don Corleone.  By now, the wall
has been torn down, and the other houses sold off.

His car is parked; Pentangeli steps out, still angry over
the confrontation.  As he approaches the house, he notices
something strained about the bodyguards who discreetly guard
his house.  No one seems to want to tell him.

				PENTANGELI
		What's up?

Pentangeli glances over to the front door foyer.

PENTANGELI'S VIEW

The strange and silent Bussetta, the man who now always
travels with Michael.

INT. PENTANGELI'S HOUSE - DAY

Pentangeli enters; he sees his WIFE, standing oddly in the
hallway.

				PENTANGELI
			(Sicilian)
		What's this?

				WIFE
		Michael Corleone.

				PENTANGELI
		One Michael Corleone...Dove?

				WIFE
			(Sicilian)
		He's in your study.

He knows it is very very serious for Michael to be here in
his home.

He automatically moves into his study.

INT. PENTANGELI'S STUDY - DAY

Michael stands quietly in the room.  This was once his
father's study, although it is totally redecorated.
Pentangeli starts sweating, and moves toward the young Don,
and kisses his hand.

				PENTANGELI
		Don Corleone, I wish you let me
		know you was coming.  We could have
		prepared something for you.

				MICHAEL
		I didn't want you to know I was
		coming.  You heard what happened in
		my home?

				PENTANGELI
		Michael, yes, we was all relieved...

				MICHAEL
			(furious)
		In my home!  In the same room where
		my wife was sleeping; where my
		children come in their pajamas, and
		play with their toys.

He's terrified Pentangeli with his anger; then, just as
suddenly, he talks quietly, calmly.

				MICHAEL
		I want you to help me take my
		revenge.

				PENTANGELI
		Michael, anything.  What is it I
		can do for you?

				MICHAEL
		I want you to settle these troubles
		with the Rosato Brothers.

				PENTANGELI
		I was just going to contact you,
		Michael; we just had a 'sit-down' -
		in fact, I just come from there.

				MICHAEL
		I want you to settle on their terms.

				PENTANGELI
		Mike, I don't understand.  Don't
		ask me to do that.

				MICHAEL
		Trust me; do as I ask.

				PENTANGELI
		It would be the beginning of the
		end for my family.  How can I keep
		all my other territories in like if
		I let two wise-guys stand up and
		demand this and that, and then give
		it to them?

				MICHAEL
		Frankie...do you respect me?  Do I
		have your loyalty?

				PENTANGELI
		Always... But sometimes I don't
		understand.  I know I'll never have
		your kind of brains, in big deals.
		But Mike, this is a street thing.
		And Hyman Roth in Miami is behind
		the Rosato Brothers.

				MICHAEL
		I know.

				PENTANGELI
		Then why do you want me to lay down
		to them?

				MICHAEL
			(coldly, but convincing)
		Frankie, Roth tried to have me
		killed.  I'm sure it was him, but I
		don't know yet why.

				PENTANGELI
		Jesus Christ, Michael, then let's
		hit 'em now, while we still got the
		muscle.

				MICHAEL
		This was my father's old study.
		When I was a kid, we had to be
		quiet when we played near here.
		When I was older, I learned many
		things from him here.  I was happy
		that this house never went to
		strangers; first Clemenza took it
		over, and then you.  My father
		taught me, in this room, never to
		act until you know everything
		that's behind things.  Never.  If
		Hyman Roth sees that I interceded
		with you in the Rosato Brothers'
		favor, he'll think his relationship
		with me is still sound.  I'm going
		somewhere to meet him tomorrow.  We
		have friends in some very important
		business that we're making.  Do
		this for me; you make the peace
		with the Rosato Brothers on their
		terms.  Let the word out that I
		forced you; you're not happy wit
		hit, but acquiesced, just because
		of me.  It will get back to Hyman
		Roth.  Do this, Frankie.  You can
		trust me.

				PENTANGELI
		Sure, Mike.  I'll go along.

				MICHAEL
		Good.

They embrace; Michael kisses him.  He looks at the young
Don, thoughtfully.

INT. TROPICANA HOTEL - CLOSE VIEW - DAY

The money trays are carefully unloaded from the gaming
tables, and put on a cart with others.

The cart, preceded and followed by security guards, is then
wheeled through the casino, into a private, counting room.

INT. COUNTING ROOM - MED. VIEW - DAY

The guards leave the room; the door is locked after them,
leaving only Hagen.  Neri and an ACCOUNTANT, a very fat man.
The numbered boxes are opened, and cash and checks are
spread out on the counting table.

The accountant begins with amazing speed and skill, to count
and divide the money.

				NERI
		Fifteen percent skim?

				HAGEN
		Twenty-five this time.

The accountant stops, and looks up to Neri.

				NERI
		It might show.

				HAGEN
		Mike wants it.

Neri nods, and the accountant continues.  Neri opens a door,
allowing a sandy-haired man, a COURIER, into the room.  The
cream is placed into his pouch personally by Neri.

				NERI
		We've never sent this much with one
		courier.

				HAGEN
			(to the courier)
		Your plans are a little different
		this time.  You skip Miami, and go
		straight to Geneva.  It's to be
		deposited to this number.
			(handing him a small envelope)
		And it's got to be there by Monday
		morning, no slip-up.

				COURIER
		I think I was 'picked-up' last trip.
		That hour layover I had at Kennedy.
		I went over and bought a paper...

Neri has finished putting the 'creamed' money into the pouch.

				NERI
		Those were our people.

				COURIER
		Okay, just thought you should know.

He is just about to close and lock the pouch, when Hagen
gestures that he should wait, and adds more stacks of
carefully packaged bills into the pouch.  Then Neri locks
it, and handcuffs it to the courier's arm, looking
inquiringly at Hagen.

				HAGEN
		Let them count.

The courier is shown out through a private door, and then
the first door is opened.  Two accountants come in with the
guards, and the trays are opened, and the counting process
is begun all over again, this time with the State Tally
sheets.

INT. TROPICANA CORRIDOR - MOVING VIEW - DAY

The courier continues on his way; followed by Hagen and Neri.

				NERI
		What's up?

				HAGEN
		No questions.

				NERI
		I got to ask questions, Tom,
		there's three million dollars cash
		in that pouch; Mike is gone and I
		have no word from him.

				HAGEN
		Al, as far as you're concerned, I'm
		the Don.

				NERI
		How do I know you haven't gone into
		business for yourself?

This hurts Tom; but he is a reasonable man, and he knows he
owes Neri some explanation.

				HAGEN
		You've been through a lot with us
		so I'm going to give you the truth.
		Mike knows it was someone within
		the compound that set him up for
		that hit.  So nobody is to know
		where he is, not you, not Rocco,
		not even his brother Fredo.  Sorry,
		Al, I know how you feel about
		Mike...but he still remembers Tessio.

EXT. KEY WEST - NIGHT

Michael is led to a desolate, night-lit private dock.  He is
followed by the ever-present Bussetta, and they are helped
onto a light-weight, luxury cabin cruiser.  The crew cast
off various ropes, and the boat sets out into the night.

							FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. TAHOE ESTATE - DAY

A seaplane lands nicely by the private Corleone harbor;
Hagen disembarks with his inevitable overloaded briefcase.
He continues down the ramp, past several Buttonmen, dressed
in summer casual attire, and who resemble secret service men
rather than thugs.

His wife THERESA lies on a blanket on the great lawn, with
her youngest children, who run to their father for a kiss.

				THERESA
		Hungry?

				HAGEN
		Just a little.

				THERESA
		I've invited Mama, Sandra and the
		kids for barbecue.

				HAGEN
		What about Kay?

				THERESA
		I couldn't find her.  She's been so
		broody, sticks to herself.

EXT. TAHOE LAWN BARBECUE - MED. VIEW - DAY

Hagen and Sonny's boys are throwing a football around on the
lawn; the littler kids running after them.

Coals are burning in the old style stone barbecue, and
several tables are set for the family.

In the distance, there is always evidence of the bodyguards.

Theresa, Mama and Sandra prepare the steaks.

Hagen relaxes in a sports shirt.

				HAGEN
		Let me try Kay.

He crosses the lawn, to the house on the beach where Michael
and his family live.  Is about to knock on the door:

				HAGEN'S SON
		Hey, Pop, heads up!

The football is flying in his direction; he catches it and
throws it back.  Then he cracks the door open, and peeks in.

INT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - DAY

				HAGEN
		Kay?

He steps in, the beautiful summer living room is neat, but
empty.

				HAGEN
		Anyone hungry?

He moves through the house more quickly; into the dining and
recreation room areas.  A cat jumps off a pile of cushions
and runs across the room.

				HAGEN
		Hello?

				SANDRA (O.S.)
		She's gone, Tom.

Sandra has followed him into Michael's house.

				HAGEN
		What do you mean gone?

				SANDRA
		The Barretts from Rubicon Bay came
		by in a new speedboat.  Rocco tried
		to say she wasn't in, but Kay
		spotted them and asked if they
		would take her and the kids for a
		ride.  That was three hours ago.

				HAGEN
			(furious)
		Why didn't someone tell me!

				SANDRA
		I wanted to tell you alone; your
		wife doesn't know what's going on.

Hagen rushes out of the house.

EXT. TAHOE LAWN - DAY

Hagen moves quickly out of Michael's house; moving across
the lawn to the boathouse.

				HAGEN'S SON
		Hey, Dad!

This time he ignores the thrown ball, and moves directly to
Rocco, who is by some men near the boathouse.

				HAGEN
		Rocco!

				ROCCO
		I know.  I went down to the Barrett
		house.  But she's gone.  They drove
		her and the kids to North Tahoe
		airport.

				HAGEN
		Goddamn it, where were you?

				ROCCO
		I was in my house.  Willy tried,
		but it would have taken some
		strong-arm to stop her, and he
		figured you wouldn't want that.

INT. THE BOATHOUSE - DAY

They enter the boathouse.

				HAGEN
			(to one of the men)
		Get me a Scotch and water.

The man hurries behind the bar.

				ROCCO
		She took a flight to San Francisco.
		We figure she's going to connect to
		New Hampshire; her parents' place.

				HAGEN
			(almost to himself)
		I can't let him down.

He swallows the drink down in several gulps.  And then looks
up to his men watching him.  He's embarrassed to have shown
such weakness.

				HAGEN
		All right, let me think a minute.

Rocco clears the men out.

				ROCCO
		Me too, Tom?

				HAGEN
		Yeah, give me a minute.

Rocco gone, Hagen moves behind the enormous bar, and pours
himself a giant drink.  He drinks that, and calms himself.

				HAGEN
		Oh Christ, Pop.  It was so good
		when you were alive.  I felt I
		could handle anything...

EXT. VIEW FROM BOAT - FULL VIEW - DAY

A beautiful coastal view of a tropical Caribbean city.  An
extraordinary view, high buildings, palm trees, all set
right on the bay.

MED. CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL

on the cruiser, Bussetta a little distance away, watching,
but never speaking.  The dark-skinned CAPTAIN of the cruiser
keeps pointing repeatedly.

				CAPTAIN
		Habana, Habana.

EXT. HAVANA STREET - MOVING VIEW - DAY

Michael and Bussetta are driven in a Mercury sedan, making
its way through the streets of Havana.

CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL

looking out the window.

MICHAEL'S POV

Crowded streets, occasional roving bands playing for the
tourists; there is much evidence of tourism: Americans
walking through the streets with cameras.  Occasionally, we
see a Cuban with a row of numbers attached to his hat,
carrying a big sheet of the daily lottery numbers.  From all
of these street impressions, the city is booming with
activity, but there is also much evidence of whores and
pimps and little children begging in the streets.

MED. VIEW

The big American car stops at an intersection.  Bussetta is
sitting in the forward passenger side; while Michael is in
the back.  He hears tapping on the window; he turns and sees
four Cuban boys tapping on his window and extending their
hands, and rubbing their stomachs as though they were hungry.
The Cuban driver rolls down his window and shouts them away
in Spanish.

INT. HAVANA CASINO LOBBY - MOVING VIEW - NIGHT

Michael is led through a beautiful wooden lobby of the
hotel, done in Spanish style, apparently just recently
completed.  He is approached by a thin, mousy man, SAM ROTH,
who ushers him toward the casino entrance.

				SAM ROTH
		Hiya, Mr. Corleone, I'm Sam Roth.
		Welcome to the Capri; my brother's
		upstairs.  You wanta take a rest
		before you see him, or can I get
		you something, anything at all?

				MICHAEL
		No, I'm fine.

He leads Michael into the main casino.

				SAM ROTH
		This is it!  We think it makes
		Vegas look like the corner crap game.

				MICHAEL
		Very impressive.

				SAM ROTH
		Jake, Jake, come over here.  Mike,
		I want you to meet Jake Cohen; he
		manages the casino for us.

				COHEN
			(appreciating
			Michael's status)
		Mr. Corleone.

Sam turns to Bussetta and extends his glad-hand.

				SAM ROTH
		Pleasure to meet you, I'm sure...

He gets no response whatsoever from Bussetta.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT

An extremely tall, well-built Cuban, tanned and wearing an
attractive mustache, LEON, in his middle forties, reads from
a prepared paper.  His sentences are translated by a smaller
man, standing to his rear.

				LEON
			(Spanish)
		Most respected gentlemen, allow me
		to welcome you to the City of
		Havana, the Republic of Cuba on
		behalf of His Excellency, Fulgencio
		Batista.

THE VIEW BEGINS TO MOVE along the various men gathered for
this meeting.

				LEON (O.S.)
		I'd like to thank this distinguished
		group of American Industrialists,
		for continuing to work with Cuba,
		for the greatest period of
		prosperity in her entire history.
		Mr. William Proxmiro, representing
		the General Fruit Company... Messrs.
		Corngold and Dant, of the United
		Telephone and Telegraph Company; Mr.
		Petty, regional Vice-President of
		the Pan American Mining Corporation;
		and, of course, our friend Mr.
		Robert Allen, of South American
		Sugar.  Mr. Nash of the American
		State Department.  And Mr. Hyman
		Roth of Miami, and Michael Corleone
		of Nevada representing our
		Associates in Tourism and Leisure
		Activities.

VIEW ON THE ENTIRE GROUP

Leon pauses to take a drink of water.  Then proudly, he
lifts a shiny yellow telephone for all to see.

				LEON
		The President would like to take
		this opportunity to thank U T&T for
		their lovely gift: a solid gold
		telephone!  He thought all you
		gentlemen would care to take a look
		at it.

He hands the heavy phone set to one of his aides, and it is
passed in turn to each of the men in attendance.

				CORNGOLD
		Your Excellency, perhaps you could
		discuss the status of rebel activity
		and how this may affect our
		businesses.

MED. CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL

He receives the telephone, and glances at it before passing
it on to Hyman Roth.

				LEON (O.S.)
		Of course.  The rebel movement is
		basically unpopular, and since July
		of 1958 has been contained in the
		Oriente Province, in the mountains
		of the Sierra Muestre.

Michael passes the phone on to Roth.

				LEON
			(continuing)
		We began a highly successful
		offensive against them in March,
		and activities within the city
		itself are at a minimum.  I can
		assure you we'll tolerate no
		guerrillas in the casinos or
		swimming pools!

General subdued laughter.

A CUBAN STREET - LATE DAY

Police are stopping traffic.  Michael's Mercury is among the
cars; a police officer, seeing that some important person is
being driven, walks up to the driver.  He leans forward, and
says something in Spanish to the driver.

The driver, in turn, leans over to Michael.

				DRIVER
		He says it will just be a short
		time and they'll let us through.

Michael looks out the window.

MICHAEL'S VIEW

The old building has been totally surrounded by police and
military vehicles.  Right at this moment, they are waiting
lazily, but soldiers are there with automatic weapons ready.
There is a momentary commotion inside the building, and the
men brace up.  A Captain of the Army detachment says
something in Spanish over a megaphone; and his men put their
weapons at the ready, as other policemen lead a group of
civilians out of the building with their hands up.

They are moved over to some military truck, where they are
frisked before being loaded.

All of a sudden, one of the civilian rebels breaks loose,
and rushes toward the command vehicle.  He hurls himself
into the vehicle, as two police try to pull him out.  A
second later, and there is an explosion; the man obviously
having hidden a grenade on his body, sacrificing his own
life to take the life of the Captain.

There is a commotion, but the military quickly quell it.

CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL

watching.  The police rush to Michael's car and guide it
outside of the trouble area.

MED. VIEW

as they lead and escort the Mercury out of the area.

EXT. HAVANA COUNTRY CLUB - CLOSE VIEW - DAY

Some glasses; rum is poured into them; then Coca Cola.
Quarter limes are squeezed.

				SAM ROTH (O.S.)
		Rum... Coca Cola...a squeeze of
		fresh lime...

Sam prepares the drinks for his brother, Hyman, and a group
of men, including Michael.

				MAN
		Cuba Libres.

				MICHAEL
		I was told the Cubans now call this
		drink: "La Mentira."

				ROTH
		I still don't speak Spanish, Michael.

				MICHAEL
		It means... "The Lie."

A moment's hesitation, then a few of the men laugh.  Now two
Cubans in white carry a table which has a lovely small cake
on it.

				SAM ROTH
		The cake is here.

They all raise their glasses to the old man.

				EVERYONE
			(ad lib)
		Happy Birthday!

Roth glances at the cake and its inscription, is pleased.

				ROTH
		I hope my age is correct: I am
		always accurate about my age.

Some laugh.  He nods, and they begin to cut it, put a piece
on plates, and carry them to the different men.

				ROTH
		Everything we've learned in Vegas
		is true here; but we can go further.
		The bigger, the swankier, the
		plusher the store, the more a sense
		of legitimacy, and the bigger
		business we do.
			(looking at the plate
			brought to him)
		A smaller piece.  What we've
		proposed to the Cuban Government is
		that it put up half the cash on a
		dollar for dollar basis.
			(accepting a smaller piece)
		Thank you.  We can find people in
		the United States who will put up
		our share for a small piece of the
		action, yet we will retain control.

				ONE OF THE MEN
		How much?

				ROTH
		A hundred million dollars.  But
		only if this Government relaxes its
		restrictions on importing building
		materials; we'll need some new
		laws, too, but that will be no
		difficulty.

				ANOTHER MAN
		What are import duties now?

				ROTH
		As much as seventy percent.  Also,
		I'm working out an arrangement with
		the Minister of Labor so that all
		our pit bosses, stick-men and
		Dealers, can be considered
		specialized technicians eligible
		for two year visas.  As of now
		they're only allowed in Cuba for
		six months at a time.  In short,
		we're in a full partnership with
		the Cuban Government.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

is handed a piece of cake.  Roth moves over to a folder of
documents.

				ROTH
			(continuing)
		Here are applications from Friends
		all over the States.  I understand
		Santo Virgilio in Tampa is trying
		to make his own deal.  Well, the
		Cuban Government will brush him off.
		The Lakeville Road Boys are going
		to take over the Nacionale here.
		I'm planning a new hotel casino to
		be known as Riviera.  The new Capri
		will go to the Corleone Family.

MED. VIEW

The cake is sliced and carried to each of the men.

				ROTH
		Then there's the Sevilla Biltmore;
		the Havana Hilton, which is going
		to cost twenty-four million --
		Cuban banks will put up half, the
		Teamsters will bankroll the rest.
		Generally, there will be friends
		for all our friends including the
		Lieutenant Governor of Nevada;
		Eddie Levine of Newport will bring
		in the Pennino Brothers, Dino and
		Eddie; they'll handle actual casino
		operations.

And seeing that all of his friends have been served, Roth
raises his fork.

				ROTH
		Enjoy.

				MICHAEL
		I saw an interesting thing today.
		A man was being arrested by the
		Military Police; probably an urban
		guerrilla.  Rather than be taken
		alive, he exploded a grenade hidden
		in his jacket, taking the command
		vehicle with him.

The various men look up as Michael eats his cake, wondering
what the point of it is.

				MICHAEL
		It occurred to me: the police are
		paid to fight, and the Rebels are
		not.

				SAM ROTH
		So?

				MICHAEL
		So, that occurred to me.

VIEW ON ROTH

He understands Michael's point, if the others do not.

				ROTH
		This country has had rebels for the
		last fifty years; it's part of
		their blood.  Believe me, I know...
		I've been coming here since the
		twenties; we were running molasses
		out of Havana when you were a baby.
		To trucks owned by your father.
			(he chuckles warmly
			over the memory)
		We'll talk when we're alone.

And he returns his attention to the men who are gathered
with him on his birthday.

EXT. ROTH'S PRIVATE TERRACE - DAY

Michael sits alone with the old man, on a terrace that
overlooks the city.

				ROTH
		You have to be careful what you say
		in front of the others... they
		frighten easy.  It's always been
		that way, most men frighten easy.

				MICHAEL
		We're making a big investment in
		Cuba.  That's my only concern.

				ROTH
		My concern is that the three
		million never arrived at Batista's
		numbered account in Switzerland.
		He thinks it's because you have
		second thoughts about his ability
		to stop the rebels.

				MICHAEL
		The money was sent.

				ROTH
		Then you have to trace it.  Michael,
		people here look at me as a reliable
		man.  I can't afford not to be
		looked on as a reliable man.  But
		you know all that; there's nothing
		you can learn from me.  You
		shouldn't have to put up with a
		sick old man as a partner.

				MICHAEL
		I wouldn't consider anyone else.

				ROTH
		Except the President of the United
		States.

He laughs slyly, as though this is some private joke between
them.  Then his laughter becomes a cough, which he painfully
stifles with a handkerchief.

				ROTH
		If only I could live to see it,
		kid; to be there with you.  How
		beautifully we've done it, step by
		step.  Here, protected, free to
		make our profits without the
		Justice Department, the FBI; ninety
		miles away in partnership with a
		friendly government.  Ninety miles,
		just a small step, looking for a
		man who desperately wants to be
		President of the United States, and
		having the cash to make it possible.

				MICHAEL
		You'll be there to see it; you'll
		be there.

INT. MICHAEL'S SUITE - NIGHT

The telephone has just rung; Michael listens.

				OPERATOR
		We have your call to Tahoe, Nevada,
		sir.

				MICHAEL
		Thank you.
			(click, click)
		Tom?  Tom, is that you?

				ROCCO (O.S.)
		No, Tom's out of town.  This is
		Rocco.  Who is this?

Michael is openly disturbed that Hagen is not there.  He
hangs up without answering.

EXT. NEW ENGLAND HOUSE - DAY

Tom Hagen steps out of a taxicab a bit tentatively, and then
steps toward the door of a pleasant New England house.  He
rings the bell and waits, hat in hand.  A moment later, the
door opens, and Kay is standing there.

				KAY
		I'm not surprised to see you, Tom.

INT. SMALL ROOM - NEW ENGLAND HOUSE - MED. VIEW - DAY

Out to the yard, where we can see glimpses of little Anthony
playing by himself.

				KAY (O.S.)
		I can't love a man like that; I
		can't live with him, I can't let
		him be father to my children.  Look.

The little boy, moodily by himself.

VIEW ON KAY

obviously moved.

				KAY
		He's not like a little boy... he
		doesn't talk to me; he doesn't want
		to play; he doesn't like other
		children, he doesn't like toys.
		It's as though he's waiting for the
		time he can take his Father's place.
			(almost in tears)
		You know what he told me when he
		was four years old.  He said he had
		killed his Grandfather...

VIEW ON HAGEN

listening, calmly.

				KAY
		... He said he had shot his
		Grandfather with a gun, and then he
		died in the garden.  And he asked
		me... he asked me, Tom, if that
		meant now his father would shoot
		him out of... revenge.
			(she cries)
		How does a four year old boy learn
		the word... 'revenge'?

				HAGEN
		Kay... Kay...

VIEW ON KAY

				KAY
		What kind of a family is this...
		are we human beings?  He knows his
		Father killed his Uncle Carlo.  He
		heard Connie.

				HAGEN
		You don't know that's true.  But
		Kay, just for the sake of an
		argument, let's assume it is, I'm
		not saying it is, remember, but...
		What if I gave you what might be
		some justification for what he
		did... or rather some possible
		justification for what he possibly
		did.

				KAY
		That's the first time I've seen the
		lawyer side of you, Tom.  It's not
		your best side.

				HAGEN
		Okay, just hear me out.  What if
		Carlo had been paid to help get
		Sonny killed?  What if his beating
		of Connie that time was a deliberate
		plot to get Sonny out into the open?
		Then what?  And what if the Don, a
		great man, couldn't bring himself
		to do what he had to do, avenge his
		son's death by killing his
		daughter's husband?  What if that,
		finally, was too much for him, and
		he made Michael his successor,
		knowing that Michael would take
		that load off his shoulders, would
		take that guilt?

				KAY
		He's not the same as when I met him.

				HAGEN
		If he were, he'd be dead by now.
		You'd be a widow.  You'd have no
		problem.

				KAY
		What the hell does that mean?  Come
		on, Tom, speak out straight once in
		your life.  I know Michael can't,
		but you're not Sicilian, you can
		tell a woman the truth; you can
		treat her like an equal, a fellow
		human being.

There is a long silence.

Then Hagen shakes his head; he can tell her no more.

				HAGEN
		If you told Michael what I've told
		you today, I'm a dead man.

				KAY
		When is it finally over?  I want it
		to be over before my baby is born.

				HAGEN
		I don't know.  I hope soon; but
		it's not over yet, and that's why
		you and the kids have to come back
		to me.

He looks at her; it's clear that he has been entrusted with
her safety and her children's.

He is a kind, good man, and seems very nervous and
overwrought.

VIEW ON THE WINDOW

Little Anthony is pressing his face against the glass pane,
as though he senses the adults are discussing something of
importance to him.

INT. TROPICANA HOTEL-CASINO - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

The Baccarat table.  Busy, hundred dollar bills being played.

				LOUDSPEAKER
		Mr. Corleone; Mr. Freddie Corleone,
		telephone please.

				PIT BOSS
		Not here.

VIEW ON THE CRAP TABLES

The play is fast; pit boss presiding; but no sign of Fredo.

				LOUDSPEAKER
		Telephone for Mr. Corleone.

ANOTHER PART OF THE CASINO

We see Neri, ominous, presiding over the entire store.  He
picks up a pit telephone.

				NERI
		He's backstage.
			(and hangs up disgustedly)

INT. TROPICANA BACKSTAGE AREA - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

Fredo is entertaining two showgirls done up in feathers and
what-have-you.

				FREDO
		C'mon, you got fifteen minutes
		before the finale!  I want to show
		you a trick with feathers.

				STAGEHAND
		Phone for you.

				FREDO
		Don't go away; wait a minute.

He takes the phone; we can catch a VIEW of the show going on
from the wings.

				FREDO
			(on the phone)
		Yeah.  Okay.  Who?  Mikey?  But...
		Si... si, caposco.
			(in Sicilian)
		Sure... how much?  I understand.
		Jesus, three million... I won't let
		you down.  Sure.

He hangs up thoughtfully.

				ONE OF THE GIRLS
		Freddie; we still got twelve
		minutes before the finale!

				FREDO
		Yeah... some other time.

EXT. NEW YORK BAR - DAY

There is a light rain.  Pentangeli steps out of his car;
points to Willy Cicci.

				PENTANGELI
		Wait in the car.

He walks up the street, to the bar, where he is greeted by
the tall, handsome Carmine Rosato.  They shake hands.
Pentangeli looks in his hand.

CLOSE VIEW

Rosato has put a crisp one hundred dollar bill in his hand,
folded sharply in two.

				PENTANGELI
		What's this?

				ROSATO
		That's a lucky C note for our new
		deal.

He puts his arm around Pentangeli, and they walk into the bar.

INT. THE BAR - DAY

The bar is fairly empty; and very dark.  Pentangeli and
Rosato step up to the bar; the bartender momentarily stops
polishing glasses to pour a couple of drinks.

				ROSATO
		We were all real happy about your
		decision, Frankie; you're not goin'
		to regret it.

He holds up the glass.

				PENTANGELI
		I don't like the C-note.  I take it
		like an insult.

Suddenly, a garrote is thrown around Pentangeli's throat;
and he is forcefully yanked back into the shadows, all the
way into a wooden telephone booth.

CLOSE VIEW

The folded hundred dollar bill resting on the bar.

MED. CLOSE - THE PHONE BOOTH

We see only Pentangeli's feet and legs, struggling.  We HEAR
the terrible sounds of a man being strangled.

CLOSE ON ROSATO

Calm, and then he sees something that disturbs him.

				ROSATO
		Shit, your friend the cop!

Suddenly, the side door opens, and a shaft of sunlight cuts
through the darkness.

				COP
		Everything all right in there,
		Ritchie?  The door was open.

CLOSE ON THE PHONE BOOTH

Pentangeli's feet stop moving.

				RITCHIE
		Just cleaning up.
			(strained voice)
		You okay?

				COP
		Is that something on the floor?

				ROSATO
		Take him!

				VOICE
		Okay.

				RITCHIE
		Not here; not a cop, not here!

Two figures race through the shadows and race through the
doors.

				COP
			(shouting to his
			partner, in uniform)
		Stutz!  Watch out, Stutz!

EXT. THE BAR - DAY

We see that a patrol car had stopped for its routine visit.
STUTZ, the second patrolman, is just stepping out of his
car; Pentangeli's bodyguard, seeing the commotion, leaps out.
Three men, including Rosato, rush out.  There is gunfire;
Cicci is wounded.

MED. CLOSE

The patrolmen is grazed across the face; trying to stop the
flow of blood with his hand.

NEW VIEW

The three assailants jump into the car and drive off.

INT. THE BAR - DAY

The stricken Pentangeli comes back to life.  He can barely
move his lips.

				PENTANGELI
		The bastard.  The dirty bastard, he
		gave me a C-note.  He gave me a C-
		note.

He sees the patrolman leaning over him.

EXT. PATROL CAR - DAY

The Sergeant is on the car radio.

				SERGEANT
		Frankie Pentangeli murder attempt.
		Patrolman Stutz shot.  Sahara
		Lounge - Utica Avenue and Claredon
		Road.  White Cadillac three or four
		men took off from scene.  Need
		ambulance; Stutz is bad.  Taking
		Pentangeli into custody...

INT. ROTH'S SUITE IN HAVANA - MED. CLOSE VIEW ON ROTH - DAY

His wizened face, pale.  Right now, though, his eyes have a
sparkle as he watches three million dollars in cold cash
being counted on a card table in front of him.

His brother Sam is present, and the sandy-haired Courier, a
little nervous; the one who had left from the Tropicana with
the Corleone skim-money.  Also Johnny Ola.  The money is
evidently all there; Roth picks up a packet; probably a
hundred thousand dollars, and throws it over to the Courier.

				ROTH
		Make it fast; I don't want to
		chance him being seen.

				COURIER
			(frightened)
		What about the arrangements?  How
		can I be sure about the arrangements?

				OLA
		Relax.  You're under our protection;
		the Corleone family will never find
		you.

Ola leads the Courier to the adjoining room where two
smartly dressed Military (Cuban) Police are standing, and a
civilian.  The Courier sees them, looks back to Ola.  One of
the police steps forward, placing the Courier under arrest;
handcuffing him.

				COURIER
		Hey, what's this?

The other takes the packet of money, and hands it to the
civilian, who places it in the briefcase he carries.  The
other officer kneels down and fastens leg manacles.

				COURIER
		The arrangements... YOU BASTARDS!
		What...

The Captain strikes him expertly across the side of his head
with his pistol.

Ola closes the door on this scene.

EXT. THE HAVANA CAPRI - DAY

Fredo Corleone steps out of a car, squints up at the sunshine
and palm trees.  He is holding on tightly to a small satchel,
which he won't let the bellman carry along with his other
things.

INT. MICHAEL'S SUITE - MED. CLOSE VIEW - DAY

Michael and Fredo in a brother's embrace; they kiss each
other.  Fredo is still in his jacket, holding the satchel.

				FREDO
		Mikey.  How are you?

He glances up at Bussetta, who doesn't say a word.  Fredo
extends his hand.

				FREDO
		Hiya, Freddie Corleone.

				MICHAEL
		Mio fratello.

Then Bussetta offers his hand back to Fredo.

				FREDO
			(taking off his jacket)
		What a trip, Jesus Christ, the
		whole time I'm thinking what if
		someone knew what I got in here.

He undoes the combination of the briefcase starts taking out
cash.  Then he stops, remembering that there's a stranger in
the room.

				FREDO
		Oh, 'scuse me.

				MICHAEL
		It's all right.  He stays with me
		all the time.

				FREDO
		Oh.  Mikey, what's up?  I'm totally
		in the dark.

				MICHAEL
		We're making an investment in Havana.

				FREDO
		Great, Havana's great.  Lots of
		activity in Havana!  Anybody I know
		here.  Five-Angels?  Anybody?

				MICHAEL
		Johnny Ola... Hyman Roth.

				FREDO
		I never met them.

				MICHAEL
		Pentangeli's dead.  He was ambushed
		by the Rosato Brothers.
			(pause)
		Didn't you know that?

				FREDO
		No.  No, I didn't.  Who tells me
		anything?  I been kept in the dark
		so long, I'm getting used to it.

				MICHAEL
		I want you to help me, Fredo.

				FREDO
		That's what I'm here for.

				MICHAEL
		Tonight I want to relax with you.
		The Senator from Nevada is here
		with some people from Washington.
		I want to show them a good time in
		Havana.

				FREDO
		Count on me; that's my specialty.

				MICHAEL
		I'd like to come along.  There's
		been a lot of strain, and I've been
		cooped up in this room for three
		days.

				FREDO
		Me and you, great!  Gimme an hour
		to wash my face and do my research
		and we'll have these Washington
		suckers right where you want 'em.
			(then a thought
			strikes him)
		Poor Frankie Five-Angels.  He
		always wanted to die in bed...with
		a broad.

INT. ROTH'S SUITE - MED. VIEW - DAY

Michael stands at Roth's door carrying the briefcase that
Fredo had brought.

A hotel DOCTOR takes Hyman Roth's blood pressure, while his
wife waits nervously.

				DOCTOR
			(Spanish)
		You must not exert yourself; I will
		write out a prescription and come
		back tomorrow.

				HOTEL MAN
		He's going to write a prescription.

				ROTH
		I want my own doctor; fly him in
		from Miami.  I don't trust a doctor
		who can't speak English.

The doctor is shown out.  Roth gestures to the hotel man,
who also leaves.  Then he looks to his wife.

				ROTH
		Honey, go down to the casino?

				TERRI
		If you feel better...

				ROTH
		I do.  Play the Bingo game.

They kiss, and she leaves.  Also Bussetta and Ola remain.

				ROTH
		My sixth sense tells me you have a
		bag full of money in your hand.

Ola locks the door; Michael nods, and opens the bag, spilling
its contents on the card table.

				MICHAEL
		This doubles my investment.

				ROTH
		Still no word of your courier?
		We'll find him.  But at least this
		will satisfy our friends here.
		You've been invited to the New Year
		reception at the Presidential Home.
		I understand your brother is here
		as well; I hope he'll come.

				MICHAEL
		Six million dollars in cash is a
		high price for a piece of a country
		in the middle of a revolution.

Roth looks patiently at Michael, as though he were a child
who hadn't minded the lesson that he had been taught over
and over again.

				ROTH
		You're a careful kid, and that's
		good.  But look.  An international
		dispatch on the wire service.
		American journalism, not propaganda.
		The government troops have all but
		eliminated the rebels.  All but
		their radio station.

				MICHAEL
		I've read it; I'm pleased that the
		government is doing so well.  As a
		heavy investor, I'm pleased.  How
		did the doctor find you?

				ROTH
		Terrible.  I'd give twice this
		amount to take a piss without it
		hurting.

				MICHAEL
		Who had Frankie Pantangeli killed?

				ROTH
			(taken a bit off-balance)
		Why...the Rosato Brothers.

				MICHAEL
		I know that; but who gave the go
		ahead.

Roth glances to Ola; he is not a fool; he realizes Michael
has begun to suspect him.

				MICHAEL
		I know it wasn't me...so that
		leaves you.

				ROTH
		There was this kid that I grew up
		with; he was a couple years younger
		than me, and sort of looked up to
		me, you know.  We did our first
		work together, worked our way out
		of the street.  Things were good
		and we made the most of it.  During
		prohibition, we ran molasses up to
		Canada and made a fortune; your
		father too.  I guess as much as
		anyone, I loved him and trusted him.
		Later on he had an idea to make a
		city out of a desert stop-over for
		G.I.'s on the way to the West Coast.
		That kid's name was Moe Greene, and
		the city he invented was Las Vegas.
		This was a great man; a man with
		vision and guts; and there isn't
		even a plaque or a signpost or a
		statue of him in that town.  Someone
		put a bullet through his eye; no
		one knows who gave the order.  When
		I heard about it I wasn't angry.  I
		knew Moe; I knew he was headstrong,
		and talking loud, and saying stupid
		things.  So when he turned up dead,
		I let it go, and said to myself:
		this is the business we've chosen.
		I never asked, who gave the go
		ahead because it had nothing to do
		with business.

He regards Michael silently a moment.

				ROTH
			(continuing)
		There's three million dollars on
		that table.  I'm going to lie down,
		maybe take a nap.  When I wake up,
		if it's still there, I'll know I
		have a partner.  If it's gone, then
		I'll know I don't.

The old man turns, and moves in his slippers, toward his
bedroom.

INT. THE CORRIDOR - DAY

Michael closes the door, and moves down the hallway.  He is
followed by Bussetta, who had waited in the corridor.

				MICHAEL
			(Sicilian)
		How sick do you think the old man is?

				BUSSETTA
			(Sicilian)
		He'll live longer than me.

INT. TROPICOR NIGHT CLUB - VIEW ON THE SHOW - NIGHT

A Havana extravaganza, with tall, beautiful showgirls done
up in flamboyant, 'South-of-the-Border' Carmen Miranda
costumes; the lead singer is a six foot blonde doing "Rum
and Coca Cola" in that style.  Her name is YOLANDA.

MED. VIEW

At a large round table, located in an obvious VIP section of
the high, tropically draped room with living ferns and other
tropical planting with artificial stars.

Michael rises, to be introduced by Fredo to some conservative
looking Senatorial types, including Senator Pat Geary of
Nevada.  We notice Bussetta standing nearby.

				FREDO
		Does everyone know everyone, or
		nobody knows nobody.  Here, my
		brother, Michael Corleone... well,
		you know Senator Geary.

Geary warmly shakes Michael's hand.

				SENATOR GEARY
		Good to see you, Mike; I'm glad we
		can spend this time together.

				FREDO
		This is Senator Payton from Florida;
		Judge DeMalco from New York...
		Senator Ream... Mr. Questadt from
		California, he's a lawyer with the
		Price-Control Administration.  And
		Fred Corngold of U T&T.

They all make themselves comfortable.  A waiter with a tray
of drinks appears.

				FREDO
		Gentlemen... your pleasure?  Cuba
		Libres, Pina Coladas, you name it.

				SENATOR GEARY
		I'll take a Yolanda.

Laughter.

				FREDO
		Later, later.  All those girls look
		like they're on stilts!

The various tropical drinks are distributed.

				SENATOR GEARY
		To a night in Havana!

They all join in.

				FREDO
			(aside to Michael)
		Jeeze, it's great you came along,
		Mike... You know, we've never spent
		a night out on the town together.
		I always thought you looked down on
		me for liking a good time.

				MICHAEL
		I never looked down on you, Fredo.
		You don't look down at a brother.

INT. THE CASINO - NIGHT

By now the group has made its way into the casino.  Some of
them are crowded around the crap table; Senator Geary is
with the enormous and beautiful Yolanda, who barely speaks
English.  There are other girls with some of the men; not
with Michael, who gambles dollars while talking to Corngold.

				CORNGOLD
		Our information is that Castro is
		dead.  There are maybe a few
		hundred die-hards in the Sierra
		Muestra; but government troops are
		going to clean them out any day.

Johnny Ola approaches Michael.

				OLA
		Mike, can I talk to you.

Michael follows Ola toward the Baccarat table; a watchful
Bussetta moves, a distance away, with them.

				OLA
		Listen, this Senator from Florida
		already has a hundred grand worth
		of markers on the table.

We can see Senator Ream at the table, making thousand dollar
bets on the Bank.

				OLA
		They asked him to sign paper to
		take down the markers; but he got
		mad; told them to wait until he was
		finished.

				MICHAEL
		Let him gamble.

				OLA
		Okay.  You know he doesn't have
		that kind of money.

				FREDO
		Mike said let him gamble.

Fredo puts his arm around his brother; he is high with the
first attention Mike has ever given him, as though finally
he is being taken seriously; as though his brother needs him.

				FREDO
		Mike, I got something special up my
		sleeve for these boys.  You ever
		hear of "Superman?" And I don't
		mean the comic book.

				MICHAEL
		No.

				FREDO
		Wait'll you see!

INT. HAVANA BAR - NIGHT

Our group are in a large Havana bar; the walls totally
covered with hundreds of fifths of different types of rum
and other liquor.

A couple of the girls from the show are out with the men;
Yolanda herself is giving them a private song and dance.

Fredo is a little loaded, and especially attentive to
Michael this night.

				FREDO
		Mikey, why would they ever hit poor
		old Frankie Five-Angels?  I loved
		that ole sonuvabitch.  I remember
		when he was just a 'button,' when
		we were kids.  We used to put
		bedsheets on our heads, you know,
		like we were ghosts.  An' ole
		Frankie come peek into our room,
		we'd jump up, and he'd always
		pretend like he was really scared.
		You remember?

				MICHAEL
		It was hard to have him killed.

				FREDO
		You?  What do you mean you, I
		thought...

				MICHAEL
		It was hard to have him killed.

				FREDO
		You?  What do you mean you, I
		thought...

				MICHAEL
		It was Frankie tried to have me hit.

				FREDO
		No.  I mean, are you sure?

				MICHAEL
		You know otherwise, Freddie?

				FREDO
		Me?  NO, no, I don't know anything.
		Fellas!  You're all falling asleep.
		We got to see Superman.

CLOSE ON MICHAEL

A growing feeling about his brother.

EXT. GARISH HAVANA STREET - NIGHT

The street is lit with tons of neon signs; it is alive with
people; some roving bands of musicians.  Everywhere are
little boys running around, begging for money.  And in
doorways and windows are silent, dark-skinned women.

				SENATOR REAM
			(pushing away from
			the palm outstretched
			little hands of the boys)
		Goddamn beggers.  Goddamn city of
		beggars and pimps and whores.  And
		we bend over backwards to support
		them with the goddamn sugar quota.

				FREDO
			(to Geary)
		What's eating him?

				SENATOR GEARY
		He lost a quarter million dollars
		at the casino.

				SENATOR REAM
		...goddamn city of whores...

				SENATOR GEARY
		He gave them a bad check.

INT. 'SUPERMAN SHOW' - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

A large room with a succession of platforms arranged step-
like around a circular area which becomes a stage.

There are a hundred or so people, practically all men,
tourists and business men, standing on the different levels,
forming the audience.

In the center of the stage is a thick, telephone type pole,
to which is tied a young Cuban girl, in a flimsy white
sacrificial slip.  A small band, mostly drummers, play some
Latin music.

MED. VIEW

Fredo's party standing on the ramp, looking down at the
spectacle.  They're a little woozy from the drinks and late
hour.  Michael is with them, but now we sense he is using
this time, with all exhausted and drunk, to come to some
important conclusions.

				QUESTADT
		Why do we have to stand?

				FREDO
		Everyone stands.  But it's worth
		it, watch!

VIEW ON THE ARENA

Now two high priestesses, scantily clad, bring in a tall and
muscular Cuban, done up in chains and loin cloth, as though
he were a captured slave.  This is SUPERMAN

VIEW ACROSS THE MEN TO THE STAGE

				FREDO
		That's him; that's Superman!

Some preliminary pornographic proceedings go on, as the
priestesses lead the slave to the virgin tied to the post.
The music is percussive and wild.

MED. VIEW ON THE MEN

				SENATOR GEARY
		Ohmygod.  I don't believe it.

				QUESTADT
		It's got to be fake.

				FREDO
		That's why they call him Superman.
		Johnny Ola told me about this; I
		didn't believe it.

CLOSE on Michael turning away.  Not because of the spectacle
which he finds disgusting, but at what his brother is saying.

				FREDO (O.S.)
		... but seeing is believing.  Ole
		Johnny knows all the places.  I
		tol' you... can you believe it?

If Michael would ever allow himself to cry, it would be now.

				FREDO
			(continuing)
		The old man Roth, would never come;
		but Johnny knows these places like
		the back of his hand...

							FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

INT. MICHAEL'S SUITE - MED. VIEW - MORNING

Michael is alone in his bedroom; it seems as though he
hasn't slept very much, but sits by his window, looking out
at the city.  He is troubled and tired.

His radio is on:

				RADIO
			(Spanish)
		"This is Rebel Radio: Rebel troops
		of Column Four 'Jose Marti' took
		the town of Baire yesterday at 8:30
		p.m.  The enemy has retreated..."

EXT. CUBAN STREET - MORNING

This street in Havana is like a Caribbean tourist city with
no indication of the revolution in progress.

Michael walks along the street, alone, past the Cubans on
their way to work; past the American ladies who have gotten
up early for their shopping spree.

				RADIO
			(Spanish)
			 (continuing)
		... An important military action is
		developing along a 35-kilometer
		stretch of the Central Highway.
		Numerous enemy garrisons are left
		with two alternatives, surrender or
		annihilation...

One full block away, Bussetta rides in the front seat of the
dark Mercury, driving slowly, giving Michael his privacy,
but never letting him out of Bussetta's sight.

CLOSE ON MICHAEL

watching.

MICHAEL'S VIEW

Shopkeepers happily luring the tourists into their shops in
broken English.  Havana is prosperous.

				RADIO
			(continuing)
		... Victories in war depend on a
		minimum on weapons and to a maximum
		on morale...

VIEW ON MICHAEL

glances back to the dark car following him.  In a moment, it
pulls up to him, and he gets into the back seat.

EXT. AMERICAN MILITARY MISSION - VIEW ON MICHAEL - DAY

standing by his car, looking through the cyclone fencing
that borders this military training camp operated by the
American Army near the city.

				RADIO
		... War is not a simple question of
		rifles, bullets, guns and planes...

CLOSER VIEW INTO THE CAMP

EXT. HAVANA STREET - DAY

A street singer, followed by a guitarist sings Jose Marti's
words of "Guantanamera." It is solemn, as though it is a
song of protest, a song of the revolution.

Nearby, in a restaurant, Michael has lunch with Fredo.

				MICHAEL
		How is your wife, Fredo...your
		marriage?

				FREDO
			(eating)
		You know her; drives me crazy, one
		minute she's a popsicle, the next
		she's all vinegar.  Sometimes I
		think... I think - I should a
		married someone, like you did.  To
		have kids, to have a family.

Michael turns, distracted for a moment at something the
singer has sung.

				MICHAEL
		"Yo soy un hombre sincero..."
		I am a sincere man,
		From the land of the palms...

				FREDO
		What's that?

				MICHAEL
		The song.  Are you sincere with me,
		Fredo?

				FREDO
		Sincere.  What are you talking
		about, of course I'm sincere with
		you, Mike.

				MICHAEL
		Then I'm going to confide in you;
		trust you with something.

				FREDO
			(Sicilian)
		Mike, are you crazy, I'm your
		brother.

				MICHAEL
		Tonight we've been invited to a
		reception at the Presidential
		Palace; to bring in the New Year.
		You and I will go in a special car
		that's being sent.  They'll have
		cocktails... then dinner, and a
		reception with the President.  When
		it's over, it will be suggested
		that you take Questadt and his
		friends from Washington to spend
		the night with some women.  I'll go
		home alone in the car; and before I
		reach the hotel, I'll be
		assassinated.

				FREDO
		...Who?

				MICHAEL
		The same man who tried in Nevada...
		Hyman Roth, not Pentangeli.

				FREDO
		But, you told me yourself...

				MICHAEL
		It was never Pentangeli... I've
		always known that.  It was Roth all
		along.  He talks to me as a son; as
		his successor, but the old man
		thinks he'll live forever.

				FREDO
		What do you want me to do?

				MICHAEL
		To go tonight, with me, as though
		we know nothing.  I've already made
		my move.

				FREDO
		What is it?  Can I help?

				MICHAEL
		The old man will never bring in the
		New Year.

Fredo realizes what he means; looks immediately to Bussetta,
who had been sitting near the door and the musicians.  He is
gone.

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - MOVING VIEW ON BUSSETTA - NIGHT

The first time ever away from Michael, moving toward us
quickly.  He stops, knocks on the door of Roth's suite.
Then quickly for a man his size, he moves without noise to
the adjoining door, opens it with a key, and disappears
inside.

A moment elapses on the empty corridor, and then a roused
Johnny Ola, opens the first door.  He steps out into the
corridor, to see who had knocked.  Confused, he is about to
return inside, when Bussetta easily breaks his neck in two
from behind.

INT. THE SUITE - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

as Bussetta quietly pulls the limp body of Johnny Ola, his
head bent at an impossible angle, and lays it at the foot of
the couch.

EXT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT

Guards who are regular troops patrol the Palace in twos,
carrying machine weapons.

Now an elite officer, checks the identification of the
various cars carrying dignitaries, as they are driven up to
the Palace.  The one being inspected at the moment contains
Fredo and Michael.  We can see the beautifully dressed
people on their way to the reception, and sense the cheerful
mood of this New Year's Eve.

INT. THE SUITE - NIGHT

Bussetta bends over Ola's body, tying the wrists and knees
with electrical extensions.  He then easily carries the body
to the small balcony which all the rooms have.

EXT. THE BALCONY - NIGHT

Bussetta swings the body over the side of the balcony
railing; tying the extension cord to the railing, and
suspending the body so that it is invisible both from the
inside and out during the night.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - VIEW ON THE MAIN FOYER - NIGHT

The PRESIDENT, his WIFE and six oldest CHILDREN great
formally the many beautifully and affluently dressed guests.
He speaks to them in Spanish, as one by one they file to him.

Michael and Fredo are presented in a group with several
other Americans, including several of the American
businessmen with interests in Cuba.

EXT. STREETS OF HAVANA - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

The excitement of the night is beginning to build; people
are out in the streets; poor people, but they are
enthusiastic and lively.

NEW VIEW

Traffic stops, as an ambulance speeds its way to a hospital;
SIREN going.

INT. THE SUITE - NIGHT

Bussetta delicately picks up a small satin cushion that had
fallen from the couch, and replaces it as though nothing had
happened.  Slowly he cracks the door open which adjoins
Roth's bedroom.  There is a slight commotion; whispered
voices.

BUSSETTA'S VIEW

Terri, Mrs. Roth, is crying.  A group of men lift Hyman
Roth's frail body onto a stretcher.

CLOSE ON BUSSETTA

realizes that this is the man he is to kill.

CLOSER VIEW ON ROTH

He is alive; breathing hard with his mouth dry and open.
The doctor examines him, and then gives instructions to the
orderly who carries him out, presumably to the ambulance.

Bussetta closes the door on this VIEW.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT

An orchestra plays for the guests, as an army of waiters
serve champagne and hors d'oeuvres.  Michael relaxes with
Senator Geary, Major Leon, and several of the Americans.

				QUESTADT
		The embargo on arms shipments from
		the U.S. to your government, was
		just a necessary public relations
		move... Only last month, your air
		force received a major shipment of
		rockets...

Michael glances at his watch; Fredo concentrates on this.

				SENATOR GEARY
		We believe in non-intervention...
		but the agreement stipulates that
		our forces may be withdrawn... but
		as you've seen, we have not
		withdrawn them.

				CORNGOLD
		And my guess is that President
		Eisenhower won't pull out while we
		have over three billion invested
		over here.

				MICHAEL
		Fredo.  Where are you going?

				FREDO
		Nowhere, Mike.  I wanted to get a
		refill.  How about you?

EXT. HAVANA HOSPITAL - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

The ambulance makes its way up to the emergency section of
the hospital.  The orderlies quickly carry the old man
inside.  His wife and the doctor, and several of his men,
follow in another car.

THE VIEW ALTERS

and we see Bussetta waiting in the shadows.

EXT. HAVANA STREETS - NIGHT

The growing crowds of Cubans begin their celebration.

NEW VIEW

A Cuban military detachment speeds along in the night,
motorcyclists clear a path through the celebrants.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - FULL VIEW - NIGHT

A full sitdown dinner is being served the guests.  Michael
sits at a table at dinner with several of the distinguished
Cubans, and some of the American businessmen.

				QUESTADT
		What's kept Mr. Roth?

Fredo looks up at Michael.

In the back of the room, we notice the detachment of military
moving quickly through the reception room on their way to
the President's private quarters.  Michael notices it as well.

INT. THE HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - FULL VIEW - NIGHT

The activity at the end of the hall has come to rest; we can
tell that the doctor tells Mrs. Roth that she should go, the
old man will be taken to a room where he can rest.
Gradually, these people leave him in the care of the hospital
staff.

Bussetta watches from the distance of the hallway; after the
old man has been moved, he quietly walks down the hallway to
the room.

HIS VIEW

A nurse sits in the room in attendance; Hyman Roth is
asleep, his mouth wide open, breathing noisily.

VIEW ON BUSSETTA

hears footsteps, quickly steps away from the door, and into
another room.

Some nurses and attendants speak to the nurse in the room in
Spanish; one has brought a small bottle of wine, and
obviously they are inviting the nurse to have a New Year's
toast with them.  They laugh; and the nurse steps away from
the room for a moment.

Bussetta moves slowly back into the room, alone with the
helpless Roth.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - FULL VIEW ON THE GUESTS - NIGHT

seeing in the New Year; a great banner is hoisted up in
Spanish, welcoming 1959.

Hands are shaken; kisses exchanged.

MED. CLOSE VIEW

Michael and Fredo in an embrace; they kiss one another.

				MICHAEL
		I've arranged for a plane; we're
		going to Miami in an hour.  Try not
		to make a big thing of it.

He kisses his brother once again.

				MICHAEL
			(Sicilian)
		I know it was you, Fredo.  You've
		broken my heart.

Slowly, understanding, Fredo backs away from his brother,
taking the kiss another way.

A little distance away, Major Leon notices an old woman, one
of the President's maids, moving across the alcove, carrying
her suitcases.

				LEON
		What a pity; she's crying.  Must
		have been fired, and she's been
		with the President's family for
		twenty years.

EXT. HAVANA STREETS - NIGHT

The gathered crowd joyously welcomes the New Year.  We
notice the continual military movement.

MED. VIEW

A family surreptitiously leaves their home, carrying
suitcases and belongings.

INT. ROTH'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

Bussetta raises a hospital pillow, and easily begins to
smother the thin old man, who can barely struggle.

OUT IN THE HALL

A detachment of military move quickly, accompanied by some
of Roth's men, as though they have important news that must
be dealt with.

They pass the small group of aides and nurses welcoming the
New Year.

Seeing them, the nurse assigned to him, puts down her glass
and moves quickly to the room.

She opens the door, and lays bare the sight of Bussetta
smothering Roth.  Bussetta turns quickly; and one of the
military takes out his pistol and shoots several times at
his head.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT

The entire reception has been disrupted for an announcement;
all the guests in their formal dress and evening gowns,
standing with frightened faces like first class passengers
on a doomed ship.  The President himself, his back to our
VIEW, is making an announcement in Spanish.  While he
speaks, we notice continuous movement of his personal staff,
carrying suitcases and possessions.

				PRESIDENT
		...Because of serious setbacks of
		our troops in Guantanamo and
		Santiago, we feel reluctantly, that
		we must leave the Capital at once.
		Myself and my family must bid you
		goodbye, and good fortune.  We will
		go directly to Ciudad Trujillo.

The crowd is stunned; already whispers are moving throughout
the guests.

The only one who is not completely taken off guard is
Michael, who quietly steps back, and disappears from the room.

				PRESIDENT
		...My only regret is that there
		could not have been more warning...
		As my last official act as
		President, I hereby appoint a
		provisional government with Dr.
		Carlos M. Piedra, as its President.

By now, there is only one thought among the guests: how can
they get out, and with what.

EXT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT

We see evidence of the confusion at this late hour; already
cars are beginning to move; people leaving the Palace in
haste.  Michael moves quickly toward his car.  He sees
Fredo, watching him in fear.

				MICHAEL
		Come with me.  It's your only way
		of getting out!

VIEW ON FREDO

Terrified of his brother, and what he knows; Fredo backs
away into the growing noise and confusion of the crowd.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

Finally, he has to step into the car and it roars off.

EXT. HAVANA STREETS - NIGHT

Rebel cars with loudspeakers have already picked up the news
that Batista has conceded...this throws the crowds already
gathered for the New Year into cheers of joy.

They harass a wealthy family who are trying to get away in
their car.

The people pull them out of the car, opening their suitcases,
out of which spill piles of cash and jewelry into street.

Michael's car makes its way as the crowd cheers: "El animale
se fue!"

EXT. THE UNITED STATES EMBASSY - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

Crowds of panicked and frightened tourists, and Batistianos
are trying to get to the safety of the Embassy with the
families and possessions.

We see Geary, and some of the Americans we had met, working
their way through the crowds, shouting that they are
Americans in order to get preference on the line.  Often
that declaration brings 'boos' from the crowds.

Sometimes the joyous Cubans will let a family through, but
again, taking away the suitcases, rich leather, filled with
money and valuables.  Money seems to be stuffed everywhere.

EXT. THE YACHT CLUB - NIGHT

All forms of private transportation are jammed with people
trying to get out, holding cash in their hands for anyone
with a yacht or small boat to get them to Florida.

A car pulls up; and we see Sam Roth, Terri Roth and some of
their men, carry the sickly, but still alive Hyman Roth to a
private cruiser which is protected by men with machine guns.

Within seconds, they are on their way to Miami.

EXT. THE PRIVATE AIRPORT - NIGHT

Things are no different at the airport; where anything that
can fly is being jammed with refugees and their money.

A wealthy family is arguing with the pilot of a fast
airplane; trying to force cash on him, and his family into
the plane.  The PILOT steadfastly refuses, although checking
his watch, as though his passengers are late.  He speaks
only English.

				PILOT
		No, this is a private plane.  No,
		this plane is taken.

Finally Michael's Mercury pulls up, and Michael approaches
the Pilot.

				MICHAEL
		He isn't here.

				PILOT
		We've got to leave, they'll take
		this thing apart.

				MICHAEL
		All right.  Go now.

The Pilot lets Michael in, as the Cuban screams curses at
them, and begins searching for another plane for his family.

INT. THE PLANE - VIEW ON THE PILOT - NIGHT

as the propeller turns over.

EXT. THE AIRPORT - FULL VIEW - NIGHT

Groups of the cheering, celebrating Cubans sing
"Guantanamera," now as a song of triumph.

INT. THE PLANE - MOVING VIEW - MICHAEL - NIGHT

Closer to him, his personal and business life caught in the
middle of history.

EXT. NEW YORK STREET - MED. VIEW - DAY (1920)

He stops to pick out some choice oranges and peaches from a
fruit stand.  Then he reaches into his pocket for change.

				VENDOR
		No, no.  It is my pleasure to make
		this a gift.

CLOSE VIEW ON VITO

				VITO
		You are kind.  If ever I can do
		something for you, in return,
		please come to me.

INT. VITO'S TENEMENT - DAY

Despite his new position of 'respect,' there is little
changed about his home.  Only that they have lived there a
while now, and the rooms are fuller with the inevitable
possessions a young family acquires.

He kisses his wife, who seems a big apprehensive.  He shows
her the fruit; and from her reaction knows she has something
on her mind.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		What is it?

				CARMELLA
			(Sicilian)
		Come...

They step into the tiny parlor, where we see an older woman,
waiting nervously.

				CARMELLA
		The Signora is a friend of mine.
		She has a favor to ask of you.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		Why do you come to me?

				SIGNORA COLOMBO
			(Sicilian)
		She told me to ask you.

He seems surprised; looks to his wife.

				CARMELLA
		She is having some trouble.  Her
		landlord has received complaints
		because of her dog.  He told her to
		get rid of it, but her boy loved
		it, so they tried to hide it.  When
		the landlord found out, he was so
		angry, he ordered her to leave.
		Even if she truly will let the dog
		go.

				SIGNORA COLOMBO
			(Sicilian)
		He said he would have the police
		put us out.

				VITO
			(thoughtfully)
		I can give you some money to help
		you move, is that what you want?

				SIGNORA COLOMBO
		My friends are all here; how can I
		move to another neighborhood with
		strangers?  I want you to speak to
		the landlord to let me stay.

Vito nods to the frightened old woman.

				VITO
		It's done then.  You won't have to
		move; I'll speak to him tomorrow
		morning.

Carmella breaks into a smile; which her husband des not
acknowledge.

The old woman starts to leave the room; but she is not
convinced.

				SIGNORA COLOMBO
		You're sure he'll say yes, the
		landlord?

				VITO
		I'm sure he's a good-hearted fellow.
		Once I explain how things are with
		you, I'm sure he'll take pity on
		your misfortunes.  Don't let it
		trouble you any more.
			(as he shows her out)
		Guard your health, for the sake of
		your children.

EXT. TENEMENT BLOCK - DAY

SIGNOR ROBERTO, a pompous, rather well-dressed Patrone
angrily walks down the steps of one of his tenement buildings.

He carries a check list, and makes marks with a pencil
concerning the condition of his various buildings; a broken
window here, some missing tile there.  He bends over to pick
up some garbage left by a thoughtless tenant, muttering to
himself, when he sees the shoes and legs of a young worker.

				VITO (O.S.)
		Signore Roberto...

He rises to be face to face with a polite Vito Corleone.

				VITO
		The friend of my wife, a poor widow
		with no man to protect her, tells
		me that for some reason she has
		been ordered to move from your
		building.  She is in despair.  She
		has no money, she has no friends
		except those that live here.

Signor Roberto brusquely answers, and continues on his way.

				ROBERTO
		I have already rented the apartment
		to another family.

MOVING SHOT ON THE TWO

				VITO
		I told her I would speak to you,
		that you are a reasonable man who
		acted out of some misunderstanding.
		She has gotten rid of the animal
		that caused all the trouble, so why
		shouldn't she stay.  As one Italian
		to another, I ask you the favor.

				ROBERTO
		I've already rented it; I cannot
		disappoint the new tenants.  They're
		paying a higher rent.

				VITO
		How much more a month?

				ROBERTO
		Eh...
			(we sense he is lying)
		Five dollars more.

Vito reaches into his pocket, and takes out a roll of bills.

				VITO
		Here is the six month's increase in
		advance.  You needn't speak to her
		about it, she's a proud woman.  See
		me again in another six months.
		But of course, you'll let her keep
		her dog.

				ROBERTO
		Like hell!  And who the hell are
		you to give me orders.  Watch your
		manners or you'll be on your
		Sicilian ass in the street there.

Vito raises his hands in surprise; his voice is reasonable.

				VITO
		I'm asking you a favor, only that.
		One never knows when one might need
		a friend, isn't that true?  Here,
		take this money as a sign of my
		good-will, and make your own
		decision.  I won't quarrel with it.
			(he puts the money in
			Roberto's hand)
		Do me this little favor, just take
		it and think carefully.  Tomorrow
		morning if you want to give me the
		money back, by all means do so.  If
		you want the woman out of your
		house, how can I stop you?  It's
		your property, after all.  If you
		don't want the dog in there, I can
		understand.  I dislike dogs myself.
			(he pats Roberto on
			the shoulder)
		Do me this service, eh?  I won't
		forget it.  Ask your friends in
		this neighborhood about me, they'll
		tell you I'm a man who believes in
		showing his gratitude.

Without a word more, Vito leaves a hypnotized Roberto
standing in front of the tenement, his hand clasping the
money.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - DAY

A thin young man, almost gawky, walks down the street in
this Italian neighborhood, his name is HYMAN SUCHOWSKY.

He carries his tools as he comes home from work.  He is
pursued and tormented by a couple of Italian youths, about
his own age, eighteen.

				ITALIAN BOY
		Kid, where do you live?

				ANOTHER
		Where'd you get those nigger lips?

He tries not to be intimidated; finally one of the boys,
steps in front of him and stops him.

				ITALIAN BOY
		Say 'bread' in Italian.

				ANOTHER
		He dunno.

				ITALIAN BOY
		Go on; how do you say 'bread' in
		Italian?  If you're from the
		neighborhood, you should know how
		to say 'bread' in Italian.

An amused Peter Clemenza steps forward from a local coffee
house, to preside over the fuss.  He's a 'big' man in the
neighborhood, and loves a fight.

				CLEMENZA
		What's up?

				ITALIAN BOY
		This kid lives around here, but he
		can't say bread in Italian.

				CLEMENZA
		That's 'cause he's Jew.  Look at
		those pregnant lips!

He giggles at his own joke.

				ITALIAN BOY
		Are you a Jewboy?

The boy doesn't answer, tries to keep going.

				ITALIAN BOY
		Well, if you're not a Jew, say
		'bread' in Italian.  See, he can't.

And with that, he rounds a blow squarely to the boy's face,
sending him sprawling to the cement, his tools flying with a
clatter.

The other Italian immediately joins in with a few kicks to
the boy's stomach.  Hyman tries to fight back; grabs a hold
of his tormentor's foot, and brings him down on the cement
as well.  For a moment, they are rolling around on the
sidewalk, two against one, Hyman taking the worst of it.

				CLEMENZA
		Alright, alright, cut it out.

				SECOND ITALIAN
		What for?  He killed Jesus Christ!

Clemenza pulls him off, and kicks him in the ass.

				CLEMENZA
		I said cut it out!
			(to the beaten kid)
		What's your name?

				HYMAN
		Hyman Suchowsky.

				ITALIAN BOY
		I don't believe it.  In our
		neighborhood, with a name like that!

				CLEMENZA
		What are those tools?  You work on
		cars?

				HYMAN
		Yeah.

				CLEMENZA
		Maybe I know how you can make a
		couple of extra bucks working as a
		mechanic.

The boy seems agreeable.

				CLEMENZA
		But you gotta know how to keep your
		mouth shut, and fer Chrissakes, get
		rid of that name.  I'll call you
		Johnny Lips.
			(he giggles at his
			own humor again)
		Come on...

He leads the boy down the street, whispering to him, on the
side:

				CLEMENZA
		Bread in Italian is pane.  P-A-N-E,
		pane.  Don't forget.

INT. NEW GENCO WAREHOUSE - DAY

A newly acquired warehouse, stocked with cases of the new
product "GENCO PURA" olive oil.  It is the beginning of a
new business, in the American tradition.  Now they have one
rattling old truck, and a few stock boys.

Genco has become the accountant-business manager, based on
the experience working with his father.  But it is clear,
that Vito is the leader, and undisputed 'President' of the
new enterprise.

Genco moves through the darkness of the warehouse, to the
small divided area that Vito uses as his office.

				GENCO
			(Sicilian)
		The 'patrone' is here.

				VITO
		Chi?

				GENCO
		Roberto.  Who owns the 'rat-holes.'

Vito nods that he will see him; and soon Roberto enters, on
tiptoe, his hat in his hand, and in a apologetic voice.

				ROBERTO
		Excuse me, I hope I am not a
		disturbance, Don Corleone.

				VITO
		Yes.

				ROBERTO
		What a terrible misunderstanding.
		Of course, Signora Colombo can stay
		in the flat.  Who were those
		miserable tenants to complain about
		noise from a poor animal...when
		they pay such low rent.

Then abruptly, he puts the roll of money on Vito's table,
and steps back a respectful distance.

				ROBERTO
		Your good heart in helping the poor
		widow has shamed me, and I want to
		show that I, too, have some
		Christian charity.  Her rent will
		remain what it was.

				VITO
		What was that?

				ROBERTO
		In fact, reduced, bu five dollars!

Vito embraces him warmly.

				VITO
		I accept your generosity...

				ROBERTO
		I won't keep you another minute...

He quickly takes his leave, bowing several times, and then
makes it back to the safety of the warehouse; he sighs,
deflates his lungs, and mops his brow; his bones have turned
too jelly with fear at his narrow escape.  He all but runs
out of the warehouse.

Genco laughs as he watches.

				GENCO
		We won't see him for weeks!  He'll
		stay in bed in the Bronx!

Clemenza has been waiting with his new mechanic.  We notice
the subtle difference in the way he treats Vito.  He is no
longer a junior apprentice in their petty crimes; but an
imposing leader.

				CLEMENZA
		This kid is good with cars; he
		kiijed at the truck, and says he
		can keep it going.

Vito looks over the lanky young man.

				CLEMENZA
		What's your name?

				HYMAN
		Suchowsky.  Hyman Suchowsky.

				CLEMENZA
		He's gonna dump that; I call him
		Johnny Lips.

				VITO
		Who is the greatest man you can
		think of?

				CLEMENZA
		Go on, answer him when he talks to
		you.  Tell him: Columbus, Marconi...
		Garibaldi.

				HYMAN
		Arnold Rothstein.

				VITO
		Then take that as your name: Hyman
		Rothstein.

Genco is out in the alley; he calls out with glee.

				GENCO
		Vitone!  Look at this!

Vito moves out to the smiling Genco; Clemenza and the newly
christened Hyman Rothstein follow a distance behind.

EXT. THE ALLEY - DAY

Genco stands beaming, as two workers raise up high, the
freshly painted sign: "GENCO OLIVE OIL COMPANY."

				GENCO
			(enthusiastically)
		God bless America!  We're in
		business!

The young men watch as the sign is hoisted into place.  OUR
VIEW goes from one to the other: Clemenza, Genco, Vito and
Hyman Rothstein.

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT. SENATE CAUCUS ROOM - MED. CLOSE VIEW - DAY

Willy Cicci, Pentangeli's associate and bodyguard takes a
drink of water.

				SENATOR (O.S.)
		Mr. Cicci.  From the year 1927 to
		the present time, you were an
		employee of the "Genco Olive Oil
		Company."

				CICCI
		That's right.

				SENATOR (O.S.)
		But in actuality, you were a member
		of the Corleone Crime organization.

				CICCI
		The Corleone Family, Senator.  We
		called it, "The Family."

				SENATOR (O.S.)
		What position did you occupy?

				CICCI
		At first, like everybody, I was a
		soldier.

VIEW ON SENATOR KANE

A thin, angular Baptist with a Mid-Western accent.

				SENATOR KANE
		What is that exactly?

				CICCI
		A button.  You know, Senator.

				SENATOR KANE
		No, I don't know, explain that
		exactly.

				CICCI
		When the boss says push the button
		on a guy, I push the button, see,
		Senator?

The Senators treat Cicci with a surface courtesy, as if he
were a curious kind of animal, not really human.  Cicci
reacts to this by being even more brutally forthright than
he has to be, to show his contempt for what he considers a
hypocrisy.

The VIEW ALTERS from Senator Kane to the Committee's
attorney, Mr. Questadt.

				QUESTADT
		You mean you killed people at the
		behest of your superiors?

				CICCI
		That's right, counsellor.

				QUESTADT
		And the head of your family was
		Michael Corleone.

				CICCI
		Yeah, counsellor, Michael Corleone.

				SENATOR KANE
		Did you ever get such an order
		directly from Michael Corleone?

				CICCI
		No, Senator, I never talked to him.

				SENATOR SAVOY
			(very autocratic,
			deep South,
			gentlemanly man)
		There was always a buffer, someone
		in between you who gave you orders.

				CICCI
		Yeah, a buffer, the Family had a
		lot of buffers.

EXT. THE TROPICANA IN VEGAS - MED. VIEW - DAY

A limousine pulls up at a private area near the side of the
hotel.  Michael exits the limousine followed by Hagen and
Neri.

				MICHAEL
		Do you think they have somebody to
		back up Cicci?

				HAGEN
		No.  But if they do have somebody,
		you'll do three years for perjury
		if you give them so much as a wrong
		middle name.

Michael smiles to him, but it's a cold, deadly smile.

				HAGEN
		Michael, take the Fifth all the
		way, that way you can't get into
		trouble.

EXT. PRIVATE BALCONY OF CORLEONE APARTMENT AT TROPICANA - DAY

A Corleone bodyguard waits outside on the balcony overlooking
the pool area.  Through the translucent draperies, we see a
grouping of me.

INT. CORLEONE APARTMENT AT THE TROPICANA - DAY

Michael, Hagen, Neri and Rocco are seated in this luxury in
the hotel.  Michael sits in a comfortable chair in his
apartment.  Neri comes and brings him a drink without
asking, but Michael refuses it.

				MICHAEL
		Al, get me a wet towel.  Does Kay
		know I'm back?

Hagen nods.

				MICHAEL
		Did the boy get something from me
		for Christmas?

				HAGEN
		I took care of it.

				MICHAEL
		What was it, so I'll know.

				HAGEN
		A little care he can ride in with
		an electric motor.

Neri comes around with a wet face towel, which Michael uses
to cool his eyes.  He puts the used towel down on the table.

				MICHAEL
		Fellas, can you wait outside a
		minute?

They know what he means and leave the apartment, going out
to the balcony where we can see them but they cannot hear.
Only Hagen remains.

				MICHAEL
		Where's my brother?

				HAGEN
		Roth got out on a private boat.
		He's in a hospital in Miami.  Had a
		stroke but he's recovered okay.
		Bussetta's dead.

				MICHAEL
		I asked about Fredo?

				HAGEN
		The new government arrested him,
		held him for a couple of days with
		a lot of the other casino people,
		including Roth's brother, Sam.  The
		American Embassy arranged flights
		for citizens; I'm not sure, but I
		think he's somewhere in New York.

				MICHAEL
		I want you to reach Fredo.  I know
		he's scared, but have one of our
		people reach him.  Assure him that
		there will be no reprisals.  Tell
		him that I know Roth misled him.

				HAGEN
		My information is that Fredo
		thought it was a kidnapping.  Roth
		assured him nothing would happen to
		you.

				MICHAEL
			(indicating Rocco and
			Neri on the balcony)
		They can come in now.

				HAGEN
		Wait... there's something else.

				MICHAEL
		Alright.

Hagen pauses; doesn't know how to begin.

				MICHAEL
			(impatiently)
		Go on, tell me.

				HAGEN
		Kay had a miscarriage; she lost the
		baby.

After a moment:

				MICHAEL
		Was it a boy or a girl?

				HAGEN
		Mike, at three and a half...

				MICHAEL
		What is it, can't you give me
		straight answers anymore!

				HAGEN
		It was a boy.

				MICHAEL
		And Kay...she's all right?

				HAGEN
		She took the Senate Investigation
		worse.

				MICHAEL
		Does she blame it on me?  The baby?

				HAGEN
		I don't know.

EXT. TAHOE ESTATE - DAY

The first snow of the New Year has fallen; the trees are
bare, and there is hush all over this part of the Sierras.
Michael is driven in his car, looking out at the familiar
sight of the home he has been forced to be away from.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

looking out from his window.  The last time he had seen the
estate it was warm, and the trees were full.

MOVING VIEW

approaching the great stone gates; closed.  The bodyguards
are not readily visible, but they are there.  The iron gates
are opened, and one of the men makes a simple nod of respect,
as the car pulls in.

NEW VIEW

Inside the estate, the private roads have been freshly
plowed, and occasionally a worker will pause to watch the
car as it passes.

The Grandchildren are in school now, and so the estate is
especially quiet.  Although there are signs that children
live here; a bicycle, a sled, a swing and gymnastic set, wet
and with a rim of snow still on it.

INT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - VIEW FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE - DAY

to the outside, where Michael walks slowly.  He stops and
looks at a little Italian red sportscar made for children.

NEW VIEW

The front door opens, and Michael enters his own home.  It
is very quiet, no one is at home to greet him.  He can see
the evidence of his family; things his wife and his children
have been using, and left on a sofa or a table.

He moves toward his and Kay's bedroom, where we can HEAR the
SOUND of a sewing machine running.

Quietly he opens the door.

MICHAEL'S VIEW

into the bedroom.  Kay is sitting by the window, lit by the
cold afternoon light, at work with her sewing machine.  She
hasn't noticed that he's in the room yet, and goes on with
her work.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

stands there a moment, watching, not making a sound.  And
then without a word, he steps back, and closes the door, so
that she doesn't see him.

VIEW FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE

onto Michael, moving outside, walking through the snow, he
moves to the house next to his own.

INT. CONNIE'S HOUSE - DAY

This is the house where Mama lives with Connie's children,
Connie so rarely is there.

He steps in; his mother is asleep in a chair in the living
room.  He moves to her, and bends low, whispers.

				MICHAEL
		Mom... Mom...

She opens her eyes, which are red and small with age.

				MICHAEL
			(Sicilian)
		It's Michael.  How are you, Mom?

				MAMA
			(Sicilian)
		I'm alright.  Will you stay home
		for awhile?

				MICHAEL
			(Sicilian)
		There are still things I have to do.

				MAMA
			(Sicilian)
		Well, we can all have a nice dinner
		together tonight.  How are your eyes?

				MICHAEL
		Alright.  They bother me once in
		awhile.
			(a pause as he thinks)
		Tell me, when Pop had troubles...
		did he ever think, even to himself,
		that he had gone the wrong way;
		that maybe by trying to be strong
		and trying to protect his family,
		that he could... that he could...
		lose it instead?

				MAMA
			(Sicilian)
		You talk about the baby.  She can
		have another baby.

				MICHAEL
			(Sicilian)
		No, I meant lose his family.

				MAMA
			(as best she ever
			understood it)
		Your family?  How can you ever lose
		your family?

				MICHAEL
			(almost to himself)
		But times are different...

FULL VIEW IN ROOM - MICHAEL AND HIS MOTHER

Quietly we HEAR the music of a small band playing an Italian
march.  From the orchestration, we know it is from the past.

							DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. TRAIN STATION AT CORLEONE - DAY

Vitone and his young family: Mama, Santino, Fredo and the
baby Michael are met at the small station in Sicily by
friends, and Mama's relatives.  There is a small band,
playing for the occasion.  A small man has brought a motor
car to pick the family up; and there are certain dark men,
with shotguns slung over their shoulders to preside over the
occasion.

The family is helped into the car; the luggage is packed on
the roof, and the car drives off.  The second car, with
bodyguards following.

EXT. DON TOMASINO'S VILLA OUTSIDE OF CORLEONE - DAY

The villa is bloomed with flowers and DON TOMASINO at this
point is a man in his late twenties.  He embraces Vitone and
pats the heads of his children, and leads them all into the
garden.

INT. THE VILLA - SUMPTUOUS MED. VIEW - LATE DAY

A sumptuous table is set for the visiting family from
America.  There is a warm atmosphere as Vito, his wife and
children eat.  Tomasino and his family received presents
from Carmella and to Tomasino's mother, and gifts are given
to all of the children.

All typically American representing some of the prosperity
and interests in the consumer goods that followed a great war.

EXT. CORLEONE PLAZA - DAY

The family exits the church on the plaza of the town.  Vito
shakes hands warmly with the priest.

INT. VILLAGE COTTAGE - NIGHT

The door is open -- the footsteps of a man enter the room.
We follow these footsteps without quite knowing to whom they
belong.  They lead us to a bed, where we see asleep an OLD
MAN.  He sleeps in his undershirt and is sweating, covered
by mosquito netting.

VIEW ALTERS

and we realize that it is young Vito looking at the MAN.

We remember that the man is MOSCA, one of three men, who
almost twenty years before had hunted down Vito when he was
a boy.  With lightning speed, Vito slashes through the
mosquito netting with a knife.  And with the movement
precise as a butcher's he disembowls this man.

EXT. OLIVE OIL WAREHOUSE - FULL VIEW

Vito has brought his wife and children to see the Olive Oil
Depot which is the link to his New York importing business.
They go inside.

INT. OLIVE OIL WAREHOUSE - DAY

They are led by one of Vito's associates through rows and
rows of large vats of olive oil.  Vito very proudly shows
his associates in Italy the olive oil can that will be used
in the United States.  They all stand around at the link to
their new importing business and share a toast of wine.

EXT. THE BAY - DAY

A team of Sicilian fisherman are at work mending their nets.
One sings accompanied by a guitar.

VIEW MOVES TO ONE OF THE OLD FISHERMAN

He is recognized as the second of the men who had hunted
Vito down.  STROLLO.  As he walks we notice there is a
figure that is moving through the drying sails and barrels,
it is Vito.  He moves quietly, stepping up behind the old
man.  In an instant, he has thrown a garrote around his
throat, twisting it tight, so that there is very little
sound.

Then, almost silently dragging him through the space hidden
by the drying sails.

EXT. THE IMPRESSIVE ESTATE OF DON FRANCESCO - DAY

We see an old car approach.  Its driver is the young Tomasino.
Sitting in the car with him is Vito.

The car stops at the gates, and an old guard sees and
recognizes Tomasino, opens the gates allowing them to enter.

MED. VIEW

on an almost decrepit DON FRANCESCO.  He must be in his
early nineties, sitting as powerful and as impressive as
ever, in his throne-like chair from which he manages the
power as the Mafia Chieftan of this village.  Young Don
Tomasino is speaking.

We notice in a little distance in the rear, there are some
younger shepherds with shotguns thrown over their shoulders.

				TOMASINO
			(Sicilian)
		Don Francesco, if you will honor
		me, by allowing me to introduce my
		associate in America, in New York.
		His name is Vito Corleone.

The old man and his eyes glance up at a notion of a man who
has taken the name of this town as his name.

				TOMASINO
		We will supply him with olive oil
		exclusively in the town of Corleone.
		His company is called the "Genco
		Olive Oil Company." Here we have
		brought you an indication of how he
		will sell the product.

Tomasino respectfully puts a can of olive oil where the old
man can look at it.  The old man nods, accepting the notion
of this business.

				TOMASINO
			(Sicilian)
		We have come to ask your blessing
		and permission to continue this
		enterprise.

				DON FRANCESCO
			(Sicilian)
			 (in a shrill, high,
			raspy voice)
		Where is this young man?

				TOMASINO
		He is right here, standing next to
		me, Don Francesco.

				DON FRANCESCO
			(Sicilian)
		Have him come closer, I can't see
		very well.

Vito takes those several steps, so that he is standing right
in front of the old man.

VIEW ON DON FRANCESCO

looking up, squinting against the sun.

DON FRANCESCO'S VIEW

Strangely backlit, almost blurry image of the young man from
America.

				DON FRANCESCO
			(Sicilian)
		What is your name?

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		Vito Corleone.

				DON FRANCESCO
			(Sicilian)
		You took the name of this town, eh?
		What was your father's name?

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		Antonio Andolini.

CLOSE VIEW ON THE OLD MAN

The recognition of the name throws a shudder through him.
It is as though he recognizes that this is the boy; the son
of his old enemy, whom he had killed, and whose sons he had
tried to wipe out.  The old man raises his feeble hands
signalling his guard, and in his weak voice, he shouts:

				DON FRANCESCO
			(Sicilian)
		Kill him!  Kill him!

But he is too late; Vito steps forward.

				VITO
			(Sicilian)
		In the name of my Father, and my
		Brother...

And uses the knife, ritualistically plunging it into the old
man's belly, and then up to his throat, which is severed.

VIEW ON TOMASINO

has drawn his pistol and quickly shoots one of the guards,
helping Vito to escape back into the motor car.

VIEW ON A GUARD

raising his shotgun.

VIEW ON THE MOTOR CAR

Just as Tomasino is about to get into the car, the shotgun
is fired, and he is hit in the legs.

Vito manages to pull him up into the car, and they make
their escape.

EXT. RAILROAD STATION IN CORLEONE - DAY

Some of the townspeople have come bringing flowers and gifts
for Vito and his family.

His wife is radiant with the flowers given her.

The train has arrived and the crowd shout "Ciao, come back
soon."

THE VIEW ALTERS

revealing his good friend Tomasino, waving from his
wheelchair.

VIEW ON VITO

wave his hand.

INT. SENATE CAUCUS ROOM - MED. CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL - DAY

				SENATOR KANE (O.S.)
		Are you the son of Vito Corleone?

				MICHAEL
		Yes.

				SENATOR KING
		Did he use at times an alias?  Was
		this alias in certain circles
		GODFATHER?

				MICHAEL
		It was not an alias.  GODFATHER was
		a term of affection, used by his
		friends, one of respect.

				SENATOR WEEKLER
			(Senator from New
			York, very smooth,
			partly liberal,
			Tammany Hall)
		Let me agree with that.  Many of my
		constituents are Italian and have
		been honored with that certain
		friendship by my close Italian
		friends.  Up to this point before I
		have to leave this hearing to join
		my own committee, let me say, that
		this hearing on the Mafia is in no
		way a slur on the Italians by the
		Senate; nor is it meant to be; nor
		will I allow it to be.  Italian
		Americans are the hardest working,
		most law abiding patriotic Americans
		of our country.  It is a shame and
		a pity that a few rotten apples
		give them a bad name.  We are here
		to weed those rotten apples out of
		the vast healthy barrel of Italian
		Americans, who are one of the
		backbones of our country.

There is a pause for a while, while the New York Senator
poses for the TV cameras and leaves the hearing so that he
will not be associated with hearing the rough stuff.

				SENATOR KANE
		I'm sure we all agree with our
		esteemed colleague.  Now, Mr.
		Corleone, you have been advised as
		to your legal rights.  We have had
		testimony from a preceding witness
		who states you are head of the most
		powerful Mafia family in this
		country.  Are you?

				MICHAEL
		No.

				SENATOR KANE
		This witness has testified that you
		are personally responsible for the
		murder of a New York Police Captain
		in the year 1947 and with him a man
		named Virgil Sollozzo.  Do you deny
		this?

				MICHAEL
		I deny his every charge.

				SENATOR KANE
		Is it true that in the year 1950
		you devised the murder of the heads
		of the Five Families in New York,
		to assume and consolidate your
		nefarious power?

				MICHAEL
		That is a complete falsehood.

				SENATOR KANE
		Is it true that you own a
		controlling interest in three of
		the major hotels in Las Vegas?

				MICHAEL
		That is not true.  I own some stock
		in some of the hotels, but only
		very small amounts.  I also own
		some American Telephone and IBM
		stock.

Michael had checked this point with Hagen, before answering,
and then once again after the answer.

				SENATOR ROGERS
		Why is it necessary for your
		counsel to advise you on that
		question?

				MICHAEL
		Senator, I've observed the head of
		General Motors before a Senate
		Committee, and his lawyer whispered
		in his ear.  That was not commented
		upon in the way you have just done.

				SENATOR KANE
		Mr. Corleone, do you have any hotel
		interests in the state of Arizona?
		Or any gambling interests in that
		state?

				MICHAEL
		I do not.

				SENATOR KANE
		Do you have interests or control
		over gambling and narcotics in the
		state of New York.

				MICHAEL
		I do not.

A pause.  Silence, as the Chairman whispers something to his
assistant.

Tom Hagen takes a paper out of his briefcase, and addresses
the Chair.

				HAGEN
		Senator, my client would like to
		read a statement for the record.

				SENATOR KANE
		I don't think that's necessary.

				HAGEN
		Sir, my client has answered every
		question asked by this committee
		with the utmost cooperation and
		sincerity.  He has not taken that
		Fifth Amendment as it was his right
		to do, and which because of the
		extreme legal complexity of this
		hearing, counsel advised him to do.
		So, I think in all fairness this
		committee should hear his statement
		and put it in the record.

				SENATOR KANE
		Very well.

At this point Senator Rogers contemptuously walks out of the
hearing room.

				MICHAEL
			(reading)
		In the hopes of clearing my family
		name, in the sincere desire to give
		my children their fair share of the
		American way of life without a
		blemish on their name and background
		I have appeared before this
		committee and given it all the
		cooperation in my power.  I consider
		my being called before this
		committee an act of prejudice to
		all Americans of Italian extraction.
		I consider it a great dishonor to
		me personally to have to deny that
		I am a criminal.  I wish to have
		the following noted for the record.
		That I served my country faithfully
		and honorably in World War II and
		was awarded the Distinguished
		Service Cross for actions in
		defense of my country.  That I have
		never been arrested or indicted for
		any crime whatsoever... that no
		proof linking me to any criminal
		conspiracy, whether it is called
		Mafia or Cosa Nostra or whatever
		other name you wish to give, has
		ever been made public.  Only one
		man has made charges against me,
		and that man is known to be a
		murderer, arsonist and rapist.  And
		yet this committee had used this
		person to besmirch my name.  My
		personal protest can only be made
		to the people of this country.  I
		can only thank God that in this
		country we have a legal system and
		courts of law to protect innocent
		people from wild accusation.  I
		thank God for our democratic due
		process of Law that shields me from
		the false charges made by this
		committee's witness.  I have not
		taken refuge behind the Fifth
		Amendment, though counsel advised
		me to do so.  I challenge this
		committee to produce any witness or
		evidence against me, and if they do
		not, I hope they will have the
		decency to clear my name with the
		same publicity with which they have
		now besmirched it.  I ask this
		without malice, in the interests of
		fair play.

The television cameras have documented this moment, as Hagen
hands the document over to the committee lawyer.

				SENATOR ROGERS
		We are all impressed.  The committee
		will now recess over the weekend.
		However, it will continue Monday
		morning, at eleven a.m.  At that
		time, this committee will then
		produce a witness directly linking
		Mr. Corleone to the charges we have
		made.  And then, Mr. Corleone may
		very well by liable for indictments
		of perjury.  However, this document
		will be made a matter of record.

EXT. ARMY POST - DAY

An army post somewhere in the East.  It is safely guarded.

INT. HOUSE ON THE POST - DAY

where Pentangeli is being held by his constant companions,
the two FBI MEN.

				PENTANGELI
		Ten to one shot, you said.  Ten to
		one shot in my favor, and I lose.

				FBI MAN #1
		Get a good night's sleep.  We got a
		new suit, new shirt, new tie, and
		I'm going to shave you myself.
		Tomorrow we want you to look
		respectable for fifty million of
		your fellow Americans.

				PENTANGELI
		My life won't be worth a nickel
		after tomorrow.

				FBI MAN #1
		We have a special home for you for
		the rest of your life.  Nobody gets
		near you.  You're not going any
		place.

				PENTANGELI
		Yeah, some deal I made.

				FBI MAN #2
		You live like a king.  You'll be a
		hero.  You'll live better in here
		than most people on the outside.

				PENTANGELI
		Some deal.
			(pause)
		I just wish Mike had took the Fifth.

				FBI MAN #1
		Why'd you do it, Frankie?  After
		all these years, why'd you turn
		against him?

				PENTANGELI
		I didn't turn against nobody; he
		turned against me.

EXT. THE BOATHOUSE ALCOVE - DAY

A somewhat frightened Fredo Corleone sits in the easy chair
overlooking the lake in this canopied section of the
boathouse.  Rocco sits with him.

INT. BOATHOUSE - DAY

Michael is in the dark room with Hagen and Neri.

				MICHAEL
		How did they get their hands on
		Pentangeli?

				HAGEN
		Roth engineered it, Michael.  He
		made Pentangeli think you hit him.
		Deliberately letting him get off
		alive.  Then the New York detectives
		turned Frankie over to the FBI.  My
		informants say he was half dead and
		scared stiff -- talking out loud
		that you had turned on him and
		tried to kill him.  Anyway, they
		had him on possession, dealing in
		heroin, murder one and a lot more.
		There's no way we can get to him
		and you've opened yourself to five
		points of perjury.

				NERI
		They've got him airtight.  He's in
		a military base, twenty-four hour
		guards.  Trying to kill him is like
		trying to like the President --
		it's impossible.

				MICHAEL
		What does Fredo know?

				HAGEN
		He says he doesn't know anything,
		and I believe him.  Roth played
		this one beautifully.

				MICHAEL
		Alright.  I'm going to go outside
		and talk to Fredo.

EXT. BOATHOUSE FOYER - DAY

Fredo sits on the couch.  When Rocco sees Michael, he
automatically takes his leave.  Michael sits in the chair
opposite Fredo.

				FREDO
			(after a pause)
		I don't have a lot to say, Michael.

				MICHAEL
		We have time.

				FREDO
		I was kept pretty much in the dark.
		I didn't know all that much.

				MICHAEL
		What about now, is there anything
		you can help me out with?

				FREDO
		I know they get Pentangeli, that's
		all I know.

Fredo gets up, walks to the glass panel that separates the
terrace from the lake.

				FREDO
		I didn't know it was a hit.  I
		swear to you I didn't know.  Johnny
		Ola contacted me in Beverly Hills --
		said he wanted to talk.  He said
		you and Roth were in on some big
		deal, and there was a place for me
		in it if I could help them out.
		They said you were being tough on
		the negotiation, and if they had a
		little bit of help, they could
		close it fast and it would be good
		for you.

				MICHAEL
		And you believed that story.

				FREDO
		He said there was something good in
		it for me...me on my own.

				MICHAEL
		I've always taken care of you.

				FREDO
		Taken care of me.  Mike, you're my
		kid brother, and you take care of
		my.  Did you ever think of that.
		Ever once?  Send Fredo off to do
		this, send Fredo to take care of
		that... take care of some little
		unimportant night club here, and
		there; pick somebody up at the
		airport.  Mike, I'm your older
		brother; I was stepped over!

				MICHAEL
		It's the way Pop wanted it.

				FREDO
		It wasn't the way I wanted it!  I
		can handle things.  I'm not dumb
		Christ, not like everyone says.
		I'm smart; and I want respect.

				MICHAEL
		There's nothing more you can tell
		me about this investigation?

				FREDO
		The lawyer; Questadt, he belongs to
		Roth.

				MICHAEL
		You're nothing to me now, Fredo;
		not a brother, not a friend, I
		don't want to know you, or what
		happens to you.  I don't want to
		see you at the hotels, or near my
		home.  When you visit our Mother, I
		want to know a day in advance, so I
		won't be there.  Do you understand?

Michael turns, and starts to leave.  A frightened voice
behind him:

				FREDO
		Mikey?

Michael doesn't stop, doesn't turn back.  He continues off
through the veranda, and out the summer doors.

Neri stops by him.

				MICHAEL
		I don't want anything to happen to
		him while my Mother's alive.

Michael leaves.

EXT. ARMY POST - DAY

Five cars brimming with Army guards and Agents are waiting
to move Pentangeli.  There is one empty car.

INT. GUARDED HOUSE - DAY

The two FBI Agents are helping Pentangeli get dressed.  He's
in brightly colored striped shorts and bare-chested.  The
Agents help him with the shirt and tie.  One holds out the
trousers but Pentangeli ignores it and looks at himself in
the mirror.

				FBI MAN #1
		Ready, Frankie.

				PENTANGELI
		Let's go.

The Agents open the door, and precede him, surveying the
area.  They check the cars waiting, each with two Agents.
They check the gate and note the military sentries.  Then
they stand aside, and let Pentangeli come out.  They get
close to his side, and it is obvious they will protect his
life with their own.

EXT. ARMY POST - DAY

The Agents put him in the front seat of the empty car, and
get in with him, one at each side.  Another Agent drives.
Now, the first cars start out; the Sentries opening the
gates, and letting the caravan pass.

An Army supply truck comes very close to them, and the
Agents next to Pentangeli become very tense.  Pentangeli
grins.  Then the truck passes on, and they relax.

INT. SENATE CAUCUS ROOM - DAY

The room is crowded with TV journalists, cameras, etc.  We
pick Pentangeli up, closely guarded, being led to witness
chair.

Pentangeli is seated, and made to take his oath.  FBI Agents
are all around him.

MED. VIEW

Anyone given entrance to the caucus room is being frisked.
The five Senators take their places.

VIEW ON HAGEN

waiting at his long table, very nervous.  He seems startled
by the appearance of Pentangeli.

VIEW ON PENTANGELI

catching Hagen's eye.  It's as though he is pleading for
some kind of understanding of the fact that he has become a
traitor.

VIEW ON HAGEN

cold; then he turns away.

VIEW ON THE ENTRANCE

The bustle is settling down; then Michael Corleone enters,
and with him is someone very peculiar and out of keeping for
this setting.  A burly-chested imposing man of middle age.
Very powerful-looking with frightening magnetic eyes.  His
dress is odd: boots, rough tie, and shirt.  He could be the
tenor out of a Sicilian opera.  He is clearly a country Don,
direct from Sicily, and he dominates the room.

VIEW ON PENTANGELI

At first his view is blocked.  Then he sees Michael and is a
bit shamefaced, but still defiant.

PENTANGELI'S POV

Michael returns his glances without emotion.  Then the VIEW
ALTERS, revealing the Sicilian.

VIEW ON PENTANGELI

He is terror stricken; obviously he recognizes the man.

VIEW ON HAGEN'S TABLE

Michael and the Sicilian sit by Hagen, where they can stare
directly at Pentangeli; he is frozen with fear.

VIEW ON THE SENATOR

Notices the tension in the room.  The Chairman commences:

				SENATOR KANE
		We have here a witness who will
		testify further on Michael
		Corleone's rule of the criminal
		empire that controls gambling in
		this country and perhaps in other
		countries.  This witness had no
		buffer between himself and Michael
		Corleone.  He can corroborate our
		charges on enough counts for this
		committee to consider a charge of
		perjury against Michael Corleone.
			(then he turns to Pentangeli)
		Your name please, for the record.

				PENTANGELI
		Frank Pentangeli.

				SENATOR KANE
		Were you a member of the Corleone
		Family?  Were you under the
		Caporegime Peter Clemenza, under
		Vito Corleone, known as the
		Godfather?

There is a long silence.

VIEW ON PENTANGELI

He seems unable to speak.

VIEW ON THE SICILIAN

gazing at him.

VIEW ON PENTANGELI

				PENTANGELI
		I never knew no Godfather.  I got
		my own family.

Senator Kane is stunned.  The two FBI men are alert, their
eyes searching the room for what has intimidated their
witness at the last moment.

				SENATOR KANE
		Mr. Pentangeli, you are
		contradicting your confessions to
		our investigators; I ask you again,
		were you a member of a crime
		organization headed by Michael
		Corleone?

				PENTANGELI
		No.  I never heard of it.  I never
		heard of nothing like that.  I was
		in the olive oil business with his
		father a long time ago.  That's all.

				SENATOR KANE
		We have your confession that you
		murdered on the orders of Michael
		Corleone.  Do you deny that
		confession and do you know what
		denying that confession will mean
		to you?

The die is cast and like a good soldier, Pentangeli will go
all the way now.  So he is brazen in his defiance of the
Senator.

				PENTANGELI
		The FBI guys promised me a deal.
		So I made up a lot of stuff about
		Michael Corleone.  Because then,
		that's what they wanted.  But it
		was all lies.  Everything.  They
		said Michael Corleone did this,
		Michael Corleone did that.  So I
		said, "Yeah, sure."

He makes a big grin to show how he has made fools of
everybody.

VIEW ON THE FBI AGENTS

glancing around the room; their eyes have settled on the
Sicilian.  One of them scribbles a note on a piece of paper,
and passes it to the Committee lawyer.  Then in turn it goes
to Senator Kane.

				SENATOR KANE
		Mr. Hagen, would you kindly identify
		to this committee that gentleman
		sitting on your right hand?

				HAGEN
			(coolly)
		Yes, sir.  His name is Vincenzo
		Pentangeli.

				SENATOR KANE
		Is he related to the witness?

				HAGEN
		He is, I believe, a brother.

VIEW ON MICHAEL AND VINCENZO PENTANGELI

They wait with no expression.

				SENATOR KANE
			(to Vincenzo Pentangeli)
		Sir, I would like you to take the
		stand.

Vincenzo stares at him, uncomprehending.  There may just be
a shadow of contempt.  He doesn't answer.

				HAGEN
		Sir, the gentleman does not
		understand English.  He would not
		in any case, take the stand.  He
		came, at his own expense, to aid
		his brother in his trouble.  He is
		not under any jurisdiction of our
		government and his reputation in
		his own country is impeccable.

				SENATOR KANE
			(furious)
		The witness is excused; take him out.

The guards and FBI Agents quickly remove Pentangeli, as
everybody else in the room is required to sit still.

				HAGEN
		Senator Kane.

				SENATOR KANE
		This meeting is adjourned.

				HAGEN
			(rising and shouting)
		This committee owes an apology!

				SENATOR KANE
		The committee is adjourned until
		further notice.

For the first time, in the midst of the confusion, Hagen
smiles.  A bitter, contemptuous smile.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

The modest champion.  He rises and they take their leave.

VIEW ON THE TWO FBI AGENTS

They watch the Corleone party as they exit.

INT. WASHINGTON HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY

The Corleone nurse is waiting, playing with the little girl
MARY.  A distance away, the boy, Anthony, is standing by
himself.

INT. MICHAEL'S SUITE - WASHINGTON HOTEL - DAY

The door to Michael's suite opens; Rocco leans in.

				ROCCO
		It's Kay.

Michael is sitting in an easy chair; he seems to have
difficulty with his eyes.

				MICHAEL
		On the phone?

				ROCCO
		No, she's here.

Michael rises, surprised.  Rocco steps back, and Kay enters.

				MICHAEL
		I had no idea...

				KAY
		I wanted to see you before you went
		back to Nevada.  Also, the
		children - Michael, they're here.

				MICHAEL
		Where?

				KAY
		In a minute.  They're outside with
		Esther.  I'm very happy for you...
		I suppose I knew that you're simply
		too smart for anyone ever to beat
		you.

				MICHAEL
		Why don't you sit down?

				KAY
		I'm not going to stay long; I can't.

				MICHAEL
		There are a lot of things I want to
		talk to you about.  Things I've
		been thinking about -- changes I
		want to make.

				KAY
		I think it's too late for changes,
		Michael.  I promised myself I
		wouldn't talk about it and I've
		gone and spoiled it.

				MICHAEL
		Why too late?

				KAY
		Tell me, Michael.  What really
		happened with Pentangeli?

				MICHAEL
		His brother came to help him.

				KAY
		I didn't even know he had a brother.
		And where is he now?

				MICHAEL
		On a plane back to Sicily.

				KAY
		And that's all he had to do.  Just
		show his face.

				MICHAEL
		That's all.  You see, in Sicily, in
		the old days... there was only one
		legitimate reason to kill a blood
		relative... only one.  IF he was a
		traitor.

				KAY
		You would have killed his brother?

				MICHAEL
		Kay, you've got it wrong.  That
		kind of thing's all over, I promised
		you.  This was between the two
		brothers.  Years ago Frankie had a
		young girlfriend; he called her his
		co-wife.  That was his joke, but he
		meant it.  He wouldn't divorce his
		wife... because she was a great
		cook.  He said he girlfriend made a
		spaghetti sauce once and it was so
		terrible he knew he could never
		marry her.  He set her up in a
		house in Jersey.  She had to be
		faithful... and she had to have kids.
		And she did, two, a boy and a girl.
		He had her checked out and watched
		so she couldn't cheat... but the
		girl couldn't stand that kind of
		life.  She begged him to let her go.
		He did.  He gave her money and made
		her give up the kids.  Then Frankie
		took them to Italy, and had them
		brought up by his brother Vincenzo.
		Where he knew they'd by safe.

Kay begins to realize.

				MICHAEL
		When he saw his brother in the
		hearing room, he knew what was at
		stake.
			(pause)
		I don't think Vincenzo would have
		done it.  He loves the kids, too.
		Omerta, Kay.  Honor, silence.  It
		had nothing to do with me.  It was
		between those brothers.

				KAY
		I'll bring the children up now;
		they want to say goodbye.

				MICHAEL
		Kay, I told you...

				KAY
		Goodbye, Michael.

				MICHAEL
		I won't let you leave!  Christ, do
		you think I'm going to let you leave.

				KAY
			(meekly)
		Michael.

				MICHAEL
		No, I don't want to hear anything.
		There are things between men and
		women that will not change; things
		that have been the same for
		thousands of years.  You are my
		wife, and they are my children...
		and I love you and I will not let
		you leave, because you are MINE!

				KAY
		Oh, I do feel things for you,
		Michael; but now, I think it's pity.
		For the first time since I've known
		you, you seem so helpless.  You
		held me a prisoner once; will you
		try again?

				MICHAEL
		If that's what it takes; then yes,
		I will.

				KAY
		At this moment, I feel no love for
		you at all.  I never thought that
		could happen, but it has.

				MICHAEL
		We'll go back tonight.  Bring the
		children.

				KAY
		You haven't heard me.

He moves to her; he does love her, and is tender with her.

				MICHAEL
		How can I let you leave; how can I
		let you take my children away?
		Don't you know me?  You understand,
		it's an impossibility.  I would
		never let it happen; no, never, not
		if it took all my strength, all my
		cunning.  But in time, soon, you'll
		feel differently.  You see, you'll
		be happy that I stopped you.  I
		know you.  You'll forget about
		this; you'll forget about the baby
		we lost... and we'll go on, you and
		I.

				KAY
		The baby I lost...

				MICHAEL
		I know what it meant... and I'm
		prepared to make it up to you.  I
		will make changes; I can.
			(he clenches his fist tightly)
		I CAN change; that I have learned,
		that I have the strength to change...
		And we have another child, a boy...
		and you'll forget the miscarriage.

				KAY
		It wasn't a miscarriage.  And you
		with your cunning, couldn't you
		figure it out!  It was an abortion;
		an abortion, like our marriage is
		an abortion, something unholy and
		evil.  I don't want your son; I
		wouldn't bring another of your sons
		into this world.  An abortion,
		Michael... it was a son, and I had
		it killed, but this must all end!

VIEW ON MICHAEL

He had no hint, not in his wildest imagination could he have
guessed that she would do such a thing.

				KAY
		And I know that now it's over; I
		knew it then, there would be no way
		you could ever forgive me, not with
		this Sicilian thing that goes back
		two thousand years.

He is silent, though raging -- then, with all his passion,
and his strength, he raises his arms, and strikes her across
her neck, literally knocking her down to the floor, and
hurting her badly.

				MICHAEL
			(coldly)
		You won't take my children.

							FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. THE CORLEONE ESTATE AT TAHOE - FULL VIEW - DAY

A collection of dark cars and black limousines are gathered
to one side.  A few drivers wait quietly.

And then, to the other extreme of the estate, is a small
grouping of about twenty to thirty people, gathered near
Michael's house.

MED. CLOSE SHOT

Connie Corleone, dressed simply and now showing her age
without the carefully applied makeup which we have been used
to, kneels down before the shrine of Santa Theresa, and puts
down a bouquet of flowers, along with others that have been
placed there.  We see that some have the simple silk ribbon
with the word "Mama" hand-lettered upon it.

Her two children stand close behind her; they had been
raised by their Grandmother.

Connie steps back, and moves through the small group of
friends and relatives, into Michael's house.

INT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - CONNIE'S VIEW - DAY

Fredo, kneeling by the coffin of his mother in a portion of
the house that has been set aside for the wake.  Fredo
concludes his prayer, wipes away the tears in his eyes and
steps away from the coffin.

He stops when he notices Neri, a little distance away,
looking at him.

VIEW ON NERI

After a moment, he nods respectfully to Fredo, and steps
forward, moving to the old woman's coffin.  Fredo moves to
Hagen, who is there with his wife and children.

				FREDO
		Tom.  Where's Mike?

				HAGEN
			(difficult to tell him)
		He's waiting for you to leave.

				FREDO
		Can I talk to him?

				HAGEN
		No chance.  I'm sorry, Freddie.

				CONNIE
			(who has heard this)
		Can I see him?

				HAGEN
		He's in the boathouse.

INT. THE BOATHOUSE - MED. VIEW - DAY

Michael sits quietly in the darkened room in one of the big
sofas, dressed immaculately in suit and tie.  His two
children, also dressed for the wake sit opposite him in the
other oversized sofa, their shoes not touching the floor.
We regard this tableau for a long moment.

				CONNIE (O.S.)
			(quietly)
		Michael?  It's Connie.

She comes in, and sits down by his knees.

				CONNIE
		I want to stay close to home now,
		is that alright?

Michael nods.

				CONNIE
		Is Kay coming?

				MICHAEL
		No.

				CONNIE
		Michael, Fredo's in the house with
		Mama.  He asked for you, and Tom
		said he couldn't see you.

				MICHAEL
		Tom is right.

				CONNIE
		Kids, why don't you go outside for
		a while?

The children don't move; Connie realizes they will only
listen to Michael.

				CONNIE
		I want to talk to you, Michael.

				MICHAEL
		The children can stay.

				CONNIE
		I hated you for so long, Michael;
		for so many years.  I think I did
		things to myself, to hurt myself,
		so that you would know -- and you
		would be hurt too.  But I understand
		you now; I think I do.  You were
		being strong for all of us, like
		Papa was.  And I forgive you, and
		want to be close to you now.  Can't
		you forgive Fredo; he's so sweet,
		and helpless without you.

Slowly, Michael puts his hand on her hair, and touches her
gently.

				CONNIE
		You need me, Michael.  I want to be
		with you now.

INT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - DAY

Friends, relatives; Francesca and her new husband, Gardner
and their baby; Sandra Corleone; Teresa, her children; all
the familiar faces of the family are present, quietly paying
their respects to Mama.

Some of the men can be seen in the kitchen, drinking wine,
and talking in low voices.

Fredo is there, broken-hearted over the loss of his Mother;
like some lost child with no friends.

MED. VIEW

Michael enters the room, followed by Connie, who tends
little Mary and Anthony.

He approaches his brother, and then embraces.  Fredo breaks
into tears.

				FREDO
		Christ, Mike.  Jesus Christ, Mike.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

embracing his brother, he glances up.

VIEW ON NERI

quiet, and deadly.

EXT. THE TAHOE ESTATE - MED. VIEW - DAY

Tom Hagen is talking in the distance to his wife, and one of
his older sons; he kisses, and moves toward the boathouse.
After crossing the lawn, he stops.

VIEW ON SANDRA CORLEONE

waiting there; obviously wanting to talk to him.  He
continues, and she walks with him.

MOVING VIEW ON THE TWO

as they cross toward the boathouse.

				SANDRA
		You're going to talk to him now.

				HAGEN
		Yes.

				SANDRA
		Will you tell him?

				HAGEN
		I don't know.

She stops him.

				SANDRA
		Tom, think of yourself for once.
		Don't let this opportunity slip
		through your fingers; don't do it.
		We're all trapped here, don't you
		see?

He continues past her, without answering her.  Continues up
to the boathouse.  He stops before he enters.

HAGEN'S VIEW

Fredo is sitting by the edge of the harbor with Michael's
son Anthony; he is helping him with some fishing rig.

INT. THE BOATHOUSE - VIEW ON MICHAEL - DAY

looking through the window at his son and brother.  Neri
sits in the room, dressed informally.

				MICHAEL
			(without looking back)
		Sit down, Tom.  Have you heard
		about our friend and partner, Mr.
		Hyman Roth?

				HAGEN
		I know he's in Israel.

				NERI
			(hands Hagen the paper)
		The High Court of Israel turned
		down his request to live as a
		'returned Jew.' His passport's been
		invalidated except for return to
		the U.S.  He landed in Buenos Aires
		yesterday, offered a gift of one
		million dollars if they would give
		him citizenship.  They turned him
		down.

				HAGEN
			(reading)
		He's going to try Panama...

				MICHAEL
		They won't take him; not for a
		million, not for ten million.

				HAGEN
		His medical condition is reported
		as... "terminal."

				MICHAEL
		He's been dying of the same heart
		attack for twenty years.

				HAGEN
		That plane goes to Miami...

				MICHAEL
		I want it met.

				HAGEN
			(understanding)
		Mike, it's impossible.  He'll be
		met by the Internal Revenue; the
		Customs Service, and half the FBI.

				MICHAEL
		I don't like it when you use the
		word impossible; nothing is
		impossible...

				HAGEN
		Mike, it would be like trying to
		kill the President; there's no way
		we can get to him.

				MICHAEL
		I'm surprised at you, Tom.  If
		there's anything certain; certain
		in life; if history has taught us
		anything, it's that you can kill...
			(he stops, then coldly)
		ANYBODY.  But perhaps your
		relucatance is because you've come
		to tell me that you're moving your
		family to Vegas, that you've been
		offered the Vice-Presidency of the
		Houstan Hotels there.  Or weren't
		you going to tell me at all?

				HAGEN
		Are you so hungry for traitors; do
		you want to find them everywhere?

				MICHAEL
		They are everywhere!

				HAGEN
		I turned Houstan down; I didn't see
		why I should tell you about an
		offer I turned down.
			(Michael begins to
			confuse him)
		Are you sure, Mikey?  Are you sure
		of what we're doing; what we'll
		gain; what does the family gain?
		Forget that, Mike; I already know
		the answer.

				MICHAEL
		I know you do, Tom.  Then I can
		count on you to help me do the
		things I have to do.  If not, call
		Houstan, and become a Vice-President.
		Take your family and your mistress
		and move them to Las Vegas.

				HAGEN
		Why do you hurt me, Michael?  I've
		always been loyal to you.

				MICHAEL
		Good.  Then you're staying.

				HAGEN
		I'm staying.
			(he pauses...then,
			without being asked)
		Don't ever enjoy the cruel part of
		all this; Sonny never listened to
		me about that.
			(then he sits down,
			and opens his briefcase)
		Now, explain everything to me.

EXT. THE HARBOR - DAY

Fredo sits with Anthony, with a silly-looking fishing hat on
his head, covered with lure and flies.

				FREDO
		Anthony, ole buddy, your Uncle
		Fredo's gonna teach you how to
		catch the big fish.  You know, when
		I was a kid, I did this amazing
		thing.  I went out on a fishing
		trip; me and my brothers and my
		Pop, and no one could catch a fish
		except me.  And this was my secret:
			(confidentially)
		Every time I would put the line
		down I would say a "Hail Mary" and
		every time I said a "Hail Mary" I
		would catch a fish.  Now, when it's
		sunset, we're gonna go out on the
		lake, and we're gonna try it.

INT. GUARDED HOUSE - DAY

The guards step aside as Tom Hagen enters the foyer of the
house.  He shows a court order to them and they lead him up
the stairs where he knocks on the door.

INT. GUARDED HOUSE - DAY

There is a KNOCK at the door.  The two guards show Hagen in
and Hagen presents the court order to one of the FBI men.

				HAGEN
		I think I prefer to see my client
		privately.

				PENTANGELI
		The room has a bug in it.

				HAGEN
			(to the FBI men)
		I'd like to go outside with him, in
		the open air.

				FBI MAN #1
		This room is not bugged.

				HAGEN
		You have guards outside and the
		electric fence.  There's no security
		reason for not letting us talk in
		the yard.

				FBI MAN #1
		Okay.

They pass out of the room.

EXT. THE ARMY POST - DAY

Hagen and Pentangeli outside, by the electric fence.  They
cannot be overheard.  Pentangeli takes out some cigars and
offers Hagen one.  Hagen takes it and Pentangeli lights both
their cigars.  They puff on them contentedly.  They are
comfortable together, almost.

				HAGEN
		Everything is going to be okay,
		Frankie, don't worry.

				PENTANGELI
		Did my brother go back?

				HAGEN
		Yeah, but don't worry.

				PENTANGELI
		He's ten times tougher than me, my
		brother.  He's old-fashioned.

				HAGEN
		Yeah.  He wouldn't even go out to
		dinner.  Just wanted to go home.

				PENTANGELI
		That's my brother.  Nothing could
		get him away from that two mule
		town.  He coulda been big over
		here -- he could of had his own
		Family.

				HAGEN
		You're right.

				PENTANGELI
		Tom, what do I do now?

The light is beginning to turn reddish as the sun falls.

				HAGEN
		Frankie, you were always interested
		in politics, in history.  I remember
		you talking about Hitler back in
		'43.  We were young then.

				PENTANGELI
		Yeah, I still read a lot.  They
		bring me stuff.

				HAGEN
		You were around the old timers who
		dreamed up how the Families should
		be organized, how they based it on
		the old Roman Legions, and called
		them 'Regimes'... with the 'Capos'
		and 'Soldiers,' and it worked.

				PENTANGELI
		Yeah, it worked.  Those were great
		old days.  We was like the Roman
		Empire.  The Corleone family was
		like the Roman Empire.

				HAGEN
			(sadly)
		Yeah, it was once.

They both puff on their cigars.  Pentangeli lets himself be
carried away by thoughts of old days of glory; Hagen thinks
of other days too.

				HAGEN
			(very gently)
		The Roman Empire... when a plot
		against the Emperor failed, the
		plotters were always given a chance
		to let their families keep their
		fortunes.

				PENTANGELI
		Yeah, but only the rich guys.  The
		little guys got knocked off.  If
		they got arrested and executed, all
		their estate went to the Emperor.
		If they just went home and killed
		themselves, up front, nothing
		happened.

				HAGEN
		Yeah, that was a good break.  A
		nice deal.

Pentangeli looks at Hagen; he understands.

				PENTANGELI
		They went home and sat in a hot
		bath and opened their veins, and
		bled to death.  Sometimes they gave
		a little party before they did it.

Hagen throws away his cigar.  Pentangeli puffs on his.

				HAGEN
		Don't worry about anything, Frankie
		Five-Angels.

				PENTANGELI
		Thanks, Tom.  Thanks.

They shake hands.  The FBI Agents come out to let Hagen out
the gate.  Pentangeli is led back to the house.

				FBI MAN #1
		Your lawyer tell you he can get
		that 600 years reduced to 500?

Pentangeli puffs on his cigar and reflects.

				PENTANGELI
		You boys sure you can't get me a
		broad for tonight?  Give me a
		little party?

				FBI MAN #2
		We got some nice books.

Pentangeli puffs on his cigar and gives the Agent a smile an
old man gives a child.  He starts upstairs.

				PENTANGELI
		I guess I'll just take a hot bath.

EXT. THE ARMY POST - DAY

Hagen walks away; glances back.  Then gets into his waiting
car and drives off.

INT. THE BOATHOUSE - FULL VIEW - SUNSET

Michael sits alone in the empty boathouse; in the shadows.

INT. BOAT DOCK - SUNSET

Neri stands by the dock area under the boathouse.  He pushes
the button which lowers a boat by winch and tackle.  He
wears a fishing cap.

He steps into the boat, and pulls the small outboard, which
glides the boat out into the harbor.

MED. VIEW

The boat pulls up alongside Fredo and Anthony.

				FREDO
		Here we go; and remember the secret.

He lifts Anthony into the boat.

				CONNIE (O.S.)
		Anthony.

THEIR VIEW

Connie, in houseclothes, is calling Anthony.

				FREDO
		He's here; we're goin' fishing.

				CONNIE
		He can't go; Michael wants to take
		him into Reno.

				FREDO
		Ah.  Okay, kid, you got to go to
		Reno with your Pop.

He lifts the boy out of the boat, and puts him on the shore.

				FREDO
		I'll catch one for you, with the
		secret.

				CONNIE
		Hurry, Anthony.

Neri stands the motor; and the boat with the two fisherman
glides off.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

watching, from the dark window of the boathouse.

INT. HIGH SECURITY HOUSE IN ARMY POST - NIGHT

The FBI man knocks on the bathroom door in the house where
they have kept Pentangeli.

				FBI MAN #1
		Frankie, open up.  You okay?

No answer; he hammers on the door.  Using his elbow, and
then a kick he breaks into the bathroom.

HIS VIEW

Pentangeli lying in a tub of water.  His stomach shows above
it.  His wrists are cut and covered with blood.  The bath
water has a purplish tone.

							DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. LAKE TAHOE - MED. VIEW - SUNSET

Fredo and Neri are fishing, each with lines out.  The VIEW
MOVES CLOSER, and we can hear Fredo as he holds the pole.

				FREDO
		... the Lord is with thee.  Blessed
		art thou amongst women, and blessed
		is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

LONG SHOT

The boat on the shimmery lake.

				FREDO
		... Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray
		for us...

We hear a quiet, echoing GUNSHOT; and then silence.

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT. MIAMI AIRPORT - NIGHT

An exhausted Hyman Roth, ill-shaven, and in shirt-sleeves in
taken into custody by a swarm of Customs, and FBI men.  They
allow him to be photographed by press people; and television
cameramen.

				FBI MAN
		Mr. Roth, we have to take you into
		custody.

				ROTH
		Yes, I know.

Some flashbulbs go off.

				REPORTER
		Can you give us your reaction to
		the High Court of Israel's ruling.

				ROTH
		I am a retired investor on a
		pension, and I wished to live there
		as a Jew  in the twilight of my
		life...

				LAWYER
		Mr. Roth is not a well man; he's
		tired of running.

				ROTH
		I'm an old man; at my age, it's too
		late to start worrying.

				REPORTER
		Is it true you are worth over three
		hundred million dollars, Mr. Roth?

				ROTH
		I'm a retired investor, living on a
		pension... I came home to vote in
		the Presidential election, because
		they wouldn't give me an absentee
		ballot...

The newsmen and photographers all laugh, as the FBI men move
him away.

CLOSE VIEW

One of the newspapermen laughing we recognize to be Rocco
Lampone.

He moves closer to Roth, and shoves his revolver right
against his head, and in a second, on camera, assassinates
Roth.  People scream, as Rocco attempts to run down the
airport corridor, limping as he does.

FBI men easily pick him off.

							FADE OUT.

EXT. THE DRIVEWAY BY MICHAEL'S HOUSE - DAY

A taxi cab waits by the house; its driver sleeping with a
newspaper over his face.

INT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - DAY

The cleaning woman, Esther, who had been with Kay for years,
sits by the dining room table, weeping profusely.  Behind
her, in the recreation room, we can see the tableau of Kay
sitting on the couch, her little daughter Mary, between her
knees, talking quietly about things we cannot hear.  Her son
Anthony sits by himself, in another chair by the side of the
room.

MED. VIEW

Connie comes into the house quickly, and moves toward them.

				CONNIE
		Kay, you have to go.

This prompts Esther to weep all the more.  Kay hugs her
daughter, and kisses her many times.

				CONNIE
		You have to hurry; he's coming.

Kay puts her coat on; then stands, and reaches out for her
son.

				KAY
		Anthony, kiss Mama goodbye.

He doesn't move.

				CONNIE
			(angrily)
		Anthony, you kiss your Mother
		goodbye!

He rises, and walks to her.  Hugs her lifelessly.

MED. CLOSE VIEW

on Kay, kissing her boy.

				KAY
		Anthony, say goodbye; your Mama
		loves you.

				ANTHONY
		Goodbye.

She restrains any tears; she has become too strong for tears.
Kay starts to go; picks up Mary, kisses her, and starts to go.

NEW VIEW

She steps out the kitchen door; then she cannot help herself.
Crouches down, outside, and calls to her son.

				KAY
		Anthony, kiss me once.

Then she looks up, and slowly rises.

HER VIEW

Michael has stepped into the dining room.  He seems older
somehow; as though some sickness has taken more years away
from him.

VIEW ON KAY

looks at him; instinctively, she takes a step back.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

slowly steps toward her.

VIEW ON KAY

Another step back; the door is still open.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

He moves closer to the door; stops, looks at her.  And then
closes it obscuring any view of her.

EXT. TAHOE ESTATE - DAY

It is late fall -- most of the leaves have fallen on the
grounds and there is quite a wind.

MED. VIEW

The water is whipped up by the wind, and the waves are high
as they break against the pavilion.  We HEAR the MUSIC of
time passing, of Michael, of the Godfather over these images.

VIEW ON THE SWIMMING POOLS

They have not been used in several months; they are drained
and the bottoms are mossy and dark.

VIEW ON THE MAIN GATE

Leaves blowing past it; we don't see the button men; only a
hint of someone in the gatehouse.

VIEW ON THE HOUSES

Some of the houses have had the summer awnings taken down,
and put away.  Some of the windows have been boarded up.

VIEW ON THE KENNELS

There are still the guard dogs; some sleeping, some moving
impatiently.

As the MUSIC concludes its statement.

MED. VIEW

The peninsula of the private Corleone Harbor.  We see the
figures of two people, seated at a table.

MED. VIEW

Michael sits at a table having a sparse lunch.  He is
attended by his sister Connie, who seems to be the closest
person now living on the estate with him.  We see from the
way she pampers him with his lunch, that she has fallen into
the role of a surrogate Mother-Wife.  He seems older than
his years, as though his illness, diabetes, has taken its
toll.

				CONNIE
		Don't worry; I'm sure he got here
		on time.  The roads from the
		airport are so windy, it takes
		forever; I've driven them myself.

She picks up some of the serving plates that he has left
untouched.

				CONNIE
		I'll bring him out to you as soon
		as he comes.

She moves back to the main house.

MED. CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL

He turns and looks at the rough water of the lake for a
moment.  He slowly takes a sip of wine.

EXT. A PLACE IN THE GARDEN - DAY

There are a few chairs.

MED. VIEW ON ANTHONY CORLEONE

He is eighteen years old.

				ANTHONY
		Hello, Dad.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

squinting up at his son.

				MICHAEL
		Anthony.

He rises, and reaches up to his son, who is now taller than
he; he embraces him.

				MICHAEL
		You've grown so tall... so tall in
		the last year.  You're much taller
		than me.

				ANTHONY
		I was taller than you when I was
		fourteen.

				MICHAEL
		Sit down.  Your Aunt Connie and I
		waited for you to have some lunch,
		but now it's all dried out.

				ANTHONY
		I'm not hungry.

				MICHAEL
		Well, that's alright... alright.
		Good.  You'll graduate in another
		year, isn't that right?  You know...
		I never finished college.  I was a
		good student, but I never finished.
		Of course, there was a war then.

Connie approaches them.

				CONNIE
		Don't let me interrupt anything,
		this will just take a second.  Here.
			(she takes out a
			small needle, and
			begins to prepare it)
		Your father has to have his insulin
		shot.  Why don't you go to your
		room and put your things away,
		Anthony.

She begins to give Michael the shot.

				MICHAEL
		Hurry back; we'll talk.  We'll talk.

Anthony goes on his way to the house with his things.
Connie gives Michael the shot.

				CONNIE
		Whenever I see that lake so cold, I
		think of poor Fredo, drowned.  Lake
		Tahoe is very cold.  They say if a
		person drowns in it, that the body
		will remain mid-suspended --
		perfectly preserved.  Some say it
		will remain forever.

She finishes the shot, puts her things away.

				CONNIE
		Your boy will be right back.

She leaves.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

Alone in the garden.

OUR VIEW begins to MOVE CLOSER to him.  We begin to HEAR
MUSIC of the forties; happy music, swing music, as we move
CLOSER to Michael.

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT. OLD CORLEONE HOUSE - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

SONNY CORLEONE, his arm wrapped around a smiling red-faced
Carlo Rizzi, pulls him into the Corleone dining room.

				SONNY
		Hey, who knows my buddy Carlo Rizzi.
		Here... my brother Fredo, here's my
		Mom.  Mom, whatcha got cooking?
		And Carlo, this is my kid sister
		Connie.  Here, pull up a chair,
		Carol is sitting next to Connie.
		Oh, the droopy kid over there is
		Mike.  The college boy.

An older, lanky man enters the room, his arms laden with
presents.  This is TESSIO.

				TESSIO
		Buon Natale, everybody.  Buon
		Natale...
			(he smiles at Tom Hagen)
		Hi, Tom, how's every little thing?

				HAGEN
			(helping him with the presents)
		Wonderful, Sal.

Now the study door opens, and DON CORLEONE enters.

				DON CORLEONE
		Is dinner ready?

				MOM
		Two minutes.

The Don happily regards his family; his sons and daughters
and even some Grandchildren.  He raises a glass.

				DON CORLEONE
		A good life, a long life to all my
		children, and friends.  To my
		grandchildren, and those that will
		be.  To our family.

They all drink.

They refill glasses; then Tessio proposes a toast.

				TESSIO
		To our Godfather.

They all drink.

INT. THE DINING ROOM - MED. VIEW - NIGHT

The family is happily at Christmas dinner.  Don Corleone
seated at the head of the table.

				SONNY
		What'd you think of those Japs, eh?
		The nerve of those Japs, coming
		right here in our own backyard
		dropping bombs!

				HAGEN
		Well, we could have expected it
		after the embargo.

				SONNY
		Hey!  Expect it or not, those Japs
		don't have a right to drop bombs in
		our backyard.  Whose side you on?

				MAMA
		Please, do we have to talk about
		the war at the table?  On Christmas,
		much less.

VIEW ON MICHAEL

He has been listening to this discussion.

				MICHAEL
		Pop, I've decided I'm going to
		enlist.

A quiet hush descends over the table, as though everyone
knows the effect this will have on the old man.  Sonny tries
to make light of it.

				SONNY
		Kid, stay in college.  The girls
		are cuter, if you know what I mean.

				HAGEN
		Pop had to pull a lot of strings to
		get you your deferment.

				MICHAEL
		I never asked for it; I don't want
		it.

VIEW ON DON CORLEONE

Disturbed; but wise and prudent.

				DON CORLEONE
		My son wants to talk about this,
		and so we'll talk, but not at the
		dinner table.

He rises, and starts across the room toward his study.  Then
he looks back.

				DON CORLEONE
		Michael.

He disappears into his study.  Michael rises, glances around.
People are generally tense over the situation.  Michael
follows his father into the study.

INT. DON CORLEONE'S OLD STUDY - NIGHT

The Don closes the door behind his son, and then moves
across the room.  He stops at the little bar there, and
pours himself a brandy.

				DON CORLEONE
		Would you like some?

				MICHAEL
		No, Dad.

				DON CORLEONE
		Now what is this talk about joining
		the army?  Eh?

				MICHAEL
		It's not talk; I'm doing it.

				DON CORLEONE
		You would risk your life for
		strangers?

				MICHAEL
		Not for strangers; for my country.

				DON CORLEONE
		Anyone not in your family, is a
		stranger.  Believe me, when trouble
		comes, your country won't take care
		of you.

				MICHAEL
		That's how it was in the old world,
		Pop, but this is not Sicily.

				DON CORLEONE
		I know.  I know, Michael.  It's
		Christmas, your brothers and sister
		are all here -- we are happy.
		Let's not spoil this.  Go your own
		way, but when you are ready, come
		to me the way a son should.  I have
		hopes for you...

CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL

looking at his father with a mixture of great love, and also
fear, and confusion.

				MICHAEL
		I won't be a man like you.

EXT. THE TAHOE ESTATE - HIGH FULL VIEW - DAY

The leaves are blowing.  MUSIC comes up.

Michael and his young son, Anthony, walk through the grounds
of the estate, talking about things we cannot hear.
