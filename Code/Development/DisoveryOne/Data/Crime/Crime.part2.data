FADE IN:

EXT. NIGHT SKY

Flames in the night sky. Distant SIRENS. PULLING BACK,
we see that the burning building is mostly hidden by dense,
black shapes that define the oceanside skyline of Miranda
Beach, Florida. We're watching from across town. The
sound of a bathroom SHOWER comes to a dripping stop at
about the same time we see the naked back and head of NED
RACINE. We continue to PULL BACK INTO --

RACINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Racine, dressed in undershorts, is standing on the small
porch off his apartment on the upper floor of an old house.
Racine lights a cigarette and continues to stare off at
the fire. We've passed him now, into the bedroom of the
apartment, and the shape of a young woman, ANGELA, flashes
by, drying her body with a towel.

                          ANGELA (O.S.)
           My God, it's hot. I stepped out of
           the shower and stared sweating again.
           ... It's still burning? Jesus, it's
           bigger! And I thought you were making
           me hear those sirens.
                  (she giggles)
           What is it?

                          RACINE
           The Seawater Inn. My family used to
           eat dinner there twenty-five years
           ago. Now somebody's torched it to
           clear the lot.

Angela reappears briefly, gathering her clothes.   She
sits on an unseen bed to get dressed.

                             ANGELA (O.S.)
           That's a shame.

                          RACINE
           Probably one of my clients.

                             ANGELA (O.S.)
           I'm leaving.

                          RACINE
                  (back still turned)
           It's four a.m.

On the bed, Angela snaps on her bra.

                          ANGELA
           I go on duty at Miami Airport at
           seven.

                         ANGELA (CONT'D)
          I wouldn't mind having breakfast...
          What do you care? You're watching
          the fire. You're done with me. I'm
          just getting into my uniform here...

She is, in fact, slipping on the blouse of her Avis Rent-
a-Car uniform. There's a smile on her lips as she buttons
up, watching Racine.

                         ANGELA
          You've had your fun. You're spent.
                 (trying for a
                  straight face)
          I'll just slip into my uniform here
          and slip away.

                         RACINE
          My history's burning up out here.

                         ANGELA
          Hey, I don't mind. I'm leaving.
          Why do they make these damn skirts
          so hard to zip...

Now, for the first time, Racine turns to look at   her.
She is sitting on the edge of the bed, half into   her
uniform. Racine smiles broadly at the  sight and   moves
into the room. He pushes her back and  they both   disappear
from sight, fabric rustling.

                         RACINE
          Where's your hat?

                         ANGELA (O.S.)
          Hey... hey...
                 (giggling)
          ... don't wrinkle it!

                         RACINE (O.S.)
          'You're spent.' Where'd you hear
          that?

We are left looking out over the porch at the night. And
we go back there, across the rooftops, to the flames.

INT. COURTROOM - DAY

An Assistant County Prosecutor named PETER LOWENSTEIN has
been conferring at the bench with JUDGE COSTANZA and now
they both wait as Racine comes into view to join them.

The Judge is irritated.

                         JUDGE COSTANZA
          Mr. Racine, I do no longer care
          whether these alleged toilets were
                         (MORE)

                         JUDGE COSTANZA (CONT'D)
          ever actually en route from Indiana
          or not. I think we're wasting our
          time here. It's pretty clear your
          client has attempted to defraud the
          county in a not very ingenious manner.
                 (he nods at
                  Lowenstein)
          The Assistant Prosecutor has made
          what I consider a generous offer.
          And given that you've failed to
          generate even the semblance of a
          defense --

                         RACINE
          Judge Costanza, perhaps when I've
          presented all --

                         JUDGE COSTANZA
          Yeah, yeah. If I were you, I'd
          recommend to your client that held
          quickly do as Mr. Lowenstein here
          has suggested -- plead nolo
          contendre, file Chapter Eleven and
          agree never to do business with
          Okeelanta County again.

Racine is surprised and pleased.

                         RACINE
          You would look favorably on that?

                         JUDGE COSTANZA
                 (nods)
          He can walk. But don't test my
          patience for even five more minutes.
          If he hesitates, I'll nail him.

                         RACINE
          I'll talk to him.

Racine starts to turn.

                         JUDGE COSTANZA
          Mr. Racine. Next time you come into
          my courtroom I hope you've got either
          a better defense or a better class
          of client.

Lowenstein smiles.

                         RACINE
          Thank you, Your Honor.

Racine goes back to his client, a Businessman of enormous
confidence and extravagantly untrustworthy appearance.

INT. STELLA'S COFFEE SHOP - FIRST STREET - DAY

Racine and Lowenstein are seated at the counter. Racine
drinks beer while Lowenstein drinks a tall iced tea very
rapidly and signals for another. This place is across
the street from the courthouse/police station and there
are plenty of lawyers and cops around, several of whom
acknowledge Lowenstein and Racine with pats or nods.

A single unit air conditioner is blowing away above the
door, but it can't compete with the blasts of hot air
that come in with each new patron. All of these people,
like the pedestrians outside the window, have stripped
down to essentials In the infernal heat. The lawyers all
carry their Jackets, but even so their shirtsleeves are
sweaty. The town is sizzling.

                         LOWENSTEIN
          -- I think I've underestimated you,
          Ned. I don't know why it took me so
          long. You've started using your
          incompetence as a weapon.

                          RACINE
                 (smiles)
          My defense was evolving. You guys
          got scared. Costanza doesn't like
          me. What'd I do to him?

                          LOWENSTEIN
          He's an unhappy man, Thinks he should
          be Circuit Court by now. Here he is
          in a state with really top-notch
          corruption and he's stuck with the
          county toilets.
                 (he drinks)
          I'm surprised you weren't in on that
          toilet caper. Could have been that
          quick score you've always been
          searching for.

                          RACINE
          Maybe Costanza was in on it.   That's
          why he was mad.

STELLA, the owner of the coffee shop, writes and places
separate checks in front of the two men.

                         STELLA
          What's the word from the hallowed
          halls of justice? Anything juicy?

                         LOWENSTEIN
          Maybe Stella was in on it.
                 (finished his tea)
          Stella, when you gonna get a real
          air conditioner in here.

                         STELLA
          You don't like it there's lots of
          other places.

                         LOWENSTEIN
          They don't have you. Gotta go.

He stands fishing for change, but Racine takes his check
and places it with his own. Lowenstein nods and moves for
the door.

                         LOWENSTEIN
          You can't buy me. No sirree, I don't
          come cheap.

Just before he reaches the door he does a strange thing --
he takes several graceful dance steps in the Astaire
manner.

                         A VOICE
          Lowenstein, you're a fag.

Lowenstein spins out the door, where he is blasted by the
heavy air. His body droops as he disappears.

                         STELLA
          Why does he do that?

                         RACINE
          He's pretty good, that's the weird
          part.

                         STELLA
          Did you hear about Dr. Block?

                          RACINE
          No.   Do I want to?

                          STELLA
                 (leans toward him,
                  confidential)
          Agnes Marshall.

                         RACINE
                 (the thought
                  disgusts him)
          That must have been Mrs. Block's
          idea, some kind of punishment.

                         STELLA
          It was! How'd you know? Christ,
          you're plugged in better than me.
          So you must know about Mrs. Block's
          friend in Ocean Grove.

Racine winces, gets up, and puts money on the counter.
He lights a cigarette.

                         RACINE
          Stella, this is beneath even you.
          Things must be slow.

Stella agrees with a shrug as Racine heads for the door.

                           STELLA
          It's the heat.

EXT. FIRST STREET AND MAIN STREET - DAY

Racine makes his way up First to the corner of Main and
crosses diagonally to his building on Main. He is well-
known here, greeted through glass by many of the shop
owners. The heat dominates much of the pantomimed
conversation. Racine goes in a doorway and heads up the
stairs to his office.

INT. RACINE'S OFFICE - DAY

Racine's secretary, BEVERLY, is behind the desk in the
modest reception room. She's a pretty girl barely past
twenty. She pushes some phone message slips toward Racine
and nods toward the sofa. A middle-aged woman client,
MRS. SINGER, sits there clutching a walking stick. Her
face suddenly is contorted in pain. Racine glances
meaningfully at Beverly then turns his full solicitous
charm on Mrs. Singer.

                         RACINE
          Mrs. Singer, I would have gladly
          come to the house.

He helps her up and leads her slowly to his office.

                         MRS. SINGER
          No. no, the doctor says I should
          walk and I had some shopping. Not
          that that quack knows what he's
          talking about. I tell you, Mr.
          Racine, I'm not sure his testimony
          is going to be very useful.

                         RACINE
          Don't worry about it. I'll find you
          a doctor who's more understanding.
          Is it bad today?

                         MRS. SINGER
          Oooh, you can't imagine. Nothing
          can make up for the pain they've
          caused me.

                         RACINE
          How well I know. We'll sue those
          reckless bastards dry. Excuse my
          language.

As Mrs. Singer disappears into the office, Racine flashes
a grin at Beverly.

                         MRS. SINGER
          Don't apologize. That's the kind of
          attitude you've got to have these
          days...

EXT. THE BEACHFRONT - NIGHT

The hottest January in fifty years has brought the crowds
to the beach in search of relief. But they've been
disappointed. Even the breeze off the ocean seems blown
from a hair dryer. Still, the nights are a trifle better
and the Beachfront, the penny arcades, the ice cream stands
and bars are busy, even now in the middle of the week.

Racine comes out of a bar and lights a cigarette, idly
watching the passing parade. There is a free band concert
in progress at the band shell. Racine wanders in that
direction.

EXT. THE BAND SHELL - NIGHT

The Miranda Beach High School Orchestra is playing to a
full, sweating house; the audience is a sea of orange
programs fluttering away as fans. People come and go
frequently.

The atmosphere is as innocent and informal as the music
the band is playing now.

Racine leans against the back rail, smoking, his eyes
playing over the scene with no expectations.

Then, down near the center aisle, a WOMAN rises. As the
band plays on, this extraordinary, beautiful woman, in a
simple white dress, moves down the aisle. She moves
wonderfully. The dress clings to  her body in the heat.

Racine watches, mesmerized, as she walks directly toward
him. She passes within a few inches of him, her eyes
lowered. Racine's body sways a moment as she goes by, as
though buffeted by some force. But they do not touch.
She goes out onto the Beachfront walkway.

EXT. THE BEACHFRONT WALKWAY - NIGHT

The Woman, MATTY, has walked to the rail. She stands
there now lighting a cigarette. She presents her face

to the ocean, hoping for a breeze.    We move in on her,
with Racine.

Racine lights a new cigarette and smiles at her. She
looks at him and, for an instant, her eyes race over his
body, then she looks back at the ocean.

                         RACINE
          You can stand here with me if you
          want, but you'll have to agree not
          to talk about the heat.

She looks at him, and there is something startling about
the directness of her gaze. When she speaks, she is cool
without being hostile.

                         MATTY
          I'm a married woman.

                            RACINE
          Meaning what?

                         MATTY
          Meaning I'm not looking for company.

She turns back toward the ocean.

                         RACINE
          Then you should have said -- 'I'm a
          happily married woman.'

                         MATTY
          That's my business.

                            RACINE
          What?

                            MATTY
          How happy I am.

                         RACINE
          And how, happy is that?

She looks at him curiously. She begins walking slowly
along the rail. He walks too.

                         MATTY
          You're not too smart, are you?

Racine shakes his head "no."

                         MATTY
          I like that in a man.

                         RACINE
          What else you like -- Ugly?   Lazy?
          Horny? I got 'em all.

                         MATTY
          You don't look lazy.

Racine smiles.

                         MATTY
          Tell me, does chat like that work
          with most women?

                         RACINE
          Some. If they haven't been around
          much.

                         MATTY
          I wondered. Thought maybe I was out
          of touch.

She stops again at the rail as a small breeze blows in
from the ocean. She turns her back to it and, with her
cigarette dangling from her lips, she uses both hands to
lift her hair up off her nape. She closes her eyes as
the air hits her. Racine watches very closely.

                         RACINE
          How 'bout I buy you a drink?

                         MATTY
          I told you. I've got a husband.

                         RACINE
          I'll buy him one too.

                         MATTY
          He's out of town.

                         RACINE
          My favorite kind. We'll drink to
          him.

                         MATTY
          He only comes up on the weekends.

Matty lets her hair fall and again begins moving down
walkway. She drops her cigarette and steps on it.

                         RACINE
          I'm liking him better all the time.
          You better take me up on this quick.
          In another forty-five minutes I'm
          going to give up and walk away.

                         MATTY
          You want to buy me something?   I'll
          take one of these.

They have come upon a Vendor selling snow cones.

                         RACINE
          What kind?

                         MATTY
          Cherry.

                         RACINE
                 (to Vendor)
          Make it two.

The Vendor scoops and pours as Racine lays some change on
the cart.

                         RACINE
                 (to Matty)
          You're not staying in Miranda Beach.
                 (she shakes her
                  head "no")
          I would have noticed you.

                         MATTY
          Is this town that small?

Racine hands her a snow cone. They walk over to the rail.
Racine watches her eat the snow cone with enormous
interest.

                         RACINE
          Pinehaven. You're staying up in
          Pinehaven, on the waterway.
                 (she gives him a
                  look, surprised)
          You have a house.

                            MATTY
          How'd you know?

                         RACINE
          You look like Pinehaven.

                         MATTY
          How does Pinehaven look?

                            RACINE
          Well tended.

She looks out at the ocean.

                         MATTY
          Yes, I'm well tended, all right.
          Well tended. What about you?

                         RACINE
          Me? I need tending. I need someone
          to take care of me. Rub my tired
          muscles. Smooth out my sheets.

                            MATTY
          Get married.

                         RACINE
          I just need it for tonight.

For the first time, Matty laughs. A moment later, she
spills the snow cone over the front of her dress. It
makes a bright red stain against the white. The thin
material clings to the line of her breast.

                           MATTY
          Good.    Nice move, Matty.

                           RACINE
          Matty.    I like it. Right over your
          heart.

                         MATTY
          At least it's cool. I'm burning up.

                         RACINE
          I asked you not to talk about the
          heat.

                         MATTY
          Would you get me a paper towel or
          something? Dip it in some cold water.

Racine starts toward the restroom nearby.

                           RACINE
          Right away.    I'll even wipe it off
          for you.

                         MATTY
          You don't want to lick it?

This causes a momentary hitch in Racine's retreat, but
then he hurries off.

INT. MEN'S ROOM

Racine comes in, snaps some paper towels from the rack
and turns on the water. The room is full of smoke. A
fifteen-year-old Boy is leaning against the wall. After
looking Racine over a second, he brings the smoking joint
he's been holding behind his back into view and takes a
toke. He nods at Racine, who nods back and stands up
with his wet towels. As he walks out, Racine takes a
deep breath.

EXT. THE BEACHFRONT - NIGHT

Racine comes out of the structure. And stops. Matty is
gone. Racine  looks around without much hope. Finally,
he puts a wet paper towel to the back of his neck. We
begin to HEAR a strange, measured thumping, and then --

EXT. THE BOARDWALK (82ND STREET) - DAWN

Racine is running. The THUMPING is the sound of Racine's
battered running shoes hitting the weathered wooden planks
of the Boardwalk.

    Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org             12.


Racine wears old gym shorts and a torn tee-shirt with
"F.S.U." fading from the front. The raised wooden walk
works its crooked way through lush, tropical vegetation,
first coming close to the wide, white beach, then jutting
back inland, swallowed by greenery, then shooting out
again toward the sea. Racine hits this last stretch at
top speed and launches himself flying out onto the gleaming
sand.

EXT. BEACH - DAWN

Racine is running on the sand now, on a raised, hardened
section that bisects the beach. His shoes make a weird
whooshing SOUND each time they break the compacted surface
and sink an inch below. The sun is just rising from the
ocean to his right, yet the day is already broiling.
Racine's shirt is drenched. The WHOOSHING is hypnotic,
steady; his expression indicates that it is just this
sound which keeps him going.

EXT. THE BAND SHELL/THE BEACH - DAY

Further on, Racine runs by the Band Shell where he'd seen
Matty.

EXT. THE PIER - DAY

The THUMPING returns, as Racine runs the long, straight
pier directly out to sea, toward the rising sun. A
lifeguard boat with an outboard motor is on the left of
the pier. Racine watches it as he runs until it disappears
beneath him, then reappears on his right and turns out to
sea, so that it is running beside him. Racine speeds up,
really kicking, racing the boat to the end of the pier.
The Lifeguard on board isn't even aware of Racine, but he
beats the runner nonetheless, then veers off to continue
his business.

Racine pulls up, breathing hard. He walks it off a bit,
watching the boat, then turns and starts walking back
along the pier. He reaches into the waistband of his
shorts and takes out a pack of cigarettes.

INT. RACINE'S OFFICE - DAY

Racine is behind the desk. Occupying the two seats in
front are a married couple rapidly approaching divorce.
They are arguing now, each trying to convince Racine of
their view. Racine nods occasionally, looking from one
to the other. But he is also looking between them, through
the open door out to the reception room, where his
secretary Beverly is kneeling before the lowest drawer of
a filing cabinet. Her back is turned and her jeans are
tight across the bottom. There's nothing especially
provocative about her pose. She's just there. Working
away.

Racine walks across his office and closes the door.   He
goes back to his seat. The couple continues.

EXT. THE BAND SHELL - NIGHT

Another concert going on, a trio   of musicians. Racine
moves down the sidewalk away from   the audience. He looks
around as he lights a cigarette.    She is nowhere in sight.
Racine opens the door to his car,   a nicked-up red '64
Stingray.

EXT. PINEHAVEN - DAY

Racine drives past a neat sign --

"You are entering
PINEHAVEN
Please drive carefully"

There's money here. Many of the homes are not visible
from the street -- only their gates announce their
presence. Those that can be seen are sprawling and lavish.
The Waterway appears to the left. A large white yacht
cruises slowly by.

INT. RACINE'S APARTMENT - DAY

Racine sits in bed smoking a cigarette. At the mirror, a
Nurse in a fresh white uniform steps into her white shoes
and begins attaching her cap with bobby pins.

INT. COCKTAIL LOUNGE - PINEHAVEN - NIGHT

Dark. Almost classy. The place is half full. Matty is
drinking at the end of the bar, her cigarettes next to
her glass. The bar chairs near her are empty.

Racine comes in, looks around, walks over and sits in the
seat next to her. She looks up, surprised.

                         MATTY
          Look who's here. Isn't this a
          coincidence?

Racine looks at her, almost as though he can't place her.
But he doesn't push that effect hard. He lights a
cigarette.

                          RACINE
          I know you.

                         MATTY
          You're the one that doesn't want to
          talk about the heat. Too bad. I'd
          tell you about my chimes.

                         RACINE
          What about them?

                         MATTY
          The wind chimes on my porch. They
          keep ringing and I go out there
          expecting a cool breeze. That's
          what they've always meant. But not
          this summer, This summer it's just
          hot air.

                         RACINE
          Do I remind you of hot air?

The Bartender has come up.

                         RACINE
          Bourbon, any kind, on the rocks.
                 (to Matty)
          Another?

She thinks, then nods her agreement.    The Bartender moves
away.

                         MATTY
          What are you doing in Pinehaven?

                         RACINE
          I'm no yokel. Why, I was all the
          way to Miami once.

                         MATTY
          There are some men, once they get a
          whiff of it, they'll trail you like
          a hound.

The Bartender brings their drinks and leaves.

                         RACINE
          I'm not that eager.

                         MATTY
          What is your name, anyway?

                         RACINE
                 (offers his hand)
          Ned Racine.

                          MATTY
          Matty Walker.

She takes his hand and shakes it. Racine reacts strangely
to her touch and doesn't let go right away. She gently
frees it, then refers to his look as she picks up her
drink --

                         RACINE
          Are you all right?

                          MATTY
                 (laughs)
          Yes. My temperature runs a couple
          degrees high. Around 100 all the
          time I don't mind it. It's the engine
          or something.

                         RACINE
          Maybe you need a tune-up.

                         MATTY
          Don't tell me -- you have just the
          right tool.

                         RACINE
          I don't talk that way.

                         MATTY
          How'd you find me, Ned?

Racine gives her a look.

                         RACINE
          This is the only joint in Pinehaven.

                         MATTY
          How'd you know I drink?

                         RACINE
          You seemed like a woman with all the
          vices.

                          MATTY
                 (smiles)
          You shouldn't have come. You're
          going to be disappointed.

Racine looks out over his drink.    Several of the Men in
the place are looking at them.

                         RACINE
                 (referring to the
                  men)
          What'd I do?

                         MATTY
                 (indicating Racine's
                  chair)
          A lot of them have tried that seat.
          You're the first one I've let stay.

                         RACINE
                 (spotting a few
                  more)
          You must come here a lot.

                         MATTY
          Most men are little boys.

                         RACINE
          Maybe you should drink at home.

                           MATTY
          Too quiet.

                         RACINE
          Maybe you shouldn't dress like that.

                         MATTY
          This is a blouse and a skirt. I
          don't know what you're talking about.

                         RACINE
          You shouldn't wear that body.

Natty leans back in her seat and glances down at herself.
She's magnificent.

                         MATTY
          I don't like my body much.   It's
          never been right.

Racine has been looking at her body too. With her line,
he just laughs. Matty watches him, then leans over her
drink. Her tone is different.

                         MATTY
          Sometimes, I don't know. I get so
          sick of everything, I'm not sure I
          care anymore. Do you know what I
          mean, Ned?

                         RACINE
                 (he's not sure)
          I know that sometimes the shit comes
          down SO heavy I feel like I should
          wear a hat.

Matty laughs, studies him.

                         MATTY
          Yeah, that's what I mean.

Ratty drains her glass and stubs out her cigarette.

                          MATTY
          I think I'll get out of here now.
          I'm going home.

                           RACINE
          I'll take you.

                           MATTY
          I have a car.

                         RACINE
          I'll follow you. I want to see the
          chimes.

                         MATTY
          You want to see the chimes.

                         RACINE
          I want to hear them.

She looks at him a long time.

                          MATTY
          That's all.   If I let you, that's
          all.

                         RACINE
                 (gestures his
                  innocence)
          I'm not looking for trouble.

                         MATTY
                 (very serious)
          I mean it. I like you.    But my life
          is complicated enough.

Racine again accepts.

                         MATTY
          This is my community bar. I might
          have to come here with my husband
          some time. Would you leave before
          me?  Wait in your car? I know it
          seems silly...

                         RACINE
          I don't know who we're going to fool.
          You've been pretty friendly.

She gives him a look and then slaps him hard!     Everyone
turns toward them.

                         MATTY
                 (steadily)
          Now leave me alone.

She stands up, takes her purse and her cigarettes, and
walks to the other end of the bar, where she sits down.
Racine watches her with amazed eyes. He stands up and
throws some money on the bar.

                         RACINE
                 (angry)
          Lady, you must be some kind of crazy!

He stalks out of the bar.

INT. RACINE'S CAR - NIGHT

CLOSE on his face as he drives. His look is intense,
expectant. He's feeling lucky as he watches up ahead.

RACINE'S POV out the windshield. Matty's shiny Mercedes
450 SEL is gliding down the road ahead of him. She puts
on the blinker, slows and turns into a gated drive. The
drive is canopied by heavy trees, the vegetation crowding
the road with a primeval lushness. The headlights create
sinuous welcoming shadows. It is as though Racine were
entering some separate, parallel, jungle world. Eventually
the house comes into view.

                            RACINE (O.S.)
          Jesus.

Matty's car swings around in the parking area and stops.
Racine pulls the Stingray up next to it, facing the other
way. He watches Matty slide her long legs out of the
car. She glances at Racine and for an instant there is a
hint of self-consciousness under the weight of his gaze.
We begin to HEAR the soft tinkling of chimes.

EXT. THE WALKER HOUSE - FRONT TERRACE - NIGHT

Racine follows closely behind Matty as they go up the
stairs. At the door, Matty turns suddenly and looks at
Racine.

                         MATTY
          Remember your promise.

Racine agrees. Matty looks him over a moment, then turns
to unlock the door.

INT. ENTRY HALL/SECOND FLOOR HALL - NIGHT

Matty comes in and puts her purse on a hall table as Racine
moves forward to look around. Despite the night gloom,
it's clear the place is expensively decorated in a manner
entirely consistent with the exterior of the house. Fine
antiques, carefully chosen fabrics, and a meticulous
selection of accessories have given the place the look of
an affluent home of Thirties America. And yet the overall
effect is almost contemporary, so burnished are the woods,
so fresh all the elements. It works.

                         RACINE
          Just like my place.

Matty gives him a searching look, then      leads   him up the
stairs, flipping on only an occasional      light   in their
path. In the second floor hall, Matty       moves   to the front
of the house. Racine glances into the       gloom   that hides
Matty's bedroom.

                           RACINE
          No help?

                         MATTY
          She goes home nights.

                         RACINE
          You're not nervous alone?

Matty pauses at the doors to the porch, unlocking them,
and looks at Racine as though she barely understands the
question.

                           MATTY
          No.

EXT. SECOND FLOOR PORCH - NIGHT

The TINKLING is distinct out here. Matty and Racine come
out onto the porch. There are about thirty wind chimes
of various, lovely designs -- crystal, metal, wood hanging
at intervals from the rim of the wide porch awning,
completely encircling Matty and Racine.

Halfway down the long lawn is a white gazebo. Beyond it,
the waterway is shimmering in the moonlight. At the edge
of the water is a small boat house.

Racine walks along under the chimes, looking up at them.
A smile plays across her face. He looks back at Matty,

                         RACINE
          You do have chimes.

He looks out at the boat house.

                           RACINE
          What's that?

                           MATTY
          A gazebo

                           RACINE
          No, out there.

                           MATTY
          Boat house.

                         RACINE
          What is in there?

                           MATTY
          Boat.

Racine moves back and stands very close to her. He looks
at her in the moonlight, but she concentrates on the
distant water.

                         MATTY
          It's a mess. There's a row boat, a
          lot of lounge chairs... things like
          that.

Racine puts his hand up under her hair, on her nape. She
closes her eyes at his touch, then moves away, as though
by an act, of will, to the door, half opening it.

                         MATTY
          I think you should go now.

                         RACINE
          I just got here.

                         MATTY
          You've seen them. Please go.

Racine steps toward her, but she ducks inside and moves
through the intermittent light of the hall and down the
steps. Racine follows her.

INT. ENTRY HALL

Matty stops at the entry hall, leaning against the wall.

                         RACINE
          You didn't bring me here to see your
          wind chimes.

He puts an arm on each side of her, caging her against
the wall. She looks up at him.

                         MATTY
          Yes, I did. I said what I meant.
          Do you ever do that?

                            RACINE
          No.     not very often.

He kisses her light on the forehead.   Again she reacts,
but fights it.

                         RACINE
          I don't think you want me to go.

                            MATTY
          Yes... Please.

He kisses her lightly on the nose.

                         RACINE
          There's nothing to be afraid of.

                         MATTY
          There is for me.

Matty slips under his arms and quickly steps out the front
door. She stands just outside watching him. Racine shakes
his head, goes out there.

EXT. FRONT TERRACE - NIGHT

Racine stops next to Matty.    She doesn't move away.

                         MATTY
          Thank you. I'm sorry, I shouldn't
          have lot you come.

Racine looks at her a long time.

                         RACINE
          You're not so tough after all, are
          you?

                           MATTY
          No...    I'm weak.

She kisses him on the lips and steps quickly inside the
front door. She closes it, looks through the window at
him, then moves away.

EXT. PARKING AREA - NIGHT

Racine stands looking at   the door a  few moments. Then he
walks to his car. Again    he stops.   He looks back at the
house. The wind picks up    a bit and  the TINKLING of the
wind chimes gets louder.    And then  louder.

Racine goes back up onto the porch fast.    He goes to the
front door and looks through the window.

EXT. FRONT TERRACE - NIGHT

RACINE'S POV. Matty is standing at the bottom of the
stairs in the hall. She is looking directly at the front
door. Frozen in the spot.

Racine tries the door. It's locked. He shakes it hard,
but it's solid. He looks to his left. There are windows
down the wall there. He moves to them. They go into the
living room but their shutters are closed. He looks
through a broken slat at Matty, who watches him from the
same spot, through the living room door. Racine tries
them. They won't budge. Racine moves to his right past
the front door, to the windows off the dining room. He
pushes at them as his eyes lock with Matty, who watches
from the hall. The windows won't move, Racine spins and
picks up the nearest object, a wooden rocking chair. He
lifts it, turns and smashes the big window. Glass showers
into the dining room.

Matty watches.    She hasn't moved.

Racine pushes the broken window out of his way.    He comes
in, like a violent gust of wind.

INT. HALL

Racine crosses the dark living room  fast. As he reaches
Matty, she lifts her arms to match  his embrace. They
come together hard and tight. They   kiss. And kiss again.
Her hands travel over his body, as  though she's wanted
them there for a long time.

They turn once slowly along the wall, into the dimness of
the central hall. Then he rotates her body away from
him, holding her close.

                           MATTY
            Yes, yes...

Then she is just nodding. Racine puts his face deep into
her hair, closing his eyes as the smell of her washes
over him.

Matty turns in his arms and kisses him hard.    Racine pulls
her close to him and they sink to the floor.

                           RACINE
            That's right... that's right.

CLOSE ON Matty's face, a look that might be anguish. She
bites her lip in expectation. Racine moves over her.

                           MATTY
            Please, please ...

She pulls him tightly to her, clinging like a drowning
woman.

                                               DISSOLVE TO:

INT. MATTY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Racine and Matty lie under a sheet on her big bed.    Her
eyes are closed. There are more wind chimes on the    second
floor of the verandah, which is off this room, and   Racine
is listening to their TINKLING. Racine looks over    in
that direction.

RACINE'S POV. The moonlit, sheer white curtains on the
window roil to a light breeze. Racine's gaze travels
over the luxurious bedroom; here too, it is in the Thirties
style. Their clothes are haphazardly thrown across a
divan and on the floor nearby. A delicate fern sways in
the wind. Finally, he is looking at a lovely writing
desk against the far wall. Some tissue-thin stationery
flaps in the breeze, kept in place by the weight of a
pen. Then, as he looks, the paper stops flapping and the
chimes gradually STOP TINKLING. Racine looks toward the
window. It is still open, but the air had died.

The curtains hang still.

Racine's face.   The world has stopped.

                          MATTY (O.S.)
                 (softly)
          I didn't want this to happen. But I
          didn't try hard enough to stop it...
          Because I wanted you. I wanted you
          here, like this ... This is bad for
          me. I know it. Now nothing's going
          to be the same anymore.

FROM ABOVE THEM, we see them framed by the bed.

EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF WALKER HOUSE - DAY

Near the front gate of  the Walker place, a heavyset, middle-
aged woman, BETTY, THE  WALKER'S HOUSEKEEPER, has been
waiting on a bus stop  bench. Now she lifts her tired
body to board a public  bus.

Down the Street, just around a corner, Racine watches her
go. He puts the Stingray in gear and drives to the
Walkers.

EXT. WALKERS' BOAT HOUSE - SUNSET

Lights are going on across the waterway, sending shimmers
toward the boat house.

INT. WALKERS' BOAT HOUSE - SUNSET

We're looking out a dusty window at the waterway. We
HEAR Racine and Matty disentangle and roll apart o.s.,
Racine grunting his exhaustion. After a moment, Racine
rises up into frame, looking happy. He looks down to
where he was and rests against the wall.

                         RACINE
          I like this place. It's got a nice
          feel.

                         MATTY (O.S.)
          You were on top.

                         RACINE
          So it could use a better mattress.
          See to it, will you?

                           MATTY (O.S.)
          Yes sir.

Racine turns and stares out at the ocean. Matty rises up
behind and hugs him from the back. She kisses his shoulder
blades and presses her cheek against his spine.

                         RACINE
                 (reacting)
          Hey, gimme a break here.    It takes a
          little while.

                          MATTY
                 (ignoring him,
                  laughs)
          It's your fault.

                         RACINE
                 (smiling)
          It takes me a good thirty seconds.

                           MATTY
          Are you sure?    I just want to make
          sure here.

She pulls him down.

On the lounge cushions that are spread across the floor,
Matty rolls on top of Racine. Racine reacts with
exaggerated pain to the roughness of the cushions.

                         RACINE
          Jesus, I think you're right --
                 (he rolls over her)
          -- you better be on the bottom.

                         MATTY
          No, you misunderstood --
                 (she rolls over
                  him)
          -- this is my new saddle, and I just
          want to --

                          RACINE
          Wow!   No, I must object --

Laughing, they roll again and we're on Racine's face as

Racine's face; he is still rolling, but he is alone. He
has just rolled off the bed. He lies there like a dead
man.

                    (finally, breathless)

Racine is at the sink, having just washed his tired face.
He opens the medicine cabinet and looks at all the

toiletries of Matty's husband. He selects a cologne, is
impressed by its expensive look, and slaps a little on
his jaw.  He doesn't like the smell. He closes the cabinet
and moves back into the bedroom.

INT. MATTY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Matty, wrapped in a thin white terrycloth robe, is
stripping the bed of its sheets. Racine watches from
across the room.

                            RACINE
             What are you doing?

                            MATTY
             I've got to wash these.

                            RACINE
             You're afraid of your maid?

                            MATTY
             That's right. My mother told me
             "knowledge is power."

                            RACINE
             This is an interesting interpretation.
             Is that why you've started smoking
             my brand?

Matty straightens with an armload of sheets.

                            MATTY
             No one must know. Promise me, Ned.
             No one.

He promise with a gesture.

INT. RACINE'S APARTMENT - DAWN

Racine comes in, beat. He throws his jacket across a
chair. Out the windows to the porch, the sun is rising
out of the Atlantic. Racine goes there and closes the
curtains. In the gloom he walks to his bed and sits on
the edge, kicking off his shoes. He picks up his alarm
clock and begins setting it.

EXT. WALKER HOUSE - LAWN/GAZEBO - NIGHT

Racine has just parked his car and is walking back across
the lawn. Matty is standing in the gazebo, her back
turned, looking out at the Waterway.

She is dressed in white and from here she looks very much
as she did when they first met. There are wind chimes
hanging from the gazebo.

                            RACINE
             Hey, lady, wanna make love?

    Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org              26.


The lady in question turns around, surprised. It is not
Matty at all. It is MARY ANN. She's attractive, but a
little cheap-looking. She looks him over.

                         MARY ANN
          I don't know. Maybe This sure is a
          friendly town.

Racine is nonplussed.   He doesn't know what to do.

                          RACINE
          I'm sorry.

                         MARY ANN
                 (mock hurt feelings)
          You are? You mean the offers no
          good?

Racine comes up on the porch.

                         RACINE
          I feel like a jerk.

Mary Ann gives him a salacious smile.

                          MARY ANN
          Maybe you were supposed to deliver
          it next door?
                 (a beat)
          You must be looking for the lady of
          the house.

Unbeknownst to either of them, Matty has been watching
from the lawn. Now she moves up into the gazebo. In her
right hand she has an envelope, well-filled and sealed.

EXT. INTERSECTION

A block away from the station, the patrol car races toward
an intersection. Suddenly, a WOMAN steps into the street,
pushing a baby buggy. Pat slams on the brakes, and the
car skids sideways toward the intersection, where it rocks
onto two wheels and stops just a few yards short of the
buggy. Sam sticks his head out the window.

                          SAM
          Are you crazy, lady?     Didn't you
          hear the siren?

The woman dives to the ground as the BABY sits up in the
buggy -- he is a midget with a cigar in his mouth and a
tommy gun in his hands. Pat jerks Sam to the floor just
as the midget opens fire.

The midget riddles the car with bullets. Headlights
explode, windows are smashed, the grill is torn to shreds,
and steam mushrooms into the air.

All four tires are flattened, a bumper is sheared off,
and still the blasting goes on.

There's almost nothing left of the patrol car as a dark
sedan wheels into the intersection to pick up the woman
and the midget. The sedan speeds away, and Pat and Sam
climb out of the rubble, unhurt but very shaken.

                                                 CUT TO:

INT. TRACY'S CAR

Siren off, Tracy cuts the motor and silently glides into
Cullen Park, stopping just under a low-hanging weeping
willow.

EXT. BOATHOUSE

Approaching the boathouse carefully, Tracy takes out his
pistol. The front door is ajar. Tracy pushes it, and it
creaks open. He enters cautiously.

INT. BOATHOUSE

The boathouse is dark, lit only by moonlight and park
lights that shine through the windows. Tensely, Tracy
listens for sounds, then moves very carefully past stacked
up rowboats and canoes.

Traced against a window at the far end of the boathouse,
Tracy sees the silhouette of a man. Gripping his pistol,
he moves silently toward that silhouette, closing in on
it while keeping alert for movement.

                         MATTY
          Ned, this is Mary Ann.

Matty hands the envelope to Mary Ann, who puts it in her
purse.

                         MARY ANN
                 (smiling)
          We were just meeting. Ned made me
          feel very welcome.

                         RACINE
          I'm an idiot. Nice to meet you.
          Are you staying in town?

                         MARY ANN
          No, no, just passing through. Nice
          area. A little hot for my tastes.

                          RACINE
          It's unusual.   We're famous for our
          cool breezes.

There is a pregnant pause as Mary Ann looks him over,
fighting some private amusement.

                         MATTY
                 (to Mary Ann)
          Do you want to stay for dinner?

                         MARY ANN
                 (negative)
          Got to go, got to go.

She pecks Matty on the cheek, then steps close to Racine
to shake his hand.

                         MARY ANN
          You two have fun now.

She's smiling as she leaves the gazebo and walks across
the lawn. Matty  takes Racine's arm as they watch Mary
Ann get into her little sports car, which has been pulled
up close to the house. She pulls out waving.

                         RACINE
          I didn't see her car. I'm sorry.    I
          got to be more careful.

Matty turns to him and puts her arms around his neck.

                         MATTY
          Mary Ann's an old friend. She's
          like a sister to me. She wants me
          to be happy.

EXT. LAWN/LAGOONS - WALKER HOUSE - NIGHT

Matty's Mercedes has been pulled out onto lawn next to
the lagoons which border the grass.  Racine and Matty can
be seen, intermittently rising into view in the back seat,
grappling, then disappearing again.  Matty is giggling.

                         RACINE (O.S.)
                 (not in a jovial
                  mood)
          You know, this has never been one of
          my pleasures. Car. I considered
          the time I spent making it --
                 (grunts, sits up)
          -- like this ... penance for some
          sin.

                         MATTY (O.S.)
          What sin?

                         RACINE
          I never knew. Maybe worshipping
          women instead of God. But it never
          did anything for me.

                  head)

          No.

                         MATTY (O.S.)

Matty rises up, wraps her arms around his neck and kisses
him deeply. She pulls him out of sight.

INT. MASTER BATHROOM

Racine and Matty lie together in the full bathtub. On
the floor beside the tub is the container that catches
the ice from a refrigerator's automatic icemaker.

                         RACINE
          You're killing me.

                         MATTY
          Is there any more ice?   I'm burning
          up.

Racine gropes for the ice container and dumps the remaining
ice cubs Into the tub with them. Matty snatches one out
of the water and holds it to her forehead.

                         MATTY
          He's coming up tomorrow.

Racine knows.

                         MATTY
          I can't stand the thought of him...
          He's small and mean... and weak.

Racine watches some water run through his fingers. He
cradles her head in an embrace that has nothing to do
with sex. She looks sad.

EXT. GROUNDS - WALKER'S PLACE -- NIGHT

The Middle of the Night. A light FOG has rolled in.
Racine is walking slowly through the shadows of the heavy
foliage. He stops beside a rubber tree.

RACINE'S POV. The Walker House. In front sits a huge
white Cadillac. All the lights in the house are out.
The wind chimes TINKLE softly.

Racine lights a cigarette.

INT. RACINE'S OFFICE - DAY

Racine stands at the window staring down at the busy Main
Street. He is far away.

INT. ENTRY HALL - WALKER HOUSE - NIGHT

Racine has just entered.   Matty is calling from somewhere
out of sight.

                         MATTY (O.S.)
          Just do what I say! Go into the
          living room.

                         RACINE
          Come on! It's been three days.      I
          want to see you --

                         MATTY (O.S.)
          I'm going to make it up to you
          tonight. But you must behave.      Now
          go!

                          RACINE
          I'm going.   I'm going.

INT. LIVING ROOM

Racine goes into the living room and sits down on the
couch.

                           RACINE
          I'm here.

                           MATTY (O.S.)
          Good.

Matty comes in carrying a tray with two drinks on it.
And she is dressed in the uniform of an airline stewardess,
complete all the way to her little cap. She cannot keep
a straight face, despite her efforts. Racine begins to
laugh.

She hands him a drink, but he takes it and the tray and
puts them on the floor. He pulls her down across his
lap. They are both laughing hard. He kisses her.

          You don't like it? I thought you
          went for this stuff.

He pushes her back across the sofa.

                           MATTY
          Wait ...   wait ... I want to tell you
          about the   thing... the thing that
          will drop   from the ceiling... in
          case the   cabin suddenly depressurizes --
          oho...

EXT. DRIVING RANGE - NIGHT

A dozen Golfers are practicing, spotted along the  row of
hitting pads under floodlights. Most are drenched   with
sweat from their exertion in the muggy air. Their   randomly
timed swings send streaking white bullets into the
darkness. But what is hypnotic, what so captures   a hot
night in sound, is the irregular CRACKING of clubs  meeting
balls: CRACK, CRACK-CRACK-CRACK, CRACK-CRACK!

In the darkness of the overlooking parking lot, behind a
high fence, sits the Stingray, with Racine in the driver's
seat and Matty close beside him. They sit in silence.

                         MATTY
                 (finally)
          What are we doing here?

                               RACINE
                    (hushed)
          Listen!
                 (CRACK, CRACK)
          I love that sound.

Matty listens, but her eyes are on Racine.

                         MATTY
          I want to be in bed.

                         RACINE
          Is that all you ever think about?

Racine watches the Golfers, listening intently.    Then he
sees that Matty is crying. He comforts her.

                          RACINE
          Hey!   I'm kidding.

Matty looks straight ahead and her tone is somber.

                         MATTY
          Yes ... that's all I ever think about
          ... You and me. Your body near mine,
          close. I'm not right when you're
          not with me. I get the shakes. And
          each time, when I first see you, I
          shake even more. For a while. And
          then I get calm. I feel safe ...
          I've never been this way. I can't
          remember how I lived before.

He knows it's true. It's the same for him. He wipes her
cheeks with his hand. CRACK, CRACK-CRACK, CRACK.

EXT./INT. WALKER HOUSE (SERIES OF SHOTS) - NIGHT

WATERWAY/BOAT HOUSE -- The water laps against the pier.
Gently. The quiet sound almost overpowered by the
insistent buzz of the night insects. The CAMERA MOVES
toward the house.

LAGOON/GAZEBO -- A giant palmetto bug leaps from a lily
pad into the water, creating a tiny ripple. The CAMERA
MOVES toward the house.

STAIRWELL/HALLWAY -- Quiet and dark. The CAMERA MOVES
along the shiny white posts of the stairs. Upward.

INT. MATTY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Racine and Matty are in bed. Matty is sound asleep, her
back close to Racine. But he is not asleep. He is propped
up, looking down at her. We've never seen his face like
this before. Never this open, never so much in repose.
She stirs, and then is still again. He touches her hair
lightly. She sleeps.

INT. STELLA'S COFFEE SHOP - DAY

Same courthouse/cop crowd as before. Racine finishes a
sandwich at a table as Lowenstein sits down with two tall
glasses of iced coffee, both of which he drinks down.

                         RACINE
          You look terrible. Don't you sleep?

                         LOWENSTEIN
          I had a dream last night that was so
          boring it woke me up. I was afraid
          to go back to sleep. Where the hell
          have you been?

                         RACINE
          What do you mean, I been around.

                         LOWENSTEIN
          I've barely seen you for a month.
          Wait a minute -- it's some new quiff,
          isn't it? What's wrong with me.

Racine dismisses this with a gesture.

                         LOWENSTEIN
          You've never been shy about that
          stuff.

At this moment, DETECTIVE OSCAR GRACE, a   big, powerful
black man comes in. He's a plainclothes    cop in shirt
sleeves, his jacket in his hand. As he    passes Racine on
his way to the third seat at the table,   he squeezes
Racine's shoulders with his huge hands,   by way of greeting.

                         RACINE
          Oscar.

                        GRACE
          Hey. You weren't at the Y last week.
          We lost.

                         LOWENSTEIN
                 (about Racine)
          He's getting discreet. I can't
          believe it.

Stella comes over.

                         GRACE
          Whatcha got in pie today, Stella?

                         STELLA
                 (glancing behind
                  her)
          Cherry, cherry... and cherry.

                         GRACE
          What do you recommend?

                         STELLA
          I like the cherry.

          Bring it on.   And a gigantic Coke.

                         LOWENSTEIN
          I'm really disappointed, Racine.
          I've been living vicariously off you
          for years. If you shut up on me,
          I'll have just my wife.

                         RACINE
          There's nothing to tell.   I lead a
          lonely life.

                        GRACE
          Right. And it's gonna snow later
          today --

                         LOWENSTEIN
          ... And people are basically decent..
                 (looking around
                  the restaurant)
          ... Must be someone I know. Let's
          see -- someone in uniform...

Grace laughs. Racine shakes his head in mock exasperation.

                         LOWENSTEIN
          ...no Army personnel around.
          Waitress... Could it be...
                 (like Brando in
                  "Streetcar," but
                  soft)
          ...Stella!

Stella arrives with Grace's order. Lowenstein looks her
over as a possible for Racine, but shakes his head. Stella
lingers. Lowenstein spots someone, speaks to Racine in a
loud, excited whisper.

                         LOWENSTEIN
          I know, I know -- you finally got to
          Glenda.

Across the restaurant, GLENDA, a Meter Maid, is talking
with some other women.

                         LOWENSTEIN
          How was it? Did she let you into the
          no parking zone?

                         STELLA
          I'll have you know Glenda is seriously
          involved with a narc from Palm Beach.

                         RACINE
                 (smiling his
                  innocence)
          There you are.

                         LOWENSTEIN
          A narc from Palm Beach? Is that his
          hobby?

                         RACINE
          How's the cop business, Oscar?

                         GRACE
          Real good. Always starts hoppin' in
          weather like this. When it gets hot,
          people try to kill each other.

                         STELLA
          It's true. I could tell you some
          people who'll be dead if we don't
          get a break soon.

She leaves.   The three men exchange amused looks.

                         GRACE
          We've got more of everything bad
          since the wave started. It's the
          crisis atmosphere. People dress
          different, feel different, sweat
          more. They wake up cranky and they
          never recover. Look at Lowenstein.
                 (a flash of smile)
          Things are just a little askew. Pretty
          soon people think the old rules aren't
          in effect. They start breaking them.
          Figure no one'll care, cause it's
          emergency time... time out.

He takes a big bite of pie.

                         LOWENSTEIN
          Oscar, I just don't understand how
          you could be doing advanced
          theoretical thinking like that and
          still be stuck working in our little
          town.

                         GRACE
                 (good-humored)
          Lowenstein dreams of bigger things.

                         LOWENSTEIN
          Assistant County Prosecutor isn't
          the end for me, fellows.

          Hell, no. Someday -- Deputy County
          Prosecutor.

          my future in this state will be
          unlimited.

Glenda the Meter Maid passes their table on her way out.
She has eyes only for Racine.

                         GLENDA
          Hello, Ned.

                         RACINE
          Hi, Glenda.

She goes out. Lowenstein and Grace look at Racine, then
at each other. Grace smiles hugely.

EXT. LIGHTHOUSE/SAND DUNES - NIGHT

The big beacon turns in the distance, throwing an
intermittent bridge of light across the water toward us.

The undulating dunes stretch off as far as we can see.
Racine's Stingray is parked on the dirt access road. Below
it, Racine and Matty sit close in the warm sand.

                         MATTY
          Don't say it, if you don't mean it.
          Please, Ned, don't.

                         RACINE
          I do. I want you with me.

She looks at him a long time. There is real joy in her
face. And tears in her eyes. We're very close to those
eyes as she wipes the tears away. Racine puts an arm around
her. She looks out at the lighthouse.

                         MATTY
          I'm going to tell Edmund I want a
          divorce. I won't stay any longer. I
          would have, if you hadn't come along.
          The life is comfortable. I was
          willing to go on. But you've reminded
          me of what it can be... I know now
          that these last three years I've
          been living half a life. It's my
          fault, I don't deny it. You have to
          let yourself be bought. I did. I
          let it happen. I've lived so much of
          my life with nothing. When you have
          no money, you have no choices. I
          don't care what they say -- money is
          freedom. That's something they don't
          teach you in school. But I found
          out. And when Edmund came along when
          I saw a chance to stop struggling I
          took it. I'm not ashamed.

          He got   what he wanted... he has a
          knack   for that. But no more. I'm
          ready   to walk away from the money.
          I have   to be with you.

                         RACINE
                 (kisses her, smiles)
          It is conceivable I'll make a buck
          someday.

                         MATTY
                 (hugs him closer)
          Oh, I know you will, darling. I didn't
          mean that. I know you will. But it
          doesn't matter. It's you I want.
          That's all.

                         RACINE
          Anyway, you'll come out all right.

                            MATTY
          Of the divorce?

                           RACINE
          Yeah.    He's ripe.

Matty is silent for a long beat.

                          MATTY
          No.   I signed a pre-nuptial agreement.

                            RACINE
          What?

                         MATTY
          He insisted. He blamed it on his
          sister Roz -- she's always hated me --
          but I know he wanted it too.

                            RACINE
          How is it?

                         MATTY
          Bad. I get some money for a year.
          Not much. That's it. But I don't
          care, Ned. Not if I can be with you.

She searches his face, almost frightened.

                         MATTY
          Does it matter, Ned? Tell me the
          truth please. I'll understand, I
          swear to you.

                         RACINE
          The truth? I wish you were going to
          be loaded. Does it matter? No. No.

They kiss.

                            MATTY
             God, you've made me happy.
                    (she pulls away)
             It's time for your present.

She jumps up and runs back to the car. Racine walks back
there as Matty takes a wrapped package out of the car.
She hands it to Racine, who leans against the car to unwrap
it.

                            MATTY
             From now on, when it starts coming
             down on you, I'll be there to protect
             you.

Racine opens the box and smiles broadly. It is a hat a
fedora in the classic style.

                            MATTY
             Put it on! I'll bet I guessed the
             size right.

Racine puts on the fedora. It fits. He looks simultaneously
old-fashioned, a visitor from the Forties, and also very
chic, a present-day fashion plate. But most of all, he
looks exactly right. Matty squeals in glee at the sight.

                              MATTY
             I love it.

                              RACINE
             I want to see.

Racine tries to see his reflection in the car's side view
mirror but he has trouble. Matty, very animated in her
delight, steps up and kisses him quickly.

                            MATTY
             Look in my eyes. Can you see yourself?

Racine tries for a moment, then gives up with a laugh.

                              MATTY
             Here!

Matty opens the door of the Stingray and sits in the
passenger seat with her legs out. She rolls up the window
in that door as Racine stands before it. The glass capture
the moonlight to make a perfect mirror. As the window
goes up, Racine's reflection appears on the glass, posing
in his hat. At the same time, Matty's face disappears
from view.

INT. RACINE'S OFFICE - DAY

Racine lies on the couch. He spins the fedora Matty gave
him on his finger, Beverly comes up and leans against the
doorjamb. She's wearing a tee-shirt and tight slacks; she
looks good. She watches him for a moment.

                         BEVERLY
          Big weekend planned?

                         RACINE
          Nope, Small weekend. Tiny little
          weekend.

                         BEVERLY
          There's jazz tonight at the beach...
          if you're not doing anything...

                         RACINE
          Beverly, do yourself a big favor and
          forget it.

                         BEVERLY
          Forget what?

                         RACINE
          Whatever you're thinking.

She shrugs.. She turns back to her desk, unconvinced.

INT. BAR - NIGHT

Busy weekend crowd. Racine sits drinking alone at the
bar. He signals for another.

EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF WALKER PLACE - NIGHT

Racine drives slowly by, head craning to peer into the
darkness. We begin to HEAR the thumping again --

EXT. THE PIER - DAY

Racine has been running. Walking now,  breathing hard, he
takes his cigarettes from his shorts.  At the end of the
pier he folds his body over the rail  so that it looks as
though he will topple over the edge.  But he does not; he
lights up and looks down there.

RACINE'S POV. The water following against the thick
pilings. Then, TILTING UP, UP, AND OVER, past the ocean's
horizon to the perfect blue sky, which fills the screen.

Racine is looking straight up, blowing his own clouds.

INT. RACINE'S APARTMENT - DAY

Racine lies smoking in bed, bathed in sweat, a beer nearby.
A fan is pointed at him, but it's blowing hot air. He
looks at the telephone.

EXT. PORCH OF RACINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Fog. Thick and heavy. Racine's cigarette glows in it as
he sits in the gray limbo. The phone in the apartment
RINGS.

INT. RACINE'S APARTMENT

Racine comes in from the porch and picks up the phone.

                            RACINE
             Yeah.

                            MATTY

             Come to me.

                     pause)
             No... I couldn't.

Racine's face relaxes. He looks relieved.

                            RACINE
             Okay, I'm coming.

EXT. SECOND FLOOR PORCH - WALKER PLACE - NIGHT

Same thick fog. The wind chimes TINKLE softly. Light
seeps out from Matty's bedroom windows, half-revealing
Racine and Matty lying together on a lounge. Matty is in
her white terrycloth robe, Racine just shorts.

                            RACINE
             How do you know?

                            MATTY
             I saw the will once. He showed it
             to me. He was trying to prove
             something ... how much he loved me
             or something.

                            RACINE
             How'd he get so fat?

                        MATTY
         The stock market, investments, real
         estate. He doesn't tell me anything,
         but I've picked up a little. I know
         they own a lot of land along the
         shore here.

                           RACINE
         Who's "they"'

                        MATTY
                (she doesn't know)
         He's never introduced me to anyone.
         I'm not sure if they're all
         legitimate.

                        RACINE
                (snorts at the
                 odds of that)
         I wonder what they call themselves.
         Maybe I've heard of them.

                        MATTY
         They own that old place in Miranda
         Beach, The Breakers... I know that.

                        RACINE
                (surprised)
         The Breakers? I thought Hermie Fisher
         owned that land.

                         MATTY
                (shrugs)
         Edmund mentioned it once.

Racine lights another cigarette and gazes off into the
fog, thinking. Matty presses her cheek against his chest
and closes her eyes tight.

                        MATTY
         Ned, it scares me to talk about these
         things.

                           RACINE
         Why?

                           MATTY
         You know.

                           RACINE
         No.    I don't.

                        MATTY
         Let's just not, okay? Let's not
         think about all he's got.

                         RACINE
                 (pressing)
          What is it, Matty? Tell me exactly
          what frightens you.

                         MATTY
          I'm afraid... because when I think
          about it, I wish that he'd die. That's
          really what I want. It's horrible
          and ugly and It's what I most want.

Racine looks off into the night for a few beats, then he
lifts her face so he can look into her eyes.

                         RACINE
          That's where we're at, isn't it,
          Matty?

                         MATTY
          What do you mean?

                         RACINE
          That's what we're both thinking --
          how good it'd be for us if he were
          gone. It'd be real sweet for us.

                         MATTY
          Don't talk about it, Ned. Please
          don't. Talk is dangerous. Sometimes
          it makes things happen, it makes it
          real.

                         RACINE
          Don't let it scare you. Because he's
          not gonna die. There's nothing wrong
          with him, is there? There's no reason
          to think he's gonna die, is there?

Matty shakes her head "no," lays it in his chest again.

                         RACINE
          That's right. So we might as well
          forget about it, It's not gonna just
          happen to make things nice for us...
          It won't just happen.

Racine lifts her head and kisses her on the mouth.

                         MATTY
          I'm afraid, Ned.

                         RACINE
          Maybe that's a smart way to be now,
          Matty. Maybe we both should be.

Racine takes a last drag on his cigarette and flicks it
out into the fog,

                         RACINE
          The only thing wrong with your husband
          right now... is us.

INT. BAR - PAY PHONE AT BACK

Again, Racine is getting no answer.   He gives up, goes
back to his seat at the bar.

EXT. TELEPHONE BOOTH - MAIN STREET - DAY

Late afternoon. Racine, sportcoat slung over his shoulder,
listens to repeated ringing at the other end of his call.
He's surprised there's no answer. People drag by, making
their way home from work in the heat. Finally, Racine
hangs up.

Racine comes out of the phone booth. He has nowhere to
go. He ambles down the street. A few people say hello.
He walks diagonally across the street toward a restaurant
called "Tulio's."

INT. TULIO'S RESTAURANT - DUSK

The best restaurant in Miranda Beach. Racine slips on
his jacket as he comes in the door. He waves to the
Hostess across the dining room, indicating he'll be alone
tonight. She signals a short wait. He steps toward the
bar, bringing him suddenly face to face with Matty.

                          RACINE
          Well, well.   Hello to you --

The panic which shoots across her face, cuts him off in
mid-sentence, a split second before EDMUND WALKER appears
behind her. Matty's face goes calm and she smiles
politely.

                           MATTY
                   (to Racine)
          Hello.

She turns to her husband. He is not what Racine expected.
He may, in fact, be mean, as Matty described him, but he
looks neither small nor weak. A handsome man, he is bigger
than Racine and in terrific shape. Dressed in an expensive
summer suit, he radiates vigor and controlled physical
power. He wears sleek, metal-framed glasses.

                         MATTY
          Darling, I'd like you to meet Mr.
          Racine. I'm sorry. I don't know your
          first name.

                           RACINE
          Ned.

He offers his hand and Walker encloses it firmly in his.

                           WALKER
          Edmund Walker.    Nice to meet you.

                         MATTY
          Mr. Racine is the lawyer I told you
          about.
                 (Walker doesn't
                  remember)
          You remember. He had a client who
          wanted to buy the house. I told him
          we weren't selling.

                           WALKER
          Right.

                         RACINE
          That hasn't changed, has it?

                         WALKER
          No, we're very happy with it.

                          RACINE
                 (nods)
          I can understand that.    It's a
          terrific place.

Walker nods, looking at Racine carefully.    He motions
toward the dining room.

                         WALKER
          Are you going in?

                         RACINE
          I was just going to grab a bite.

                           WALKER
          Join us.

                         RACINE
          No. Thanks very much, but I don't
          want to interfere with --

The Hostess has come toward them.

                         WALKER
          Don't be silly. Come on.
                 (to Hostess)
          We have room for three, don't we?

The Hostess nods and leads the way. Walker gestures Matty
ahead, then puts a big hand behind Racine's elbow and
ushers him into the dining room.

                         WALKER
          I've heard this place is great. But
          you can't get near it on the weekends
          and I don't get down during the week
          much.

                            RACINE
          Is that right?

                                                  WIPE TO:

LATER

They have finished their salad at a table toward the back.
A Waiter comes and takes away their dishes. Walker has
taken off his glasses and is cleaning the lenses with a
lovely handkerchief. He does this cleaning with enormous
care and inordinate relish. His manner is a mix of gruff
charm and hinted menace. There's something dangerous
about the man and it's perfectly distilled in his smile,
which is quick, frequent and vaguely threatening.

                         WALKER
          I was a lawyer. Still am, I guess.
          But I don't practice. Went to
          Columbia. You?

                            RACINE
          F. S. U.

                            WALKER
                 (nods)
          Good school.  I got bored with it
          quick. I guess I didn't have the
          temperament.  I wanted to make the
          money faster.  Is there a living in
          it here?

                         RACINE
          I can afford to send my shirts out.
          And eat here once a month, if I don't
          order an appetizer.

Walker smiles, re-folds his handkerchief carefully and
puts it back in the cheat pocket of his jacket.

                         WALKER
          I figured an honest lawyer doesn't
          make much and the other kind was too
          slimy for me. I'd rather be upfront
          about shafting somebody.

                            MATTY
          Edmund, really.     It's Mr. Racine's
          profession.

                         RACINE
          That's all right. I don't like it
          much.

                         WALKER
          What's to like. That's the way of
          the world. Most people despise their
          jobs.

Walker picks up a wine bottle and pours more into each of
their glasses, emptying it.

                            RACINE
          Do you?

                            WALKER
          No. I love it.     But it's not a job.

                         RACINE
          What is it, exactly?

Walker signals to a distant Waiter for another bottle of
wine. He does it with a small flick of his finger.

                            WALKER
          Various things.     This and that.
          Here and there.

                         RACINE
          You don't have to be specific.

                         WALKER
                 (that smile again)
          Finance, basically. Venture capital,
          Investments, real estate. We're
          into a few things.

                          RACINE
          Yeah?   Around here?

                          WALKER
          Some.   We own some things here.

                         MATTY
          Edmund's company owns The Breakers.

                            RACINE
          Is that right?

For a second, Walker's eyes flick over Matty like a whip.

                         WALKER
          It's not that simple. We have an
          interest in a few places along the
          shore. For the land. You know.
          Someday. There's no explaining it
          to her.

                         MATTY
                 (to Racine)
          I'm too dumb. Woman, you know.

She picks up her purse and stands up with a good-humored
smile. The men rise.

                         MATTY
          I'll be right back.

Then maybe we can talk about pantyhose or something
interesting.

She walks away. Walker watches her go with a satisfied,
possessive grin. They sit.

                         WALKER
          She's something, isn't she?

                           RACINE
                 (nods)
          A lovely lady.

                         WALKER
          Yes, she is. I'm crazy about her.
          If I ever thought she was seeing
          another guy... I don't know.
                 (he takes a sip of
                  wine)
          I'd understand how it could happen.
          Her being the way she is. I'd
          understand it. But I think I'd kill
          the guy with my bare hands.

                         RACINE
          That's understanding.

Walker looks at Racine and laughs. As he begins to speak,
he focuses intently on Racine. He seems to be trying to
communicate something other than what he's saying.

                         WALKER
          You wouldn't believe the dorkus she
          was with when I met her. The guy
          came to us with a business
          proposition. We're always looking
          for opportunities. If the conditions
          are right. We're willing to take an
          occasional risk, if the downside
          isn't too steep. But this guy hadn't
          done his homework, he didn't know
          the bottom line. That's how I knew
          he was full of shit. You've got to
          know the bottom line. That's all
          that really counts.

Again Walker takes off his glasses. He holds them up to
the light and then rubs them again with his handkerchief.

                         WALKER
          He didn't have the goods,  this guy.
          He was like a lot of guys  you run
          into -- they want to get  rich, they
          want to do it quick, they  want to be
          there with one score.

He puts his glasses back on, stares at Racine.

                         WALKER
          But they're not willing to do what's
          necessary. Do you know what I mean?

Racine looks at him in silence for a moment.

                        RACINE
          I'm not sure. You mean, lay the
          groundwork? Earn it?

                         WALKER
          No. I mean do what's necessary.
          Whatever's necessary.

The two men stare at each other a few beats.

                         RACINE
          Yeah. I know that kind of guy. I
          can't stand that. It makes me sick.

                            WALKER
          Me too.

                         RACINE
          I'm not like that.

Walker ROARS with laughter. A huge, powerful burst that
shakes the table. And Racine laughs with him.

EXT. WALKER HOUSE - NIGHT

Matty's bedroom window, from a distance.  The light goes
out, Racine is watching from the shadows of the gazebo.
He stares up there. The TINKLING of the  wind chimes rises
and rises. It crests and begins to fade,  replaced by the
WHOOSHING.

EXT. BEACH - DAWN

Racine runs south along the beach. The WHOOSHING slows.
He is looking at something. He takes out his cigarettes
as he slows to a walk. When he is directly across from
what he's staring at, he sits in the sand, He lights up.

RACINE'S POV - "THE BREAKERS," an ancient wooden beach
hotel, of medium size, sits at the edge of the beach. It
is closed down, boarded up, deteriorating horribly in the
ocean air.

EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

Lunchtime. Racine is headed toward his office, briefcase
in hand. Beverly appears out of the noon crush; she's
going the other way in a hurry.

                         BEVERLY
          There are some messages on your desk.
          Be back in an hour. Got to run.

INT. RACINE'S OFFICE - DAY

Racine comes into the reception room from the hall. He's
surprised the door is unlocked. He crosses the room and
opens the door to his office.

Matty is sitting in one of the chairs in front of his
desk. She jumps up at the sight of him and moves up to
embrace him.

                           RACINE
          Jesus!    Did Beverly see you?

Matty kisses him on the mouth, then shakes her head "no."

                         MATTY
          I waited till I saw her leave.      Please
          don't be angry with me.

                        RACINE
          Angry? I'm not angry -- How'd you
          get in?

                         MATTY
          It didn't lock. Oh. Ned, hold me.
          Please just hold me, God, I love
          you.

Racine reaches over and locks the door to his office.

                         MATTY
          He left this morning.      I had to see
          you.

                            RACINE
                    (kissing her)
          I know.

                         MATTY
          I couldn't call. I'm afraid to call.
          I was afraid you wouldn't let me
          come.

                         RACINE
          Yes, that's right. You can't call.
          Never call. We have to be very
          careful now about the phone. The
          phone company keeps records.

                         MATTY
          I'm careful. I hated it, Ned. I
          hated sitting there with the two of
          you. I thought I was going to scream.

                         RACINE
                 (distracted,
                  thinking)
          You did good.
                 (finds his thought)
          You've called my apartment from the
          house.

                           MATTY
          No, never.

                          RACINE
          No?   Those two times --

                         MATTY
          I went to phone booths. I'm afraid
          of him, Ned. I'm always afraid.

                         RACINE
          That's good. We have to be careful
          about the phones now.

                         MATTY
          Why, Ned, why do you say this now?

                         RACINE
                 (in his own thoughts)
          We could account for a couple calls.
          We've had some contact. That would
          make sense.

Matty grasps his face in her hands and looks into his
face.

                           MATTY
          Why, Ned?    What's happened?

                          RACINE
          Because we're going to kill him.    We
          both know that.

Matty's face looks different than we've seen it. There's
a fire burning behind there and the heat it's throwing is
bringing her equal portions of dread and relief. She
stares at him,

                         RACINE
          That's what you want, isn't it? We
          knew it was coming. It's the only
          way we can get everything we want,
          isn't it?

Matty's nod is barely perceptible.

                         RACINE
          The man's gonna die for no reason
          but we want him dead.

                         RACINE (CONT'D)
          He doesn't deserve it. Let's not
          ever say that. We're doing it for
          us. And you're going to inherit
          half of everything he owns. That's
          what the will says, right?

Again, the tiny nod. He pulls her head close, so he
doesn't have to look into her eyes anymore.

                         RACINE
          That's it then. We're gonna kill
          him. And I think I know how.

Matty reacts to this.

                         MATTY
          It's real, then?

                         RACINE
          Yeah, it's real all right, and if
          we're not careful, it's gonna be the
          last real thing we do.

EXT. FISHING HARBOR - STREET ACROSS FROM DOCKS - NIGHT

Matty sits at the wheel of her Mercedes at the curb. She
smokes her cigarette nervously. Racine walks over to the
car from the docks and leans down to the window.

                         RACINE
          I know where he is. It's not far
          from here. I don't want you with
          me.

                          MATTY
          I thought we settled that. I'll
          wait in the car, but --
                 (she puts a hand
                  on him)
          -- I want to take the risks with
          you. We're both doing this.

Racine gives her a look of resignation and moves around
the car.

INT. TEDDY LAURSEN'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

TEDDY LAURSEN, rock'n roll arsonist, is keeping the beat
and mouthing the words along with the Bruce Springsteen
tape on his workbench. Teddy is in his mid-twenties,
dressed in a black T-shirt and jeans. His arson workshop
is located in the basement of an old building. All around
him are the tools and supplies of his trade: wire, rope,
cans, vises, alarm clocks, chemical containers, and a
huge assortment of mechanical implements. He keeps all
his small accessories in dozens of cigar boxes, unlabeled.

    Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org             52.


He knows where everything Is. Teddy is watching Racine,
who is kneeling on the floor before a compact incendiary
device. Teddy winces at the way Racine clips two wires
together. He reaches over to turn down the tape slightly,
then squats down next to Racine to demonstrate the proper
method.

                          TEDDY
          Whatsa matter, you can't think with
          a little music?
                 (demonstrating)
          Like this, I said.

Racine nods then duplicates the clipping. Teddy goes
back to his stool, slapping the beat of the music on his
thigh. Racine pulls out the alarm lever on the clock
attached to the device and stands up. He throws a look
to Teddy and Teddy nods that, yes, the device is now set.

                         RACINE
          That's it?

                         TEDDY
                 (nods to the music)
          It's fast. It's hot. It's simple.
          You can use the clock or rig it to
          something that moves. It starts big
          and it'll go with just the mag clips.
          If you want more, splash a little
          accelerator around.

                         RACINE
          Just regular gasoline?

                         TEDDY
          Regular, unleaded, supreme -- whatever
          you like, counselor. I got to tell
          you, though, this mama has a big
          drawback.

                         RACINE
          What?

                         TEDDY
          It's easy to spot, even after the
          meltdown. They'll know it's arson.

                         RACINE
          I don't care about that.
                 (looks at Teddy)
          That's all there is to it?

Teddy is offended.

                          TEDDY
          No. No-no-no-no. That ain't all
          there is to it.

                           TEDDY (CONT'D)
          You gotta get in, you gotta get out.
          You gotta pick the right spot and
          the right time. And you gotta try
          not to get famous while you're in
          the act.
                 (gestures at the
                   device)
          If that was all there was to it, any
          idiot could do it.

                         RACINE
          Sorry.

                         TEDDY
          Hey, now I want to ask you something,
          Are you listening, asshole, because
          I like you?
                 (Racine nods)
          I got a serious question for you.
          What the fuck are you doing? This
          is not shit for you to be messing
          with. Are you ready to hear
          something? See if this sounds
          familiar. Anytime you try a decent
          crime, there is fifty ways to fuck
          up. If you think of twenty-five of
          them you're a genius. And you're no
          genius. You know who told me that?

Racine remembers telling Teddy that.

                         TEDDY
          Listen, man, maybe you should let me
          do it for you. Gratis. I'll do it.
          I wouldn't even be on the street if
          it weren't for you.

Racine looks him over, shakes his head "no."

                         RACINE
          Thanks.

                         TEDDY
          I hope you know what you're doin'
          you better be pretty damn sure about
          it. If you ain't sure, don't do it.
          Of course, that's my recommendation
          anyway -- don't do it.
                 (he puts a hand on
                  Racine's shoulder)
          Because I tell you, Counselor, this
          arson, this is serious crime.

Racine looks at him.

INT. ENCLOSED SIDE VERANDAH - WALKER HOUSE - NIGHT

Racine sits smoking, watching Matty fill their tall
highball glasses with ice at the bar.

                         MATTY
          I don't know why he's so crazy about
          her. Maybe because he never had any
          of his own. She's a cute little
          girl, all right, but other than
          that... I know this, though, her
          mother has worked plenty hard to
          keep Heather on Edmund's mind, Always
          bringing her around, reporting
          everything she does in school. That
          Roz is a smart one. And you know
          that anything Heather inherits goes
          straight to Roz. Heather won't even
          get a look at it. That's the part I
          can't stand. That's why it seems so
          wrong to have half of it go to her.

She hands him his glass and stands next to him, her hand
playing with his hair.

                         RACINE
          That's the way it is.       There's nothing
          we can do about it.

She kneels beside him.

                         MATTY
          Are you sure, Ned? I've been thinking
          about it. Maybe there is. The will
          is with his lawyer in Miami I know
          that. What if I could get him to
          bring it home? He did it once, he'd
          do it again. If I could swing it,
          couldn't we rewrite it? Change it.
          Then when he dies, I could find the
          new one. We could just change it a
          little. Every little change would
          mean a lot to us, End. You're a
          lawyer. You know how to write it.
          It wouldn't seem so odd. I could
          say he brought it home and we talked
          about it and decided to make some
          changes up here. And I knew you
          already --

Racine is shaking his head.

                             RACINE
          No.   Forget it.

                         MATTY
          I just don't see why Heather should
          take half --

Racine puts down his drink and turns to look down at her.

                            RACINE
             Listen to me, Matty. Nothing strange
             can happen in his life right now,
             not one thing out of the ordinary.
             That's vital, that's the main thing.
             If anything does, the chances double
             that we get caught. You and I are
             walking out there on the edge every
             second now. One false move and we're
             gonna fall off. It'll be all over.
             You've got to remember that all the
             time.
                    (he studies her
                     face)
             You'll get half of everything and
             it'll be plenty. No matter what it
             is, we're gonna be satisfied. We're
             not gonna get greedy. If we do,
             we'll get burned. You gotta believe
             me, baby, the odds that we'll get
             burned are good enough without looking
             for trouble.

She studies him with frightened eyes, then nods her
agreement and lays her hand in his lap.

                            MATTY
             You're right, darling.   I'm sorry.
             I know you're right.

EXT. "THE BREAKERS" - NIGHT

Middle of the night. No one in sight. Now comes the only
movement -- a Miranda Beach Police Patrol Car drives slowly
up the street next to the old hotel and turns south on
Ocean Avenue. When it is gone, all is dead again.

EXT. THE BEACH - NIGHT

Racine has   watched the patrol car from the  darkness of
the beach.   Now he sits in the sand again,  his back against
the raised   bank of sand on which he runs.   He lights a
flashlight   and makes a notation in a small  notepad.

INT. "THE BREAKERS" - NIGHT

Racine's footsteps creak through the blackness. Then his
flashlight reveals a corridor in the crumbling basement
of the old hotel. Racine is not the first to have violated
the premises -- scattered about are beer cans, whiskey
bottles, beds made of newspapers, the remains of food.
Rats CHITTER and scamper in the shadows. A lizard scoots
over the pipes.

Racine goes through a doorway and is in what used to be a
supply area at the bottom of a stairway.

    Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                56.


Scattered about are empty wooden food crates. The walls
are lined with tall wooden shelves; one of these units is
tipped over across the room, Racine shines his light in
that direction and sees what caused the shelves to fall.
One of the beams which cross the ceiling has rotted loose
and dropped one end to the floor.

Racine has found what he wanted.

EXT. WALKER HOUSE - PARKING AREA - MIGHT

We're CLOSE ON RACINE'S WATCH; it reads 2:30.

                          RACINE
          Okay.   Gotta go.

Racine, at the wheel of the Stingray is looking at his
watch. Matty is leaning down to the window dressed only
in a robe.

                          MATTY
          Be careful.

                         RACINE
          I'm just going for a ride.   I wish
          it was all this dangerous.

She kisses him deeply.

                          MATTY
          I love you.

He looks at his watch again and pulls away.     Matty stands
watching.

EXT. FROM PINEHAVEN TO "THE BREAKERS" - SERIES OF SHOTS -
NIGHT

Racine drives his murder route. The roads are almost
totally deserted. Intermittently he passes signs welcoming
him to the towns as he travels south.

A. The first stretch of his trip, Racine travels on a
deserted back road with overhanging trees. A Teenage
Hotrodder passes him and he is alone again. As he turns
off the road, he checks his watch.
B. He drives through a neighborhood of neat houses. No
life.
C. He turns onto a four line interstate. More traffic
here -- long haul truckers, late night drinkers.
D. He drives across a graceful drawbridge, rimmed by
lights, over a canal.
E. He drives toward the ocean beside a pretty lake in a
park. A patrol car passes the other way. Racine checks
his watch.
F. At "The Breakers." Racine follows the same path as
the police car he'd watched.

INT. COUNTY JAIL - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE VISITING ROOM - DAY

A seedy-looking Thief is brought out of the visiting room
by a Uniformed Deputy, followed by Racine, briefcase in
hand. Racine shakes the Thief's hand. The Deputy leads
the Thief away down the hall. Racine glances at his
departing client, then heads in the other direction.
Before he has gone too far a heavy, metal, barred door at
the other end swallows up the Thief with a piercing CLANG!
Racine jumps. He puts a hand against the wall.

INT. BED - MATTY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Racine and Matty, just their heads on one pillow, inches
apart. They look at each other in silence. Finally --

                           RACINE
          And?

                           MATTY
          The side door.

                           RACINE
          And?

                         MATTY
          Two A.M. I send him down.

                         RACINE
          We won't talk again after     I leave
          here tonight. I'll be in      Miami by
          noon Friday. You won't be      able to
          reach me. When I see you      again,
          he'll be dead.

Matty nods.   She begins to cry.     Racine touches her.

                         MATTY
          I'm so frightened.

So is Racine.

INT. RACINE'S STINGRAY - INTERSTATE 95 - DAY

Matty unlocks the door side of the house.    She tests it
once from the outside.

EXT. EMPTY LOT - MIAMI - DAY

A Real Estate Agent leans against his car reading a
newspaper at the front of a huge, empty lot beneath a
causeway. There's a big "For Sale" sign up.

Racine pulls up in the Stingray. The Real Estate Agent
throws his paper in his car and goes over to shake hands
with Racine. They turn to look at the lot.

EXT. ENTRANCE - SHERATON HOTEL (MIAMI) - DAY

Racine pulls up in the Stingray. He takes an overnight
bag from the car and goes inside as a Parking Attendant
wheels the Stingray into an underground garage.

EXT. FRONT TERRACE - WALKER HOUSE - NIGHT

Matty comes to the end of the porch, a big, welcoming

Edmund is getting out the driver's side.

                         WALKER
          Hello, sweetheart. Have I got a
          nice present for you.

The passenger door of the Cadillac swings open. Pretty
nine-year-old HEATHER KRAFT pops out with a grin.

                            HEATHER
          Hi, Aunt Matty!

          Heather.   What a surprise.

INT. SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - WALKER HOUSE - NIGHT

Through an open door, Edmund can be seen kissing Heather
goodnight in the guest room. He gets up, comes to the

door, but she speaks to him. He nods and leaves the door
half open.

INT. RACINE'S RENTED OLDSMOBILE (INSERT CU) - NIGHT

Racine's face, intermittently lit by the road lights, is
set, intense. We MOVE IN on it and --

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

INT. MATTY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Matty's face, her head on a pillow, turned away from her
husband, away from the bedroom door. Her look is just as
intense as Racine's. Her eyes are focused on -

An alarm clock on the nightstand -- 1:15.

There is the SOUND of a car somewhere outside and Matty
reacts to it silently. She listens with her whole being.
The wind chimes TINKLE.

EXT. SIDE DOOR - WALKER HOUSE - NIGHT

Racine's hand takes hold of the doorknob. He tries it. It
won't open.

Racine's face. Puzzled. He gives an irritated glance
upward. Then he moves along the wall.

INT. MATTY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

The alarm clock -- 1:42.

Matty watches. Matty listens. She tries to confirm that
Walker is sleeping without looking there. Matty begins to
move her legs slowly toward the side of the bed, to get
out.

Suddenly, the bed lurches. Matty gasps and whips her head
around to look. Edmund is standing next to his side of
the bed in his undershorts. He puts on his glasses and
looks at her.

                         WALKER
          Jesus, take it easy. I thought I
          was tense.

                         MATTY
          What are you doing?

                         WALKER
          I can't sleep. I'm going down and
          get something to drink.

Matty watches with panicky eyes as Edmund moves toward
door. When she speaks, her voice is different, husky.

                           MATTY
          Edmund.

He turns to look at her.   She moves once on the bed,
languidly.

                         MATTY
          I can't sleep, either.

He peers at her in the darkness.

                         MATTY
          Lock the door, darling.

Edmund studies her, then walks over and locks the door.

                                                 WIPE TO:

INT. MATTY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Edmund's alarm clock - 2:05. Edmund rolls into view, his
breath ragged. Matty's hand is on his chest.

Edmund looks at her and laughs.

                         WALKER
          You trying to kill me?

Matty, flat on her back, smiles weakly and looks at the
ceiling. Again, the mattress moves. She looks at Edmund.
He has pulled on his shorts and is walking toward the
bathroom.

                         WALKER
          I'm going downstairs.     Do you want
          anything?

He disappears into the bathroom. Matty slips out of bed.
She is wearing a silky nightgown. She hurries to the
bedroom door.

                         MATTY
                 (calling softly to
                  him)
          I'll go down with you.

She opens the door and steps into the hall.

INT. SECOND FLOOR HALL - NIGHT

Matty looks across the hall toward the open door to the
guest room; it is dark. She hurries to the stairs, peering
down into the darkness. She starts down the steps.

INT. FIRST FLOOR HALL - NIGHT

MATTY'S POV as she comes down the steps. Each shadow,
doorway, and alcove threatens to erupt with life.

Matty reaches the bottom of the stairs and peers around.
She starts back along the dark hall of the house just as
Edmund comes out of the bedroom upstairs; he is still in
his undershorts. He reaches the top of the stairs as Matty
moves back along the hall. The alcove under the stairs is
in black shadow. Matty is focused on it.

Just as she reaches it, the lights in the hall snap on.
Racine is standing under the stairs, poised to strike the
figure in the hall with a heavy wooden plank about two
feet long. Matty gasps at the sight, but it is covered by --

                          WALKER
                 (at the top of the
                  stairs)
          Christ, woman, did you ever hear of
          turning on the lights?

Racine doesn't breathe. Matty is frozen in the spot,
directly in front of Racine and five feet below Edmund,
who now starts down the steps.

                            MATTY
          Edmund... wait!

                           WALKER
                 (stops)
          What is it?

                         MATTY
                 (whispering up at
                  him)
          Put on a robe or something. What if
          Heather wakes up and comes down.

Edmund frowns, goes back up the stairs.

                         WALKER
                 (grumbling)
          Damn. She's not going to wake up at
          2 o'clock in the morning...

Racine and Matty lock eyes.   Racine slips back through
the alcove door.

EXT. PARKING AREA - WALKER HOUSE - DAY

Matty watches Heather give Edmund a big   goodbye kiss and
run off to talk to Betty, the Walker's   Housekeeper, who
is sweeping the front terrace. Edmund    gets in the
Cadillac. Matty leans down and kisses    him goodbye.

                         WALKER
          You don't really mind, do you?
                 (Matty shakes her
                  head)
          Roz will pick her up on Friday. And
          don't worry, Roz won't stay overnight.

                         MATTY
          She can do whatever she wants.

                         WALKER
                 (gives her a
                  skeptical look)
          Listen, I don't know if I'll be able
          to come up next weekend. I'll know
          more later. I'll call you.

He gives her a once-over, proprietary look and drives
away, honking once to Heather, who waves.

HEATHER'S STAY/RACINE'S WEEK - SERIES OF SHOTS

A. Matty sits on the dock dangling her feet in the water
as Heather plays in an inner tube.
B. Racine stands at his office window, staring down at
the traffic on Main Street. He wipes the sweat from his
brow with his finger.
C. At night, Matty comes upstairs with a highball in her
hand. She pauses and looks across the hall to the half-
open door of the guest room. There is just blackness
there; no way to know if Heather is asleep or watching.

    Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org             63.


Matty goes out the hall door to the verandah and sits
down with her drink. The wind chimes TINKLE.
D. At night, Racine runs sweating along the Boardwalk,
footsteps THUMPING.
E. Daytime. Matty is in a phone booth in a gas station,
speaking urgently. She hangs up.

F. In his office, Racine hangs up, disgruntled. His
feet up on his desk, he has been toying with the fedora
Matty gave him. Now he sails it across the office at the
hook of a coatstand. It hits and bounces off onto the
floor. Racine gets up, walks over and picks it up. He
walks away from the coatstand, then turns and floats the
hat through the air to land on the hook. From his new
position, he can see out into the reception area. Beverly
is working at her desk. Racine watches her small
movements. Beverly looks up and sees him.
G. Evening. Heather is happily watching television in
the enclosed side verandah in the Walker house. Matty is
in a big chair. She watches Heather, not the television.
She puts a cigarette in her mouth then reaches out to
strike a wooden match against the rough surface of the
porcelain match holder. As it bursts into flame, it
becomes --
H. The flame at the end of Racine's match. He is drinking
alone at a bar and now lights another cigarette.

EXT. FRONT TERRACE - WALKER HOUSE - NIGHT

Matty comes out. She's wearing a light, simple shift.
She walks over to a small table and begins putting some
dirty dishes and glasses on a small tray. Suddenly, Racine
takes her into his arms from behind. She GASPS in terror;
he turns her to him. He is wearing only cut-off blue
jean shorts and his body is wet, glistening. His hair is
soaking, slicked straight back. He looks different. She
sees who it is and kisses him deeply. They whisper --

                          MATTY
          My God, you scared me. You shouldn't
          be here. Heather's still here.
          She's upstairs.

                            RACINE
          -- Asleep.

                         MATTY
          I miss you so badly.       But it's too
          dangerous.

                         RACINE
          She won't wake up now.

                            MATTY
          You're all wet.

                         RACINE
          I've been out there waiting for two
          hours.

                            HEATHER (O.S.)
                 (sleepy)
          Aunt Matty?

The door from the house squeaks open and Heather puts one
foot onto the porch; she looks only half-awake as she
peers into the gloom. Racine has turned at the SOUND and
for one moment he is sideways to her, his head turned in
her direction.

Heather's eyes suddenly discern the scene. Racine turns
away at the same instant that Heather stumbles backwards
through the door and out of sight. Heather's FOOTSTEPS
patter swiftly away.

Matty and Racine look at each other.

INT. SECOND FLOOR HALL - NIGHT

Matty comes up the stairs and looks toward the guest room.
The door is closed.

INT. TERRACE BREAKFAST AREA - WALKER HOUSE - DAY

Morning. Matty sits with coffee and toast at the table.
The Walker's Housekeeper moves about in the kitchen.
Heather comes in and takes her place opposite Matty. She
seems perfectly normal. But she doesn't look Matty in
the eye.

                         HEATHER
          Good morning, Aunt Matty.
                 (to the Housekeeper)
          Hi, Betty.

Matty watches over her coffee as Heather butters a muffin.

                         HEATHER
          Is there any more of that strawberry
          stuff?

EXT. PARKING AREA - WALKER HOUSE - DAY

ROZ KRAFT, Edmund Walker's sister, closes the passenger
door of her station wagon behind Heather. Matty stands
nearby.

                         ROZ
          What do you say?

                            HEATHER
          I did.

                            MATTY
          She did.

Roz gives Heather a look.

                         HEATHER
          Thank you, Aunt Matty.

Roz walks around the car and gets in.

                            ROZ
          Thanks, Matty.     We appreciate it.

                            MATTY
          Any time, Roz.     She's a pleasure.

Roz smiles, waves and pulls away.    Matty watches them go,
worried.

INT. RACINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The lights are out. There's enough moonlight pouring in
the open windows to see Racine sitting on the bed in his
shorts, his back propped against some pillows at the
headboard. A fan WHIRS on a table. He lights another
cigarette and takes another drink; a bottle of bourbon
sits on his nightstand. From where he sits, he can see
the ocean. There is a KNOCK at the door.

                            RACINE
          Yeah?

                            MATTY (O.S.)
          It is me.

                            RACINE
          It's open.

Matty comes in.  She peers into the darkness until she
sees him. She  locks the door and turns to face him. She
is dressed in a pale silk suit and blouse, very carefully
put together.  She looks as good as she ever has; she
seems to create her own light.

                         MATTY
          Why haven't you answered your phone?

                          RACINE
          You took a chance coming here.
          Where's Edmund?

                         MATTY
          He's not coming up this weekend.
          Why haven't you answered?

                         RACINE
          I didn't want to talk.     I just wanted
          to think.

    Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                66.


                         MATTY
                 (nods; then, after
                  a moment)
          Can I get in with you?

Racine just stares at her.

                         MATTY
          I don't know what Heather will tell
          Roz. Maybe nothing. Maybe she'll
          be embarrassed or afraid. Maybe
          she'll think she imagined the whole
          thing.

                         RACINE
                 (chuckles without
                  humor)
          Maybe we all did.

                         MATTY
          We'll know if she does tell. Roz
          will report to Edmund quick enough.
          It's exactly what she's always wanted.

Matty disappears for a moment into the shadows.

                         MATTY
          I've been thinking, too.

                         RACINE
          And what have you got?

Matty emerges from the darkness and sits on the edge of
the bed next to Racine. She looks into his eyes.

                         MATTY
          I think we should give it up. We
          haven't done anything criminal, yet.

Racine has been thinking along the same lines.    He stubs
out his cigarette.

                         RACINE
          It's not too late to back out.

                          MATTY
          That's right.   I don't think we can
          do it.

                         RACINE
          What do you mean?

                          MATTY
          Things have already started to go
          wrong. I feel like we got to the
          edge and looked over and, well, it
          was too much. We'll just have to
          live with that.

She sits down on the bed.

                         MATTY
          I'll divorce him. And     we won't have
          his money. Part of me     wants it so
          bad. I'd be lying if I     said I didn't.
          But it's the worst part    of me, the
          weakest part.

She leans back against him.

                         MATTY
          All that matters is that we're
          together.

                         RACINE
                 (after a moment)
          You don't think I can pull it off.

                         MATTY
          It's not you, it's us. I'm sure
          I'll make some mistake.

                         RACINE
          That's not what you really mean, is
          it, Matty?

                            MATTY
          Yes it is.

                         RACINE
                 (very calm, flat)
          No, it isn't. You think he's too
          much for me. You think I'll fuck it
          up, get us caught.

Matty turns toward him.

                         MATTY
          No, darling. Don't talk that way.
          It's not true.

Racine studies her face.

                        RACINE
          No? Well that's what I've been
          thinking.

                         MATTY
          You're wrong. Don't think that,
          ever! I know you could do it.
                 (moving closer)
          But all I care about is you. The
          money doesn't matter.

                         RACINE
          It does in this world, the one we're
          living in.

Matty presses her head against his chest.

                         MATTY
          Why torture ourselves about it?

Racine laughs; he doesn't know what's funny.

                         RACINE
          When's he coming back?

                           MATTY
          Friday.

                         RACINE
          That'll be it, then. Nothing will
          stop us.

                         MATTY
          Is that what you really want?     Are
          you sure?

                           RACINE
          Yeah.    I wasn't before, but I am
          now.

Racine reaches over her, gets another cigarette and lights
it. After he takes a deep drag, she takes it from him
and takes a puff too.

                         RACINE
          This time you're going to know how
          to reach me. I don't want any more
          surprises.

                                          SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. CITY STREET - MIAMI - DAY

Racine locks up   a rented Ford on a side street and walks
back two cars to   where his Stingray is parked. As he
bends to unlock   the Stingray, he looks around and a passing
car catches his   attention.

RACINE'S POV, PANNING with the car as it drives by him.
There is only one thing extraordinary about this particular
car. The driver, hunched and intent on the road ahead,
is a Clown, in full costume and makeup.

Racine watches as the car disappears.   For a moment, Racine
looks like a dead man.

INT. MASTER BATHROOM - WALKER HOUSE - DAY

Matty is reclining in the soapy water, slowly scrubbing.
She HUMS to herself.

EXT. HILTON HOTEL - MIAMI - DUSK

A Parking Attendant takes Racine's Stingray, as Racine
goes into the lobby.

EXT. FRONT TERRACE - WALKER HOUSE - DUSK

Matty is leaning against one of the posts that flank the
porch stairs. Headlights pass across the front of the
house and Matty's body. She smiles a welcoming smile to
the unseen Edmund.

EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

A light fog is settling into the dips of the road. Now
Racine's rented Ford appears out of one such depression
and moves into a clear stretch.

INT. RACINE'S RENTED FORD - NIGHT

Racine eyes the fog with concern.

EXT. WALKER HOUSE - NIGHT

The FOG is much heavier here. It rolls in past the house
in thick waves. The only light burning is on the front
porch. The wind Chimes TINKLE softly.

EXT. SECOND FLOOR PORCH - NIGHT

The wind chimes TINKLE, nudged by the same breeze that
floats the FOG around them.

INT. MATTY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

The alarm clock -- 1:50.

Again, Matty lies on her side, turned away from Edmund,
eyes wide, watching the clock. Again, the bed moves
suddenly! Matty rolls over to look.

Edmund is sitting up in bed, putting on his glasses.

                            MATTY
          What's wrong?

Edmund motions for her to be silent.

                         WALKER
                 (whispering)
          I think there's someone downstairs I
          heard something.

He swings out of bed; he is in his undershorts.

                            MATTY
          Are you sure?

closet and disappears inside.

          Will you be quiet? I'm going to
          nail the bastard.

Edmund comes out of the closet checking the safety on a
shiny nickel-plated .38 revolver.

                          MATTY
                 (aghast)
          Edmund, what's that?

                         WALKER
          Will you be quiet?

                         MATTY
          I've never seen that.

                         WALKER
                 (at the bedroom
                  door)
          I've got a surprise for this fucker.

                         MATTY
          Edmund, be careful!

But he is already out the door, silently. For a moment
Matty is frozen, then she slides out of bed.

INT. SECOND FLOOR HALL - NIGHT

Edmund has stopped at the top of the stairs. He listens
for sounds from below. He starts down the steps in the
dark.

INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT

Edmund comes slowly down the steps, his gun pointing here,
then there in his perfectly steady grip. The thrill of
the hunt is in Edmund's eyes. The downstairs is thick
with ominous shadows. At the bottom of the steps, he
stops and listens again. He moves in two quick steps to
the entry hall and looks into the living room and dining
room. He seems to hear something at the rear of the house.
He turns and moves back along the central hall, very
slowly. The alcove under the stairs is pitch black.
Edmund points his gun at that approaching space and stops.
He listens. The TINKLING of the wind chimes rises weirdly,
making it hard for him to hear.

Edmund's hand reaches out to the wall.   His fingers find
the light switch. He flips it.

For a second, we are blinded by the glare. In the next
Instant, as we see that the space below the stairs is
empty, Matty screams from the top of the stairs --

                          MATTY
          He has a gun!

Edmund thinks she is warning him.   He spins to look.

                          WALKER
          Where?

Suddenly, Racine bursts from the hall closet, the wooden
plank raised above his head. He brings it down fast toward
Edmund's head.

Edmund reacts instinctively, raising his arm, the arm
that holds the gun, to protect himself. The wooden plank
smashes down -- half its force taken by Edmund's forearm,
half by his head. The gun BLASTS once.

One small window in the front door shatters and the bullet
continues into the night.

Edmund's revolver slides across the hall floor into a
corner.

Edmund is on the floor, blood pouring from his scalp.
But he is coming on like a crazed beast. His glasses
askew, but still on his head, he has grasped Racine around
the legs. With a powerful lunge, he pulls Racine's legs
out. Racine crashes to the hall floor, losing the wooden
plank.

Matty, frozen at the stair railing, cries out.

Edmund is pulling Racine toward him with all his might,
crawling up Racine's body as they both slide on the wood
floor. Edmund reaches out one huge hand, and pulls Racine
even closer.

Racine puts his left hand into Edmund's face, his thumb
flat against the lens of Edmund's glasses and pushes his
head back. The glasses fly away and Racine loses his
hold. Edmund comes on.

Racine's right hand gropes -- gropes -- finds the wooden
plank. He swings it up.

The wooden plank describes a perfect arc into our view,
and then out, finding its mark with a HORRIBLE THUD.

Matty, up the stairs, turns away.

Racine falls back on the floor.

EXT. TRUNK OF WALKER'S CADILLAC - NIGHT

The trunk is open like a giant maw. A sheet of plastic
has been spread across the inside. Edmund's body flops
down inside. He has been dressed, his shoes and watch
put on. Racine drops the blooded wooden plank beside the
body, then throws a blanket over the corpse and slams the
trunk. Racine turns to Matty who stands, fully dressed,
shaking in the foggy air.

                           RACINE
            The cars at the end of the drive.
            Spend the fifteen minutes cleaning
            up inside, then come. You're gonna
            have to be careful in this fog.
                   (he looks at her)
            Are you all right?

She nods.

                           RACINE
            Fifteen minutes.

Racine gets in the Cadillac and pulls away.

INT. CADILLAC - ON DESERTED BACKROAD - NIGHT

                                                 WIPE TO:

The first stretch of Racine's route to "The Breakers"
looks different in the dense FOG. Racine has to take it
slowly.

He consults his watch. A branch from one of the
overhanging trees looms up abruptly in the windshield,
like a grasping arm. Racine flinches.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

Racine drives through the silent neighborhood. The  houses
are invisible in the FOG, their presence indicated only
by an occasional glowing light. Suddenly, a police  SIREN
pierces the night, followed by the appearance of a flashing
red light on the street behind the Cadillac.

INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT

Racine's eyes jump to the rear view mirror and the flashing
red light growing in it. Racine pulls over. The police
car slows as it reaches the Cadillac, pulls alongside,
and then speeds on ahead, SIREN squealing. A light goes
on in the house in front of which Racine has stopped. He
pulls away.

EXT. FOUR-LANE INTERSTATE - NIGHT

The Cadillac pulls up to the interstate from the side
street.

    Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                 73.


As on the other night, there is more traffic here.   But
it is moving slowly in the FOG.

INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT

Racine has to cross two lanes of traffic to go south. He
peers out through the misted windshield. He starts to
pull out and a sports car appears from nowhere, doing
fifty, sitting on his HORN. Racine hits the brakes. As
soon as it has passed, there is a lull. Racine fishtails
across the road just ahead of a truck and moves south.

EXT./INT. CADILLAC - INTERSTATE - NIGHT

The traffic on Racine's side of the interstate has slowed.
There's an accident up ahead. The police car that passed
Racine is on the scene, but the lone Cop is not enough.
Some Passing Motorists have pulled over to help with the
wreck and direct traffic. The FOG is aglow with flashing
red and white lights and burning flares. A Man signals
for Racine to stop. The cars in the opposite lanes are
allowed to pass through. Racine keeps his head down.

A STOCKY TRUCKER comes out of the glowing FOG and walks
up to the Cadillac. He leans down into the driver's
window.

                         STOCKY TRUCKER
          Hey, man, do you have any flares?

                            RACINE
          Uh -- no.     I don't think so.

                         STOCKY TRUCKER
                 (irritated)
          Could you check your trunk? We got
          kinda of a mess here.

                         RACINE
          I don't have them. I told you.

The Stocky Trucker gives him a disgusted look and stands
up.

                         STOCKY TRUCKER
          Don't put yourself out.

The Man in the road ahead signals for Racine to pull around
into the opposite lanes and move on.

TRACKING along beside the Cadillac, Racine moves slowly
through the nightmare scene. Figures move by carrying
lights and tools. The Injured CRY OUT in pain. Three
cars are meshed in crumpled steel. A clutch of Onlookers
are outlined against the beams of headlights... Racine
might as well be driving into Hell.

EXT. BRIDGE OVER CANAL - NIGHT

Here is relief. The  Cadillac moves all alone across the
bridge. The lights  penetrate the FOG at orderly intervals,
barely illuminating the bridge. A huge FOG HORN fills
the air from not far way.

EXT. "THE BREAKERS" - DELIVERY DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

The deserted hotel looms ghostly in the FOG. The Cadillac,
lights out, rolls silently to a stop in the half-hidden
delivery driveway.

INT. "THE BREAKERS" - SUPPLY AREA - NIGHT

Racine, carrying only a flashlight, has made his way to
the supply area he visited before. His beam probes dark
corners, responds to random CREAKING. Satisfied that he
is alone, he moves a wooden crate and reaches into the
hole in the wall which it hid. He brings out Teddy's
incendiary device and places it on the floor in the middle
of the room.

EXT. "THE BREAKERS" - DELIVERY DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

Racine grunts under the weight of Edmund's corpse, flung
over his back. He stumbles back toward the hulking hotel.
The trunk of the Cadillac is closed.

INT. "THE BREAKERS" - CORRIDOR - SUPPLY AREA - NIGHT

Racine sits down hard. He is streaming with sweat under
the enormous dead weight. He adjusts the plastic sheet
so that Edmund's bloody skull won't contact the wall.
Racine gathers his strength and half-lifts, half-drags
the body down the corridor, his silhouette that of a
twisted, double-headed monster. His flashlight glows
from ahead at his destination.

IN THE SUPPLY AREA, Racine has dropped Edmund's body over
some tipped shelves. Now he lifts the  heavy ceiling beam
he spotted earlier. He has to change  its angle only two
feet in order to let it drop -- now -- on Edmund's head.

Racine walks over to the incendiary device. He pulls out
the lever and straightens up. As he does he looks down a
connecting hallway. He sees movement. He snatches up
the flashlight and the wooden plank and rushes down that
hallway.

AT THE END OF THE HALLWAY, Racine slides to a halt,
breathing hard. Again he sees the movement. A horrible,
sweaty figure confronts him -- there is a broken mirror
attached to the wall. Racine looks at himself a long
moment and the tension seems to drain away...

Someone speaks in the shadows!

    Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                75.


Racine jumps and spins toward the sound,   which is only a
little more than a MOAN. His flashlight    seeks out the
source - a RAGGED BUM is stirring in his   sleep on a bed
of newspapers. He wears an old baseball    cap.

Racine looks at him a long time, trying to decide what to
do. He looks back  in the direction of the supply area.
He looks at the Bum settling again into a deep sleep. He
looks for one final second at himself in the mirror.

EXT. "THE BREAKERS" - BEACH - NIGHT

Racine appears at a run from the fog. He has the Bum
with him, grasped firmly at the neck of the collar and
the seat of his pants. Racine is forcing the Bum to run
along with him. The Bum is mightily confused, not least
by the fact that Racine has jammed the baseball cap all
the way down over his nose -- he can see nothing. Racine
lets go, hurtling him across the sand.

                         RACINE
                 (a low growl)
          Get the hell out of here and don't
          come back.

The Bum is sprawled in the sand. The baseball cap has
come off. He watches Racine's dark figure recede in the
fog.

                         RAGGED BUM
                 (a whisper)
          Come on back here and fight like a
          man!

INT. RENTED FORD - SIDE STREET - NIGHT

Matty sits fidgeting in the front seat, trying to peer
through the soupy FOG. She sucks on an unlit cigarette.

Racine appears at the driver's window. Matty gasps.     He
is a horrible sight. He gets in the driver's seat.

                          MATTY
          Thank god.   I thought --

Racine grabs her and pulls her down out of sight, bending
his body low over her.

                          RACINE
          Shh!

The windows are suddenly illuminated by the beams of
headlights. They grow brighter and a police patrol car,
red light slowly revolving on the top, passes next to the
Ford and moves off quietly in the FOG.

            They're right on time and I'm running
            late.

He rises slowly and watches the patrol car disappear.

EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF WALKER HOUSE - NIGHT

The Ford stops at front of the drive.

INT. RENTED FORD - NIGHT

Racine and Matty break from a kiss.    He moves her away
from him.

                           RACINE
            We won't talk for a long time.

She nods.   They look at each other.   She gets out.

EXT. INTERSTATE 95 - SERIES OF SHOTS - NIGHT

The rented Ford speeds through the foggy night.

INT. RENTED FORD - NIGHT

Racine's face. He knows that for the first time in his
life, he's really done it. There's no turning back.

Racine does something that he's going to be doing for the
rest of his life. He looks in the rear view mirror.

INT. "THE BREAKERS" - SUPPLY AREA - NIGHT

Everything is as Racine left it. Edmund's body lies
beneath the beam. It is barely discernible in the gloom.
The only bright spot in the room is the incendiary device,
its shiny surface catching some errant sliver of light.

And then it explodes with a harsh SHRIEK. And the light
of the magnesium chips is white, blinding. The chips are
out in all directions to the waiting puddles of gasoline.
The light goes from white to yellow as huge flames engulf
the room. The flames ROAR. We watch them for a few
moments and then --

                                        SLOWLY DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. SECOND FLOOR PORCH - WALKER HOUSE - NIGHT

Matty stands in the FOG, one arm wrapped around a post of
the porch. Above her the wind chimes TINKLE. She
struggles to hear something else. Finally she does hear
it and her face relaxes and she looks at peace. Listening
to soft, distant SIRENS.

FADE IN:

INT. RACINE'S OFFICE - DAY

The fedora hangs on the coatstand. Racine works at his
desk, reading over a long contract. The sun is cutting
through the Venetian blinds behind him in glaring strips
and, as he leans back in his chair, he finds it impossible
to read his document. He gets up, goes to the window and
adjusts the blinds so that his desk goes dark in the shade.
As it does, the PHONE RINGS. Beverly answers out in the
reception room, her conversation muffled through the
slightly cracked door. She hits a hold button and yells,
as is her informal custom.

                           BEVERLY
           Ned.   Miles Hardin. Do you want
           him?

                          RACINE
           Who is he?

                          BEVERLY
           She says he's a lawyer from Miami.

Racine picks up his phone.

                          RACINE
           Hello.

           Yes.

                          SECRETARY
           Miles Hardin calling.

The Secretary goes off and Racine is left holding. He
waits five long beats and seems about to hang up when a
Voice comes on, very dry and cold.

                          HARDIN
                  (filtered throughout)
           Mr. Racine.

           Yes.

                          HARDIN
           This is Miles Hardin of Morris and
           Dale in Miami.

           Yes.

                         HARDIN

          Walker.

                             RACINE
          Yes.

Hardin seems to expect more of a response.    Racine is
silent.

                         HARDIN
          Yes, well, Mrs. Walker has submitted
          the new will you wrote up there.

Racine closes his eyes for a moment. The blood drains
out of his face. He puts a hand out toward his desk.

                             RACINE
          Yes...    I see.

                         HARDIN
          And frankly, Mr. Racine, I think we
          may have a problem.

                           RACINE
          Uh-huh.    What problem is that?

                           HARDIN
          Well, I'd   rather discuss  it in person.
          In fact I   think it might  be best if
          we could   all get together  down there.
          That is,   if you wouldn't  object.

                         RACINE
          No no, that would be all right.

                         HARDIN
          Good. We have a relationship with a
          firm in West Palm -- Shiller,
          Hastings.

                             RACINE
          I know of them.

                         HARDIN
          I've arranged to have the use of
          their offices. I thought we might
          try to make it tomorrow, say ten
          o'clock. Would that be possible for
          you?

                         RACINE
          Yes, I think so.

                         HARDIN
          Good. Mrs. Walker told me she would
          be back down there by then.

          Right.

                            HARDIN
          Good-bye.

Hardin clicks off. Racine hangs up slowly. He stares at
the phone a long time. He gets up, his mind racing. He
goes to the window and parts two of the blinds with his
fingers. The sun makes him squint.

INT. RECEPTION AREA - DAY

Racine opens the door from his office.

LARGE CONFERENCE ROOM, opulent, with a big skylight.
Seated around the room are Matty, Roz Kraft, and much   to
Racine's surprise, his friend Peter Lowenstein, Matty   is
dressed in chic black, MILES HARDIN comes around the   big
desk to shake Racine's hand. Hardin is an impressive    guy
in a $500 suit. He greets Racine with icy eyes and a
cordial look.

                         HARDIN
          Miles Hardin, Mr. Racine.

                          RACINE
          How are you?

                         HARDIN
          I don't think you know Mrs. Kraft.

                          RACINE
                  (shakes her head)
          No.   I don't. My condolences.

                          ROZ
          Thank you.

Racine comes up to Matty and takes her hand.

                         RACINE
          Mrs. Walker, I'm very sorry about
          your husband.

                         MATTY
          Thank you, Mr. Racine.

                         HARDIN
          You know Mr. Lowenstein.

They shake and Lowenstein gives him a cheerful grin.

Racine shakes his hand. Hardin motions Racine into a
chair and moves back around the desk.

                         HARDIN
          I asked Mr. Lowenstein to join us
          because he's handling the inquiry
          into Edmund's death for the County
          Prosecutor's office. He and I have

                 (to Racine)
          As I've told Mrs. Walker, I was more
          than a little surprised by the
          existence of this new will. Edmund
          hadn't mentioned anything about it
          to me.

Hardin looks at Racine a beat, but Racine has nothing to
say.

                          HARDIN
          Mrs. Walker explained to me that
          when she and her husband decided to
          make some minor changes, they just
          took care of it up here for
          simplicity's sake. And, indeed, as
          you know, the new will is almost
          identical to the old but for the
          disposition of a few items.
                  (to the group in
                   general)
          At the risk of oversimplifying, the
          thrust of the will is to divide the
          estate in almost equal parts between
          Heather Kraft and Mrs. Walker. Would
          you agree with that assessment, Mr.
          Racine?

Racine nods.

                          HARDIN
          Mmmm. And you witnessed the    signing
          by Edmund Walker along with   this
          Miss --
                  (glancing at papers
                   on the desk)
          -- Mary Ann Simpson on July   twenty-
          first. Apparently, it will    be
          impossible for us to contact   Miss
          Simpson.

                         MATTY
          Mary Ann is a lifelong   friend of
          mine. She  happened to   be visiting
          on her way to Europe.    I'm sure when
          she returns she'll get   in touch with
          me.

                         RACINE
                 (eyeing Hardin)
          Although it's certainly not required.
          The witnesses to the signing of a
          will are not commonly available when
          the will is entered into probate.
          It's not standard by any means.

Hardin glances at Lowenstein, who watches impassively.

                         HARDIN
          Edmund Walker's death was not
          standard.

                         ROZ
                 (to Hardin)
          Pardon me. I'm sorry. I'm confused.
          Is there some question about the
          authenticity of the will?

Racine would like to kiss Roz; instead he turns with a
questioning look to Hardin.

                         RACINE
          I'm confused, too. Do you have a
          problem with the witnessing or the
          signatures? What is it you're getting
          at?

                         HARDIN
                 (almost wistful)
          No, there doesn't seem to be any
          problem here. This is Edmund Walker's
          last will and testament. I'm afraid
          the problem is elsewhere.

He reaches into his coat and brings out a gold cigar case.

                         HARDIN
          Would anyone mind if I smoked?

No one does. In fact, Racine, Matty and Roz all
immediately produce their own packs of cigarettes. The
effect is comical and everyone in the room laughs at the
group reflex. Roz notices that Lowenstein is not lighting
up and offers him one of hers.

                         LOWENSTEIN
          I don't need my own. I'll just
          breathe the air.

Roz smiles and tilts her head to blow a stream of smoke
toward the ceiling. We TILT UP with it as the white smoke
intrudes the clear air and --

                                                  WIPE TO:

The same space, thick with smoke, and TILT DOWN to the
assembled group, all of whom are focused on Hardin, except
for Lowenstein, whose glance dances about the rapt faces.

                         HARDIN
          Everything's in order up to there.
          The problem comes in the language of
          the bequest to Heather. It's a
          technical matter.

                         HARDIN (CONT'D)
          In writing the will, I'm afraid Mr.
          Racine violated what's known as "the
          rule against perpetuities.

Hardin watches Racine, who reacts minutely.

                         HARDIN
          It's a small thing, but it's the
          law. It forbids an inheritance to
          be passed down indefinitely for
          generations. Many general
          practitioner lawyers don't fully
          understand it. It doesn't come up
          much for them, because wills this
          complex are usually handled by estate
          departments in larger firms. Handled
          by lawyers who specialize in this
          type of work.

Matty turns a confused look to Roz who returns it
sympathetically. Hardin notes it.

                           HARDIN
          I know this is terribly confusing,
          but if you'll bear with me... I
          spotted the problem right away, but
          since Edmund's intent was clear, I
          thought it in everyone's best interest
          to try and get the will admitted
          into probate anyway, even though it
          was technically incorrect. I knew
          that a probate judge in Miami would
          spot the mistake right away. That's
          all they do all day, they're expert.
          So I thought I'd bring it up here to
          Okeelanta County -- since Edmund had
          the residence here -- and see if I
          could get lucky with a judge who
          didn't know estate law quite so
          well...
                  (dryly, he can't
                   resist)
          Perhaps find one with the same kind
          of training as Mr. Racine.

Racine watches him, his mind racing ahead too fast to
bother being insulted. Lowenstein can't help a small,
wincing smile. Now Hardin gets to his payoff and there
is no amusement in his tone.

                         HARDIN
          Unfortunately, my plan backfired. I
          ran into a judge who'd had other
          dealings with Mr. Racine. A Judge
          Costanza.

                         HARDIN (CONT'D)
          In fact, it seems there were problems
          with an estate in a case four years
          ago. Very different problems, it's
          true. But on a will Mr. Racine
          prepared. It was quite a mess.
          Accusations of carelessness, a
          malpractice suit...
                 (to Racine)
          I think he called it the Gourson
          case?

Racine watches him dully, then concentrates on taking out
a cigarette.

                         ROZ
          Once again, Mr. Hardin, you've lost
          me.

                         MATTY
          Yes, what does all this mean?

                         HARDIN
          It means, I'm afraid, that Edmund's
          will is invalid. Edmund Walker died
          interstate, as though there were no
          will at all.

Roz looks at Matty with panicky eyes.

                         MATTY
          So... what happens now?

Hardin looks her over coldly.    He doesn't believe she
doesn't know,

                            HARDIN
          You don't know?

                         MATTY
                 (irritated)
          No, I don't.

                         HARDIN
          Perhaps Mr. Racine would like to
          tell you.

Racine is recovering. He gives Hardin a quick, ugly look,
then turns toward Matty, and speaks quietly.

                         RACINE
          In the state of Florida, when a person
          dies without a will, and there are
          no children and no surviving parents,
          then the spouse inherits everything.

It seems to take a long moment for Matty to fully digest
this. It takes not quite as long for Roz.

Her face goes through several transformations: confusion
to disbelief to despair, then on in the direction of
outrage.

Lowenstein's eyes are flashing around at the faces.    He
seems genuinely amused.

                          MATTY
          My god.   You mean... it's all mine?

Hardin is an unconvinced audience.   He nods.

                         HARDIN
          Though that was clearly not your
          husband's intention.

                          MATTY
          My god.

                         HARDIN
          He intended Heather to benefit --

                         MATTY
                 (looking between
                  Hardin and Roz)
          Of course, of course, I understand.
          Of course.

                         HARDIN
          As you can imagine, Mrs. Walkers
          given the circumstances of Edmund's
          death, none of this is going to
          happen... how should I say it...
          simply.

Matty seems still in shook.

                         MATTY
          ... Of course...

EXT. PARKING LOT BEHIND SHILLER, HASTINGS (WEST PALM
BEACH) - DAY

Matty, Racine, Roz, Lowenstein and Hardin stand talking
in a little cluster near the building. They say their
good-byes with much handshaking. Matty lays a reassuring
hand on Roz's arm and kisses her on the cheek. As she
breaks from the crowd, Racine walks with her. The others
stand talking a little longer. Racine takes off his jacket
in the blazing Heat. He is very aware of the little group
behind them as he walks with Matty to her Mercedes. When
they are out of earshot --

                         RACINE
          You look good in black.

                         MATTY
          I've missed you so badly.   I need
          you.

                         RACINE
          At first I couldn't figure out when
          you got ahold of my stationery and
          stuff. It finally came to me...
          Edmund's signature must have been a
          snap. And you knew I wasn't gonna
          challenge mine --

                         MATTY
          Please stop. I don't blame you for
          hating me right now.

                         RACINE
          You've really done it, Matty.    You
          really have.

Behind them the group breaks up, Hardin goes back into
the building and Lowenstein walks Roz the short distance
to her car. Matty reaches the door of her car and turns
to Racine.

                         MATTY
          Will you come to the house tonight?

She takes his hand and shakes it for show.

                         MATTY
          I want you more right now than I
          ever have. I know how you must feel
          about me. But please come tonight.

                         RACINE
          I hope you haven't done us in.

Matty gets into her car.

At the far end of the parking lots Lowenstein has been
watching them as he makes his way to his car. Now, as he
moves between two rows of cars, he executes a few nifty
dance steps, just like Fred Astaire.

EXT. RACINE'S BUILDING - DAY

Racine, jacket over his shoulder and briefcase in hand,
leaves the Stingray at the curb and goes into the big
house of which his apartment is the top floor.

INT. STAIRWAY - RACINE'S BUILDING - DAY

Racine trudges up the dark steps in the heat. As he
approaches the door to his place, he senses that someone
is there. He tries the knob and the door swings open
slowly, revealing Peter Lowenstein, reading a book at the
bookcase and, lounging out on the porch, Detective Oscar

comes in,

INT. RACINE'S APARTMENT - DAY

Racine gets rid of his briefcase and jacket as Grace comes
in from the porch.

                         RACINE
          Hi, guys. Just come on in, make
          yourself at home.

          Sorry about that.

                         LOWENSTEIN
          Not me. The door was unlocked,
          inviting illegal entry. It's behavior
          like that makes Oscar's job so hard.

                         RACINE
          Sorry, Oscar. Would you guys a beer?

                         LOWENSTEIN
          No thanks, I already had one.

Oscar indicates "no" as Racine takes one from the
refrigerator for himself and begins unbuttoning his shirt.

                         GRACE
          I've gotta bring my wife up here.
          She thinks our house is the hottest
          place in the county.

                         RACINE
          It ain't great this time of day.

There is a pregnant pause as Racine takes off his shirt
and leans against the refrigerator.

                         GRACE
          Ned, how did you get involved with
          this Matty Walker?

                         RACINE
                 (takes a drink)
          What do you mean?

          I mean she's poison, man. Tell me
          what you know about her old man's
          death.

                         RACINE
          What read in the paper. He died in
          the fire. Looks like arson--

          Was arson.

                         RACINE
          Okay, was arson. You don't know if
          he was setting it and messed up...
          or if that's just what someone wanted
          it to look like.

                         GRACE
          Nah, he didn't set it.   Somebody
          offend him.

                         RACINE
          His people owned the place or
          something?

                         GRACE
                 (nods)
          That's right. A very rough group of
          fellows, too. They're arguing with
          the insurance company right now.
          It's possible they wanted to cut old
          Edmund out. I'm sure they're not
          too broken up over his departure.
                 (grimaces)
          But this just doesn't seem like a
          neat way to handle something like
          that.

                         LOWENSTEIN
          It's not their style. They're very
          smooth. They'd rather destroy you
          than kill you. And they hate
          publicity.

Racine takes it in, sucks on his beer.

                          GRACE
          Course guys like that make a lot of
          enemies. Coulda been a grudge match
          from the outside, I suppose.
                 (he looks at Racine)
          But me, I'm kinda interested in the
          grieving widow.

Racine looks a little skeptical. He thinks about it as he
moves to a chair.

                         LOWENSTEIN
          Her sister-in-law's got plenty of
          ideas along that line, too. She
          could barely contain herself today,
          I could tell.
                 (he cackles)
          But she wants to wait and see how
          Matty treats her on the estate. She
          doesn't want to blow it.

                 (shrugs)
          They asked me to re-do the will. I
          met with her and Edmund. It was
          pretty simple. This Mary Ann Simpson
          witnessed it with me. Walker didn't
          seem to think it was any big deal.

                         GRACE
          That's it?

                         RACINE
          That's it.

                         GRACE
          What was this Simpson's story?

                         RACINE
          I don't know... old friend of theirs,
          good-looking broad. She was just
          passing through.

                         GRACE
          On her way to Europe?

Racine shrugs, he doesn't know.

                          GRACE
          The passport people can't find any
          record of that.

Lowenstein and Grace look at him a long time.

                         GRACE
          What do you think? About the wife?

Racine considers a moment.

                          RACINE
          I suppose it's possible. I don't
          know much about her, except --
                 (he grins)
          -- what I've seen. Wouldn't shock
          me, either way.

                         LOWENSTEIN
          I've got a feeling she's very bad
          news. Take some incredibly
          intelligent advice and stay away
          from her.

                         GRACE
          He's right for once.

They both get up to leave. Racine watches from the chair.

                         RACINE
          Well, I'm sorry, guys.    I'm afraid I
          can't do that.

                           GRACE
          Why not?

                         RACINE
          First of all, did you get a look at
          her?

They did. Racine grins. He stands up and comes right up
to them.

                         RACINE
          That wouldn't be quite so meaningful,
          except that today she started coming
          on to me. And maybe you haven't
          heard but the lady is about to come
          into a great deal of money.

They look at him with some concern.

                           RACINE
          The fact   is, she's invited me out to
          her place   tonight. And I'm going.
          And I'll   keep on going as many nights,
          or days,   or weekends, as she'll have
          me.

                         LOWENSTEIN
          Ned, that lady may have just killed
          her husband.

Racine smiles cheerfully and puts a reassuring arm around
Lowenstein's shoulder, leading him to the door.

                         RACINE
          Peter, she's not gonna inherit
          anything by killing me.

Lowenstein is out the door now. He looks at Racine in
wonder. He shakes his head and goes down the steps.
Racine turns, smiling, to Grace, but Oscar is grim.

                         GRACE
          Ned, you've messed up before. You'll
          mess up again. That's your nature.
          But they've always been small-time.
          This might not be. She's trouble,
          Ned. The real thing. Big-time, major
          league trouble. Watch yourself.

Racine reassures his friend with touch and Oscar leaves.

INT. WALKER HOUSE - ENTRY HALL - NIGHT

Matty closes the front door behind Racine and wraps her
arms around him. She kisses him hard and long on the mouth,
then starts on his neck. He begins to push her away but
she clings to him, eating him up.

                         MATTY
          I know. I know. I know you'd
          probably like to kill me. I know.
          But please... you can hate me...
          punish me... hurt me if you want,
          but don't talk yet.

She takes his hand and drags him to the steps and leads
the way up, her eyes on him always.

                         MATTY
          Please, Ned.

He lets her lead him up the stairs.

INT. MATTY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

They lie in bed. The wind chimes TINKLE outside.

                         MATTY
          ... Mary Ann and I left Wheaton
          together and went to Chicago. We
          didn't know what we were doing. I
          got in bad trouble with drugs. Speed.
          Really bad. I did things...
                 (she looks up at
                  him)
          Whatever's the evilest thing you can
          think of me now, I did worse things
          then. There's nothing lower than
          the animal I was then. Worse than
          you can imagine. I thought I would
          die. I prayed I would... And then
          a man helped me. He got me clean.
          He didn't want much in return,
          either... He was a lawyer and he
          put me to work in his office. I
          learned a lot there. One time I
          even thought I might go to law school.
          ... That's where I picked up the
          business about making a will invalid.
          That happened to him once. I swear
          I would never have used that if I'd
          known about your case... I was afraid
          to tell you, Ned. I knew you wouldn't
          let me do it. I'm greedy, like you
          said. I wanted us to have it all.

She moves up over him and looks into his face.

                         MATTY
          I don't blame you for thinking I'm
          bad. I am. I know it. I'd
          understand if you just cut me off
          now. If you never trusted me again.
          You'd probably be smart. But you
          must believe one thing. I love you.
          I love you and need you. I want to
          be with you forever.

She puts her head on his chest as Racine lights a
cigarette.

                         RACINE
          They already think you're involved.

                            MATTY
          I don't care.

                            RACINE
          Great.

                         MATTY
          There's nothing we can do about it
          now. In a little while we'll either
          have the money or we won't. It's
          out of our hands.

Racine thinks about this awhile.     He exhales a stream of
smoke.

                         MATTY
          I fired the housekeeper. We can
          stay together as long as we want.
          We're all alone here now.

                                     SLOW, SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

INT. WAITING ROOM - DETECTIVE BUREAU - DAY

Lowenstein makes Heather and Roz comfortable in the waiting
room, then goes through the gate partition, nods at the
Cop Clerk on duty, and goes into Oscar Grace's office, re-
closing the door behind him.

INT. GRACE'S OFFICE - DAY

It's cramped, hot, cluttered. There is one other door
out of the office. Grace has his feet up on his desk.
He's nursing a bottle of Coke and looking at Racine, who
stands across the office, leaning on a file cabinet and
glaring between sentences. Racine gives Lowenstein an
ugly look then returns his attention to Grace. Racine is
angry, but in control.

                            RACINE
          That's right.

                         RACINE (CONT'D)
          I've been down there a lot lately.
          Isn't that amazing? Miami. Jesus.
          I'm handling the purchase of some
          property down there. I'll be going
          back in the future... if that's all
          right, if it's still legal to go to
          Miami.

There is silence.   Lowenstein looks between them, speaks
to Grace.

                          LOWENSTEIN
          He is mad.

                         RACINE
          Nooo. No, I'm not mad. Why should
          I be mad just because my friend here,
          who I've know for years, wants to
          know of my whereabouts on the night
          of our recent local murder?

                         LOWENSTEIN
          It's not so recent anymore.   Maybe
          he's feeling some pressure.

Grace is pained by all this, but his tone is scolding,
defensive.

                         GRACE
          You brought this on yourself, man!
          I don't run this department, you
          know. There are people watching
          this thing. They hear you're out
          there banging the widow every night;
          it tends to call attention to you.
          So don't give me shit.

Lowenstein goes to Oscar's desk and takes a pull from the
bottle of Coke.

                         RACINE
          That's my business!

                         GRACE
          This whole damn case is getting crazy.

                         LOWENSTEIN
                 (to Grace)
          Did you tell him about the glasses?

Grace, exasperated, indicates that he didn't.

                         LOWENSTEIN
          Seems Walker always ware glasses --
          steel-rimmed glasses. He was a real
          fanatic about them.

Racine is still staring at Grace.    He barely seems to pay
attention.

                         LOWENSTEIN
          But there were none on the scene.
          Coroner says they should've been
          there. He says that even after the
          fire the frames should've been seared
          into his -- well, you don't want to
          hear the details.

                            RACINE
          So what?

                         GRACE
          So it's looking more and more like
          he was killed somewhere else and
          brought there in his own car. Your
          honey, his wife, says he left the
          house in the middle of the night
          driving himself to some mysterious
          meeting. Is that vague enough for
          you?

                         RACINE
          Look, what is this? What do you
          want? Am I supposed to be an
          undercover agent for you guys, or
          something?

                         LOWENSTEIN
          Interesting choice of phrase.

                         RACINE
          How 'bout tonight I ask her? 'Say,
          did you kill your husband? My friends
          were just wondering...'

                         LOWENSTEIN
          Hey, that's an idea. Ask her where
          the glasses are, where she did it...
          Anything else I'm forgetting, Oscar?

                            OSCAR
          Just one thing.

Lowenstein looks at him a long moment.    Racine watches
them.

                         LOWENSTEIN
          Oh, yeah! Right, right. You'll
          love this, Ned, this latest
          development. Maybe you'll be able
          to work up a little sympathy for us,
          see why Oscar here has a tendency to
          get carried away. Tell him, Oscar.
          This is rich.

                         OSCAR
          This is from the sister-in-law, the
          Kraft woman. She's been driving me
          batty lately. She's convinced she
          ain't gonna be out into the will.
          It seems that a couple weeks before
          the murder, Walker's niece stayed up
          there for a while with your friend
          Matty. One night she waxes up, goes
          to see her aunt and catches the lady
          with some guy.

The three men look at each other.   Lowenstein breaks into
laughter.

                           LOWENSTEIN
          Do you get it?    In the act or some
          fucking thing!

                         GRACE
          We haven't got all the details yet.
          Mrs. Kraft is bringing the little
          girl up here today to tell us her
          story.

                         LOWENSTEIN
                 (to Grace)
          Oh, they're here. I ran into them
          on the way in. They're waiting
          outside.

                         GRACE
          Christ. I'm not sure I'm up to
          dealing with this scene.

There is a long pause.   The other two look at Racine.

                         GRACE
                 (to Racine)
          Listen, you probably don't want to
          see the Kraft woman right now. She's
          a little wild. Why don't you slip
          out the back way here?

Racine looks first at Lowenstein, then at Grace.

                         RACINE
          Are we done here?

                         GRACE
                 (nods, looking at
                  his notes)
          I've got it all here. And, Ned, I'm
          sorry I had to ask.

Racine is neutral.   He indicates the front entrance.

                            RACINE
            I'll go out this way. I've had a
            lot of experience with disgruntled
            people.
                    (to Lowenstein)
            I'll be over to Stella's, if you
            want to have some lunch.

Lowenstein nods.   Racine opens the door and goes out of
the office.

INT. WAITING ROOM - DETECTIVE BUREAU - DAY

Racine walks out of Grace's office. Lowenstein watches
him go. Heather is absorbed in a magazine and Roz is
distracted with her cigarette. Racine could keep on
walking, but instead he walks over to Roz. She jumps
when he speaks to her.

                           RACINE
            Hello, Mrs. Kraft.

She seems confused about how to act toward him.   Heather
looks up casually. Racine shakes Roz's hand.

                           ROZ
            Hello, Mr. Racine.

                           RACINE
            How are you making out?

                           ROZ
            We're all right, I guess.

Racine crouches in front of Heather and smiles at her.

                           RACINE
            You must be Heather.

She nods.   He shakes her hand.

                           RACINE
            I'm Ned Racine, Heather. I've heard
            a lot about you. It's nice to meet
            you.

Heather nods uncertainly.

                            HEATHER
            Thank you.

                           RACINE
            I'm sorry our town is so hot for
            your visit.

          Goodbye.

Racine walks away.   Heather watches him go.   Roz turns to
Heather.

EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

Racine walks down the sidewalk and enters Stella's Coffee
Shop.

INT. STELLA'S COFFEE SHOP - DAY

As Racine comes in the front door, Stella is leaning over
the counter in a gossipy huddle with a Cop and Glenda,
the Meter Maid. When Stella notices Racine, she breaks
off suddenly and moves away. The Cop and Glenda see Racine
and go back to their food with great deliberateness.
Racine takes all this in and settles at the other end of
the counter.

                         STELLA
                 (too boisterous)
          Hi, Racine. How you doing today?

                         RACINE
          I'm fine, Stella. I'm fine.    What's
          the latest? Any hot news?

                         STELLA
          Nothing much doing. What'll it be?

                         RACINE
          What's the special?

                          STELLA
          Veal outlets.

                         RACINE
          What day'd you cook 'em?

                         STELLA
          They're fresh this month.

Racine signals for her to bring it on.   He swivels around
and looks out at the Court House.

                                                  WIPE TO:

LATER.

Same shot. Lowenstein appears on the sidewalk across the
street. He crosses over to Stella's and comes in.

    Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                98.


He spots Racine and comes over to the counter with a light
dance-walk, breaking into actual dance only as he
Pirouettes before landing in the stool beside Racine.
Racine is almost done with his lunch.

                         LOWENSTEIN
                 (to Stella)
          The usual, my sweet.

                         STELLA (O.S.)
          Two ice teas for Fred Astaire.

Lowenstein looks at Racine and smiles.

                         LOWENSTEIN
          Are you ready to hear something wild?

                         RACINE
          I don't know. I may have had my
          share for the day.

                         LOWENSTEIN
          No, this is right up your alley.

Stella puts the two ice teas in front of Lowenstein.
Lowenstein has to give her a look before she backs away.
Lowenstein leans in confidentially toward Racine.

                         LOWENSTEIN
          Little Heather comes out onto the
          back porch, and this dude is out
          there with her aunt, see? And he's
          turned away with his pants or shorts
          or whatever dropped, so he's mooning
          the little girl, right. And he and
          your friend are going at something
          which Heather couldn't quite figure
          out.

Lowenstein begins to shake with laughter; he almost falls
off the stool. Racine is confused. Lowenstein recovers
his balance and lowers his voice again. There are tears
in his eyes.

                         LOWENSTEIN
          Poor little Heather! She's never
          seen one angry before. But it made
          quite an impression on her.
          Yessirree! That's all she can
          remember.

Lowenstein starts to choke with laughter.    He takes a
drink. Racine is smiling now, too.

                         RACINE
          That's it?

          One other thing. She says the guy's
          hair was greasy. He wore it slicked
          back. "Like a Cuban," she says. I
          loved that!

          Can you imagine poor Heather? She
          hustled back to bed after getting a
          gander at that. And listen to why
          she got up in the first place, this
          is the capper. She had a nightmare!
          Christ, can you imagine what kinds
          of dreams she had the rest of the
          night?

Lowenstein rocks with laughter.    And Racine does too.

INT. ENTRY HALL - WALKER HOUSE - DAY

Matty has been pushed roughly across the entry hall. Her
back hits hard against the wall at the front of the central
hall. She rubs  her wrist where the skin is red and looks
with frightened eyes at Racine.

                            RACINE
          Don't say that.     Don't say you don't
          have them.

                          MATTY
          I swear to you, I don't.     What's
          wrong with you?

                         RACINE
          They had to be here when you cleaned
          up that night. Think about it, think
          hard. They've probably got my prints
          on them.

                          MATTY
          I must have missed them. I wasn't
          looking for them. I thought they
          were on Edmund.

                         RACINE
          So where could they have gone?

                         MATTY
          I don't know.
                 (suddenly, a look)
          Betty!

                         RACINE
          The housekeeper?
                 (Matty nods,
                  thinking)
          Where would she have put them?     You've
          been through his things.

                         MATTY
          She might have taken them.

Racine thinks that's crazy.

                         MATTY
          Listen to me. That's why I fired
          her. After Edmund's death she started
          acting strange. She was always
          watching me, listening to my calls.

                         RACINE
          That's crazy. You imagined it. I
          know, I've been imagining things,
          too. Plenty.

                         MATTY
          No, Ned, not with her I wasn't. I
          could tell there was a difference.
          Maybe she know about us. Maybe she
          wants something.

                         RACINE
          Don't you think we would have heard
          from her by now?

Matty walks over and sits at the bottom of the steps.
She looks up at him.

                         MATTY
          I don't know what to think. I'm
          worried. But it's not about the
          glasses. Or your friends. It's us.

                           RACINE
          I'm sorry.

                         MATTY
          Your first reaction is to accuse me.
          What's happening to you? I don't
          know if we can hold on like this.

Racine sits next to her.   He rubs his eyes.

                         MATTY
          Hardin called today. He said
          everything should be cleared up by
          next week. I'll get the money
                 (a caustic smile)
          He apologized for the delay.

                         RACINE
          They've been stalling. They're
          draggin it out, hoping they'd come
          up with some way to implicate you.

Matty turns and leans against him, looking into his face,
full of love.

                          MATTY
          But they haven't been able to. Soon
          it'll be all ours. That's why we've
          got to hold together, Ned. It won't
          be long, then we'll get away from
          here. Out from under all this.
                 (a beat)
          All we have is each other. I'd kill
          myself if I thought this thing would
          destroy us. I couldn't take it.

His arms enclose her.

INT. REGISTRATION DESK - HILTON HOTEL - MIAMI - DAY

Oscar Grace has been talking to the Desk Clerk, who now
disappears and returns with the Hotel Manager.

INT. BOOKKEEPING OFFICE - HILTON - DAY

Oscar and the Hotel Manager watch as a Data Clerk extracts
a sheet of freshly-printed billing information from a
computer. He points to a section of the read-out.

EXT. PARKING STRUCTURE - HILTON HOTEL - DAY

Oscar talks to the Parking Attendant who handled Racine's
Stingray. Oscar looks around the structure.

INT. CORRIDOR - HILTON HOTEL - DAY

The door to a hotel room is open in the foreground, but
Oscar is down the hall looking at the door to the
stairwell.

INT. MIAMI POLICE DEPARTMENT - DETECTIVE BUREAU - DAY

Oscar sits across the desk from a Plainclothes Cop, who
is talking on the phone. The Plainclothes Cop hears what
he wants on the phone and nods to Oscar, tapping a spot
on a list that lies before him. Oscar gets up and looks
to see where he's pointing.

EXT. HERTZ RENT-A-CAR OFFICE - DAY

Oscar can be seen inside, talking to the Attendant on
duty.

EXT. REAL ESTATE OFFICE - NIGHT

Oscar, totally beat, sits in his car. The Real Estate
Agent we saw with Racine comes up, unctuously ushering
Two Businessmen. As he shows them inside, Oscar approaches
him, getting out his I.D. He and the Real Estate Agent
shake hands.

EXT. THE MOON AND THE OCEAN - NIGHT

It's the middle of the night. Bright under a full moon.
And very quiet. The surf can be heard LAPPING at the beach.
And then we hear HUMMING.

EXT. THE PIER - NIGHT

No sign of life. Still the HUMMING; it's a Broadway show
tune.

EXT. END OF THE PIER - NIGHT

Lowenstein is there, all alone, silhouetted in the
moonlight. He uses the rail like a ballet bar, returning
to it each time he finishes a small combination of dance
steps. The moves are not extravagant, there is not
highkicking. Just a nice, smooth little combination that
Lowenstein is repeating, again and again.

He HUMS his own accompaniment. Then, softly at first,
from the distance, comes the THUMPING of running shoes on
old wood. It grows as Lowenstein completes another
repetition. When the THUMPING has gotten close, it slows,
then stops raggedly. Lowenstein looks that way.

                           RACINE (O.S.)
                   (out of breath)
          Peter?

                           LOWENSTEIN
          Hi, Ned.

Racine walks up, dripping sweat, already extracting his
cigarettes from his shorts.

                         RACINE
          What are you doing here?

                         LOWENSTEIN
          I've been looking for you.

                           RACINE
          Yeah?

                           LOWENSTEIN
          Yeah.    You always run this late?

                         RACINE
          Nah. I'm going to Miami tomorrow.
          I'm not gonna have time.

                         LOWENSTEIN
          What's in Miami?

                         RACINE
          I'm closing this real estate deal
          I've been working on.

    Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                103.


Lowenstein nods and turns to lean over the rail. Racine
offers him a cigarette. Lowenstein accepts and Racine
lights both of theirs. Lowenstein glances at Racine's
pack as Racine puts it away.

                          LOWENSTEIN
          You're some kind of health nut.
                 (Racine smiles)
          Matty Walker smokes that same brand.
          I noticed that.

                         RACINE
          Is this gonna be one of those
          conversations? Maybe I should have
          my lawyer present.

                         LOWENSTEIN
          Buddy, your lawyer is present.

They look at the ocean.

                         LOWENSTEIN
          You know, that Edmund Walker was a
          bad guy. The more I find out about
          him, the happier I am he's dead. I
          figure it's a positive thing for the
          world.

                         RACINE
          You're not known for being a
          hardliner.

                         LOWENSTEIN
          Mmm. I have my own standards. I try
          to keep them private.
                 (he looks at his
                  cigarette)
          As far as I'm concerned, I don't
          care who killed him. And I don't
          care who gets rich because of it.
                 (shakes his head)
          But Oscar, Oscar's not like that.
          His whole life is based on doing the
          right thing. He's the only person I
          know like that. Sometimes it's a
          real pain in the ass. Even for him.

Lowenstein glances at Racine, but only for a moment.

                         LOWENSTEIN
          Oscar's unhappy right now. He's in
          pain.

                          RACINE
          Why is that?

    Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                104.


                          LOWENSTEIN
          Because he likes you. He likes you
          even better than I do.
                 (long pause)
          That's why he's been busting his
          butt trying to locate this Mary Ann
          Simpson. They finally found her
          place in Miami yesterday, but the
          woman herself was gone... looked
          like she left in a hurry.
                 (a beat)
          Oscar thought any story she could
          tell might help you. He thinks you
          need help.

Racine turns around, drapes his arms back along the rail
and lets his head loll, like a tired runner.

                         LOWENSTEIN
          Someone's putting you in deep trouble,
          my friend. From about three thirty
          to five AM on the night Walker was
          killed, someone called your hotel
          room repeatedly. The hotel didn't
          want to put them through, but whoever
          was calling convinced them it was an
          emergency. The phone rang and rang,
          but you didn't answer.

Racine looks at him.

                         LOWENSTEIN
          Don't say anything. Save it for some
          Other time. It gets worse.
                 (he stamps out his
                  butt)
          Now someone's trying to give us
          Edmund's glasses. We don't know who.
          We don't know what the glasses will
          tell us. But our negotiations are
          continuing.

Lowenstein steps away, toward the street. He looks sad.

                         LOWENSTEIN
          I wish I knew what to tell you, Ned.
          But I don't have any good ideas.

He turns and walks away.

                           LOWENSTEIN
          I'll see ya.

Racine watches him go. He takes out his pack of cigarettes
and extracts one. He stares at the pack in his hand.

EXT. FRONT TERRACE - WALKER HOUSE - NIGHT

The house is dark. Racine tries the door a last time.
(He's still in his sweaty running clothes.) No good. No
one here. Racine peers inside one final time. He is looking
through the new glass in the same little window shot out
by Edmund's gun. The wind chimes TINKLE loudly.

EXT. INTERSTATE 95 - DAY

Racine's Stingray whips south in the morning light.

INT. RACINE'S CAR - DAY

Racine is shaved and showered and wearing a tie, but he
doesn't look fresh. His mind is elsewhere. He looks off
to his left. Miami sits on the horizon.

INT. ELEVATOR - SKYSCRAPER - DAY

The elevator is packed with lawyers. They're heading out
to lunch. They wear expensive suits. Racine is backed
into a corner. He watches them, as though from a distance.
He looks different from them.

INT. LOBBY - SKYSCRAPER - DAY

The lawyers pile out of the elevator. A few carry
briefcases. Racine finally appears. He too carries a
briefcase. He looks across the huge lobby at the entrance
to a restaurant/bar.

INT. RESTAURANT/BAR - SKYSCRAPER - DAY

Racine sits at the bar with a drink. Once more, he glances
diagonally to the end of the bar, at a guy in a three-
piece suit. The guy seems to be looking at Racine whenever
he isn't watching the front entrance. Finally the guy can
control himself no longer. He picks up his drink and walks
around the bar to the space next to Racine. His name is
MICHAEL GLENN and he's bright, successful and irritating.
The two men are on the edge of remembering each other.

                         GLENN
          We know each other, don't we?
                 (Racine smiles,
                  uncertain)
          I'm Michael Glenn. With Bashford,
          Hillerman.

The smile fades from Racine's face.

                           RACINE
          Ned Racine.

It comes back to Glenn in a flash. He wishes he hadn't
come up.

                         GLENN
          Christ, I've done it again.
                 (embarrassed,
                  indicates the
                  entrance)
          I'm just meeting some people.

Racine nods. Glenn looks him over, smiles; he's
ingratiating.

                         GLENN
          Hey, this is silly. You're not still
          mad about that Gourson business?
                 (Racine shrugs,
                  takes a drink)
          We had to do it. Costanza practically
          insisted we sue you. Listen, nobody
          at our place likes malpractice against
          other lawyers.

                           RACINE
          Forget it.

Glenn remembers something. He smiles confidentially.

                         GLENN
          I tried to make it up to you.

Racine looks at him blankly.

                         GLENN
          Did you ever meet a lady named Matty
          Walker? You'd remember her. A very
          hot number.

                           RACINE
          Matty Walker?

                         GLENN
                 (glances at the
                  entrance)
          Yeah. I met her at a party. She said
          she was going up there and she wanted
          to know about lawyers. I gave her
          your name.

                           RACINE
          When was this?

                         GLENN
                 (trying to remember)
          I don't know... long time. Maybe
          September.

Racine stares at him. Glenn sees his party at the entrance.
He offers his hand.

                             GLENN
           Oops, gotta go.

                          RACINE
           Did you tell her about the Gourson
           case?

                          GLENN
                  (a slimy grin)
           Hey, I was trying to get you work.

He starts to move away. Racine grabs him by his tie and
pulls him back hard. The people nearby turn in alarm.
Racine speaks very quietly to the startled Glenn.

                          RACINE
           Did you tell her about Gourson?

                          GLENN
           Jesus, are you nuts?

Racine twists his grip on Glenn's tie. Glenn starts to
choke.

                          GLENN
           Maybe I told her how we met. Yeah,
           maybe.

Racine lets him go.

EXT. FRONT OF WALKER HOUSE - DUSK

Racine's Stingray tears up the drive and SQUEALS to a
stop in the parking area. Racine looks at the house from
the car. It looks deserted as before. He pulls the Stingray
onto the lawn and drives all the way around the house,
then out the drive through his own dust.

EXT. PORCH - RACINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Racine stares out at the ocean. He lights another cigarette
and lifts a glass of bourbon to his lips. Suddenly, he
laughs, short and harsh. But the smile fades quickly.

INT. RECEPTION AREA - RACINE'S OFFICE - DAY

Racine comes in carrying his briefcase. Beverly looks him
over critically; he doesn't look so good.

                          BEVERLY
           Is there something wrong with your
           phone?

                          RACINE
           Just off the hook. What?

                         BEVERLY
          Teddy Laursen is in County. He's
          very anxious to talk to you. He
          sounded bad.

Racine nods, turns back to the door.

                         BEVERLY
          Hey, are you all right?

Racine stops for a moment and looks at her. He smiles and
goes out.

INT. COUNTY JAIL - VISITING ROOM - DAY

Teddy Laursen sits across the table from Racine. Teddy,
too, looks a little ragged. Nervous.

                         TEDDY
          I don't know. It's a thing in
          Lauderdale. Something must've gone
          wrong, but they're not telling me.
          I'm a little worried.

                           RACINE
          I'll find out.

                         TEDDY
          No, no. That's not why I called you.
          In fact, I got me another lawyer.

Racine watches him.

                         TEDDY
          I think it would be better. You know
          Schlisgal.

                         RACINE
                 (nods, confused)
          He's good.

Teddy looks around nervously. Racine waits.

                         TEDDY
          This broad came to me last week. A
          real looker. She said you told her
          how to reach me, I figured you musta,
          she knew all about it.
                 (Racine nods)
          She said you wanted another one.

Teddy searches Racine's face, trying to see if the story
was true. He's not surprised that it's not.

                          TEDDY
          Yeah, I was afraid of that. But I'm
          a slow thinker.

                 (lowers his voice
                  even more)
          She had me show her how to rig it to
          a door, with a little delay. Does
          any of this mean anything to you?

Racine looks at him blankly.

                         TEDDY
          Then I'm glad I told you. Watch your
          step.

                           RACINE
          Thanks, Teddy.

Racine pushes his chair back. Teddy seems torn about saying
more. He forces himself to --

                         TEDDY
          Racine... Don't thank me yet. These
          guys here, they've been asking me
          about The Breakers.
                 (reads Racine's
                  look)
          I haven't told 'em shit. But I don't
          like the look on their faces.

Racine gets up.

INT. RACINE'S OFFICE - DAY

Racine listens to the endless ringing on the other end of
his call and slowly hangs up. The phone rings in the
reception room and Beverly picks it up, then hits the
hold button.

                         BEVERLY
                 (yells)
          Ned. It's Mrs. Walker. Do you want
          her?

                           RACINE
          Yeah.
                   (he picks up)
          Hello.

                         MATTY
                 (filtered throughout)
          Hello, Ned. Can we talk?

Racine swivels in his chair so that he can see Beverly in
the reception room. Beverly is just replacing the receiver
on the hook and for a moment, she gives Racine a strange,
ambivalent look. Racine watches her as she goes back to
work and speaks quietly into the phone.

                     RACINE
      Okay. Where are you?

                     MATTY
      I'm in Miami. I've been running around
      like crazy and I could reach you
      before I left.

                     (a pause)
      Ned, everything's going to be all
      right.

                     RACINE
      Tell me.

                     MATTY
      I've got the money. I've taken it
      and sent it somewhere safe. It's all
      ours now.
             (Racine says nothing)
      But that's not the best part.

                     RACINE
      What's the best part?

                     MATTY
      The glasses. I got them back. That
      is, they should be ours by now.
      Betty had them. She wanted money.
      That's why I had to come down here.
      She made it all very difficult, but
      I think it worked out.

                     RACINE
      Do you have them?

                     MATTY
      No. She wouldn't do that. She's
      putting them in the boathouse. In
      the top drawer of the dresser in the
      boathouse. They should be there
      now, if she's kept up her end.

                     RACINE
      Yes.

                     MATTY
      I think you'd better get them right
      away. I don't trust her.

                     RACINE
      In the boathouse.

                     MATTY
      That's right. The top drawer of the
      dresser. Oh. Ned, we're going to be
      all right. I'll leave here as soon

          as I can. I should be there by seven-
          thirty. I can't wait to see you,
          darling. We've made it.

Racine is silent.

                         MATTY
          Are you all right?

                           RACINE
          Yes.

                         MATTY
          Good-bye, sweetheart.

She clicks off. Racine puts down the phone and stares at
it.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - COUNTY JAIL - DAY

Teddy Laursen watches as Oscar Grace and another Detective
come into the room. They look grim.

                         GRACE
          Teddy, this is Detective Knapp from
          the Fort Lauderdale Arson Squad.
          He's brought some very bad news about
          that fire. Seems there were two people
          who didn't get out.

Teddy reacts. It's the first time for him.

                         GRACE
          I know, Teddy. It's not like     you.
          And I'm willing to make that     clear
          to anybody who'll listen. But     you're
          going to have to help me out     on this
          Breakers business.

Teddy looks at him. Teddy is hurting.

INT. RACINE'S CAR - DUSK

Racine drives. The Stingray passes the sign --

                     "You are entering
                         PINEHAVEN
                    Please drive safely"

The town looks well tended.

EXT. BOAT HOUSE - WALKER HOUSE - DAY

Racine comes down the lawn. He walks slowly toward the
boathouse. His walk is unsteady. Racine moves around to
the front of the boathouse and steps onto its wooden porch.

      Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org              112.


Racine's focus is on the doorknob of the closed door.
But he moves past it to the window. The curtains have
been carefully drawn across it; it is impossible to see
beyond them into the boathouse. Except... except for one
little slice at the bottom of the window where the curtains
are held apart a fraction of an inch by something. Racine
crouches down to look through the crack.

WHAT RACINE SEES. The curtains are being held apart this
little bit by a wire. A wire which is attached to the
window and runs tautly back into the gloom of the
boathouse. Racine shifts his head an inch and he can see
another wire. It originates from that same spot back in
the gloom and runs toward the door, although Racine, with
this limited view, cannot actually see where the wire is
attached. But Racine is not really trying --

Racine has rocked back on his heels away from the window.
He stands up and steps away from the boathouse. You might
call it a stagger.

INT. GRACE'S OFFICE - POLICE STATION - NIGHT

Lowenstein is in a chair. Grace is turned away, looking
out the window at the dark street. They both look dejected.
After a long silence --

                            LOWENSTEIN
            Stupid. That's always been the
            problem.
                   (a beat)
            Her mind encompasses his.

                           GRACE
            I better go get him.

EXT. REAR OF WALKER HOUSE - NIGHT

The house looms darkly. Racine has packed the Stingray in
the black shadows of the big tree behind the house, hiding
it. He starts to walk back around the driveway side of
the house when something catches his eye at the other end
of the house. He walks over there.

Close to that far wall, in shadow as deep as the one he
has just used is, to Racine's surprise -- Matty's
Mercedes. Racine stares at the car.

EXT. RACINE'S BUILDING - NIGHT

Grace comes out of the house and walks to his car,
thinking.

INT. EDMUND'S CLOSET - MATTY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Racine pushes aside some clothes and reaches up to a high
shelf. He feels around until he's got what he wants.

    Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                113.


He pulls down the wooden case and opens it. Inside is
Edmund's .38 revolver.

EXT. DRAWBRIDGE ACROSS THE CANAL - NIGHT

Grace's car is among a dozen held up by the raised
drawbridge. A sailboat is gliding slowly through. Grace
is outside his car, leaning against it.

EXT. GAZEBO -- WALKER HOUSE - NIGHT

Close on Racine's watch -- ten-o-five.

The wind chimes on the gazebo TINKLE. Racine sits smoking
in the shadows. He takes another drink from a glass of
liquor. All the lights on the lawn, gazebo and boathouse
are off. Racine hears something and peers toward the
driveway. Headlights move very slowly up the drive toward
the house. It is Edmund's Cadillac, glowing in the
moonlight.

The Cadillac stops in front of the house and for several
moments nothing happens. Then Matty gets out of the car
Waterway.

She is wearing the same white dress she was wearing when
Racine first saw her and she is luminous in the moonlight.

Racine watches from the blackness of the gazebo. Silently.

Matty walks twenty feet past the gazebo and stops when
she can make out the boathouse in the gloom. She stares
at it a moment then turns back toward the house.

Racine steps to the edge of the gazebo. Matty seems
startled for only a split second.

                            MATTY
          Hello, darling.

                            RACINE
          Hello, Matty.

                         MATTY
          Where's your car?

                         RACINE
          In the back. With yours.

                         MATTY
          Why haven't you turned on the lights?

                            RACINE
          I could see.

Matty comes up the steps and puts her arms around him.
She closes her eyes as she hugs him. They are one figure
melded in the gloom.

                         MATTY
          It's all ours now, Ned. We could
          leave tonight if we wanted. It's
          over.

                          RACINE
          Yes, it is.

                          MATTY
                 (voice changed)
          What's this --?

Suddenly she backs away from him, down the steps, her
white dress moving back into the bright moonlight from
the shadow of the gazebo. She looks up at Racine.

                         RACINE
          It's Edmund's gun. You remember it,
          don't you?

He has it in his hand now. He looks it over casually, but
the barrel is toward her.

                         MATTY
          What is it, Ned? What's happened?

                         RACINE
          I think you know.

                          MATTY
          No.   I swear to you, I don't!

                         RACINE
          It's the glasses, Matty.

                         MATTY
          Weren't they there? Didn't she bring
          them?

                         RACINE
          I didn't see them.

                         MATTY
          She promised she'd bring them.

                         RACINE
          Maybe I missed them. The way you
          missed them that night.

                         MATTY
          Ned, I don't know what you think,
          but you're wrong. I haven't done
          anything to hurt you. I love you.
          You've got to believe me.

                         RACINE
          Keep talking, Matty. Experience shows
          I can be convinced of anything.

EXT. STREET NEAR WALKER PLACE - NIGHT

Grace's car moves up the street past the gated drives.

EXT. BACK LAWN - NIGHT

Racine is at the bottom of the gazebo steps now. Matty
has backed away, toward the Waterway.

                         MATTY
          I did arrange to meet you. But, Ned,
          it all changed. You changed it. I
          fell in love with you. I didn't plan
          that...

Racine laughs, short and bitterly.

                          RACINE
          You never quit, do you? You just
          keep on coming.

                         MATTY
          How can I prove it to you? What can
          I say?

                         RACINE
          The glasses, Matty. Why don't you go
          down there and get them?

Matty is silent. She starts to speak, but nothing comes
out. Now there is real fear in her eyes.

                         MATTY
          But you said they weren't there.

                         RACINE
          I said I didn't see them.

EXT. DRIVEWAY - WALKER HOUSE - NIGHT

Grace's car moves down the drive.

EXT. BACK LAWN - NIGHT

Racine has moved closer to Matty, away from the house.
They are only six feet apart. Tears are now rolling down
Matty's cheeks.

                         MATTY
          I'll go, Ned. I'll go and look for
          them.

She turns and starts walking toward the ocean. Just as
she is about to disappear into the shadows, she turns
back to him.

                         MATTY
          Ned... no matter what you think, I
          do love you.

AT THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE

Grace has gotten out of his car. He starts toward the
front door, but sees Racine out on the lawn. He heads out
in that direction, but stops as Racine steps into a bright
spot of moonlit lawn and the gun's shiny silverplate glints
in the light. The gun is pointed at the retreating Matty.

Grace pulls his own gun from a shoulder holster and raises
it. He is about to call out, when Matty disappears
completely in the gloom. Racine lowers the revolver wearily
and stares out toward the boathouse. Grace lowers his
gun and looks out there too. He moves slowly forward.

Close on Racine's face. It's changing now. It's not just
that he's very tired. The hardness is going out of his
look. As the seconds tick by, and Matty does not reappear,
he begins to lose faith in his view of the world. He begins
to be afraid. Afraid for Matty. Even now.

A sudden breeze starts the wind chimes TINKLING loudly.

                         RACINE
          No, Matty! Stop! Don't go in! Matty.

Racine breaks into a run, dropping the revolver on the
grass. He has taken two big strides when --

There is a sound like the ROAR of a dragon, and the roof
of the boathouse lifts and then disappears in a huge BALL
OF FLAME. The air is  sucked around Racine's body, whipping
at his clothes, as he stumbles on the lawn and falls
forward.

Grace steadies himself against the side of the gazebo.

Racine knows horror. He struggles to his feet and stumbles
toward the fire. His body is silhouetted against the
leaping, ROARING flames in the night sky.

                                       SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

INT. RACINE'S CELL BLOCK - FLORIDA STATE PENITENTIARY -
NIGHT

Absolute quiet. We move above cell after cell, dark with
sleeping convicts.

We stop at Racine's cell. It is dark like the rest. Racine
is in there alone. We move down close to his sleeping
form. He looks thinner.

    Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                117.


Suddenly he wakes with a start! His eyes snap open wide;
he is totally and instantly awake. He talks to himself,
with true amazement.

                         RACINE
          She's alive.

INT. VISITORS CENTER - FLORIDA STATE PENITENTIARY - DAY

Grace sits on the other side of the glass from Racine.
They talk on telephones. Grace's eyes are sad; they say
he thinks Racine is going crazy.

                         RACINE
          But what if that was someone else's
          body in there? What if it was already
          there when I got there -- dead and
          waiting for me. Maybe her friend...
          Mary Ann.

                         GRACE
          Her teeth were left, man. We sent
          them back to Illinois. The
          identification was positive. That
          was her, that was Matty Tyler Walker.
          That was her and she's dead.

                         RACINE
          You're not listening to me. What if
          she's been using this other girl's
          name? Since she met Walker three
          years ago, since she first spotted
          him and decided to take him... one
          way or another. Maybe Walker -- or
          any of us -- never knew her real
          name.

                         GRACE
          Why would she want to hide her
          identity?

                         RACINE
          I don't know. Maybe there was
          something in her past, something so
          bad she was afraid it would queer it
          with Walker if he found out -- that
          he'd never marry her.

Grace is unreceptive to this. But Racine is charged.

                         RACINE
          Let's say she's living as the other
          girl, this girl from her past. Someone
          whose history she knew and could use
          any way she wanted. And there's only
          one person in the world who knows
          the truth.

                         RACINE (CONT'D)
                 (he leans in)
          And then just when Matty's got me on
          the line, when she's finally going
          to collect, that one person shows
          up. That girl. Finds her. And
          threatens to expose her. So Matty
          starts paying her off. Maybe she
          even promises to cut her in on
          Edmunds' money. Now she's got to
          share it with two people.

Racine peaks, tapping the glass between them as though it
were all there for Grace to see.

                         RACINE
          But when Matty sees a way to get rid
          of both of them at once. A way to
          solve all her problems and get clear,
          with no one looking for her. At the
          boathouse. You find two bodies, me
          and this girl. Two killers dead.
          Case closed.

Oscar isn't buying.

                         RACINE
          You can't find the money, can you,
          Oscar? Doesn't that tell you
          something?

                            GRACE
          It tells    me she moved it and we can't
          find it.    And that don't mean shit.
          It could    be sittin' in any bank in
          the world    waiting for a dead lady to
          come for    it.

Racine, calmer now, shakes his head "no."

                         GRACE
          Do you hear what you're saying? It's
          crazy. This Matty would've had to
          been one quick, smart broad.

Racine confirms Grace's fears with a look that can only
be called half-crazed. There's the glimmer of a rueful
smile.

                         RACINE
          Oscar, don't you understand? That
          was her special gift she was
          relentless.
                 (much quieter)
          Matty was the kind of person who
          could do what was necessary. Whatever
          was necessary.

These words have no special import to Grace. He looks at
Racine without hope.

                         GRACE
          Racine, you got to face something.
          You killed Edmund Walker, man. And
          you're going down for it. Two people
          are dead. And no matter how you want
          to figure it, you ain't bringin'
          either of 'em back to life.

Grace gives him a long look, then hangs up the phone. He
stands up and walks away. Racine sits and stares.

                                             DISSOLVE TO:

INT. RACINE'S CELL BLOCK - DAY

Racine, bearded now, comes to the front of his cell to
get his mail. A Trustee hands through a book-size manila
envelope, which has been neatly opened by the prison
authorities. Racine looks at the return address and becomes
very intense. He sits on his cot and slides out a book. A
letter is clipped to the front. Racine scans it quickly
and begins looking through the book.

It is an old high school yearbook. Racine's fingers are
shaking slightly as they leaf quickly past black and white
scenes of youthful innocence among the Wheaton High School
Cougars of 1966.

He reaches the individual pictures of the seniors and hi
hurries through the O's and R's to the T's.

Racine's eyes are darting over the pages. Suddenly they
stop. He has found her entry. We see it too --

MARY ANN TYLER
Home Economics "Matty"
TRI-Y 29 39 4. CHORUS
Ambition -- "To Graduate"

The picture is not great. The pretty face is a little
cheap-looking. It is not the Matty he knew. It is her
friend from the back verandah, Mary Ann.

Racine's eyes dart. He thinks. Then, he flips back a few
pages. He finds what he wants --

MARY ANN SIMPSON
English
TRI-Y 2, 3, 4; CHORUS 2, 3, 4
HOMECOMING PRINCESS 3, 4; SWIMMING 2, 3
Ambition-- "To be rich and live in an exotic land."

We're very close on the type of her ambition when we pan
up the page to her smiling face. Her smile is so big, she
seems almost to be laughing.

Racine's face. That's the woman he loved.

Back to her picture. We're moving in on it. Closer. Closer.
And then through it --

To her real face, this Matty, this Mary Ann, alive and
fine in the sun of --

EXT. A HIGH PATIO - AN EXOTIC LAND - DAY

One shot, very close on that lovely face, moving around
it in a tight half-circle that barely lets us glimpse the
sun-drenched, foreign town far below and the tropical
foliage that surrounds the patio. For one brief moment,
she seems to be crying. But no, it is not a tear. It is a
little drop of sweat. She wipes it from her cheek as she
turns to an unseen male COMPANION, who has spoken to her
in Spanish. She wipes her eyes and looks off at him.

                         COMPANION (O.S.)
          Hace Calor.

                         MATTY
          What?

                         COMPANION (O.S.)
          It is hot.

                         MATTY
          Yes.

She turns her face to the sun.

                                               FADE OUT.

                        THE END
"BONNIE & CLYDE"

FADE IN.

INT. BEDROOM.  CLOSE-UP OF BONNIE PARKER.  DAY

Blonde, somewhat fragile, intelligent in expression.  She is
putting on make-up with intense concentration and
appreciation, applying lipstick and eye make-up.  As the
camera slowly pulls back from the closeup we see that we
have been looking into a mirror.  She is standing before the
full-length mirror in her bedroom doing her make-up.  She
overdoes it in the style of the time: rosebud mouth and so
forth.  As the film progresses her make-up will be refined
until, at the end, there is none.

The camera pulls back and continues to move very slowly
throughout the first part of this scene.  As the camera
continues to move away, we see, by degrees, that BONNIE is
naked.  Her nudity is never blatantly revealed to the
audience, but implied.  That is, she should be "covered" in
various ways from the camera's P.O.V., but the audience must
be aware of her exposure to CLYDE later in the scene.  This
is the only time in the film that she will ever be this
exposed, in all senses of the word, to the audience.  Her
attitude and appraisal of herself here are touched with
narcissism.

The bedroom itself is a second-story bedroom in a lower-
class frame house in West Dallas, Texas.  The neighborhood
is low income.  Though the room reveals its shabby
surroundings, it also reveals an attempt by BONNIE to fix it
up.  Small and corny objets d'art are all over the tops of
the bureaus, vanity tables, etc. (Little glass figurines and
porcelain statuettes and the like.)

BONNIE finishes admiring herself.  She walks from the mirror
and moves slowly across the room, the camera moving with
her, until she reaches the screened window on the opposite
wall.  The shade is up.  There are no curtains.  She looks
out the window, looking down, and the camera looks down with
her.

EXT. BEDROOM.  BONNIE'S P.O.V.  DAY.

Over her shoulder, we see the driveway leading to the garage
connected to the house.  There is an old car parked in the
driveway, its windows open.  We see a man walking up the
driveway, somewhat furtively.  He is a rather dapper fellow,
dressed in a dark suit with a vest, a white collar, and a
straw boater.  It is CLYDE BARROW.  Obviously, he is about
to steal the car.  He looks it over, checking around him to
make sure no passers-by are coming.  He peers inside the
front window to see if the keys are in the ignition.  He
studies the dashboard.  BONNIE continues watching, silently.
Finally she calls out.

                                                            2.


                         BONNIE
            Hey, boy!  What you doin' with my
            mama's car?

EXT. DRIVEWAY.  DAY.

CLYDE, startled, jumps and looks to see who has caught him.
Obviously frightened, he looks up and his face freezes at
what he sees.

EXT. WINDOW.  CLYDE'S P.O.V.  DAY.

We now see what he is looking at: at the open window,
revealed from the waist up, is the naked BONNIE.  She looks
down, an impudent half-smile on her face.  She doesn't move
or make any attempt to cover herself.

EXT. CLOSE-UP OF CLYDE - DAY -

-- whose face changes from astonishment to an answering
smile of impudence.  (Seeing what he has, he realizes that
this girl is clearly not going to scream for the police.
Already they are in a little game instigated by BONNIE,
sizing each other up, competing in a kind of playful
arrogance.  Before they speak, they have become
coconspirators.)

Close-up of BONNIE, still smiling.  Finally she speaks.

                         BONNIE
            Wait there!

INT. BEDROOM.  DAY.

Running from the window, she flings open a closet and grabs
a dress, and shoes.  She slips on the shoes, and flings the
dress on, running out the door as she does.  The camera
tracks with her, moving as fast.  As she runs down the
stairs she buttons up the dress.

EXT. DRIVEWAY.  DAY.

She flies out the door, slamming it behind her, runs off the
porch (all this has been one continuous movement since she
left the window, in great haste) and continues quickly into
the driveway.  Four feet away from CLYDE, she stops on a
dime.  They stand there, looking at each other, smiling the
same challenge.  For a few seconds, no one speaks, then:

                         BONNIE
                   (putting her on)
            Ain't you ashamed?  Tryin' to steal
            an old lady's automobile.

                                                            3.


                         CLYDE
                   (with the same put-on)
            I been thinkin' about buyin' me one.

                         BONNIE
            Bull.  You ain't got money for
            dinner, let alone buy no car.

                         CLYDE
                   (still the battle of
                   wits going on)
            Now I got enough money for cokes,
            and since it don't look like you're
            gonna invite me inside--

                         BONNIE
            You'd steal the dining room table
            if I did.

                         CLYDE
                   (he moves from his spot)
            Come to town with me, then.  How'd
            that be?

                         BONNIE
                   (starting to walk
                   onto the sidewalk)
            Goin' to work anyway.

EXT. STREET.  MOVING SHOT.  DAY.

The camera tracks.  It is a hot Texas afternoon, all white
light and glare.  As they walk the block to town in this
scene, their manner of mutual impudence is still pervading.

                         CLYDE
            Goin' to work, huh?  What do you do?

                         BONNIE
            None of your business.

                         CLYDE
                   (pretending to give
                   it serious thought)
            I bet you're a...movie star!
                   (thinks)
            No...A lady mechanic?...No...A
            maid?--

                         BONNIE
                   (really offended by that)
            What do you think I am?

                                                            4.


                         CLYDE
                   (right on the nose)
            A waitress.

                         BONNIE
                   (slightly startled by
                   his accuracy, anxious
                   to get back now that
                   he is temporarily
                   one-up)
            What line of work are you in?  When
            you're not stealin' cars?

                         CLYDE
                   (mysteriously)
            I tell you, I'm lookin' for suitable
            employment right at the moment.

                         BONNIE
            What did you do before?

                         CLYDE
                   (coolly, knowing its effect)
            I was in State Prison.

                         BONNIE
            State Prison?
                   (she shows her surprise)


                         CLYDE
            Yeah.

                         BONNIE
                   (herself again)
            Guess some little old lady wasn't
            so nice.

                         CLYDE
                   (tough)
            It was armed robbery.

                         BONNIE
                   (sarcastically)
            My, my, the things that turn up in
            the driveway these days.

They reach the corner and turn.  They are on:

EXT. MAIN STREET.  DAY.

--a small-town street of barber shops, cafes, groceries, etc.
At the moment, it is deserted.  They continue walking down
the empty street.  CLYDE looks the place over.  Tracking.

                                                            5.


                         CLYDE
            What do y'all do for a good time
            around here, listen to the grass
            grow?

                         BONNIE
            Guess you had a lot more fun up at
            State Prison, huh?

CLYDE laughs, enjoying her repartee.  They continue walking.
At a hydrant, CLYDE stops.

                         CLYDE
                   (showing off, but seriously)
            See this foot?
                   (pointing at his
                   right foot)
            I chopped two toes off of it.  With
            an axe.

                         BONNIE
                   (shocked)
            What?  Why?

                         CLYDE
            To get off the damn work detail,
            that's why.
                   (stopping)
            Want to see?

                         BONNIE
                   (a lady of some sensitivity)
            No!...
                   (turning a cute)
            I surely don't intend to stand here
            and look at your dirty feet in the
            middle of Main Street.

They continue walking in silence past a few stores, each
planning what next to say.

                         BONNIE
            Boy, did you really do that?

                         CLYDE
            Yeah.

                         BONNIE
            You must be crazy.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

                                                            6.


EXT. GAS STATION.  DAY.

Gas station up the block.  BONNIE and CLYDE are seen leaning
against the soft drink chest, their profiles silhouetted by
the bright sun.  They are drinking cokes.  As they begin to
talk, the camera moves in closer to them.  CLYDE takes off
his hat and rubs the cold coke bottle across his forehead.
BONNIE watches him.

                         BONNIE
            What's it like?

                         CLYDE
            Prison?

                         BONNIE
                   (very interested)
            No, armed robbery.

                         CLYDE
                   (he thinks it a silly question)
            It's...I don't know...it isn't like
            anything.

                         BONNIE
                   (thinking she's heard
                   proof that he's a liar)
            Hah!  I knew you never robbed bo
            place, you faker.

                         CLYDE
                   (challenged)
            Oh, yeah?
                   (studies her, then
                   makes up his mind to
                   show her)


Close-up.  Gun.  Day.  He reaches in his jacket and pulls
out a gun.  The camera moves to a closeup of the gun,
glinting in the sunlight.

EXT. STREET.  DAY.

The camera pulls back to show BONNIE looking at it with
fascination.  The weapon has an immediate effect on her.
She touches it in a manner almost sexual, full of repressed
excitement.

                         BONNIE
                   (goading him on)
            Yeah, well you got one all right, I
            guess...but you wouldn't have the
            gumption to use it.

                                                            7.


                         CLYDE
                   (picking up the
                   challenge, proving himself)
            You just keep your eyes open.

EXT. LITTLE GROCERY STORE ACROSS THE STREET.  DAY.

The camera remains just behind BONNIE's shoulder so that
throughout the following scene we have BONNIE in the picture,
looking at what we look at.

CLYDE goes into the little store.  We remain outside with
BONNIE watching.  For a minute nothing happens.  We can
barely see what is going on in the store.  Then CLYDE comes
out, walking slowly.  In one hand he holds the gun, in the
other a fistful of money.  He gets halfway, to BONNIE and
smiles broadly at her, a smile of charm and personality.
She smiles back.  The moment is intense, as if a spark has
jumped from one to the other.  Their relationship, which
began the minute BONNIE spotted him in the driveway, has now
really begun.  CLYDE has shown his stuff and BONNIE is
"turned on."

Suddenly the old man who runs the grocery store comes
running out into the street, completely dumbfounded.  He
stands there and says nothing, yet his mouth moves in silent
protest.  CLYDE points the gun above him and fires.  It is
the first loud noise in the film thus far and it should be a
shock.  The old man, terrified, runs back into the store as
fast as he can, CLYDE quickly grabs BONNIE's hand.  The
camera swings with them as they turn and begin to run down
the street.  A few yards and the stores disappear entirely.
The landscape turns into that arid, flat and unrelieved
western plain that begins where the town ends.

EXT. STORE.  AT THE EDGE OF TOWN.  DAY.

A car is parked at the back of the store.  As soon as they
reach it, CLYDE motions and BONNIE gets in.  CLYDE runs to
the front, lifts up the hood and crosses the wires to make
it start.  As he stands back, BONNIE calls to him:

                         BONNIE
            Hey, what's your name, anyway?

                         CLYDE
                   (he slams the hood)
            Clyde Barrow.

He runs over to the door, opens it, shoves her over, and
starts up the engine.  The entire sequence is played at an
incredible rapid pace.

                                                            8.


                         BONNIE
                   (loud, to make
                   herself heard over
                   the gunning motor)
            Hi, I'm Bonnie Parker.  Please to
            meet you.

EXT. ROAD.  DAY.

VROOM!  The car zooms off down the road, doing 90.  The fast
country breakdown music starts up on the sound track, going
just as fast as the car.

EXT. CAR.  DAY.

The car, still speeding, further down the road.  We zoom
down and look in the rear window.  CLYDE is driving, we see
from behind.  BONNIE is all over him, biting his ear,
ruffling his hair, running her hands all over him--in short,
making passionate love to him while he drives.  The thrill
of the robbery and the escape has turned her on sexually.

EXT. CAR.  ANOTHER ANGLE.  DAY.

The camera pulls back and above the car.  The car starts to
go crazy in a comical fashion, manifesting to the audience
just what is happening to the driver controlling it.  The
car swerves all over the road.  The car comes to a sudden
halt.  The car starts again.  It swerves this time almost
right off the road before it straightens out.  It jumps and
jerks.  Another car comes down the road the other way and
CLYDE's car swerves so much as to make the other guy drive
right off the road into the dirt.  It is almost Mack Sennett
stuff, but not quite that much.

INT. CAR.  BONNIE AND CLYDE.  DAY.

BONNIE grabs the wheel and turns it sharply.

EXT. CAR.  DAY.

It hairpins off the road onto a shoulder beneath some trees.

INT. CAR.  BONNIE AND CLYDE.  DAY.

--still settling to a stop.  BONNIE and CLYDE appear to be
necking heavily now, punctuated by BONNIE's squeals of
passion as she squirms and hops about like a flea, trying to
get to CLYDE.  The floor gear-shift is keeping their bodies
apart, however.  In exasperation, BONNIE takes the gear
shift and shoves it forward out of their way.  She plunges
onto CLYDE, burying him from view.

                                                            9.


                         BONNIE
                   (kissing, biting)
            ...You ready?...

                         CLYDE
                   (muffled, laughing)
            ...Hey, wait...

                         BONNIE
                   (giggling herself)
            Aren't you ready?  Well, get ready!

BONNIE has obviously touched him.  With savage coquetry she
tears into her clothes and his.

                         BONNIE
                   (muffled)
            C'mon, honey, c'mon, boy...let's
            go...let's...

                         CLYDE
                   (muffled)
            Hey...hey, wait a minute...quit
            that now, cut it out.
                   (sharply)
            I said, cut it out!

He shoves her rudely away, slamming her into the far car
door.  Suddenly it looks as if they've been fighting.  Both
unbuttoned and unglued, they stare silently at one another,
breathing heavily.  CLYDE gets out of the car, clearly
shaken.  Despite the fact that he may have encountered this
situation many times before, it's one that no twenty-one-
year-old boy in 1932 is sophisticated enough to dismiss
easily with bravado.

BONNIE remains seated in the car.  She seems terribly
vulnerable.  She fumbles about for a cigarette, too confused
to figure out what didn't happen.  CLYDE turns back and
reaches through the car window from the driver's side,
lighting it for her.  BONNIE casts CLYDE a fishy stare, then
accepts the light.

                         CLYDE
                   (trying to be casual,
                   even insouciant)
            Look, I don't do that.  It's not
            that I can't--
                   (his voice cracks,
                   the match burns his
                   fingers, and he bangs
                   his head onto roof of
                   car, and he goes
                   right on)
            --it's just that I don't see no
            percentage in it.
                         (MORE)

                                                           10.


                         CLYDE (CONT'D)
            I mean there's nothin' wrong with
            me, I don't like boys.

BONNIE doesn't know what she thinks, and CLYDE is trying to
gauge her reaction--whether she feels rejected or repelled.
In fact, it's both--along with a little latent fascination.

                         BONNIE
                   (finally, spitting
                   out smoke)
            Boy...boy...boy...

                         CLYDE
                   (a little annoyed)
            Boy, what?

                         BONNIE
            Your advertising is dandy.  Folks'd
            just never guess you don't have a
            thing to sell.
                   (a little afraid)
            You better take me home, now.

                         CLYDE
                   (getting back into car)
            Wait!

                         BONNIE
            Don't touch me!

She gets out of car, leaving CLYDE draped across the front
seat, reaching after her.

                         CLYDE
                   (almost shouting)
            If all you want's stud service,
            then get on back to West Dallas and
            stay there the rest of your life!

This stops her.  Now CLYDE pours it on, with an almost
maniacal exuberance that becomes more controlled as he gets
control of BONNIE.

                         CLYDE
            But you're worth more'n that, a lot
            more, and you know it, and that's
            why you come along with me.  You
            could find a lover boy on every
            corner in town and it doesn't make
            a damn to them whether you're
            waiting on tables or picking
            cotton, so long as you cooperate.
            But it does make a damn to me!

                                                           11.


                         BONNIE
                   (turning, intrigued)
            Why?

                         CLYDE
            Why?  Because you're different!
            You're like me and you want
            different things.

BONNIE is hooked now.

                         CLYDE
                   (continuing)
            You and me travelin' together, we
            could cut clean acrost this state,
            and Kansas, too, and maybe dip into
            Oklahoma, and Missouri or whatnot,
            and catch ourselves highpockets and
            a highheeled ol' time.  We can be
            somethin' we could never be alone.
            I'll show you...when we walk into
            the Adolphus Hotel in San Antone',
            you wearin' a silk dress, they'll
            be waitin' on you and believe me,
            sugar, they're gonna know your last
            name.

He stops, having begun to woo her to something more intense
than a casual, physical coupling.

                         BONNIE
            When'd you figure that all out?

                         CLYDE
            First time I saw you.

                         BONNIE
            How come?

                         CLYDE
                   (intensely, with real honesty)
            'Cause you may be the best damn
            girl in Texas.

Close-up.  BONNIE.

                         BONNIE
            Who are you, anyway?

                                            CUT TO:

                                                           12.


INT. ROADSIDE CAFE.  BONNIE AND CLYDE.  DAY.

BONNIE and CLYDE seated in booth, now C.U. CLYDE.  The sound
track bridges the scene: the question that BONNIE has just
asked is now suddenly rebutted by CLYDE, as he points a
finger at her.

                         CLYDE
                   (not answering her,
                   preferring to lead
                   the conversation)
            I'll tell you about you.

He loves doing this and he does it well.  The more he
envisions BONNIE's life, the more instinctively accurate he
becomes.  She grows more and more fascinated, like a child
watching a mind reader.

                         CLYDE
            Lessee...You were born somewheres
            around East Texas...got a big old
            family, right?...You went to
            school, of course, but you didn't
            take to it much 'cause you was a
            lot smarter than everybody else
            anyway.  So you just quit.  Now...
                   (thinking, playing it
                   for all it's worth)
            ...When you were sixteen...no,
            seventeen, there was a guy who
            worked in...uh...

Pull back taking in BONNIE, favoring CLYDE.

                         BONNIE
                   (fascinated)
            Cement plant--

                         CLYDE
            Right.  Cement plant.  And you
            liked him 'cause he thought you was
            just as nice as you could be.  You
            almost married that guy, but
            then...you thought, no, you didn't
            think you would.  So you got your
            job in the cafe...
                   (getting closer to
                   home now, hitting
                   them right in there)
            And every morning you wake up and
            you hate it.  You just hate it.
            And you get down there and you put
            on your white uniform--

                                                           13.


                         BONNIE
                   (enthralled)
            Pink.

                         CLYDE
            And the truck drivers come in to
            eat greasy burgers and they kid you
            and you kid them back, but they're
            stupid and dumb, boys with big
            tattoos all over 'em, and you don't
            like it...And they ask you for
            dates and sometimes you go...but
            you mostly don't, and all they ever
            try is to get into your pants
            whether you want to or not...and
            you go home and sit in your room
            and think, when and how will I ever
            get away from this?...And now you
            know.

BONNIE is half-mesmerized by his talk.  A waitress comes
with their food.  A cheap, gaudy dame, she has spit curls on
each temple in the style of the times.  CLYDE looks at her
and at BONNIE, who also wears spit curls.  As soon as the
waitress leaves:

                         CLYDE
                   (pointing at her hair)
            Change that.  I don't like it.

Without a word of protest, BONNIE immediately reaches in her
bag and takes out a mirror.  She holds it up and with the
other hand, brushes back her spit curls into her hair.  She
never again wears them.  When she has pushed them back she
looks at CLYDE for his approval.  He nods his okay.  She
smiles, puts back her mirror and begins to eat her food.
She's ravenously hungry and eats with total concentration on
her plate.  CLYDE doesn't touch his food, just watches
BONNIE eat for a minute.

                         CLYDE
            God, you're a knockout.

EXT. ROADSIDE CAFE.  DAY FOR DUSK.

CLYDE and BONNIE emerge from the cafe into the early evening.
They move toward the car they have stolen.  Just beyond sits
a newer model car.  BONNIE is surprised to see CLYDE head
toward the newer car.

                         BONNIE
            Hey, that ain't ours.

                                                           14.


                         CLYDE
            Sure it is.

                         BONNIE
            But we came in this one.

                         CLYDE
            Don't mean we have to go home in it.

She walks amazed around the new car and gets in beside him.
He turns the key and they pull away from the cafe.

INT. ABANDONED FARM HOUSE.  A WIDE SHOT OF THE PARLOR LIVING
ROOM.  DAY.

The room is bare.  In the middle BONNIE is waking, having
slept on a couple of car seats covered with an old piece of
tattered blanket.  There are windows behind her.  She looks
about bewildered.

                         BONNIE
            Clyde...

She starts to panic and runs to the window.

                         BONNIE
                   (continuing)
            Clyde...

At another window CLYDE appears.

                         CLYDE
            Hey, lady.

                         BONNIE
                   (chagrined at her fear)
            Where you been keeping yourself?

                         CLYDE
            Slept out by the car.

                         BONNIE
            Oh...These accommodations ain't
            particularly deluxe.

                         CLYDE
            No...If they're after us, I want
            the first shot.  Come on, you got
            some work to do.

BONNIE moves to the door and out of the house.

                                                           15.


EXT. FARM HOUSE.  FRONT YARD.  DAY.

On the door is a sign which reads:

INSERT:

PROPERTY OF MIDLOTHIAN CITIZENS BANK -- TRESPASSERS WILL BE
PROSECUTED.

Wide angle.  Across fence.  Day.  On the dilapidated picket
fence six old bottles have been placed.  As BONNIE joins
CLYDE he turns and fires six quick shots.  The bottles
disappear.

                         BONNIE
            You're good.

                         CLYDE
            The best.

                         BONNIE
            And modest...

                         CLYDE
            Come on.  Got you all set up over
            here.

Wider angle.  They move around to the side of the building
where CLYDE points to a tire hanging by a rope from a tree.
He means that to be BONNIE's target.  He hands her a gun.

                         CLYDE
            Set her spinnin'.

BONNIE fires.  She misses.

                         CLYDE
            Again.  Come down slow with it...

BONNIE fires again and hits the tire.  She smiles and blows
the smoke from the barrel in pride and self-mockery.

                         CLYDE
            Ain't you something?  I tell you
            I'm going to get you a Smith and
            Wesson, it'll be easier in your
            hand.  Now try it again once...

BONNIE sights.  As she is about to fire, a man appears
around the corner of the building.  A FARMER.  She fires and
hits the tire.

                         FARMER
            Heighdo.

                                                           16.


CLYDE whirls at the sound.  He grabs gun from BONNIE because
his is empty.  He aims at FARMER.

                         FARMER
                   (frightened)
            No sir...no sir.  You all go right
            ahead.

CLYDE watches him warily.

                         FARMER
                   (continuing)
            Used to be my place.  Not any more.
            Bank took it.

CLYDE and BONNIE start to move toward the farmer.  All three
move around to the front of the building.  At a distance we
see an Okie car loaded with belongings.  A WOMAN with a BABY
in arms sits in front.  A smaller BOY stands outside the car.

                         FARMER
            Yessir, moved us off.  Now it
            belongs to them.
                   (He points at the
                   foreclosure sign.)


                         BONNIE
            Well, that's a pitiful shame.

CLYDE shakes his head sympathetically.  He loads the empty
gun.

                         FARMER
                   (bitterly)
            You're damned right, ma'm.

He looks up to see an OLD NEGRO who has come from a distance
shack and now stands near CLYDE's car.

                         FARMER
                   (nodding toward Negro)
            Me and him put in the years here.
            Yessir.  So you all go right ahead.
            We just come by for a last look.

He stands a moment looking at the house and then turns
around toward his family in the car.  CLYDE and BONNIE look
after him.  CLYDE spins and fires three fast shots into the
fore-closure sign.  The FARMER stops and turns, looking at
CLYDE.  CLYDE offers the gun to the farmer.  He looks at it,
then accepts it.  He slowly takes aim at the sign and fires.
It pleases him.  He looks at CLYDE and BONNIE who smile.

                                                           17.


                         FARMER
            You all mind?

BONNIE and CLYDE are puzzled.

                         FARMER
            Hey, Davis!  Come on over here.

The NEGRO moves toward them.  Now BONNIE understands.  She
takes the second gun from CLYDE and hands it to DAVIS.
DAVIS looks from BONNIE to the FARMER and toward the house.
The FARMER fires again.  This time at a window.  He nods to
DAVIS.  DAVIS slowly raises the gun and fires at another
window.  It shatters and they can't keep from laughing.  The
FARMER returns the gun as does DAVIS.

                         FARMER
                   (continuing)
            Much obliged.

He extends his hand.  CLYDE shakes it.

                         FARMER
            Otis Harrison.  And this here's
            Davis.  We worked this place.

                         CLYDE
                   (formally)
            Miss Bonnie Parker.  And I'm Clyde
            Barrow.

Across farmer's car.  Wide shot.  Day.  The FARMER turns and
moves toward his people.  DAVIS moves toward his shack.
CLYDE and BONNIE in the b.g.

Close angle.  BONNIE and CLYDE.

                         CLYDE
                   (continuing)
            We rob banks.

BONNIE turns quickly to look at CLYDE.  He smiles and nods.

                                            FADE OUT.

FADE IN.

EXT. A LONG, COUNTRY ROAD.  DAY.

A car is driving down it.  It is the next day.  BONNIE is
driving, CLYDE beside her.

                                                           18.


INT. CAR.  DAY.

                         CLYDE
            You just stay in the car and watch
            and be ready.
                   (he is playing it
                   cool, knowing she is
                   scared.  He thinks
                   he's James Cagney)
            Okay now?
                   (he hands her a gun
                   from the glove compartment)
            You just be ready if I need you.

BONNIE's hands are tense on the wheel.  Her face shows how
nervous she is now that the time has come.

                         CLYDE
            Scared?

                         BONNIE
            No.

They drive in silence.

                         CLYDE
            What are you thinkin' about?

                         BONNIE
            Nothin'.

EXT. BUSINESS STREET OF A LITTLE TOWN.  DAY.

We are still in the car.  BONNIE pulls over and stops by the
bank.  CLYDE is frozen in his seat.  We can see that, for
all his talk, he is scared, too.

                         BONNIE
            What are you waitin' for?

That gets him.  CLYDE throws the door open and jumps,
practically dives out the door.  The camera follows his
motion right inside the bank, tracking very fast.

INT. BANK #1.  DAY.

Something is very screwy here.  The bank is dark, the TELLER
is half asleep over his books.  CLYDE approaches, thrusts
the gun at him.

                                                           19.


                         CLYDE
                   (with a swagger)
            This is a stickup.  Just take it
            easy and nothin' will happen to you.
            Gimme the money.

                         TELLER
                   (looking up with no
                   fear, his voice calm
                   and conversational)
            Heighdy.

                         CLYDE
                   (nonplussed at this)
            Gimme the money!

                         TELLER
            What money?  There ain't no money
            here, mister.

                         CLYDE
                   (totally befuddled at
                   the turn of events)
            What do you mean there ain't no
            money?  This here is a bank, ain't
            it?

The camera pans around the bank.  We see that it is empty,
dusty and shuttered.

                         TELLER
            This was a bank.  We failed three
            weeks ago.

                         CLYDE
                   (furious)
            What?  What??

In a rage, he goes behind the partition, grabs the teller
and pushes him ahead with the gun.  CLYDE is fuming.  He
forces the teller out the front door.

EXT. BANK #1.  DAY.

--showing BONNIE in the car.  She is terrified as she sees
CLYDE and the TELLER coming at her.  She doesn't understand
what is happening.

                         CLYDE
                   (shoving the teller forward)
            Tell her!  Tell her!

                                                           20.


                         TELLER
                   (acting like a man
                   who has had his sleep
                   interrupted by lunatics)
            As I was tellin' this gentleman,
            our bank failed last month and
            ain't no money in it.  I sure am
            sorry.

BONNIE's reaction is one of hysterical relief and
appreciation of what's funny in the situation.  She laughs
uproariously, she can't stop laughing.  This makes CLYDE
madder than ever.  He shoves the teller to the ground.

INT. CAR.  DAY.

Completely humiliated, CLYDE gets in the car, shoving BONNIE
over.  She is still laughing.  BONNIE starts the car.  CLYDE
points his gun out the window.

Close shot.  Bank window--whereon is lettered: ASSETS-$70,000.

INT. CAR.  CLYDE AND BONNIE.  DAY.

Angle to include bank window.  CLYDE aims and puts a bullet
through each of the zeros.  We see each zero shot through.
Then the entire window hangs there for a second and suddenly
crashes.  On the soundtrack, BONNIE's laughter.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. CAR.  DAY.

--still driving.  BONNIE has still not fully recovered from
her mirth, but is quieting down because she sees that CLYDE
is really mad and can't be pushed too far.

                         CLYDE
                   (steaming)
            We got $1.98 and you're laughin'.

She tries to stop.

EXT. STREET.  DAY.

The car pulls down another street of shops in another little
hick town.  A grocery store ahead.

INT. CAR.

                         CLYDE
            Keep it running.

                                                           21.


INT. GROCERY STORE.  DAY.

There is an old CLERK behind the counter, and standing in
the b.g., almost out of our vision, is a BUTCHER--an enormous
giant of a man.  CLYDE steps up to the counter.

                         CLYDE
            Give me a loaf of bread, a dozen
            eggs and a quart of milk.

The CLERK gets the order and puts it in a bag.  He rings
open the cash register preparatory to asking CLYDE for the
money.  CLYDE pulls his gun.

                         CLYDE
            This is a stickup.  I'll take all
            the money in that drawer now.

He reaches over the counter into the cash drawer and grabs
the bills.  He smiles.  Suddenly looming beside CLYDE is the
BUTCHER, brandishing a meat cleaver.  Camera looks up at
this formidable sight as the cleaver comes crashing down,
missing CLYDE and sticking in the wooden counter.  He grabs
CLYDE around the chest in a bear hug and actually lifts him
off the ground.  The struggle is in silence.  CLYDE is
terrified, fighting wildly to get free.  The gun in CLYDE's
hand is pinned, because the man has CLYDE's arm pinned to
his thigh.  CLYDE tries to raise the barrel at an upward
angle to shoot, finally he is able to do so.  He fires.  The
bullet enters the BUTCHER's stomach.  The BUTCHER screams,
but reacts like a wounded animal, more furious than ever.
He still holds CLYDE in a fierce hug, staggering around the
store, knocking into shelves and spilling cans.  CLYDE is
hysterical with fear.  He shoots the BUTCHER again.  The
BUTCHER falls to his knees, but still he doesn't release
CLYDE.  In a panic, CLYDE drags the man to the door, trying
to get out.

EXT. GROCERY STORE.  DAY.

BONNIE sees CLYDE and the BUTCHER holding his legs.  She is
terrified.  CLYDE drags him out on the street.  The BUTCHER
won't let go.  CLYDE, in real panic, aims the gun at his
head and fires.  Click.  Out of bullets.  In blind fury, he
pistol-whips the BUTCHER's head with two terrific swipes.
Finally the BUTCHER lets go.  Hysterical, CLYDE jumps away
and leaps into the car on the other side.  BONNIE still at
the wheel.

                         CLYDE
            Get the hell out of here!

They drive-off at top speed.

                                                           22.


INT. CAR.  DAY.

CLYDE is shaken.  He speaks haltingly, panting; trying to
get control of himself.

                         CLYDE
            Damn him, that big son of a bitch...
            He tried to kill me... I ain't got
            eyes in back of my head... I didn't
            want to hurt him.  It wasn't a real
            robbery... Some food and a little
            bit of dough.  I'm not against him.
            Damn!

EXT. SPEEDING CAR.  DAY.

The car is speeding down an open road.  Suddenly it begins
to buck and cough.  There is something wrong with the motor.

CLOSE SHOT.  C.W. MOSS.  EXT. FILLING STATION.

His cherubic cheeks are puffed up as he blows into the fuel
lines of CLYDE's car.  There is a distinctly flat sound.

Reaction: CLYDE and BONNIE.  CLYDE stands by the hood.
BONNIE remains seated in the car.  CLYDE is covered with
sweat and grease--clearly he has gotten in his licks on the
engine without success.  Neither he nor BONNIE seems
impressed by the noise C.W. is making.

Another angle.  C.W.--as he screws back the fuel line and
moves between BONNIE and CLYDE to the ignition, turning the
engine over.  It purrs beautifully.  CLYDE is astonished.

                         CLYDE
            What was wrong, anyway?

                         C.W.
                   (moving back to screw
                   on gas cap)
            Air bubble--clogged the fuel line.

C.W. now stands between BONNIE and CLYDE.

                         C.W.
                   (continuing)
            I just blowed her away.

CLYDE still can't get over it.

                         CLYDE
            You just blowed it away.

C.W. belches.  He is embarrassed before BONNIE.

                                                           23.


                         C.W.
            'Scuse me, ma'm... Anythin' else I
            can do for you?

CLYDE nods vigorously, looking across C.W.'s back to BONNIE.
BONNIE gets the message.

                         BONNIE
            Well...I'm not sure...
                   (she looks around)
            Say, them little red things there
            stickin' up?  Are they gas pumps?

                         C.W.
                   (he's not too bright)
            Sure.

                         BONNIE
            Isn't that interesting?  How does
            that there gasoline get in my
            little old car?

                         C.W.
                   (trying to be helpful)
            Well, y'see, there's this tank
            underground, and the gas comes up
            this tube into the pump and into
            your car, M'am.

                         BONNIE
            My, you're a smart fellow.  You
            sure know a lot about automobiles,
            don't you?

                         C.W.
                   (he has no idea he's
                   being toyed with)
            Yeah, I do.

                         BONNIE
            Well, would you know what kind of a
            car this is?

                         C.W.
                   (touching it)
            Yeah, it's a Chevrolet 8-cylinder
            coupe.

                         BONNIE
            No, no.

                         C.W.
            Sure it is.

                                                           24.


                         BONNIE
            No, this is a stolen Chevrolet 8-
            cylinder coupe.

C.W. jerks his hand off it as if he touched a hot stove.

                         CLYDE
                   (getting in the conversation)
            You ain't scared, are you?
                   (to Bonnie)
            I believe he is.  What a pity.  We
            sure coulda used a smart boy who
            knows such a great deal about
            automobiles.
                   (suddenly business-
                   like, to C.W.)
            You a good driver, boy?

                         C.W.
                   (getting quite confused)
            I guess so.

                         CLYDE
                   (pretending to cool
                   on him)
            No, I don't think so.  He's better
            off here...

                         BONNIE
            What's your name, boy?

                         C.W.
            C.W. Moss.

                         BONNIE
            What's the C.W. for?

                         C.W.
                   (reluctantly)
            Clarence Wallace.

                         BONNIE
            I'm Miss Bonnie Parker and this is
            Mr. Clyde Barrow.   We... rob...
            banks.
                   (C.W. reacts with
                   wide eyes)


                         CLYDE
                   (swiftly, testing his mettle)
            Ain't nothing wrong with that, is
            there, boy?

                                                           25.


                         C.W.
                   (nervously)
            Uh, nope--

                         BONNIE
                   (with a put-on sigh)
            No, he ain't the one.

                         CLYDE
            Unless, Boy, you think you got
            enough guts for our line of work?

                         C.W.
                   (affronted in his
                   dumb way)
            What do you mean?  I served a year
            in the reform school.

                         BONNIE
            Oh, a man with a record!

                         CLYDE
                   (laughs)
            Now look here, I know you got the
            nerve to short-change old ladies
            who come in for gas, but what I'm
            askin' you is have you got what it
            takes to pull bank jobs with us?

                         BONNIE
            Mr. C.W. Moss?

                         C.W.
                   (anxious to prove himself)
            Sure, I could.  Sure I could.  I
            ain't scared, if that's what you
            think.

                         CLYDE
            Prove it.

C.W. walks away from the car.  Camera remains where it was.
We see him walk inside the gas station office, open the cash
drawer, close it and come out.  He emerges with a fistful of
money.  He walks over to BONNIE's window, sticks his hand
inside and drops the money on her lap.  We see the bills
flutter down.  Not a word is spoken.  BONNIE moves over into
the middle.  C.W. opens the door and gets in behind the
wheel.  For a moment we see them all sitting there, each
smiling their little smile.  CLYDE starts to hum a hillbilly
tune quietly.  The sound track picks it up (banjo and
violin, etc.) and as the music swells, they drive off down
the road.

                                                           26.


INT. HOSPITAL ROOM.  DAY.

A small room with a bed.  On it, covered by a sheet which
humps like a mountain over his enormous stomach, is the
BUTCHER.  His head is propped up on a pillow and he sips a
liquid through a bent glass straw.  Camera is on the left
side of the head of the bed, seeing the BUTCHER in a three-
quarter profile.  On the opposite side of the bed stands a
uniformed patrolman who is in the act of flashing mug-shot
photos for the BUTCHER to identify his assailant.  The
lawman holds a stack of them in front of them, swiftly
changing the cards like a grade-school teacher with her
flash cards.  At each picture, the BUTCHER grunts negatively
and goes on sipping from his glass straw.  One picture, two,
three go by.  The fourth picture is a mug shot of CLYDE.
Again the BUTCHER grunts 'no,' without hesitation.  As the
next picture comes into view, we

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. MOTEL.  NIGHT.

--on a painted wooden sign, lit by one attached light, which
reads: "MOTOR COURT".

INT. ROOM IN MOTOR COURT.  NIGHT.

--in darkness.  Camera is close on BONNIE.  She is awake and
restless.  O.S. comes the measured snoring that we will
think comes from CLYDE.  BONNIE raises up and kneels over
Clyde.  She needs him.  Clyde seems to snore on.  Camera
drops between them and we see that the snoring actually
comes from C.W.  BONNIE drops back on her pillow.  We cut
close on CLYDE.  He is awake.

INT. CAFE.  DAY.

BONNIE, CLYDE and C.W. seated in a booth in a cafe.  The
Waitress brings the food and serves everybody.  We see C.W.
With great concentration, as he does everything by relating
to the immediate action he happens to be involved with, he
takes the sugar shaker and begins methodically sprinkling
sugar over all his food.  He sugars the meat, the beans, and
the beets.  BONNIE and CLYDE watch this performance with
first, amazement and second, disgust.  They can't believe
what they see.

                         BONNIE
                   (incredulously)
            C.W., what are you doing?  Why do
            you do that?

                                                           27.


                         C.W.
                   (beginning to eat it)
            Why not?

                         BONNIE
            It's just disgusting, that's why.

                         C.W.
                   (chewing)
            Not to me it ain't.

                         BONNIE
            But...but it makes everything sweet!

                         C.W.
            Yeah, I know.

With a resigned expression, BONNIE turns away and begins to
eat.  Suddenly a look of consternation crosses C.W.'s face.

                         C.W.
            Damn!  No mayonnaise!

He gets up and goes down to the counter on the other end of
the restaurant, out of our vision, apparently planning to
put mayonnaise over the sugar.  The minute he is out of
earshot, BONNIE gets CLYDE's attention.

                         BONNIE
            Clyde, why does he have to stay in
            the same room as us?

CLYDE seems not to have heard the question.  He takes up the
sugar shaker and spreads a thin field of sugar on the dark
table surface.  He will sketch his plan in the sugar.

                         CLYDE
            Lemme show you about tomorrow.

                         BONNIE
            Why?

                         CLYDE
            Now C.W.'ll be waitin' right
            outside in the car.  Here is the
            teller's cage.  Four of them and
            over here the desks and what have
            you...

                         BONNIE
            Why, Clyde...

                         CLYDE
            Hmmm??

                                                           28.


                         BONNIE
            In the same room with us?

                         CLYDE
            Hell, where else?  Ain't gonna
            spread out all over the state...

The harshness of his tone concerns him and he recovers with
a smile.

                         CLYDE
                   (continuing)
            Not yet, anyway.  Now, the door to
            the bank is here now.  You cover me
            from there.

                         BONNIE
                   (takes his hand to
                   her face)
            Just that I love you so much.

                         CLYDE
            You're the best damn girl in Texas.

C.W. comes back with the mayonnaise; looks at the table.

                         C.W.
            Hey, you spilled the sugar.

Three shot.

                         CLYDE
                   (eating)
            The layout for tomorrow up in
            Mineola.

                         C.W.
            Mineola?  Gosh, that's four, five
            hundred miles from here!

                         CLYDE
            So what?  We take U.S. 85 to Willis
            Point, don't you know, and cut over
            on State Highway 28 at Kaufman,
            keep on goin' till we hit the farm-
            to-market road that connects to 105
            and that's right up by Mineola.  On
            a Saturday afternoon...

EXT. SMALL KANSAS TOWN.

The car driving into a small Kansas town.  It is Saturday
afternoon, sunny.  The streets are filled with people, cars,
wagons.  C.W.

                                                           29.


is driving, BONNIE is in front with him, CLYDE is in the
back.  C.W. looks scared to death at the idea of robbing a
bank.  The car pulls up in front of the bank, double-parked.
BONNIE and CLYDE get out.

EXT. CAR.  DAY.

                         CLYDE
            Keep it running.

BONNIE and CLYDE enter bank.

INT. BANK #2.  DAY.

Cut to the interior of the bank.  BONNIE and CLYDE come in,
assume the class positions--she at the door where she can
cover the bank, CLYDE at the first teller's cage.

                         CLYDE
                   (in a very quiet voice)
            This is a stickup.

                         TELLER
            What?

                         CLYDE
            This is a stickup.

This time everyone in the bank hears it.  The people gasp
and pull back.  CLYDE slowly edges toward the door and prods
BONNIE forward.  She carries a paper sack.  CLYDE motions
her to go from cage to cage and get all of the money.
BONNIE begins doing so, while CLYDE keeps his gun trained on
everybody.  We see BONNIE get the money from the first
teller, the second teller, then...

EXT. SMALL TOWN STREET.  DAY.

A car parked in a tight spot has just pulled out.

Close-up C.W.  Day--who suddenly looks delighted to see a
parking space.

EXT. CAR - STREET.  DAY.

Immediately he methodically begins to back in.  It's a tight
spot and he has to cut the wheel, pull forward, cut some
more, pull back and so on.  The scene, for the audience,
should be nervous and funny.

                                            CUT TO:

                                                           30.


INT. BANK #2.  DAY.

Inside the bank, BONNIE and CLYDE have filled the sack.
They run out the door, the camera tracks with them.

EXT. SMALL TOWN STREET.  DAY.

They run for where the car was, but it isn't there.  Then
they see C.W. has parked it.

INT. CAR.  DAY.

                         CLYDE
            Let's go!  Let's go!

C.W. suddenly realizes what a stupid thing he's done.

EXT. CAR.  STREET.  DAY.

C.W. tries to shoot out of the parking spot, but he can't.
He has to go through the business of backing up, cutting the
wheel and all of it.  The scene is one of pure pandemonium
and chaos.

INT. CAR.

                         CLYDE
            Come on!  Get it out!

EXT. CAR.  DAY.

A policeman arrives and begins firing at car.  C.W. gets the
car halfway out of the spot, scraping fenders in the process,
and the car is almost out when suddenly a face looms up at
the window--a dignified, white-haired, celluloid-collared
man, obviously a bank official who has leaped onto the
running board.  His screaming can barely by distinguished
from all the noise.

                         MAN
            Stop!

CLYDE fires through the window.

Close-up (special effects).  The face of the man explodes in
blood.  Then he drops out of sight.

EXT. CAR.  DAY.

The car shoots off down the road, doing ninety.  Police are
firing at the escaping car; BONNIE and CLYDE are shooting
out the back window; C.W. is almost having a nervous
breakdown at the wheel.

                                                           31.


EXT. STREET.  A MOVIE HOUSE.  DAY.

A police car that had been chasing CLYDE and BONNIE's car
comes down the street.  It is obvious that the cops have
lost them.  They are searching the street for a sign of
CLYDE's car.  They pass a movie house whose marquee reads:
"GOLDDIGGERS OF 1933."  They slow for a moment, decide that
is not a probable place to look.  They drive off.

INT. MOVIE HOUSE.  WIDE ACROSS AUDIENCE AT SCREEN.

The opening musical sequence of "Golddiggers" is on the
screen.  Ginger Rogers sings "We're In The Money."  Among
the audience we cannot make out our three people.  It is a
small audience and thinly dispersed.

Tight shot at audience.  Camera pans the audience while on
the track we hear the music of the song.  First of our group
who becomes visible is C.W.  He is staring at the screen and
eating bites from a candy bar in each hand.  Camera pans
further and we see that CLYDE is in the row behind C.W. and
a few seats to one side.  CLYDE is nervous and keeps watching
the entrance doors.  He is in a rage.  He shifts in his seat.

                         CLYDE
            Boy, you gotta be poor in the head.
            You...!  Count of you I killed a
            man.  Murder...you too.

Shot from behind CLYDE.  Shooting toward screen.

                         CLYDE
                   (continuing)
            Dumb ass stupid.

C.W. turns to CLYDE and nods agreement.  This infuriates
CLYDE even more.  He slaps the back of C.W.'s head.

                         CLYDE
            Ever do a dumb thing like that
            again, I'll kill you boy!

Angle at BONNIE.  She has been watching the movie; is now
disturbed by the noise.  She turns back to CLYDE from her
seat on the aisle.

                         BONNIE
            Ssshh!  If you boys want to talk
            why don't you go outside?

She smiles at her joke and turns back to the screen to the
movie which she is obviously enjoying enormously.

                                                           32.


INT. CHEAP MOTEL BATHROOM.  CLOSE-UP BONNIE.  DAY.

On the right of the screen, f.g., BONNIE stands at the sink
fixing her make-up in the mirror.  The make-up has become
more conservative.  On the left, further back, is a bathtub
and in it sits C.W.  His head and knees peek over the gray,
soapy water.  He is engaged with his usual single-minded
concentration, in washing himself, carefully scrubbing his
arms, not a thought in his head.  BONNIE finishes her make-
up and regards herself quizzically, tilting her head to look
at herself at different angles.  She is smoking a cigarette,
and really, studying herself.

                         BONNIE
            What do you think of me, C.W.?

                         C.W.
            Uh...well, you're just fine, I
            guess.  Uh, well, course you're a
            real good shot...and...uh...well,
            sometimes you look pretty as a
            painting.

Camera stays with BONNIE during all this, watching her look
at herself as she listens to C.W.'s evaluation.  She has a
narcissistic concern at the moment and as she hears him
enumerate her values, she thinks about each in turn and
decides yes, that's true.

                         C.W.
            Hey, uh, Bonnie...could you get me
            that washrag there?

Responding automatically, BONNIE turns and walks to a towel
rack, pulls the washcloth off and starts toward C.W. when
suddenly she stops with a smile on her face and a sudden
motion.  Teasingly, she holds the washcloth out at arm's
length.

                         BONNIE
                   (coyly)
            Why'nt you come get it?

                         C.W.
                   (not even realizing
                   what's on her mind)
            Huh?

                         BONNIE
                   (wiggling the
                   washcloth like a
                   bull-fighter's cape)
            Whyn't you come get it, C.W.?

                                                           33.


Suddenly C.W. looks mortally embarrassed as he realizes what
that would entail.

                         C.W.
            Aw, Bonnie, come on, gimme it.

BONNIE tries another tack.  She begins sauntering over
slowly, teasingly, still holding out the treasured washcloth.

                         BONNIE
                   (pertly)
            All right, I'll bring it myself.

As she moves closer to the tub, C.W. realizes that she will
be able to peer down into the tub and see him and he
frantically reaches up with one hand and yanks the washcloth
into the tub, causing a great splash.  BONNIE, somewhat the
victim of the splash, jumps back and away.  Recovering her
composure, she looks at C.W. who is slunk down in the tub
like a gross September Morn.  She has tried him and he has
failed; she realizes now that he was no choice for her; no
real man, even if he might perform sexually.  He is a lump.
This irritates her; his very presence is demeaning to
herself and CLYDE.

                         BONNIE
                   (irritated with
                   herself for even
                   thinking of such a thing)
            You simpleton, what would you do if
            we just pulled out some night while
            you was asleep?

                         C.W.
                   (trying to give the
                   right answer, but
                   obviously faking it)
            Oh, I wouldn't know what to do.
            But you wouldn't do that.  You
            couldn't now.

BONNIE realizes, with some weariness, the inevitable truth
of what he's said; thus resigned, she says patronizingly:

                         BONNIE
            That's right, C.W.  We'll always be
            around to take care of you.

Pointedly, she throws her cigarette in his bath-water,
"Sssssssssss."  She turns and leaves the bathroom, slamming
the door behind her.

                                                           34.


INT. BEDROOM.

Camera goes with her into the connecting bedroom.  CLYDE is
sitting on the edge of the bed cleaning the guns and oiling
them.  He is quiet and preoccupied and takes no note of
BONNIE's present condition.  The moment she enters, he looks
up.

                         CLYDE
                   (quietly)
            Bonnie, I want to talk to you.  Sit
            down.

BONNIE sits, a little taken off balance by his serious
manner.  But she listens quietly.

                         CLYDE
                   (continuing)
            This afternoon we killed a man and
            we were seen.  Now nobody knows who
            you are yet, but they're going to
            be after me and anybody who's
            runnin' with me.  Now that's murder
            now and it's gonna get rough.
                   (BONNIE nods.  CLYDE
                   continues speaking
                   carefully and gently.)
            Look, I can't get out, but right
            now you still can.  You say the
            word and I'll put you on the bus to
            go back to your Mother.  'Cause you
            mean a lot to me, honey, and I
            ain't going to make you run with me.
            So if you want, you say the word.

BONNIE, moved by his offer, has tears in her eyes.

                         CLYDE
                   (as he pauses)
            Why?  We ain't gonna have a minute's
            peace.

BONNIE doesn't like him in this mood.  She tries to josh him
out of it.

                         BONNIE
            Oh, pshaw.

                         CLYDE
                   (trying to make her
                   see the seriousness
                   of it)
            Bonnie, we could get killed.

                                                           35.


                         BONNIE
                   (death has no reality
                   for her)
            Who'd wanna kill a sweet young
            thing like me?

                         CLYDE
                   (amused in spite of himself)
            I ain't no sweet young thing.

                         BONNIE
            Oh, Clyde, I can't picture you with
            a halo, and if you went to the
            other place you'd rob the Devil
            blind, so he'd kick you right back
            to me.

Close-up.  CLYDE--touched deeply, realizes that this was a
lovely thing to say to him.

INT. MOTEL BEDROOM.

They kiss.  They are near the bed on which are some guns
that CLYDE has been cleaning.  The kiss moves toward real
love making.  They are on the bed and push the guns aside.
Some fall to the floor.  CLYDE breaks the embrace after it
has reached a high pitch.  He moves away from the bed toward
the window.  BONNIE follows him and embraces him from the
rear.  They are miserable.  BONNIE frees him and returns to
the bed.  She falls on it face down.  A gun presses into her
face.  CLYDE sits in the window, the light silhouettes him.
He turns his face toward the glass and rests his head on the
window pane.  BONNIE turns to him from bed.  She smiles a
comforting smile at him.  She rolls over onto her back.  The
gun is now under her head and moves it.  She sits up and
gestures to CLYDE.  He remains at the window.  She stares at
him.  She looks toward the bathroom.  She looks back at
CLYDE.  She is moved and pained for him.  She touches her
cheek with the gun and waits for him to be able to look at
her.  Finally he does.  Her look eases him and he almost
smiles.

INT. BUCK'S CAR.  DAY.

Shot of little fuzzy doll tied by a white shoestring to the
rear-view mirror of a car.  The car is moving; the doll is
bouncing up and down.  In the front seat are BUCK and
BLANCHE BARROW.  BUCK is a jovial, simple, big-hearted man.
A little chubby, given to raucous jokes, knee-slapping and
broad reactions.  He is, in many ways, the emotional opposite
of his brother.  It doesn't take much to make him happy.
BLANCHE, his wife, is the direct opposite of BONNIE.

                                                           36.


She is a housefrau, no more and no less, not terribly
bright, not very ambitious, cuddly, simpering, madly in love
with BUCK and desirous of keeping their lives on the straight
and narrow.  As the scene begins we hear and then see BUCK,
driving, singing "The Great Speckled Bird."  BLANCHE is
sitting next to him looking at a movie magazine, appearing
fairly miserable.

                         BUCK
                   (singing)
            "What a beautiful thought I am
            thinking
            Concernin' that great speckled
            bird,
            Remember his name is recorded
            on the pages of God's Holy word..."

                         BLANCHE
            All right, now you did foolish
            things as a young man, honey-love,
            but you went and paid your debt to
            society and that was right.  But
            now you just gettin' back in with
            the criminal element.

                         BUCK
            Criminal element!  This is my
            brother, darlin'.  Shoot, he ain't
            no more criminal than you are,
            Blanche.

                         BLANCHE
            Well, that ain't what I heard.

                         BUCK
            Now word of mouth just don't go,
            darlin', you gotta have the facts.
            Shoot.  Why he and me growed up
            together, slept and worked side by
            side.
                   (laughing)
            God, what a boy he was!

                         BLANCHE
            He's a crook.

                         BUCK
                   (chidingly)
            Now you stop bad-mouthin' him,
            Blanche.  We're just gonna have us
            a little family visit for a few
            weeks and then we'll go back to
            Dallas and I'll get me a job
            somewheres.

                         BUCK (CONT'D)
            I just ain't gonna work in your
            Daddy's church--That's final.
                   (laughing it off, singing)
            "What a beautiful thought I am
            thinking
            Concernin' that great speckled
            bird..."

                                            CUT TO:

EXT. CABIN.  THE FRONT OF THE MOTEL.  DAY.

BUCK's car drives up to the cabin, honking the horn wildly.
The door of the cabin opens and CLYDE comes running out.  He
is overjoyed to see his brother.  BUCK jumps out of the car,
equally delighted.  They hug each other.

                         CLYDE
                   (hugging him)
            Buck!

                         BUCK
            Clyde!  You son of a bitch!

They laugh happily and begin sparring with each other,
faking punches and blocking punches--an old childhood ritual.
There is a great feeling of warmth between the two brothers.
CLYDE is more outgoing than we have ever seen him before.

                         CLYDE
            How's ma?  How's sister?

                         BUCK
            Just fine, just fine.  Send their
            best to you.

                         CLYDE
                   (patting Buck's stomach)
            Hey, you're fillin' out there.
            Must be that prison food.

                         BUCK
            Hell no!
                   (laughing)
            It's married life.  You know what
            they say, it's the face powder that
            gets a man interested, but it's the
            baking powder that keeps him at
            home.

                                                           38.


                         BUCK (CONT'D)
                   (he explodes with
                   laughter and so does
                   Clyde, who loves
                   Buck's jokes)
            Hey! you gotta meet my wife.  Hey,
            honey, c'mon out here now and meet
            my baby brother.

Camera swings to car.  We see BLANCHE still sitting there,
her face obscured by the glint of sun on the windshield.
Slowly, she gets out of the car, still carrying the movie
magazine.

                         BLANCHE
                   (suspiciously, quite
                   the grand lady)
            Howdy-do.

                         CLYDE
                   (shaking her hand)
            Howdy-do.  It's real nice to know
            you.

BUCK beams with pleasure, thinking they must like each other.
BONNIE comes out of the cabin, standing on the steps.  The
screen door slams behind her.

Close-up.  BONNIE.  Day--expressionless, looking it all over.

EXT. CABIN.

BUCK and CLYDE notice nothing of this.  BUCK bounds over to
BONNIE, all jollity.

                         BUCK
                   (grabbing her)
            Well!  You must be Bonnie!  Now I
            hear you been takin' good care of
            the baby in the family.  Well sis,
            I'm real glad to meet you!
                   (he hugs her; BONNIE
                   just lets herself be hugged)
            Say...
                   (breaking the hug)
            I'd like you to meet my wife,
            Blanche.

                         BONNIE
                   (stiffly)
            Hello.

                                                           39.


                         BLANCHE
                   (stiffly)
            Hello.

There is an awkward pause.  Suddenly the screen door opens
and C.W. comes out, dressed in his long underwear.  BLANCHE
can hardly stand it.

                         CLYDE
            Everybody, this is C.W. Moss.
            C.W., my brother Buck and his wife,
            Blanche.

                         C.W.
                   (friendly)
            Heighdy, y'all.

He pumps BUCK's hand vigorously and then goes to BLANCHE.
With his characteristic one-track intensity, he decides to
act just as friendly as he can with BLANCHE, ignoring the
fact that he's standing there in his underwear.  BLANCHE,
however, is not ignoring it.

                         C.W.
            Well how do, Mrs. Barrow.  Or can I
            call you Blanch?  I sure am pleased
            to meet you.
                   (shaking her hand;
                   Blanche is slowly
                   going crazy with mortification)
            Did you have a hard time findin' us
            here in this neck of the woods?
            Well, you sure picked a good day
            for it.  Say, you got a Screenland
            there!  Any new photos of Myrna Loy?
            She's my favorite picture star.

BLANCHE is starting to edge over to BUCK in sheer panic at
this strange, young man in his BVD's but C.W. takes no
notice of it.

BLANCHE finally grabs BUCK's arm.  BONNIE watches it all,
smirking.

                         BUCK
            Hey, lemme get the Kodak!

BUCK goes to his car and gets a folding Brownie camera.

                         CLYDE
                   (lighting up a cigar)
            Hey, C.W., go put your pants on.
            We're gonna take some pictures.

                                                           40.


                         BUCK
            Y'all hear about the guy who
            thought Western Union was a cowboy's
            underwear?

BUCK and CLYDE and C.W. laugh heartily.  C.W. goes into the
cabin.  BUCK pushes BLANCHE and CLYDE together, posing them
for a picture.

                         BONNIE
            Lemme get one of my bride and my
            brother.

                         BLANCHE
                   (getting kittenish,
                   and overdoing it)
            Buck!  Don't take my picture now.
            I'm just a mess from driving all day.

                         BUCK
            Oh honey, now you look real fine.

BONNIE watches BLANCHE's behavior with hardly-veiled disgust.
BUCK snaps the picture as BLANCHE is just about to move out
of it.

                         BLANCHE
                   (with unbecoming
                   girlish outrage)
            Did you take my picture?  Oh Buck!
            I declare--

BUCK laughs and goes to BONNIE, takes her by the arm and
moves her next to CLYDE and BLANCHE.  He lines them up,
steps back and takes their picture.  CLYDE is the only one
smiling.

                         CLYDE
                   (pulling out his gun
                   and posing like a
                   movie tough)
            Hey, Buck, get one of this.

BUCK does.

                         BUCK
                   (giving Clyde the camera)
            Clyde, you do one of me and my
            missus.

He puts his arm around BLANCHE.  CLYDE takes the picture.

                                                           41.


                         CLYDE
                   (throwing her a challenge)
            Let me take on of Bonnie.

BONNIE grins at him and responds with amused arrogance.

                         BONNIE
                   (she yanks the cigar
                   from Clyde's mouth,
                   smokes it and poses)
            Okay.

CLYDE snaps the picture.  Everyone but BLANCHE laughs.  C.W.
comes out dressed.

                         BUCK
                   (drawing Clyde aside)
            Hey, brother, let's you and me do a
            little talkin'.

                         CLYDE
                   (handing C.W. the camera)
            Here, C.W., take the girls' picture.

INT. CABIN.  DAY.

They walk into the cabin.  Camera goes with them.  Bedroom
is dark, shades pulled down.  There is an aura of boys'
clubhouse secret camaraderie in the following scene:

                         BUCK
                   (as soon as the door
                   is shut; conspiratorially)
            It was you or him, wasn't it?

                         CLYDE
            Huh?

                         BUCK
            That guy you killed.  You had to,
            didn't ya?

                         CLYDE
                   (they are protecting
                   each other)
            Yeah, he put me in a spot, so I had
            to.  He didn't have a Chinaman's
            chance.

                         BUCK
            But you had to--

                         CLYDE
            Yeah.  I had to.

                                                           42.


                         BUCK
                   (like two kids
                   keeping a secret from Mom)
            Don't say nothin' to Blanche about
            it.

                         CLYDE
            Hey, that time you broke out of
            jail, she talk you into goin' back?

                         BUCK
                   (it is obvious he had
                   hoped Clyde hadn't
                   known about it)
            Yeah, you hear about that?

                         CLYDE
            I won't say nothin' to Bonnie about
            it.

                         BUCK
            I appreciate it.

                         CLYDE
            Yeah...say, what d'ya think of
            Bonnie?

                         BUCK
            She's a real peach.

There is now a long pause--a lull in the conversation, as if
they asked each other all the questions and are now out of
things to say.  It is too much for BUCK, the natural enemy
of silence, who suddenly claps his hands together and bursts
out animatedly:

                         BUCK
            Boy, are we gonna have us a good
            time!

                         CLYDE
                   (matching his merriment)
            We surely are!

                         BUCK
            Yessir!
                   (a pause, then:)
            What are we gonna do?

                         CLYDE
            Well, how's this--I thought we'd
            all go to Missouri.  They ain't
            lookin' for me there.  We'll hole
            up someplace and have us a regular
            vacation.  All right?

                                                           43.


                         BUCK
            No trouble, now?

                         CLYDE
            No trouble.  I ain't lookin' to go
            back to prison.

                         BUCK
            Hey, what's this I hear about you
            cuttin' up your toes, boy?

                         CLYDE
                   (ironically)
            That ain't but half of it.  I did
            it so I could get off work detail--
            breakin' those damned rocks with a
            hammer day and night.  Sure enough,
            next week I got paroled.  I walked
            out of that god-forsaken jail on
            crutches.

                         BUCK
            Shoot--

                         CLYDE
            Ain't life grand?

EXT. ROAD.  DAY.

We see the two cars, one behind the other, driving down a
main road.

INT. FIRST CAR.  DAY.

CLYDE is driving.  BUCK sits next to him.  No one else is in
the car.

                         BUCK
            And the doc, he takes him aside,
            says, "Son, your old mama just
            gettin' weak and sickly layin'
            there.  I want you to persuade her
            to take a little Brandy, y'know, to
            pick her spirits up." "Why, doc,"
            he says, "you know my mamma is a
            teetotaler.  She wouldn't touch a
            drop." "Well, I tell you what," the
            doc says, "why don't you bring her
            a fresh quart of milk every day
            from your farm, 'cept you fix it up
            so half of it's Brandy and don't
            let on!" So he does that, doctors
            it up with Brandy, and his mamma
            drinks some of it.
                         (MORE)

                                                           44.


                         BUCK (CONT'D)
            And the next day he brings it again
            and she drinks some more--and she
            keeps it up every day.  Finally,
            one week later, he brings her the
            milk and don't you know she just
            shallows it all down, and looks at
            her bag and says, "Son, whatever
            you do, don't sell that cow!"

CLYDE and BUCK explode in laughter.

INT. SECOND CAR.  DAY.

At the top of the laugh, cut to the int. of the second car,
riding right in back of them.  The atmosphere is completely
unlike the cozy and jolly scene preceding.  We have dead
silence.  BONNIE is driving, smoking a cigarette, grim.
BLANCHE--seated as far away as she can get from BONNIE
without falling out of the car--makes a face at the cigarette
smoke, rolls down the window for air.  C.W.'s in the back
seat, just staring.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT. GARAGE APARTMENT.  DAY.

A residential street in Joplin, Missouri, showing a garage
apartment above a double garage.  Camera sees BUCK talking
to a dapper gent with keys in his hand.  BUCK pays him.  The
man tips his hat and walks off.  BUCK gestures and Clyde
drives a car into the driveway.  C.W. follows, driving
BUCK's car with BLANCHE.  CLYDE stops beside BUCK.  BUCK
leans into CLYDE's car and says:

                         BUCK
            I give him a month's rent in
            advance.  We're all set.  Let's get
            inside.

CLYDE calls back to C.W. in the following car.

                         CLYDE
            Pull up and unload the stuff.

                         BUCK
                   (on the running board
                   of moving car)
            Honey-love, I'm taking you into our
            first home.

BLANCHE giggles.  The two cars pull up before the garage and
the people start to descend.

                                                           45.


INT. GARAGE APARTMENT.  DAY.

A winded BUCK enters and puts down BLANCHE.  As others
behind him carry in their things and disperse throughout
apartment.

                         BLANCHE
            Oh look, it's so clean, Buck.  And
            a Frigidaire...not an icebox!

                         BUCK
            He give me the grocery number.

He goes to the phone.

                         BUCK
                   (continuing)
            Lemme see, eh 4337...Operator...
            please ma'm, may I have 4337...if
            you please?

                         BLANCHE
            Oh...they got linoleum on the
            counter.  Ain't that clever!

                         BUCK
            Hello, Smitty's grocery...I'd like
            to order a mess of groceries.  Oh
            yeah...eh 143 Hillsdale Street.
            Lessee, about 8 pounds of porkchops,
            4 pounds of red beans...a can of
            Chase and Sandborn...uh.

                         BLANCHE
            Oh, isn't this something, Daddy!

                         BUCK
            Sshh.  Uh...quart of milk...uh 8
            bottles of Dr. Pepper and that's
            it, I guess.  No...no.  Uh...a box
            of Rice Krispies...Bye now.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. LIVING ROOM.  DAY.

Open on BONNIE and CLYDE.  He is cleaning guns.  She is
watching something off screen.  We hear a clicking sound.

                         BLANCHE (O.S.)
            My, you need a haircut, Daddy.  You
            look like a hillbilly boy.

                                                           46.


A look of disgust crosses BONNIE's face.  CLYDE, who has
been watching her, smiles.  The clicking sound increases
suddenly.

                         BUCK (O.S.)
            Gotcha!

BLANCHE whoops.  Camera cuts to see that BUCK and C.W. are
playing checkers and BUCK has just beaten him.

                         C.W.
            Again.

                         BUCK
            Boy, you ain't never gonna beat me
            but you keep tryin' now.

He starts to set up the game again.

                         BLANCHE
            Jest like an ol' man.  Plays
            checkers all the time and doesn't
            pay any attention to his poor
            lonely wife.

She ruffles his hair again.

                         BUCK
            Cut it out now, honey.  I'm gonna
            teach this boy a lesson he'll never
            forget.

Camera cuts to BONNIE, watching with disgust.  Then slowly,
a wicked little smile edges across her face.  She watches
for a moment more, then she rises and with the most ingenuous
look she can muster up, beckons to CLYDE to follow her into
the bedroom.  A little puzzled, CLYDE follows.

INT. BEDROOM.

BONNIE closes the door and immediately begins fussing with
CLYDE's hair, doing a scathing imitation of BLANCHE.  Though
her miming expresses her irritation at being closeted with
the Barrow menage, it is also a peach doing an imitation of
a lemon--and it is disarmingly sensual... Indeed the mimicry
allows BONNIE to be physically freer with CLYDE, and allows
CLYDE to respond without anxiety, without self-consciousness.
We should have the distinct--if momentary--feeling that
CLYDE could suddenly make it with BONNIE.

                                                           47.


                         BONNIE
                   (doing an unmerciful imitation)
            Oh, Daddy, you shore need a haircut.
            You look just like a little old
            hillbilly boy, I do declare.
                   (she has her other
                   hand toying with the
                   buttons on his shirt,
                   her hand slipping
                   under, fluttering
                   across his bare chest)
            Oh mercy me, oh my stars!

CLYDE laughs, and BONNIE tugs at the shirt--she kneels on
the bed over CLYDE, who quite easily drapes across it.

                         BONNIE
                   (a little louder)
            Oh, Daddy!  Yore such a slowpoke!

She's letting her hair fall loose, its golden ends brushing
up and down CLYDE's body.

                         CLYDE
                   (amused, but cautionary)
            Hush up a little.  They're in the
            next room.

                         BONNIE
                   (a mock-pout, but
                   with an edge to it)
            Shoot, there's always somebody in
            this room, the next room and ever'
            other kind of room.

CLYDE has his arm around BONNIE, and she's almost draped
across him--but in the direction of the length of the bed,
so their bodies almost form a crooked cross.  She digs an
elbow into his stomach.

                         CLYDE
            Oof!...now that ain't no nice way
            to talk about my brother.

                         BONNIE
                   (imitating Blanche
                   again with baby talk)
            I ain't talking about your brother.

Suddenly BONNIE straightens up to a kneeling position again,
and cocks her head.  When she speaks now it is with a simple
plaintiveness.

                                                           48.


                         BONNIE
            Honey, do you ever just want to be
            alone with Me?
                   (sensing Clyde's
                   sensitivity to the
                   sexual implication)
            I don't just mean like that...I
            mean do you ever have the notion of
            us bein' out together and alone,
            like at some fancy ball, or, I
            don't know, where we walk in all
            dressed and they announce us and
            it's fancy and in public, but we're
            alone somehow.  We're separate from
            everybody else, and they know it.

CLYDE looks up to BONNIE, affectionately.  He runs his hand
carelessly down her body.

                         CLYDE
            I always feel like we're separate
            from everybody else.

                         BONNIE
                   (it's terribly
                   important to her)
            Do you, baby?

Suddenly there is a ring at the door.  BONNIE and CLYDE
freeze.

INT. LIVING ROOM.

BONNIE and CLYDE run out into the living room, camera going
with them.

                         BONNIE
                   (to all)
            Quiet!  I'll get it.

BONNIE goes down the stairs and reaches the front door.

                         BONNIE
            Who is it?

                         VOICE
            Groceries, M'am.

EXT. GARAGE APARTMENT.

She opens the door.  A young man is there with the two big
sacks of groceries.

                                                           49.


                         BONNIE
            How much?

                         YOUNG MAN
            Six dollars and forty-three cents.

BONNIE pays him and goes to take the bags from him.

                         YOUNG MAN
            Here, M'am, them bags is heavy.
            Let me carry 'em up for you.

                         BONNIE
                   (curtly)
            No thanks, I'll take 'em.

She takes the heavy bags and hefts them up and turns and
walks up the stairs.  They are obviously very heavy for her.
Closeup the delivery boy's face, looking puzzled at this
behavior.  BONNIE reaches the top steps, and voices are heard.

                         BUCK'S VOICE
            What was it?

                         CLYDE'S VOICE
            Quiet.  Open the door.

                         BONNIE
            C'mon, c'mon...

Close-up.  The DELIVERY BOY.  A look of suspicion comes
across his face.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

INT. GARAGE APARTMENT.

Close-up of BONNIE--seated in the living room.

                         BONNIE
                   (reading from a pad;
                   in a recital voice)
            It's called "The Ballad of Suicide
            Sal."
                   (she pauses for
                   effect; then begins:)
            "We each of us have a good alibi
            For being down here in the 'joint';
            But few of them really are justified
            If you get right down to the point.
            You've heard of a woman's glory
            Being spent on a downright cur'."

                                                           50.


                         BUCK'S VOICE (O.S.)
            You write that all by yourself?

                         BONNIE
            You want to hear this or not?

As she reads, the camera pans around the room picking out
everyone's reaction.  CLYDE is looking and listening
seriously.  BUCK is grinning.  C.W. is blank.  BLANCHE is in
the kitchen cooking.

                         BONNIE
            "Still you can't always judge the
            story
            As true, being told by her.
            Now 'Sal' was a gal of rare beauty,
            Though her features were coarse and
            tough--"

                         BUCK
            Yeah, I knew her.  She was cockeyed
            and had a hare-lip and no teeth!

BONNIE flashes him a look that could kill.  He shuts up fast.
She continues:

                         BONNIE
            "Now 'Sal' was a gal of rare
            beauty,
            Though her features were coarse and
            tough;
            She never once faltered from duty
            To play on the 'up and up'."

Still listening, CLYDE gets up from his chair and walks
slowly past the living room windows.  The camera angled
slightly above him, sees down the street.  We see two police
cars quietly pulling up.  One of them parks sideways in the
driveway to block escape from the garage, the other stays on
the street.  CLYDE turns and looks out the window.

                         BONNIE
                   (o.s. as we see out
                   the window)
            "Sal told me this tale on the
            evening
            Before she was turned out free,
            And I'll do my best to relate it
            Just as she told it to me--"

                         CLYDE
                   (seeing it)
            It's the law.

                                                           51.


As soon as CLYDE calls out, BLANCHE drops the frying pan on
the floor and begins screaming.  Camera cuts back to the
living room.  Everyone else leaps into action.  Guns begin
blazing from everywhere; we rarely see who is shooting at
whom.

EXT. GARAGE APARTMENT.  DAY.

The police, down the stairs into the garage--we follow them
with a hand-held camera tracking rapidly.

EXT. STREET.  DAY.

BLANCHE, however, in utter panic, just runs right out the
front door, and begins running down the quiet residential
street, going nowhere, anywhere.

EXT. GARAGE APARTMENT.  DAY.

BUCK, crouching, shooting with one hand, gets the garage
door open.  A policeman fires.  BUCK fires back and the cop
falls dead in the street.  BUCK, firing, dashes to the
police car blocking their escape and releases the hand brake.
CLYDE, BONNIE and C.W. leap into their car, gun the motor,
still shooting madly.  Two more police fall dead or wounded.
One policeman is hurled through a fence by the blast of a
sawed-off shotgun.  BUCK jumps into the car with the others.
They now begin to bump the police car with their car.  The
police car picks up speed as they push it and it tears into
the street right at the group of firing police.  The gang's
car turns into the street toward the running BLANCHE.
BONNIE and CLYDE are in front; BUCK and C.W. in the back
seat firing back at police.  The car pulls alongside the
wildly running BLANCHE; the back door is flung open and in
almost the style of a cartoon, two hands reach out and lift
her off her feet and pull her into the car.  They speed away.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. CAR.  DAY.

The inside of the car, still speeding.  BLANCHE is hysterical.
C.W. is still firing out the window.  The pursuing police
car's driver is shot and the car crashes into a tree.  The
gang is not being pursued now, but CLYDE is driving at 90.
BLANCHE is moaning and crying.  BONNIE, in front, turns
around furiously.

                         BONNIE
            Dammit, you almost got us killed!

                                                           52.


                         BLANCHE
                   (crying)
            What did I do wrong?  I s'pose
            you'd be happier if I got shot.

                         BONNIE
                   (at her bitchiest)
            Yeah, it would of saved us all a
            lot of trouble.

                         BLANCHE
            Buck, don't let that woman talk to
            me like that!

                         BUCK
                   (caught in the middle
                   of a bad situation,
                   knowing Blanche is
                   wrong, but trying to
                   soothe her)
            You shouldn't have done it, Blanche.
                   (quietly, cont.)
            It was a dumb thing to do.

                         BLANCHE
                   (switching tactics)
            Please, Buck, I didn't marry you to
            see you shot up!  Please, let's go!
            Let's get out of here and leave.
            Make him stop the car and let us out!

                         BUCK
                   (still quietly)
            Can't.  I killed a man.  We're in
            this now.

                         BLANCHE
                   (loud and shrill)
            Please!  Please!

                         BONNIE
                   (exploding)
            Shut up!  Just shut up your big
            mouth!  At least do that, will ya,
            just shut up.

                         CLYDE
            Cut it out, Bonnie.

BONNIE is affronted.  BLANCHE continues sobbing.

                         BONNIE
                   (curtly)
            Stop the car.  I want to talk to you.

                                                           53.


Without a word, CLYDE stops the car.

EXT. ROADSIDE.  DAY.

BONNIE and CLYDE get out and walk fifteen feet away from the
car.  Both are irritated and touchy.  Camera follows them.

                         CLYDE
                   (coldly)
            What is it?

                         BONNIE
            Get rid of her.

                         CLYDE
            Can't do that.  She's Buck's wife.

                         BONNIE
                   (snapping her words)
            Get rid of both of them then.

                         CLYDE
            Why?  What's the matter with you
            anyway?

                         BONNIE
            She's what's the matter with me, a
            damn stupid back country hick
            without a brain in her head.
                   (contemptuously)
            She ain't nothin' but prunes and
            proverbs.

                         CLYDE
                   (really pissed-off at Bonnie)
            What makes you any better?  What
            makes you so damn special?  You're
            just a West Dallas waitress who
            spent half your time pickin' up
            truck drivers!

This hits home with BONNIE.  He has said the unforgivable.

                         BONNIE
                   (raising her voice)
            You talk to me like that!  Big
            Clyde Barrow, just the same as your
            brother, an ignorant uneducated
            hillbilly.
                   (with deadly archness)
            Only special thing about you is
            your peculiar ideas about
            lovemakin'--which is no love makin'
            at all.

                                                           54.


CLYDE stiffens.  The two of them stand silent and tense,
almost quivering with anger.  They have stripped each other
raw.  CLYDE turns and looks back at the car.  Everyone is
waiting, watching them.  He breathes a deep sigh, like a man
counting to 10 to hold his temper.

                         CLYDE
            Look, Bonnie--

He can't finish.

Close.  BONNIE.  She drops her head into her hand for a
moment, comes up a little more relaxed.  She looks at CLYDE
and her eyes reflect the realization of the pain she has
inflicted on him.  She softens.

                         BONNIE
            Clyde...honey...I didn't mean all
            that, honey.  Blame it on all that
            shootin', I just felt so bad...sure
            enough...Clyde?

                         CLYDE
            Okay...Okay, hon...let's get
            movin'...

He turns and begins walking back to the car.  BONNIE walks
alongside him.  On the few steps back, she regains all her
dignity and acts aloof from the others waiting for her.  She
reaches the car.  CLYDE opens her door for her and she gets
in like a great lady.  He walks around to his side, gets in,
and they drive off.

WIDE SHOT.  EXT. CAR.  DAY.

A very wide shot.  We see CLYDE's car driving along a wooded
road.  For a moment that is all we see, then we should
become aware that far in the distance another car is
following CLYDE's.

Close. Rural mail box.  On the opposite side of the road,
CLYDE's car swings across the road and CLYDE, who is driving,
snatches a newspaper which protrudes from the box and hands
it into the car.  They drive out of the shot.  Camera holds
and soon the following car enters the shot.  The man driving
is a Texas ranger.  He drives slowly.  He drives out of the
shot.

INT. CLYDE'S CAR.

BUCK is reading from the paper.

                                                           55.


                         BUCK
                   (jubilantly)
            Hey, y'all, listen to this here:
            Law enforcement officers throughout
            the Southwest are frankly amazed at
            the way in which will-of-the-wisp
            bandit Clyde Barrow and his yellow-
            haired companion, Bonnie Parker,
            continue to elude their would-be
            captors.  Since engaging the police
            in a gun battle on the streets of
            Joplin Missouri and slaying three
            of their number...

                         BLANCHE
            Oh, Lord...

We notice CLYDE is wincing.

                         BUCK
            ...the Barrow gang has been reported
            as far West as White City, New
            Mexico, and as far north as Chicago.
            They have been credited with
            robbing the Mesquite Bank in the
            aforementioned White City, the J.J.
            Landry Oil Refinery in Arp, Texas,
            the Sanger City National Bank in
            Denton, Texas on three different
            occasions.  In addition to these
            robberies, the fast travelling
            Barrows have been rumored to have
            had a hand in the robbing of two
            Piggly Wiggly stores in Texas, and
            one A&P store in Missouri, though
            Chief Percy Hammond, who first
            identified Clyde Barrow's brother,
            Buck, as a member of the gang,
            expressed some doubt that these
            last robberies were committed by
            the Barrow Gang alone.

                         BONNIE
            Go on.

                         C.W.
                   (finally)
            Clyde, we ain't goin' to see a
            restroom for another thirty miles.
            Why don't you just stop here?

CLYDE looks relieved.

                                                           56.


EXT. WOODED AREA.  DAY.

He pulls the car to a stop, gets out and goes off into the
woods.  We watch him vanish behind the trees.

INT. CAR.

BUCK still scanning the newspaper.

                         BUCK
                   (with a laugh)
            Hey now, here's something!  Listen
            here: Lone Cop Arrests Two Officers
            In Hunt For Barrow.  Police Officer
            Howard Anderson's heart turned
            faster than his motorcycle when he
            forced to the side of the road a
            roaring black V-8 sedan in which
            were three men and a blondheaded
            woman yesterday afternoon.

Everybody laughs.  As BUCK continues to read, his voice
remaining on the soundtrack.

EXT. CAR.

The camera goes outside the car and pulls back, way back, to
reveal a police car quietly driving up behind the car.  The
car stops a good distance away and one man gets out, the
only occupant of the car.  He is tall, dressed in the
uniform of the Texas Ranger.  He draws his gun and slowly
approaches the car from the rear.  On the soundtrack BUCK's
voice continues; as we see all this taking place.

                         BUCK
            When he saw several machine guns in
            the car he was certain he'd caught
            Clyde Barrow, Bonnie Parker, and
            maybe Buck Barrow and the third
            unidentified member of the gang.
            It took a lot of telephoning and
            explaining to convince the
            motorcycle cop that his captives
            were two highway patrolmen and a
            blonde-haired stenographer from the
            Highway Patrol--.  Haw!  Haw!
                   (everybody busts up
                   with laughter)


In the meantime, on screen, the lawman is slowly approaching
the back of the car.  Suddenly, cut to shot of CLYDE coming
out of the woods, behind the lawman.  His gun is tucked in
his pants.  In a second, he sees what is happening.

                                                           57.


BUCK's voice is continuing:

                         BUCK
            Anderson was held up as an example
            for every other Texas peace officer
            today. "That was a mighty brave
            thing," explained Highway Patrol
            Chief L.C. Winston.

CLYDE whips out his gun.  The following scene is played
exactly like a classic fast-draw in an heroic Western.

                         CLYDE
            Sheriff!

BRYCE spins around.  Both men fire instanteously, but CLYDE
has the draw on him, and the aim.  The gun goes flying from
the SHERIFF's hand.  A really razzle-dazzle display of
grandstand marksmanship from Clyde.

Immediately the gang leaps from the car and surrounds the
man, guns drawn.

                         C.W.
            Boy!  What a shot, Clyde!

                         BUCK
            Sweet Jesus, I never seen shootin'
            like that!

The gang grabs the man and takes his handcuffs from his belt.
CLYDE makes him lean on the car's hood, arms extended, legs
spread, while he frisks him.  In general, everyone is
excited over the capture.  BONNIE takes the sheriff's gun
and delicately places it on the radiator grill like an
object d'art.

                         CLYDE
                   (examining the man's
                   wallet, really surprised)
            Well, now, getta load of this.  I
            want y'all to know we are in the
            custody of Cap'n Frank Bryce, and
            Frank here is a Texas Ranger.

Rev. angle across hood--so BRYCE's face, not visible to
CLYDE or anyone else behind him, is in foreground.  His
gnarled, powerful hands tremble slightly on the hood, as tho
they might crinkle the metal like so much tissue paper.  His
eyes stare toward camera relentlessly, unblinking, but
without passion.  They are shark's eyes.  They have witnessed
much carnage, devoured it, and are still wide open for more.

                                                           58.


                         C.W.
            Sure 'nough, Clyde?

                         BUCK
            Say there, peacemaker.  I believe
            you got your spurs all tangled up.
            You're in Missouri, you know that?

CLYDE has been going thru the man's  credentials.  Not so
pleasantly:

                         CLYDE
            You didn't know you was in Missouri?

                         C.W.
            He's lost, this here Texas Ranger.

CLYDE claps BRYCE's hands behind his back, handcuffs him,
spins him around.

                         CLYDE
                   (a little pissed)
            --he ain't lost...them banks are
            offerin' extra reward money fer us,
            and Frank figured on easy pickin's,
            didn't you?
                   (he suddenly knocks
                   Bryce's hat off)
            Didn't you?

BRYCE flinches involuntarily.  BUCK suddenly grows wary at
CLYDE's mood.  CLYDE leans into BRYCE, looking up.

                         CLYDE
            --Now you ain't hardly doin' your
            job, Texas Ranger.  You oughta be
            home lookin' after the rights of
            poor folks, not out chasin' after us.

He suddenly hefts BRYCE's huge bulk onto the fender.

                         BUCK
                   (trying to be casual)
            Easy there, Clyde.  Why take is so
            personal.

                         CLYDE
                   (to Bryce)
            Reg'lar laws is one thing.  But
            this here bounty hunting, we got to
            discourage that.

BLANCHE looks very uncomfortable.  She starts to say
something, but BUCK intervenes.

                                                           59.


                         BUCK
            Like how, Clyde?--

A tense moment.  CLYDE can't think of anything right away.

                         C.W.
                   (trying to be helpful)
            Shoot him.

BONNIE shoots C.W. an angry glance--it's just what the gang
doesn't want.

                         C.W.
                   (trying again)
            ...hang him?...

Reaction--BONNIE carefully gauging the moment to intervene.

                         BONNIE
                   (suddenly)
            --uh-uh.  Take his picture.

CLYDE's not sure he's heard right.  Neither is C.W.

                         C.W.
            Take his picture?

                         BONNIE
                   (pointedly ignoring
                   C.W., brightly)
            Then we'll let the newspapers have
            it--so's everyone can see Captain
            Frank Bryce of the Texas Rangers
            with the Barrow gang--
                   (moving demurely to Bryce)
            --and all bein' just as friendly as
            pie.

                         BUCK
                   (grasping
                   possibilities immediately)
            ...yeah, yeah...

                         BONNIE
                   (continuing right on,
                   coyly picking up
                   Bryce's gun from grill)
            --why we 'bout the friendliest
            folks in the world.  Texas Ranger
            waves his big ol' gun at us, and we
            just welcome him like he's one of
            our own.

                                                           60.


                         CLYDE
                   (grinning widely)
            Buck, get the Kodak!

                         BUCK
                   (relieved and excited)
            Hot dog!

                         CLYDE
                   (to Bryce)
            We're mighty proud to have a Texas
            Ranger in the family.

BRYCE is obviously not pleased with this turn of events.
Following dialogue is overlapped, ad-libbed, etc.  A sense
of mounting glee at the kind of vengeance they are going to
exact.

New angle.  BUCK is fiddling with the camera, setting up the
shot with CLYDE.  BUCK's following speech should be heard,
b.g., to CLYDE's speech below it.

                         BUCK
            ...keep him set on the hood,
            there...more to the sun, like
            that...yeah...when all his ranger
            friends see this...I bet he's gonna
            wish he was dead!

                         CLYDE
                   (to Bryce)
            ...see what come o' your
            mischief?...not doin' your job?
            Down in Duncanville last year poor
            farmers kepts the laws away from us
            with shot guns...you're s'posed to
            be protectin' them from us, and
            they're protectin' us from you.
                   (giggling)
            --don't make sense, do it?

                         BUCK
            C'mon, now, Clyde, you and Bonnie
            first.  Move into him, right close,
            right friendly.

                         CLYDE
            All righty
                   (to Bryce, whose
                   hands are tied,
                   hemmed in by them both)
            Don't move, now, hear?

                                                           61.


CLYDE grandly puts an arm on BRYCE's shoulder, BONNIE,
looking up admiringly from the other side.  BUCK takes the
picture.  BONNIE immediately hops onto the hood, next to
BRYCE.

                         BONNIE
            How's this? "Captain Bryce and new
            found friend."

She coyly loosens his tie, tousles his hair, and plants a
big kiss on him while still ogling camera.

                         CLYDE
            ...yeah, yeah...quick, Buck, get
            it...

                         BUCK
            ...I'm gettin' it, I'm gettin' it.

Quite suddenly BRYCE, whose simmering intensity we should be
more sensitive to than the gang is, spits on Bonnie.  BONNIE
half-screams in disgust, but CLYDE is on top of BRYCE in a
flash, half-strangling on his own fury.  He pulls BRYCE off
the fender by the handcuffs, spinning him around crazily
like a lasso.  BRYCE is literally ricocheted off the car by
the force, and, with CLYDE hanging on by the cuffs, plummets
down the embankment to the sandy beach below, both men
falling, spinning.  BRYCE rises shakily.  He tries to walk
away.  CLYDE grabs him again by the handcuffs and hurls him
out into the water.  BRYCE smacks into a tree stump poking
out of the shallows and goes down.  CLYDE is on top of him.

Meanwhile, BUCK has rushed down into the water, tries to
pull CLYDE off BRYCE.

                         BUCK
                   (frantic)
            I got the picture.  I got the
            picture...

                         CLYDE
                   (oblivious)
            Lemme be, lemme be...

BRYCE reaches the surface and CLYDE tries to throw him into
deeper water.  He hitches BRYCE over a moldy skiff, knocking
aside one of the oars.  BUCK upends BRYCE into the skiff and
kicks it spinning.  CLYDE picks up an oar and hurls it like
a boomerang, ass over end at the skiff.  It kicks up a spray.

                         BUCK
                   (holding tightly to
                   Clyde, yelling)
            I got the PICTURE!

                                                           62.


Reaction.  CLYDE waist deep, breathing heavily.

                         CLYDE
            ...All right, all right...
                   (to Bryce, yelling)
            WE GOT YOU...HEAR?... REMEMBER...
            YOU... YOUR FACE...WE GOT IT...WE
            GOT YOU...WE GOT YOU...WE GOT YOU...

BRYCE, battered and handcuffed, stares back with mindless
malice from the lazily spinning skiff to the hysterical
spectre of CLYDE, screaming his madness across the water.

                                            DISSOLVE:

INT. BANK.

Inside the bank.  In contrast to the previous inept bank
robbery scene, this one goes admirably well, the gang
performing slickly and without a hitch.  As they enter,
dripping wet, CLYDE makes a general announcement to everyone
to the bank.

                         CLYDE
            This is the Barrow gang.
                   (the people turn and freeze)
            Everybody just take it easy and
            nobody will get hurt.

CLYDE covers the door.  BONNIE and BUCK go to the tellers'
cages and get money.  BUCK goes inside, emptying out the
cash drawers.  Cut to BONNIE filling the sack.

Cut to a close-up of a burglar alarm button.  Slowly a hand
crawls up the wall and a finger slowly moves to push the
button.  When the finger is about one inch away, suddenly a
gun appears in the frame and gently taps the hand away.  The
camera pulls back to reveal BUCK smiling at a lady teller.

                         BUCK
            Don't do nothin' silly now.

Cut to CLYDE standing near the door, training his guns on
the entire bank.  A farmer stands a few feet away, some
bills clutched in his hand.

                         CLYDE
            That your money or the bank's?

                         FARMER
            Mine.

                         CLYDE
            Keep it, then.

                                                           63.


Across the floor, the bank guard in the corner takes
advantage of CLYDE's distraction to go for his gun.  CLYDE
spots it and fires a shot that just knocks the bank guard's
hat off without harming him.

                         CLYDE
                   (to the guard, who
                   has practically
                   frozen in fear)
            Next time I'll aim a little lower.

They finish robbing the bank.  They start to exit.  Near the
door stands a guard with his hands raised.  He wears sun
glasses of the period.  As they leave BUCK snatches the sun
glasses from the guard's head.

                         BUCK
            Get a good look at us!  We're the
            Barrow boys.

EXT. BANK.  DAY.

The gang runs wildly into the street where the car waits,
motor running.  As they leap into car, BUCK throws the sun
glasses into BLANCHE's lap.

                         BUCK
            Happy birthday.

They zoom off.  Shots are heard.  BONNIE, BUCK and CLYDE
begin firing at the bank guards who are pursuing them.  The
guards fire back.

Close-up.  BLANCHE sitting in the back seat with her fingers
stuck tightly in her ears, eyes shut, trying to overcome her
panic.  A funny image, but one that also awakens pity.  The
next sequence is carried out in cross-cutting.

                                            CUT TO:

The street in front of the bank.  Police car pulls up and
the excited crowd gestures in the direction of the departed
gang.  The siren starts.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. GANG CAR.  DAY.

The siren heard now in the far distance.

                         BUCK
                   (to C.W. at the wheel)
            Kick it in the pants, C.W.

                                                           64.


                         CLYDE
            We got to make that state line!

                         C.W.
                   (driving like a wild
                   man, but adlibing loudly)
            Can't get more'n this out of a
            Plymouth!

                                            CUT TO:

INT. BANK.

The gang has left a legacy of celebrity behind.  We see the
bank guard whose hat was shot off being interviewed by a
reporter.  He is seated in a chair, his shirt open at the
collar and a woman teller is fanning him.

                         BANK GUARD
                   (enjoying the limelight)
            Then he saw me goin' for my gun.
            Clyde Barrow himself, I mean.  And
            suddenly I was starin' into the
            face of death!

                         WOMAN TELLER
            Tsk, tsk.

A photographer steps in.

                         PHOTOGRAPHER
            Just look this way, Mr. Hawkins.

The bank guard hurriedly buttons up his collar and smiles as
the flashbulb goes off.

EXT. GANG CAR.

Still speeding along, the siren more distant.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. BANK.

The bank president and a policeman are posing for that
classic picture where both stand flanking a bullet hole in
the wall and point proudly at it.  The flashbulb goes off.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. POLICE CAR.

Two men in police uniforms following BONNIE and CLYDE.

                         FIRST POLICEMAN
            Step on it, Randolph.  We gotta
            catch 'em 'fore they reach the
            state line!

                                            CUT TO:

INT. BANK.

FARMER is describing BONNIE and CLYDE to passersby who dote
on him as though he'd just had contact with a portion of the
true cross.  FARMER is aware of his position.

                         FARMER
            Clyde?...he looked like, well he
            looked real...clean...and Bonnie,
            she's too much a lady ever to be
            caught with a cigar in her mouth...I
            don't care what you heard before.
            I saw 'em right here, not twenty
            minutes ago...
                   (gravely)
            --and all's I can say is, they did
            right by me, and I'm bringin' me a
            mess of flowers to their funeral.

Car slows up perceptibly as CLYDE says:

                         CLYDE
            Okay, relax.  We're in Oklahoma now.
            Slow down.

                         FIRST POLICEMAN
            Turn around.  Don't waste no more
            gas.

                         SECOND POLICEMAN
                   (a young eager beaver type)
            Ain't we gone to catch 'em?

                                                           66.


                         FIRST POLICEMAN
            Hell, they're over the State line.
            That's out of our jurisdiction.

                         SECOND POLICEMAN
            Why don't we get 'em anyway?

                         FIRST POLICEMAN
            I ain't gone to risk my life in
            Oklahoma.  That's their problem.

Now the gang's car is seen traveling down a long, narrow
country road surrounded by cornfields.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT. ROADSIDE BY WOODS.  DAY.

They get out, taking the various bags of money with them,
and dump the lot on the hood.  There is not an impressive
amount of money.

                         CLYDE
                   (disappointed)
            Hell.  That ain't much, is it?

                         BUCK
                   (commiseratingly)
            Times is hard,

                         CLYDE
            Well, let's get to it.

He begins dealing and splitting the money out on the hood of
the car, as they gather around.

                         CLYDE
            This is Clyde Barrow.
                   (lays down a bill)
            Buck Barrow...
                   (lays down a bill)
            Bonnie Parker...C.W.
                   (goes back to the
                   first again and lays
                   out another round)
            Clyde, Buck...Bonnie...C.W. Clyde,
            Clyde again...Buck...Bonnie...C.W.

BUCK and BLANCHE stand watching.  BLANCHE looks fretful.
She nudges BUCK and whispers to him.

                                                           67.


BUCK whispers something back to her.  Meanwhile, CLYDE's
counting still goes on.

                         CLYDE
            Bonnie...C.S....Clyde...

                         BUCK
                   (very ill at east in
                   this position he has
                   been forced into)
            Um...eh...Clyde?

                         CLYDE
            Hah?

BUCK is clearly embarrassed.

                         BUCK
            Uh, Clyde...well...what about
            Blanche?

Everyone reacts with stunned amazement at BLANCHE's nerve in
wanting to get her cut.

                         BONNIE
                   (incredulous)
            WHAT?

BLANCHE sees she has to rise to her own defense, and she
rises to the occasion with spirit and verve.

                         BLANCHE
            Well, why not?  Say I earned my
            share!  Same as everybody.  I
            coulda got killed same as everybody,
            and I'm wanted by the law same as
            everybody.  Besides I coulda got
            snake bit sleepin' in them woods
            every night!
                   (building it up)
            I'm just a nervous wreck and that's
            the truth.  And I have to listen to
            sass from Miss Bonnie Parker all
            the time.  I deserve mine!

Close.  BUCK.  Day--looking at CLYDE, his face full of weak
smiles and embarrassment at his wife.

                         CLYDE
                   (with a sigh)
            Okay...okay...hold your horses,
            Blanche.  You'll get your share.

                                                           68.


BONNIE is livid but says nothing.  CLYDE, the leader has
decided.  C.W. looks indignant, like a hog who's just been
given a bath.  CLYDE begins counting all over again in near
silence.

                         BUCK
            Married a preacher's daughter and
            she still thinks she's takin' the
            collection.

Everyone now laughs, but BLANCHE.  CLYDE continues counting.

                         BUCK
                   (to Blanche)
            Well, don't spend it all in one
            place now, hear?

                         BONNIE
            She'll be doin' right well to spend
            it at all.

BONNIE turns and ambles away from the car.  After a moment
CLYDE stops counting and moves after her.  He's prepared for
a fight, stands behind BONNIE's arched back trying to gauge
the degree of hostility there.

                         CLYDE
            Bonnie?

No answer.

                         CLYDE
                   (a little defensive)
            Look, Bonnie, I've said it and I
            guess I'll keep sayin' it before
            we're thru--Blanche is Buck's wife
            and Buck is family.

He waits expectantly.

                         BONNIE
                   (finally, utterly
                   without malice)
            --she's such a silly-Billy...

BONNIE looks plaintively to CLYDE.

                         BONNIE
            My family could use some of that
            money.

                                                           69.


                         CLYDE
            Them laws have been hangin' round
            your mamas house 'til all hours,
            Bonnie.  It's just too risky to go
            there.

                         BONNIE
                   (exploding)
            Well, where can we go?  We rob the
            damn banks, what else do we do?

CLYDE cannot really answer.  Suddenly C.W. starts yelling:

                         C.W.
            CLYDE!  CLYDE!  CLYDE!

CLYDE flinches at the sound.  C.W. comes bounding over, as
rude an assault on their sensibilities as he can be.

                         CLYDE
                   (wincing as they are
                   nose to nose)
            I hear you, C.W.

                         C.W.
            This ol' heap's gushin' oil!  We
            got to swipe us another set of
            wheels right away, or we won't get
            anywhere.  Look here.

He reaches down under the pan of the car and scoops a gooey
handful of slick black oil which he holds before their faces.

                         C.W.
            See?

CLYDE nods slowly.  He looks back to BONNIE.  He sees.

                                            DISSOLVE:

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET.

A residential neighborhood on a suburban street.  A rather
well-to-do neighborhood.  The camera is up on a porch of a
white frame house, looking toward the street.  On the porch,
sitting in the swing in the left f.g. are a MAN and a WOMAN.
She is about twenty-nine, he is about thirty-six.  He is
sitting with his back to us, embracing the WOMAN.  They are
spooning, making low, loving murmurs.

                         WOMAN
            Oh, now...now, dear...

                                                           70.


                         MAN
            Mmmm...sweet thing...

We see in the distance two cars parked in front of the house.
His and hers.  Suddenly we see another car drive up (BONNIE
and CLYDE) and somebody gets out.  Then the whole gang gets
out, ditches the one car and gets in one of the parked cars.
All the while the couple on the porch is busy spooning.  The
car begins to roll slowly into the street.  The WOMAN notices.

                         WOMAN
            Say, isn't that your car, Eugene?

                         MAN
                   (still nuzzling her)
            Mmmmmm...huh?
                   (he looks, leaps from
                   the swing)
            That's my car!  Hey!

The MAN and WOMAN run down the front steps and front walk to
the second car.  They jump in and take off, giving chase.

INT. CAR.  DAY.

The WOMAN is driving (it's her car).  The MAN is furious.

                         EUGENE
            I'll tear 'em apart!  Those punks!
            Steal a man's car right out from
            under him!  Wait till I get my
            hands on those kids, Velma, I'll
            show 'em!

They continue driving, furious, the man cursing and muttering.
We see through their windshield the other car way in the
distance.

                         VELMA
            What if they have guns, Eugene?

                         EUGENE
                   (realizing the
                   possibility, he
                   suddenly stops being
                   mad and turns chicken)
            We'd better get the police and let
            them handle this.

                         VELMA
            Right.

                                                           71.


                         EUGENE
            Turn around and let's get back to
            town.  We'll go get the sheriff.

They are by now on a narrow dirt road and the WOMAN has to
execute a U-turn.  It takes her about seven cuts to turn the
car around in the narrow space.  They start back to town.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. BONNIE AND CLYDE'S CAR.

BUCK looks out the rear window.

                         BUCK
            They stopped chasin' us.  They
            turned around.

Close-up.  CLYDE grinning mischievously.

                         CLYDE
            Let's take 'em.

BUCK and C.W. laugh appreciatively at the reversal.  CLYDE
turns the car around.  He performs the U-turn in the same
narrow space in one, swift, smooth, beautiful turn.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. THE OTHER CAR.

VELMA looks in the rear view mirror and sees that now she is
being chased.

                         VELMA
            Oh, my Lord, they're comin' after us.

                         EUGENE
                   (in a panic)
            Step on it, Velma, step on it!

Close-up.  Accelerator.  VELMA jams it down to the floor.
The car speeds.

EXT. ROAD.  THE CHASE.  DAY.

BONNIE and CLYDE's car gaining on them, gaining on them,
gaining on them and finally overtaking them, coming up and
ahead, forcing them to the side of the road.

Med. shot.  The MAN and WOMAN's car.  Terrified, they roll
up their windows, lock their doors and huddle together.

                                                           72.


EXT. ROAD.

The Barrow gang piles out of their car and walks over,
having a merry time.  They surround the car and press their
faces against the window, flattening their features, making
menacing gestures at the shaking pair inside.  We see this
from the point of view of the MAN and WOMAN inside the car.
CLYDE pulls out a gun, makes as if to shoot, but he is
kidding.  They all laugh uproariously, especially BUCK who
is delighted with CLYDE's prank.  All of this we see in
pantomime from inside the trapped car.

EXT. CAR.

                         CLYDE
            C'mon, get out!  Get out of there,
            I said.

They come out, hands held high, shaking with fear.  They
have practically turned to jelly.

                         CLYDE
                   (ordering them into
                   the other car)
            Get in here.

INT. OTHER CAR.  DAY.

They get in and the gang gets in.  Seven people are now
jammed inside.  CLYDE drives, BONNIE next to him, C.W. next
to her.  In back, BLANCHE, then EUGENE with VELMA (of
necessity) sitting on his lap, and then BUCK.  As will be
seen, the reason the Barrows have kidnapped the couple is
simply that they wanted company.  Living as they do, seeing
only each other day after day, they long for diversion and
new faces.  So the atmosphere in the car will shortly change
to one of friendliness and jollity, and it will get
progressively more so in the series of cuts which advance
the time.  As the car starts up at the beginning, however,
the MAN and WOMAN are terrified.

                         BUCK
            What's your name?

                         EUGENE
                   (hesitantly)
            I'm Eugene Grizzard.

                         VELMA
            I'm Velma Davis.

                                                           73.


                         BUCK
                   (just as friendly as
                   he can be)
            Well, howdy!  We're the Barrow gang.
            That there is Clyde drivin' and I'm
            Buck.

The MAN and WOMAN almost faint from fear; clutch at each
other.  The gang all laugh at this.  VELMA and EUGENE begin
to realize that they are not going to get hurt and that the
Barrows are friendly to them.

                         BONNIE
            Look, don't be scared, folks.  It
            ain't like you was the law.  You're
            just folks like us.

                         EUGENE
                   (agreeing over-enthusiastically)
            Yeah, yeah, that's the truth.

                         CLYDE
            I expect you been readin' about us.

The MAN and the WOMAN answer simultaneously with what they
think is the right thing to say under the circumstances.

                         EUGENE
            Yes.

                         VELMA
            No.

They glare at each other.

                         EUGENE
                   (meaningfully)
            Yes, Velma, we have too.

                         BONNIE
                   (laughing at the contretemps)
            Well, you two must be in love, I bet.

EUGENE and VELMA blush, get shy for a second.  BONNIE smiles.

                         BUCK
                   (gleefully, clapping
                   his hands)
            Well, when you gonna marry the
            girl, boy?

Everyone chuckles heartily.

                                            CUT TO:

                                                           74.


INT. CAR.  LATER.

--still driving, same positions, but some time has elapsed.
The atmosphere is now completely convivial and the captives
are enjoying their new friends.  As the scene starts, BUCK
is finishing his joke.

                         BONNIE
            So then she drinks her milk down
            again, every drop.  And she looks
            over at her son and says, "Son,
            whatever you do, don't sell that
            cow!"

The couple laughs with great amusement, but everyone else in
the car doesn't laugh--this is the tenth time they've heard
the joke.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. OF CAR.

--getting on toward evening.  All are thoroughly relaxes and
chatting.

                         BONNIE
                   (to Velma)
            How old are you, honey?

                         VELMA
            Thirty-three.

A sudden look of surprise registers on EUGENE's face.

INT. OF CAR.  NIGHT.

It is now night.  Everyone inside the car is eating.
Apparently they stopped somewhere along the way for food.
In the crowded interior, it is like a party--food is being
passed back and forth, laughter and gaiety, increasing
warmth between the couple and the Barrows.  The car has
become a little society on wheels, dashing through the black
night down the highway.  Inside there is a small world of
happiness and fun.

BUCK is unpacking the food and passing sandwiches and drinks
around the car.

                         VELMA
            Now I ordered some French fries,
            didn't I?

                                                           75.


                         BUCK
                   (passing her some)
            Yeah, here you go.

                         CLYDE
            Take it easy on those French fries,
            Velma.  Ain't that right, Eugene?

                         EUGENE
                   (studying his hamburger)
            This isn't mine.  I ordered mine
            well done.  Who's got the other
            hamburger?

Close-up.  C.W. who has already taken a bite of the other one.

                         C.W.
            Oh, is this supposed to be yours?

He extends the bitten burger out to EUGENE.

Full shot.

                         EUGENE
            That's okay, forget it.

CLYDE laughs at this.

                         BUCK
                   (chewing)
            Haw!  I sure am havin' a good time!
            How 'bout you folks?  Ain't you
            glad we picked you up?

                         CLYDE
                   (laughing)
            Hey, maybe y'all ought to join up
            with us.

That idea strikes everyone as being very amusing.

                         EUGENE
                   (laughing)
            Ha!  Wouldn't they be surprised
            back home to hear that?

                         VELMA
            Yeah.  What would Martha and Bill
            say if they heard that?
                   (she roars with laughter)
                         (MORE)

                                                           76.


                         VELMA (CONT'D)


                         EUGENE
            Lordy!  They'd throw a fit!
                   (roars with laughter)


                         BONNIE
                   (laughing)
            What do you do, anyway?

                         EUGENE
                   (as his laugh begins
                   to fade)
            I'm an undertaker.

Suddenly everyone freezes.  A shudder, as if the cold hand
of death had suddenly touched the occupants of the car.  The
atmosphere changes to cold, deadly, fearful silence in
exactly one second.  It is a premonition of death for the
Barrows, and they react accordingly, BONNIE especially.

Close-up.  BONNIE.

                         BONNIE
                   (tautly, in a flat voice)
            Get them out of here.

EXT. ROAD.  NIGHT.

The car brakes to a sudden stop.  The rear down is opened,
the MAN and WOMAN flung out into the darkness.  The car
drives off into the lonely night.

From this point on, the audience should realize that death
is inevitable for the Barrow gang, that it follows them
always, that it waits anywhere.  It is no longer a question
of whether death will come, but when it will.

EXT. WOODS.  MORNING.

Moving with CLYDE he tears through the brush, snagging his
clothes, calling BONNIE's name.  CLYDE's search is so
desperate here that for a moment we might think he is
fleeing from something rather than looking for something.

In a moment he emerges onto the road.  The car, with C.W.
driving, and BUCK and BLANCHE beside him, is patrolling
slowly up ahead of him.

CLYDE spots it and runs toward it.  Hold on this angle until
he catches up with it and leaps onto the running board.

                                                           77.


Moving shot.  Car.  Morning.  CLYDE, now on the running
board, his head poked into the car, his face apple red and
sweating.

                         CLYDE
                   (breathing heavily)
            ...see anythin', Buck?

BUCK is shocked at his brother's desperation, but makes no
overt comment on it.

                         BUCK
            --not yet, boy.

                         CLYDE
                   (with an edge of
                   paranoia, as if the
                   three of them might
                   be withholding
                   something from him)
            --and nobody saw her leave, or
            heard anythin'
                   (almost a threat)
            ...C.W....?

EXT. CAR.  MOVING SHOT.  DAY.

CLYDE gets the point.  For the very first time we see CLYDe,
the leader, helpless as he hangs onto the running board.

                         CLYDE
                   (lamely)
            ...Well, where do you think she
            could've gone?...Buck?...Buck?

                         BUCK
                   (amazed and a little frightened)
            Jesus, I don't know...

CLYDE looks helplessly at his brother, then drops off the
running board and continues on foot, running along, scanning
the fields--the car keeping up beside him as he runs and we
truck before both car and CLYDE.

Angle on car through windshield.  Reaction shot.  Day.  BUCK
turning to BLANCHE, shrugging his shoulders, speechless.

Reverse angle through the windshield.  Day--at CLYDE, who
has suddenly seen something begins gesticulating wildly,
almost--from car's POV, a little comically.

                         CLYDE
            There!  There!  There!

                                                           78.


He starts running off into a cornfield.

Another angle--picking up CLYDE as he kicks his way into the
cornfield, knees pumping high, knocking down the stalks.  He
stops and picks up the stocking he had spotted, takes it and
moves on.

Still another angle as CLYDE has picked up a freshly beaten
trail through the cornfield.  He picks up one of BONNIE's
scarves, now.  As he runs on, he clears a knoll and BONNIE,
her yellow hair unmistakable even at this distance, comes
into view.  She's far off in the cornfield, stalking off,
looking neither to right nor left, carrying a brown paper
sack that has split, from which she has occasionally lost
clothing.  CLYDE screams, "BONNIE." She apparently doesn't
hear.

Angle on cornfield.  Day.  As CLYDE gets closer.  BONNIE
herself suddenly breaks into flight, the paper bag splitting
completely, the remaining clothes spilling out.  There is a
real chase where they each try to get the advantage.  CLYDE
is so exhausted from his run that he has real trouble
cornering her as they maneuver up and down the rows of corn.
Finally CLYDE catches up.

Extreme close-up.  BONNIE & CLYDE.  Day.  As they tumble
into the stalks of corn, mowing them down.

                         BONNIE
            Leave me alone!  Leave me alone!

                         CLYDE
                   (holding her, kissing
                   her frantically)
            Hey...hey, hey, baby, hey, Bonnie,
            hey baby...
                   (calming her down)
            ...Hey, hey now...just where did
            you think you were goin'?...

BONNIE doesn't answer.

Up angle.  POV CLYDE.  As he's momentarily distracted by
BUCK's laughter as he's in the cornfield picking up BONNIE's
clothing.  CLYDE waves an impatient it's all-right-wave.  He
turns back to BONNIE who he still holds tightly.

                         CLYDE
                   (still frantic)
            --Huh.  Bonnie?  Where?  Where?

                                                           79.


                         BONNIE
            I don't know!  You're hurting me, I
            was just scared is all...and my
            mama's been on my mind, and she's
            gettin' so old...

BONNIE hesitates, beginning to feel a little foolish now.

                         CLYDE
            Boy, don't ever leave without
            sayin' somethin'.  You really
            scared me, Bonnie.

                         BONNIE
            But I mean it, though.  I want to
            see my mama.  Please, Clyde.

Two shot.  BONNIE and CLYDE.  Day.

                         CLYDE
                   (enormously relieved,
                   kissing her)
            Okay, sweetheart.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. SIDE OF A ROAD.  VERY LONG SHOT.  DAY.

--of three or four cars parked on the side of a road in
Texas.  A light rain is falling.  There are a lot of people
gathered around, but the sound is an indistinct mixture of
talk, laughter, etc.

There follows a quick montage of cuts which isolate specific
moments in the family reunion, thereby implying the entire
tone of the proceedings.  The sense of family pervades.

Montage.  BONNIE and MOTHER.  BONNIE's mother, an old woman,
grabs her and hugs her and cries.

Montage.  BONNIE, CLYDE, MAN.  A man, an uncle perhaps,
stands with BONNIE and CLYDE, arms around them both, hugging
them to his sides tightly.

Montage.  BONNIE and sister.  BONNIE's sister hands them a
scrapbook of clippings.

                         SISTER
            Here you are, we been cuttin' and
            pastin' everything we could find
            about you in the papers.

                                                           80.


CLYDE, BONNIE, BUCK and BLANCHE all look at the scrapbook.
We see a page of it, showing newspaper articles with the
photographs the gang took back at the motel.

                         BUCK
            Hey look, here's that one I took of
            you, Clyde.  That came out just fine!

Montage.  BONNIE, CLYDE, MAN.  BONNIE and CLYDE are posing
for a comic snapshot.  A silly looking male relative is
posing, pointing a gun at them.  They have their hands in
the air and are grinning broadly.  (The effect should be
funny and simultaneously frightening.)

Montage BUCK, SMALL BOY.  BUCK is sitting with a little
four-year-old on his knee, bouncing him up and down and
singing.  Both are having a fine time.

                         BUCK
                   (singing)
            Oh, Horsey! keep your tail up, keep
            yer tail up, keep yer tail up, Oh,
            Horsey! keep yer tail up, Why don't
            you make it rise.

Montage--C.W.  A hand off camera thrusts a sandwich at C.W.
He opens the bread to see what's inside it, then eats it.

Montage--BONNIE & SISTER.  BONNIE sits stock-still while her
sister gives her a permanent in the back seat of a car.  He
sister pauses, setting down the curling iron.  She strokes
BONNIE's yellow head with her hand, as though she were a
wild animal that had paused long enough to be petted.
BONNIE turns to see her sister's expression.  They embrace.

Montage--Family picnic--Favoring CLYDE, MOTHER & BONNIE.
CLYDE, in his best theatrical manner has been playing host
in the sand pile, perhaps using some sort of towel across
the arm or around the middle.  The party is beginning to
break up now as used paper plates and crumpled napkins are
blowing across the sand and the group is finishing up on
Eskimo pie.

                         BONNIE'S UNCLE
                   (rising)
            Where y'all headed from here?

                         CLYDE
                   (right back)
            I don't know, what y'all got in
            mind?  At this point we ain't
            headin' to anywhere, we're just
            runnin' from.

                                                           81.


CLYDE laughs, in fine spirits.

Reaction--BONNIE.  She doesn't.

                         BONNIE'S SISTER'S VOICE
            C'mon, down, Litte Tom!  We're
            goin' home.  Little Tom?  Mathew,
            fetch Little Tom.

                         BONNIE
            Don't go yet, Mama.

                         UNCLE'S VOICE
                   (cutting in)
            C'mere, c'mere you little corn
            roller.

Wide angle.  As Uncle sweeps up the laughing little Tom.

Reaction--BONNIE.  BONNIE turns with increased urgency to
her MOTHER, who, having been hefted to her feet by BONNIE's
sister, has turned to CLYDE, who gives her a big, boyish hug.

                         MOTHER
            ...you know, Clyde, I read about
            y'all in the papers and I'm jes'
            scared.

                         BONNIE
                   (to Clyde)
            Sugar, make mama stay a while yet.

                         CLYDE
                   (ignoring Bonnie, as
                   does Mother,
                   ebulliently, even joshing)
            Now Mrs. Parker, don't y'all
            believe what you read in the papers!
            That's the law talking there.  They
            want us to look big so's they'll
            look big when they catch us.

He knows he's stumbled onto the wrong thing, but he bounces
right along--it's his style.

                         CLYDE
            --and they can't do that.  Why, I'm
            even better at runnin' than robbin'
            banks--aw shoot, if we done half
            the stuff they said we did, we'd be
            millionaires, wouldn't we, old

                                                           82.


                         CLYDE (CONT'D)
                   (he turns to Bonnie
                   who continues to
                   stare at her Mother)
            And I wouldn't risk Bonnie here
            just to make money, uncertain as
            times are.  Why one time I knowed
            of a job where we could of make
            $2000 easy, but I saw the law
            outside and I said to myself, why
            Bonnie could get hurt here.  So I
            just drove right on and let that
            money lay.

He waits for a response, as does BONNIE.  BONNIE's MOTHER
smiles, a little abstractedly.

                         MOTHER
            ...Maybe you know the way with her,
            then.  I'm just an old woman and I
            don't know nothin...

She trails off, looking nowhere in particular.  CLYDE takes
her reaction to mean that he's overwhelming her with his
confidence, and continues to pour it on.

                         CLYDE
            We'll be quittin' this just as soon
            as the hard times is over, Mother
            Parker, I can tell you that.  Why
            me and Bonnie were just talkin' the
            other day and we talked about when
            we'd settle down and get us a home,
            and Bonnie said, "I couldn't bear
            to live morn'n three miles from my
            precious mother." Now how'd you
            like that, Mother Parker?

BONNIE's MOTHER has undergone a funny sort of transformation
during CLYDE's speech--as if something had suddenly come
into focus before the old woman's eyes.

                         MOTHER
            Don't believe I would.  I surely
            don't.
                   (to Bonnie)
            You try to live three miles from me
            and you won't live long, honey.
                   (to Clyde)
            You'd best keep runnin' and you
            know it, Clyde Barrow.
                   (matter of fact)
            Bye, baby.

                                                           83.


She hugs BONNIE who can barely respond.  We move in for a
closeup of BONNIE as her various relatives, young and old
come by to squeeze, kiss and hug her with a chirpy little
chorus of Bye, Bonnie!  Bye, Bonnie, bye, bye, bye.

                                            DISSOLVE:

EXT. PLATTE CITY MOTEL.  PLATTE CITY, IOWA.  DAY.

Hold on the outside long enough to see the unusual
structures: two little motel cabins connected by two
identical garages, an entirely symmetrical structure.

INT. PLATTE CITY MOTEL BEDROOM.  WITH BONNIE.  DAY.

--as she tries, against heavy odds, to file and trim her
nails in a corner of the room.  The odds are; CLYDE on a
uke, b.g., BUCK, and BLANCHE--gathered around C.W. who sits
in the only stuffed chair in the room.  Their o.s.
raucousness is clearly shattering to BONNIE who, at a key
moment in the scene, ends up spearing her cuticle with a
file, spurting a little board and a lot of temper.

Other angle.  CLYDE--BUCK--BLANCHE--C.W.  Day.  A naked
lightbulb (the lampshade has been removed) glares down on
C.W.'s chest--where a pair of bluebirds have been tattooed
with a rocco flourish.  BUCK and BLANCHE are vastly amused--
rather BLANCHE takes delight in BUCK's delight.

                         BUCK
            How long have ya had it?

                         C.W.
                   (like some docile
                   animal submitting to inspection)
            --just got it.

                         BUCK
                   (to Blanche, who
                   stares fascinated as
                   one of C.W.'s pectoral
                   muscles contracts and
                   the wings flutter)
            Touch it, honey!  Go on!

BLANCHE squeals with amusement.  BUCK takes BLANCHE's hand
and places it on the bluebirds.

                         BLANCHE
                   (titillated with delight)
            Oh, no, Daddy!  No!

Reaction BONNIE.  Day--as the file digs into her cuticle on
BLANCHE's squeal.  With barely controlled rage:

                                                           84.


                         BONNIE
            What are you all doin'?

INT. MOTEL BEDROOM.  GROUP SHOT.  FAV. BONNIE.  DAY.

                         C.W.
                   (insensitive to
                   Bonnie's stare)
            Playin' with my tattoo, Bonnie.

                         BONNIE
            Well, why don't you all go play
            with it somewhere else?

New angle.  Motel bedroom.  Day.

                         BLANCHE
            What's bothering her?

                         CLYDE
                   (sees something coming)
            Not now, Blanche.

                         BUCK
                   (who doesn't want to
                   be victimized by
                   Bonnie's temperament)
            What's bothering her, Clyde?

                         BONNIE
                   (exploding)
            I said go somewhere else!

She picks up the first three objects she can find on the
dresser and hurls them--an ashtray, a Gideon Bible, and a
flower pot--at the little group.  The pot goes shattering
into the wall.  Everyone ducks.

                         CLYDE
                   (straightening up,
                   matter-of-fact)
            Bonnie's hungry, C.W. I saw a
            chicken place a few miles back.
            Who all wants to go get some food?

INT. MOTEL BEDROOM.  GROUP SHOT.  DAY.

                         BLANCHE
                   (rising from her
                   chair, a little
                   shaken at Bonnie's outburst)
            I sure do.  I'm plenty tired of
            sittin' around here anyway.

                                                           85.


                         BUCK
                   (not making a move to
                   get up)
            You can't drive, honeylove.

                         C.W.
                   (reluctantly)
            I'll go.

CLYDE makes a face to BONNIE pretending there's something
going on between C.W. and BLANCHE.  BONNIE tries to keep
from being amused.  C.W. moves out with BLANCHE.  BUCK rises
to go next door.

                         C.W.
            What's everybody want?

                         CLYDE
            Just five chicken dinners, and get
            somethin' for dessert.

                         BUCK
            See if they got peach ice cream.
                   (he grins and pats
                   his stomach)


All finally exit, leaving BONNIE and CLYDE alone.

EXT. CAR AND STREET.  DUSK.

C.W. and BLANCHE go out.  We go with them.  They get in the
car and drive off.  BUCK enters his cabin.

INT. MOTEL BEDROOM.  BONNIE AND CLYDE.  DUSK.

CLYDE reaches her, and for a moment both stare with fanatic
intensity at each other, BONNIE trying desperately to keep a
straight face.  They are nose to nose, unblinking.  CLYDE
gives her a big raspberry, waggling his fingers in his ears
like a kid.  She laughs.

                         BONNIE
            I hate you all.

                         CLYDE
            I hate y'all, too.

                         BONNIE
            no, I really hate you.

She turns away from him, wilts onto the bed.

                                                           86.


                         BONNIE
                   (eyes brimming)
            Oh, baby, I've got the blues so
            bad...

CLYDE moves behind her, begins to massage her back.  There
is something very delicate about the way he touches her; it
suggests CLYDE's sensitivity to her mood rather than any
degree of physical intimacy.

                         CLYDE
            Bonnie?...is it your mama, what
            your mama said?

                         BONNIE
            What mama?...she's just an old
            woman now...I have no mama...

BONNIE rolls over on her back, stares up at CLYDE, tears
splaying across her face from the move.

                         BONNIE
                   (quietly)
            ...so funny...I thought when we
            first went out, we were really
            goin' somewhere...but this is it--
            we're just goin', huh?

She has addressed this last directly to CLYDE, but there is
nothing rhetorical about it--it is a real question.  CLYDE
doesn't answer for a moment.  Then:

                         CLYDE
            Do you care about where we're goin'?

BONNIE clearly finds this hard to say:

                         BONNIE
            Not as long as you care about me.

                         CLYDE
                   (quite simply)
            Why I love you, sugar.

It's the first time he's said it to her, and BONNIE is
overwhelmed.  She wraps her arms around CLYDE's middle, and
snuggles into him, like a child.  Neither we nor CLYDE can
see BONNIE's face now, and her voice is muffled by his chest.

                         BONNIE'S VOICE
            --enough to die with me, baby?...
            'cause I think that's where we're
            goin'...I surely do.

                                                           87.


CLYDE is both touched and amused by the plea.  He strokes
her head lightly.  Really meaning it.

                         CLYDE
            --wherever.

                                            DISSOLVE:

INT. CAR.

BLANCHE, her tense and agitated self growing increasingly
more so lately, lights a fresh cigarette off the butt of the
one she has been smoking.

                         C.W.
                   (conversationally)
            You sure smokin' all the time lately.

                         BLANCHE
                   (quick to take
                   offense, snaps)
            So what?

                         C.W.
            Nothin'.

BLANCHE, sick of it all, drops her head in her hand with a
sigh.

                         BLANCHE
            Oh, God...

C.W. looks at her, finally decides to say something that
occurs to him.

                         C.W.
            Whyn't you go back home to your papa?

                         BLANCHE
                   (it's been her dream)
            Oh, if I could!  If I could just do
            that one thing!  Oh, there's no
            tellin' why this all happened.  I
            was a preacher's daughter.

                         C.W.
            When church is your pa affiliated
            with?

                                                           88.


                         BLANCHE
                   (much more interested
                   in talking about herself)
            Baptist...oh, and he thought the
            world of Buck, my daddy did, even
            knowing that Buck was serving time
            in jail.  He forgave him for that
            'cause he paid his debt to society.

                         C.W.
            We were Disciples of Christ.

INT. FRIED CHICKEN CAFE.

The camera remains stationary in this scene, in this position.
A lunch counter sweeps down the center of the screen.  We
are at one end of the counter.  In the f.g., a DEPUTY sits
drinking coffee, absorbed in his cup.  In the b.g., at the
other end of the counter, by the Exit door, BLANCHE and C.W.
are being handed their order by the counterman.

                         BLANCHE
            Hey, C.W., I ain't got my money.
            Give me some, will you?

The DEPUTY turns his head and looks over there.  C.W. opens
his jacket to reach in his pocket for money.  As he opens
his coat, his gun is clearly seen tucked in his pants.
Camera zooms in to tight close-up of gun.

Close shot.  DEPUTY--his face tense.  Sound of door closing
shut, as C.W. and BLANCHE leave.

                         DEPUTY
                   (to counterman)
            Get Sheriff Smoot on the phone.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

INT. PLATTE CITY MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT.

On C.W.'s moonlit chest and face, tattooed bluebirds heaving
and occasionally snoring in the night.  Behind him the room
is dimly lit by flickering candles that are placed out of
sight on the floor.  The shapes in the room--the bed is
gutted and only the box mattress remains--dresser, lamp
shades, etc., are grotesque in the flickering light.  O.s.
sounds of BONNIE and CLYDE, BONNIE giggling and CLYDE
whispering something we can't quite hear.

Move across the room toward the gutted bed.  Move giggling
from the floor beneath the box mattress--for a moment it
should appear as if something perversely sexual may be going
on between BONNIE and CLYDE.

                                                           89.


                         BONNIE'S VOICE
            Ready?

                         CLYDE'S VOICE
                   (a little embarrassed)
            Aw Bonnie--

                         BONNIE'S VOICE
                   (coaxing)
            C'mon!

CLYDE's arm wielding a Tommy gun, clears the bed.  With the
muzzle, CLYDE knocks the swivel mirror on the dresser
overhead, bringing BONNIE and CLYDE into view.

Closer angle mirror--BONNIE and CLYDE.  Night.  BONNIE lies
stiff as a statue on the white mattress, impeccably dressed
for her funeral.  Candelabras made of empty beer bottles lie
at her head and feet.  BONNIE's hands and face are powdered
and painted a waxen white.  She wears a garish silk bow in
her hair which it, for this occasion, curled like a little
girl's.

CLYDE sits up, beer bottle in one hand, Tommy gun in the
other, derby hat cocked--and just a little unsure of the
whole thing.  He takes a swig--BONNIE stops him, trying
terribly hard not to change her position.

                         BONNIE
            Lie down now, honey.

                         CLYDE
            I've done enough!

Angle on mirror--BONNIE and CLYDE.  Night.

                         BONNIE
                   (with patience, to a child)
            You have to lie down...it's the
            only way we can tell what we'll
            look kike together.

She giggles again, more than a little gassed herself.  CLYDE
clamps a big cigar between his teeth and abruptly lies down
beside her.  CLYDE is both amused and annoyed.

                         CLYDE
                   (staring up at
                   himself talking with
                   cigar clenched
                   between his teeth)
            Whatta you think?

                                                           90.


                         BONNIE
                   (it suddenly strikes her)
            That's not the right tie!

                         CLYDE
            What?

                         BONNIE
                   (rising, weaving a little)
            You can't wear polka-dots on an
            occasion like this.

                         CLYDE
            Well what--

                         BONNIE
            Stripes.  Don't go away now.

She weaves her way over to the dresser, takes a swig from a
bottle there herself, checks her makeup, and returns with
the tie.  Holding against his chest to try it out she almost
falls into him.  CLYDE steadies her.

                         BONNIE
            Perfect.

She tries to tie it for him, and clearly has trouble with
the knot.

                         CLYDE
            OK, o.k.  If we're gonna do this,
            at least I can tie it myself.  Lie
            down before you fall down.

INT. MOTEL BEDROOM--BONNIE AND CLYDE.  NIGHT.

She does, with some play-acting, exaggerated obeisance to
CLYDE's command--reaching up at the last moment like a
zombie and snatching an artificial flower from BLANCHE's hat
which still lies on the dresser.  CLYDE lies down now.  They
look into the mirror again.

                         CLYDE
                   (grudgingly)
            Better?

                         BONNIE
            Much.

This tickles CLYDE despite himself and he laughs--BONNIE
begins to sing to him--performing for both CLYDe and her own
image in the mirror--like some hoydenish vaudevillian.

                                                           91.


During the course of the song she will rise and take CLYDE
with her who finally joins in when they tip-toe over and
begin to serenade C.W.

                         BONNIE & CLYDE
                   (to the lugubrious
                   strains of the Death March)
            "Did you ever think when a hearse
            went by,
            That somebody you or I may die?
            They'll wrap you up in a big white
            sheet
            and bury you down just about six
            feet,
            The worms crawl in, the worms crawl
            out,
            The worms play penuckle on your
            snout.
            Your eyes fall in, your teeth fall
            out,
            Your face turns green and the pus
            runs out.

During this last they have been hovering over C.W.'s
twitching face, like a couple of tipsy ghouls, whisper-
singing into his ears.  C.W. finally blinks, doesn't even
bother to look at them.

                         C.W.
            I'm gonna die if I don't get some
            sleep.  Quit singing that.

Reaction--BONNIE and CLYDE.  Night.  They smile, go back and
lie down.  Looking at their images:

                         BONNIE
            All right, shut your eyes now.

                         CLYDE
                   (playing along with her)
            No, you first.

                         BONNIE
            One for the money.

                         CLYDE
            Two for the show.

                         BONNIE
            Three to get ready--

                         CLYDE & BONNIE
            Four to Go.

                                                           92.


As they approach four we should feel that somehow when they
shut their eyes, they really will die.  They shut them on
GO, and screen goes black.

EXT. PLATTE CITY MOTEL.  NIGHT.

Ranged across the lawn are six police cars, loaded with
peace officers.  Four men come out and, guns drawn, walk
cautiously over to the room on the right--BUCK and BLANCHE's.

INT. PLATTE CITY MOTEL.  BUCK'S CABIN.  NIGHT.

There is a knock on the door.  They sit bolt upright in bed.
Before BUCK can say anything, BLANCHE puts her hand over his
mouth to shut him up.

                         BLANCHE
                   (calling out)
            The men are on the other side.

EXT. PLATTE CITY MOTEL.  NIGHT.

The four lawmen, among them the DEPUTY from the cafe, edge
their way across the lawn, past the first garage, past the
second.  Before they reach the door of BONNIE and CLYDE's
cabin, the window smashes and there are blasts of gunfire.
One cop is hit and falls, the others run back to the cars
for cover.  BONNIE and C.W. are at the window, firing
steadily.

CLYDE--running into the garage to get the car.  They must
escape.  All they can do is escape, and all they have is
that one car in the closed garage.

Outside.  Two of the lawmen fall to the ground, shot.  As
the remaining two run back for cover, we see a blinding
light rolling up in a space between the six cars.  It is an
armored truck, with mounted guns and and spotlight, advancing
toward the cabin.

Inside the armored truck.  Two men in the seat.  Sounds of
gunshots coming from everywhere, piercing light.  From
inside the truck, we suddenly see the windshield shattered
from bullets fired by BONNIE and C.W.  The driver is hit,
and he slumps over the wheel.  His body hits the horn, which
starts blasting and continues throughout the battle.  The
other man, quickly, ducks under the dashboard for protection.

Inside the garage.  CLYDE standing by the car.  He holds the
Browning Automatic.  The garage door is shaking from the
impact of bullets, shattering.  His gun already firing
(automatic clip) before he gets there.  CLYDE in a crouch
runs to the garage door, flings it up, and runs back inside
the car.  Now the door is open and he can get the car out.

                                                           93.


One hand on the wheel, one hand shooting, he rolls the car
out onto the driveway.  The battle is raging from all sides.

EXT. STREET.

The car stops.  CLYDE keeps shooting.  The door of the cabin
flies open and BONNIE and C.W. come charging out, guns
blazing away.  C.W.  fires the Thompson sub-machine gun,
BONNIE fires two pistols with automatic clips.  They run in
a crouch, tryingto get inside the car in front of their door.
They make it.

Camera pans across the motel to the other door.  It opens,
BUCK and BLANCHE come out, holding a double bed mattress in
front of them for protection.  This makes their running
awkward--the mattress is heavy.  BLANCHE carries the front
end, BUCK the back with one hand, the other firing his gun.
They get halfway to the car and then BUCK is hit, shot in
the head.  He falls to the ground; BLANCHE and the mattress
fall too since she has lost balance.  Both are under the
mattress.

CLYDE dashes out of the car and drags BUCK into the back
seat.  BLANCHE follows, hysterical.  All guns on all sides
are still firing.  They fling themselves into the car and
from a standing start, the car starts out at 60 mph down the
driveway.  One of the lawmen stands blocking the way with a
double-barrele rifle, but the car keeps coming, about to run
him down.  He jumps out of the way and fires at the side.
The glass cracks and we see BLANCHE fling a hand to her
face, which is bloody.  A piece of glass has lodged in her
eye.  We hear her scream.  The horn is still blasting.

INT. THE CAR SWERVING MADLY.

CLYDE manages to keep it on the road.  They drive away.

EXT. STREET.

The police run back to their cars to give chase, calling out
to each other, unable to believe that the gang could possibly
have gotten away.

INT. CAR.  NIGHT.

as it is speeding down the highway.  Crazy, mad hillbilly
music on the soundtrack.  Packed inside this car right now
is more sheer human misery and horror than could be believed.
It is hell in there, hell and suffering and pain.  The car
is a complete mess.  C.W. is sobbing.  Everyone is hysterical.
BLANCHE is shrieking with pain and concern for BUCK.  BUCK
is alternating between groaning and passing out completely.
BONNIE is yelling at everybody to shut up.

                                                           94.


Only CLYDE, driving with both hands clenched on the wheel,
is silent.  The car is doing 90.

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET.  NIGHT.

The car from the outside, a half hour later.  They have
eluded the police.  They are barreling down the road at top
speed on a nice suburban street with proper homes.  It is
the middle of the night, utter silence.  CLYDE stops the
car, points to ca car in a driveway--it is a beautiful,
shiny new and expensive automobile.  C.W. runs out, runs up
the driveway, peers inside, gets in, quietly backs it down
the driveway and pulls behind the gang's bullet-riddled
getaway car.  Suddenly they both zoom off down the road
together.

INT. OF THE NEW CAR.  NIGHT.

C.W. driving alone.  He is crying, mumbling, wiping his eyes
and nose with one hand while he controls the wheel with the
other.

EXT. RING OF FIRS.  NIGHT.

A wide field in the country.  This is Dexter, Iowa.  It is
quiet.  We see, in a long shot that takes in everything,
that this is a meadow surrounded by a ring of trees, a dense
forest that circles them.  The meadow, however, is large.

The two cars drive into the middle of the field, headlights
on.  They stop and the Barrow gang gets out.  They are in
horrible shape--we can finally have a look at them.  Half-
dressed in their pajamas, bloody, dirty, in tatters.  Those
that can stagger out do so, others are carried.  A far shot
of all this.

Closer shot.  Moving closer to them, we see CLYDE and C.W.
lay BUCK down on the ground.  CLYDE begins to administer to
his wounds as best he can, mostly just wiping him off.  BUCK
is semi-conscious.  All are in a semi-daze.  BLANCHE falls
to her knees, still clutching her eyes.  She is totally
hysterical.

                         BLANCHE
            Oh, God, please help us!  Dear
            Father in Heaven, get us out of
            this and Buck will never do another
            bad thing in his life!
                   (she continues
                   moaning, praying, sobbing)


BONNIE walks over to the group, looking at BUCK, C.W. goes
over to her.  Two shot--BONNIE and C.W.

                                                           95.


                         C.W.
            He ain't got a chance.  Half his
            head blown off.

Camera pulls back to take in BLANCHE.

                         BLANCHE
            My eyes!
                   (she SCREAMS)
            God, I think I'm blind.
                   (in the headlights)
            ...light hurts so bad...

BONNIE walks over to the car and comes back with the
sunglasses BUCK had given BLANCHE.  Moving her out of the
glare, she helps BLANCHE put them on.  BONNIE now has an arm
around BLANCHE, and BLANCHE shivers into BONNIE gracefully.
BONNIE is a little repelled by BLANCHE, but comforts her out
of genuine feeling for her.

                         BLANCHE
                   (clinging)
            Please, please get us to a doctor!
            Tell Clyde to get us to a doctor.
            We'll die here.

                         BONNIE
                   (helping with glasses)
            --here, hon'.

BONNIE looks silently up to CLYDE.  CLYDE is looking dumbly
down at his mangled brother.

                         BLANCHE
                   (going on)
            Clyde, Clyde, please get us to a
            doctor.

Though BLANCHE cannot see it, CLYDE has knelt down to the
side of BUCK, taking BUCK's hand and with his other hand has
begun smoothing BUCK's hair back, away from the wound.

                         BLANCHE
            He's your brother!

                         BONNIE
                   (gently, knowing
                   CLYDE will not and
                   cannot answer BLANCHE)
            Buck can't be moved, now, hon'.

BLANCHE's answer to this is hysterical sobbing, burying
herself into BONNIE, mumbling half-coherent, muffled prayers
between the sobs.

                                                           96.


With BUCK and CLYDE.

                         BUCK
                   (weakly)
            Clyde?...Clyde?...

                         CLYDE
            Right here, boy.

                         BUCK
            I believe I lost my shoes...maybe
            the dog hid 'em...
                   (he lapses into
                   unconsciousness again)


CLYDE has begun to cry a little, continues to smooth back
BUCK's hair with ritualistic regularity.

Wide angle.  Night.  Camera pulls away, way back to wide
shot of the entire field, showing the group in the center of
the darkness, lit by the headlights.

Match dissolve into early dawn, camera still on the wide
shot.  The field is lighter, though the trees still loom
blackly around it.  The two cars, one almost a shattered
wreck, the other bright and shiny and new, are parked in the
center.  The sky is light, but the trees cast a dark shadow
on the field.  The gang is just sitting around.  BLANCHE
weeping next to BUCK, C.W. sitting on the running board of a
car, staring.  BONNIE standing and smoking.  CLYDE still
with BUCK.

All is quiet.

EXT. WOODS.  DAY.

From the edge of the woods, a man in a white shirt emerges
from behind a tree.  The camera swings abruptly to get him.
He calls out to the gang.

                         MAN
            Surrender!

It is a total surprise.  BONNIE, CLYDE and C.W. all grab
their guns and fire several shots; they are not firing the
big guns now, but the pistols.  The man lingers there for a
moment--he looks strange, white, luminous, like an
apparition--and then he vanishes into the woods.  Silence,
long enough to make you think it was perhaps an illusion.

Then there is a volley of gunfire--a noise so large as to be
almost an impossible sound--coming from the woods, all
around, everywhere.

                                                           97.


A ring of little white puffs of smoke emerge from the woods;
from every tree a puff of smoke.  The camera pans in a
circle.  Behind every tree is a man with a gun.  There are
at least 150 people out there--peace officers, farmers with
hunting rifles, kids with squirrel guns, everyone who wanted
to come along and catch BONNIE and CLYDE.  Their number is
so large because this time they want no possibility of the
gang making what seemed by them supernatural escapes.

From this point on, the sound of guns is unnaturally muffled
on the sound track.  We hardly hear them at all..it is like
a dream.

Without a word, all of the gang including the half-dead BUCK
making his final effort, scramble for the nearest car.  They
run, throughout this battle, crouched, like animals--their
only thought, to get away, to escape.  To fight it out would
be ludicrous.

From the moment the Barrows start in motion, there is
shooting again from the edge of the woods.  We see them
scrambling towards the car, in an extreme long shot,
surrounded by the ring of smoke.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. OF THE CAR.

All of them inside.  CLYDE is at the wheel.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT. CAR.

Med. Long shot of the car moving.  The sound track goes to
complete silence.  We see the car looking for an avenue of
escape.  It veers towards a tree, a man steps out from
behind the tree and fires, the car jerks and veers toward
another tree, again a man steps out and fires and so on.
The car performs its eccentric dance, all in utter silence
(no sound of the motor, nothing).  The film should have the
feeling of slow motion, as the car swerves and loops along
the edge of the woods.  Not once do any of the Barrows fire
back.  Another man steps out and aims.

INT. CAR.

Close-up.  CLYDE.  At the wheel-shot in the arm.  He grabs
his arm in pain, loses control of the wheel.

                                            CUT TO:

                                                           98.


EXT. CAR.

--out of control (still silent).  It smashes into a tree
stump.  The picture stops, freezes for three beats.  We hold
the image of the moment of crash, with pieces of metal
crumpling and flying into the air, suspended there by the
stop-film.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. CAR.

Sound partly up again, but never at its realistic volume.
From inside the smashed car, we peer out the window across
the field and see the other car.  The thought strikes the
audience at the same time it strikes the gang--they must get
to that car.

Med. shot of the second car, sitting in the field, shining
in the sun.  The lawmen also realize what must be done--cut
off this escape.  Though BONNIE, CLYDE and the others are
heading toward it, they suddenly train all their fire on the
car rather than the gang.

The car fills the frame of the screen.  Bullets begin to hit
it.  It starts to quiver under the impact.  For the next
minute, we see the car die in front of our eyes.  We see the
beautiful machine fall to pieces--windows smash, tires torn
apart, body riddled.  The death of the car is as painful to
watch as the willful death of a human being.  The execution
is paced deliberately to show the ritualistic tempo of the
destruction.

EXT. WOODS.

The camera pulls back, way back and slightly above everything
to reveal the entire field.  On the left of the screen,
BONNIE, CLYDE and C.W. are scrambling toward the edge of the
woods.  In the center BUCK and BLANCHE have taken cover
behind a fallen log.  In the foreground, police begin to
emerge from the woods.  The camera zooms rapidly in with
them toward BUCK.  BLANCHE is screaming.

                         BLANCHE
            Don't kill him!  Don't kill him!
            He's dying!

BUCK is making a last feeble attempt.  The zoom continues
past BUCK until it comes tight on his hand, a lawman's foot
steps on his hand.  BUCK falls over.  He dies.  BLANCHE
screams.

                         BLANCHE
            Don't die, Daddy.  Don't die!

                                                           99.


She goes berserk.  Five men, one hardly a teen-ager, grab
her and hold her as she writhes and cries.  She is still
wearing the sunglasses.

                                            CUT TO:

EXT. WOODS AND STREAM.  BONNIE, CLYDE, AND C.W.  DAY.

They have reached the edge of the woods.  Camera tracks with
them as they run.  From all around come the sounds of the
posse.  The three get in through the pines and come finally
to a deep stream.  They jump in and start across, running
awkwardly in chest-deep water.  They are half way across
when the police appear on the bank behind them, shooting.

Close-up.  BONNIE.  Day--as she is struggling through the
water.  A bullet hits her in the shoulder.  We must see this
bullet clearly, we must see it go in her flesh so that we
can feel it.

Tight close-up of BONNIE's face as she screams.  It is the
first time she has been hurt, and the scream is pure animal
pain.  She cries out.

EXT. STREAM AND CORNFIELD.  DAY.

CLYDE, who has almost reached the other side, comes back and
gets her.  He drags her out of the water and into a cornfield
that starts growing on the opposite bank, C.W. helping.  He
half-carries half-runs with her into the cornfield, as the
field gets deeper and thicker.

They stop for a second.

                         CLYDE
                   (panting, to Bonnie)
            Saw...saw a farm...up ahead...gotta
            get...a car...

He starts to give over the wounded BONNIE to C.W.

                         BONNIE
            Baby, no...

But CLYDE has not heard this last.  Working on pure
adrenaline now, he struggles onward.  Camera tilts up
slightly so we can see CLYDE as he essays his way toward a
farmhouse with a car in the distance.  After a few moments
he disappears and we can hear only the cracking of the
stalks as that sound too diminishes,

Full shot.  Cornfield.  Day.  Silence.

                                                          100.


Close.  C.W. and BONNIE.  Obviously some time later.  They
both lie prostrate in the field, listening.  C.W. licks his
lips.

                         C.W.
            Maybe--

                         BONNIE
            Shhh!

They wait for another long moment, picking up only the
tiniest sounds.

                         BONNIE
                   (finally)
            Oh, no.

                         C.W.
                   (nervously)
            What?  What?

                         BONNIE
                   (as though it were
                   the most logical
                   thing in the world)
            I can't die without Clyde.  I just
            can't.

C.W. looks at her as if she's gone crazy.  After another
moment the corn begins to tremble, and we hear the o.s.
sound of an approaching car.

With C.W. Day--tentatively lifting his head up to clear the
corn stalks.  With him we see the car looming larger,
bearing down on us, splitting the corn stalks.  The car
finally comes to a stop a few feet in front of C.W.  BONNIE
is on her feet, and CLYDE tumbles out of the car, practically
before it's stopped, sweeping BONNIE into him.  For a moment
both are in their knees a few feet from the running board of
the car, simply holding onto each other and not moving.

                         C.W.
                   (tugging at both of
                   them frantically)
            C'mon!  C'mon!  C'mon!

                                            ABRUPT CUT:

INT. CAR.  ABOUT A HALF HOUR LATER.  DAY.

They have gotten away, but are still escaping.  C.W. is
driving.  He is bare-chested.  CLYDE is beside him in front,
his arm bleeding.  He falls in and out of consciousness.
BONNIE is stretched out in back.

                                                          101.


Her shoulder has been bandaged with C.W.'s shirt.  She is
unconscious.

INT. CAR.  LATE DAY.

CLYDE comes half-awake and looks over at C.W.

                         CLYDE
            Head out, C.W.

                         C.W.
                   (determinedly)
            I'm goin' home to my daddy's farm.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. ROAD WITH CAMPSITE.  THE SAME EVENING.

C.W. is driving down the road, hell for leather.  Nearing a
campsite, where there are about six Okie cars and pick-up
trucks all loaded down, with a number of poor families
seated around a campfire, cooking.  C.W. jams on the brakes.
He gets out, looking totally exhausted.

Reaction shot.  The faces of the Okies, looking at this
sudden presence in their midst.

Back to C.W.

                         C.W.
                   (about to drop)
            Can y'all spare me a little water?

EXT. CAMPSITE.  FULL SHOT.

One man, the leader of the group, dips a cup of water and
approaches C.W. suspiciously.  He comes close enough to make
C.W. reach out for the water, but withholds it from him.

                         MAN
            Who are you, boy?

                         C.W.
            Name's Moss.

This seems to be enough for the man, who gives him the water.
As C.W. gulps it down, the man begins to circle the car,
peering into it suspiciously.  Suddenly he starts and his
eyes open wide.

                         MAN
                   (in really hushed and
                   reverent tones)
            It's Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow.

                                                          102.


He stands there struck dumb, staring.  Those of the others
who have heard him begin to come over.  Without a word they
move quietly to the car and stare in.

INT. CAR.

BONNIE is out in the back seat; CLYDE is semi-conscious in
the front seat.  He looks up through half-closed eyes.

EXT. CAR.

We see a woman pour a bowl of soup at the campfire and bring
it to C.W.  He accepts it.

A man rolls a cigarette and lights it.  Then, very gingerly,
as if afraid to really touch him, he reaches through the
window and places it in CLYDE's lips.  It hangs there, CLYDE
unable to drag on it or remove it.

Children peer through the back window.

C.W. finishes his cup of soup.  He hands it and the cup of
water back to a woman in the crowd.

Quietly, moving together, the Okies step back.  C.W. walks
to the driver's seat, gets in and shuts the door.  He starts
up the car.

The people push a bit closer for a last look.  CLYDE, unable
to do more, nods his head in a barely perceptive gesture by
way of saying "thank you" t ot the people.  The cigarette is
still dangling from his lips.

The car moves off.  A YOUNG BOY pulls on his FATHER's shirt.

                         BOY
            Who was they, Pa?

                         MAN
            That was Bonnie and Clyde, the bank
            robbers.

A woman, nearby, smiles sweetly.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. MOSS FARM.  MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

The car pulls up outside the slightly ramshackle farm of
MALCOLM MOSS, C.W.'s father, in Arcadia, Louisiana.  It
sits, for a moment, in the dark.  Then C.W. honks the horn.
A few seconds pass, and the porch light comes on.  OLD MAN
MOSS comes out in his pajamas and peers into the darkness.
He is a fat man with gray hair.

                                                          103.


                         MALCOLM
            Who's there?

                         C.W.
                   (calling back)
            Daddy?

                         MALCOLM
            Who's there?  Who is it?

                         C.W.
            It's C.W.  It's Clarence.

                         MALCOLM
            Clarence!

He runs down the steps, down the path to his son.  They
greet each other, hugging for a second, looking each other
over.

                         MALCOLM
            God, it's good to see you, boy!

He holds C.W. at arm's length to study him, and suddenly he
scowls at something he sees by the light of the porch.

                         MALCOLM
            What's that on your chest?

                         C.W.
                   (puzzled)
            Huh?
                   (realizing what he means)
            It's a tattoo...I'm in trouble.
            I'll tell you about it later.  My
            friends are hurt.  Help me get 'em
            in.

MALCOLM goes to car and looks inside for a moment.  He walks
back to C.W.

                         MALCOLM
            Jesus, what happened to them?  You
            in trouble, son?

                         C.W.
            Yeah.  That's Clyde Barrow and
            Bonnie Parker.
                   (reaction from Malcolm)
            We been shot.  Help me get 'em
            inside.  We gotta help 'em.

They go to the car and drag the unconscious BONNIE out and
begin carrying her up to the house.

                                                          104.


                         MALCOLM
            Why'd you get yourself marked up?
            A tattoo!  What in hell made you do
            a damn fool thing like that?

They reach the house.

                         C.W.
            C'mon, Pa, open the door.

INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE IN DEXTER.  DAY.

Although the scene begins with a full-screen close-up of a
newspaper clipping with a photo, it is just a blurry-gray,
crowded scene of BLANCHE's capture.  Really impossible to
make anybody out in the crowd.  Camera stays on photo as we
hear voice over of two men talking: a sheriff and his deputy.

                         BILLY
            I was in the bunch that took 'er.
            See here?  Can you make me out?
            Here I am, see here, right behind
            Joe Boyd here.

                         PETE
            Sure enough, Billy, is that your
            head there?

Camera pulls away, BILLY, a young deputy--cold, intense,
humorless and square, carefully folds up the clipping and
puts it in his wallet.

                         BILLY
            Still can't figure how we let them
            other two get away.

                         PETE
                   (an older, more
                   genial type)
            Yeah, seems as how nobody can get
            'em somehow.

                         BILLY
                   (sullen)
            Yeah...well, maybe this boy'll be
            the one to do it, this Hamer guy.
            Boy if he can't do it, Sheriff,
            ain't nobody but the whole U.S.
            Army can do it.

                                                          105.


                         PETE
                   (with a new note of
                   enthusiasm, gets up
                   and walks to the
                   window--turning to Billy)
            You hear he quit the Rangers on
            account of Texas got that woman
            governor.  Said he wouldn't work
            under no woman.

                         BILLY
                   (respectfully)
            Yeah, that's somethin' all right.
            Say, how many they say he shot
            anyway in his day?

                         PETE
            Sixty-five they say.

                         BILLY
            Son of a sea-cook!

The door opens.  We see, full shot and then fast close-up
FRANK HAMER.  It should be a complete shock to the audience--
this is the man kidnapped by the gang earlier and partially
destroyed by BONNIE.

HAMER is dressed in his Ranger outfit and hat, and again he
has that quality of sinister frenzy beneath his calm manner.
His attitude toward these lawmen is sheer condescension,
friendly only out of convention, really superior and
contemptuous of lesser workers in his field.

                         HAMER
                   (with politeness
                   arising from condescension)
            Excuse me, am I in the right place?
            Is this Sheriff Smoot?

PETE and BILLY jump up from the chairs and walk over to
HAMER, hands extended.  They are quite impressed by meeting
in the flesh.

                         PETE
                   (mispronouncing his name)
            Frank Hammer.  I sure am pleased to
            meet you!
                   (shakes his hand)


                         HAMER
            Hamer.

                                                          106.


EXT. MOSS FARM.  CLOSE SHOT NEWSPAPER.  DAY.

A coil of rope snaps into and through the paper, splitting
it and revealing C.W.'s startled face.  CLYDE strides the
porch angrily, snapping the rope.

BONNIE and MALCOLM are seated along with C.W.  Through
BONNIE has her arm supported by a sling and CLYDE has his
shoulder bandagedm it is evident by CLYDE's heady indignation
and BONNIE's attentiveness that both are well on the way to
recovery.

                         CLYDE
                   (still snapping rope)
            FLED?  What do they mean, fled?
            How in the nama God could I leave
            my brother to die when he was
            already dead when I left him?
                   (livid)
            He was shot in too many pieces to
            pick off the ground!  Fled...what
            do they know, the papers or the
            police?...

Suddenly he moves upon MALCOLM with enormous intent, as if
by pounding the point home to the one relative stranger
among them, he will justify it all.  MALCOLM momentarily
flinches, then listens with intense deference.

                         CLYDE
            Why, while we were all lyin' around
            here, near dead, they had us
            holdin' up the Grand Prairie
            National Bank!  They hung that one
            on us just for luck, I guess.

CLYDE shakes his head, still thinking this over.  Abruptly,
to BONNIE, with deadly seriousness:

                         CLYDE
            Tell you what.  Soon's we get well,
            we're gonna take that bank!

He breaks into a wicked grin, but then reels, catching
himself on the porch railing.  He's obviously dizzy from
exertion and anger.  BONNIE starts--then sees CLYDE is in
control.

                         CLYDE
                   (remarking on his own dizziness)
            Whooooooo, boy...
                   (kneeling, to Bonnie)
            They don't know nothin'--do they,
            sugar?

                                                          107.


                         BONNIE
                   (assuring him)
            You did all you could, hon'.
            Nobody coulda done more.

C.W. has been studying hard on the torn paper, b.g.  Suddenly:

                         C.W.
            Hey.  How come I'm always called
            the "Un-identified sus-spect?"

Group shot.  Porch.  C.W. has trouble with this last phrase.
BONNIE laughs.  This picks up CLYDE's spirits once more.

                         CLYDE
                   (to C.W.)
            You can just thank your lucky stars
            that's all you are.  So long's they
            don't have your last name, you're
            home safe.

                         MALCOLM
                   (toadying to Clyde,
                   talking to Clarence)
            Mr. Barrow's lookin' out for your
            interests, boy.

                         C.W.
                   (impressed)
            Oh...Hey, Pa, how you like havin' a
            coupla big deals stayin' with you?

                         MALCOLM
                   (friendly as can be)
            Ain't that somethin' for me?

                         CLYDE
                   (back in good mood, expansive)
            Well now, you been real nice to us,
            and I tell you what, let us pay you
            forty dollars for your hospitality,
            what do you say?

                         MALCOLM
                   (protesting vehemently)
            No, no, no.  I don't want your
            money.  I'm just pleased to have
            your company.  Any friend of my
            boy's...

                         C.W.
                   (abruptly)
            Hey, Pa, let's have supper.  I'm
            hungry.

                                                          108.


                         MALCOLM
                   (smiling)
            Yeah...okay, Clarence...
                   (to Clyde)
            You're welcome here, now you know
            that.

INT. MOSS HOUSE.

They go into the house.  Camera goes with them.  As soon as
they are out of earshot from BONNIE and CLYDE, MALCOLM turns
on C.W. displaying an entirely different demeanor from the
one he presented outside.

                         MALCOLM
                   (indicating tatto
                   which flutters
                   through C.W.'s open shirt)
            You look like trash, boy, marked up
            like that.  Cheap trash.

                         C.W.
                   (protesting)
            Bonnie says it looks good.

                         MALCOLM
            Bonnie, what does she know.  She's
            just cheap trash herself.  Look
            what they do to you, and you don't
            even get your name in the paper--
            just pictures put on your skin, by
            "Bonnie and Clyde"--
                   (more to himself)
            --why they're a coupla kids.

                         C.W.
            But, Daddy--

                         MALCOLM
            I'm just glad your ma ain't alive
            to see that thing.

C.W. peeks at it, peering down at his chest, trying to bring
the bluebirds into focus, puzzled.

                         C.W.
            I don't see what's so bad about it...

INT. HOSPITAL.  MED. SHOT OF THE ROOM.

Seated in a soft chair, looking directly at us, is BLANCHE
BARROW.  Her eyes are completely covered with a white
bandage.  She wears a hospital gown.  The room is white and
bright.

                                                          109.


Med. shot.  HAMER in the doorway.  The nurse leaves.  He
reaches in his pocket and pulls out a white handkerchief.
He puts it over his mouth to disguise his voice, afraid she
will remember it from the kidnap.  Quietly, almost on
tiptoes, HAMER walks over to BLANCHE.  He gets inches away
from her face.  She still doesn't know he is there.

                         HAMER
                   (quietly, but
                   suddenly, his voice
                   muffled by the handkerchief)
            Blanche Barrow.

She starts to her feet, then adjusts to his presence.  She
is a bit panicked.  BLANCHE is now a defeated human being.
Her voice and manner bespeak great weariness, sorrow and
still a touch of her old high-strung hysteria.  But most of
that is gone now, like everything else that was really vital
in her life.

                         BLANCHE
            What?  What?  Who is it?

                         HAMER
                   (in a monotone, a
                   relentless questioner)
            You know your husband's dead.

                         BLANCHE
                   (her voice flat and expressionless)
            I know.

                         HAMER
            You're going to prison.

                         BLANCHE
            I know it.

                         HAMER
            Where's the rest of 'em?

                         BLANCHE
            I don't know.

                         HAMER
            Where's the rest of 'em?

                         BLANCHE
            I just don't know.  I don't know.

                         HAMER
            How'd you get in with them?

                                                          110.


                         BLANCHE
                   (starting slow, but
                   warming up to the
                   subject, she begins
                   to talk and talk for
                   the sake of airing
                   her troubles)
            I didn't mean to.  I didn't.  Buck
            said we was just goin' to visit, we
            wouldn't be doin' no robbin' and
            stealin', and then we went to
            Joplin and all of a sudden they
            started shootin'.
                   (hysteria begins to
                   creep into her voice
                   as she relives it all)
            And we run off, God, I was scared.
            And then it was run all the time,
            and I wanted to go, I begged to go,
            but Clyde and Bonnie and C.W.--

                         HAMER
                   (seizing on it)
            C.W.  C.W. who?

                         BLANCHE
            C.W. Moss.

                                            FADE OUT:

FADE IN:

EXT. CAR ON THE MOSS FARM.  A DIRT PATH NEAR THE BARN.  DAY.

It is pouring rain, middle of the afternoon, BONNIE and
CLYDE are inside the car, sitting.  They have lived so much
in cars that they tend to still spend much of their time in
it rather than in a room.  There they are themselves.

INT. CAR.

BONNIE is in the back seat, her legs wrapped in a plaid
blanket, writing poetry.  She looks like Elizabeth Barrett
Browning.  With one essential difference--her arm is in a
sling and she is wearing bandages on the shoulder.  CLYDE is
in the front seat, reading a newspaper.  He is also partially
bandaged.  On the dashboard is a box of ginger-snaps which
he eats while he reads.  They look domestic.

                         CLYDE
            Want a ginger-snap, Bonnie?

                                                          111.


                         BONNIE
                   (busy, absorbed)
            No, hum-umm.
                   (then she realizes
                   his nice gesture and
                   smiles warmly at him)
            But thanks anyway, Clyde.
                   (she takes it all in,
                   her situation, and
                   looks content and cozy)
            It's real nice here, just the two
            of us like this.

                         CLYDE
                   (more interested in
                   his paper)
            Uh-huh.
                   (something in the
                   paper catches his interest)
            Look here, honey, remember this?

He holds up the paper; there is one of the photos from the
motel, the one showing BONNIE smoking.  She looks up at it
with mild interest.

                         BONNIE
            Yeah, at the motel.

                         CLYDE
                   (studying the picture)
            You sure don't resemble that no more.

Close-up BONNIE.  She doesn't.  She has become totally
fragile, the essence of herself.  She is writing on a pad.

CLYDE and BONNIE.

                         CLYDE
            What you writin' this time?

                         BONNIE
                   (intensely)
            I'm writing a poem about us.  I'm
            writing our story.

                         CLYDE
                   (this appeals to his ego)
            Oh, are you?  Let's hear it.  If
            it's good, I'll mail it in to the
            Law and it'll be printed in all the
            papers again.

                         BONNIE
            Just let me finish this line.

                                                          112.


She does so.  CLYDE munches a cookie.

                         BONNIE
                   (continuing)
            Okay, here it is.

Close-up.  BONNIE--as she reads intensely.  At the beginning
of this montage, the camera remains on her face.  Behind her
we see the rain on the window.

                         BONNIE
                   (reading)
            "The Story of Bonnie and Clyde"

            You've heard the story of Jesse
            James--
            Of how he lived and died:
            If you're still in need
            Of something to read
            Here's the story of Bonnie and
            Clyde.

            Now Bonnie and Clyde are the Barrow
            Gang
            I'm sure you all have read
            How they rob and steal
            And those who squeal
            Are usually found dying or dead.

            They call them cold-hearted killers;
            They say they are heartless and
            mean;
            But I say this with pride,
            That I once knew Clyde
            When he was honest and upright and
            clean.

            But the laws fooled around,
            Kept taking him down
            And locking him in a cell,
            Till he said to me,
            "I'll never be free
            So I'll meet a few of them in
            hell."

            The road was so dimly lighted;
            There were no highway signs to
            guide;
            But they made up their minds
            If all roads were blind,
            They wouldn't give up till they died.

                                            CUT TO:

                                                          113.


INT. POLICE STATION.  DAY.

The manuscript is lying on the police blotter.  HAMER picks
it up and continues reading it.  He reads it in a halting
way:

                         HAMER
            The road gets dimmer and dimmer;
            Sometimes you can hardly see;
            But it's fight man to man,
            And do all you can,
            For they know they can never be
            free.

            From heartbreak some people have
            suffered;
            From weariness some people have
            died;
            But take it all in all,
            Our troubles are small,
            Till we get like Bonnie and Clyde.

Close-up of a newspaper page.  The poem is printed all the
way down the length of one column.  On the sound track,
BONNIE's voice picks up the recitation:

                         BONNIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
            If a policeman is killed in Dallas,
            And they have no clue or guide;
            If they can't find a fiend,
            They just wipe their slate clean
            And hang it on Bonnie and Clyde.

INT. CAR.  CLOSE-UP OF BONNIE.  DAY.

The day is sunny and we see it through the car window.  She
continues reading, but now she reads it directly from the
newspaper:

                         BONNIE
            If they try to act like citizens
            And rent them a nice little flat
            About the third night
            They're invited to fight
            By a sub-gun's rat-tat-tat.

            Some day they'll go down together;
            They'll bury them side by side;
            To few it'll be grief--
            To the law a relief--
            But it's death for Bonnie and Clyde.

                                                          114.


BONNIE finishes the poem, as camera pulls back slightly to
show that it is a different day, different clothes and the
bandages are gone.  As she stops, she has an expectant and
somewhat self-satisfied look.

Close-up of CLYDE.  His eyes are wide, his mouth open, his
face shows surprise and delight and he is on the verge of a
giant laugh.

                         CLYDE
                   (in gleeful wonder)
            Damn!  That's me!

A great laugh comes bursting from him.  Camera widens to
take in BONNIE.  She is both startled and delighted by his
response.

                         CLYDE
                   (continuing)
            In that poem!

BONNIE giggles.

                         CLYDE
                   (continuing; it is
                   all starting to come
                   out now--his
                   realization that he
                   has made it, that he
                   is the stuff of
                   legend, that he is an
                   important figure)
            A sub-gun's rat-tat-tat!
                   (he begins to laugh loudly)
            Right in the paper!

Close-up BONNIE.  Now laughing too, with a great feeling of
joy.

Two shot.  BONNIE and CLYDE.

                         CLYDE
            Jesse James!  You hear 'bout old
            Jesse, now you goin' to hear 'bout
            Clyde!

He puffs up with air and explodes like a steam valve.

                         CLYDE
                   (continuing)
            Pshhhhhh!

He grabs BONNIE and chuckles delightedly.

                                                          115.


                         CLYDE
                   (continuing)
            Damn, Bonnie!  You musta been one
            hell of a waitress!

Close-up.  BONNIE--laughing, her eyes filled with tears.
CLYDE's hand wipes them away.

Two shot.

                         CLYDE
                   (shaking his head
                   back and forth like a
                   puppy, just so much
                   glee in him that he
                   can't hold it)
            Oooooh, that Clyde!  That's my boy,
            that Clyde!

He looks at her with love and delight, hugs her tightly.

                         CLYDE
            Bonnie...
                   (she hugs him back)
            The Poem of Bonnie and Clyde!

                         BONNIE
                   (laughing at the
                   mistake, happy)
            The Story.

                         CLYDE
            The Story of Bonnie and Clyde!  Oh,
            child, you really did tell that
            story!

He pulls her to him, his face inches away from hers, about
to kiss her.  She is waiting, expecting... Suddenly, he lets
out one wild laugh almost into her mouth.

He kisses her.  She kisses back.  They are chuckling,
giggling.  They grow more ardent; they pull back and laugh
again.  They begin to make love.

EXT. ARCADIA STREET.  ICE CREAM PARLOR.  DAY.

Bright afternoon.  Camera across the street from an ice
cream parlor.  Sign about it: "EVA'S HAND-PACKED ICE CREAM."
A large plate glass window fronts the store, and through it
we can see the people inside seated at tables and booths.
Prominent in our vision is MALCOLM MOSS, seated, facing
camera.  He is seated across from another man, but we see
him from the back.

                                                          116.


MALCOLM is obviously doing a lot of talking and then some
hard listening; gesticulating and looking disturbed.  After
a bit of this, he rises from the table and begins walking
toward the door.  The other man rises and turns.  We now see
that it is FRANK HAMER.

MALCOLM and HAMER come out onto the sidewalk, squinting in
the sunlight.  MALCOLM mimes some social pleasantries by way
of saying "goodbye," but HAMER's face shows no emotion of
recognition of the gesture.  He turns and walks away,
walking out of the frame.

MALCOLM stands where he is, in front of the ice cream parlor.
By the expression on his face, we can see that he is rather
disturbed by what he has heard and that he is still grappling
with the problem.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

BONNIE and CLYDE.  They lie where they were with one
difference--they are now wrapped in the blanket.  CLYDE's
pants are wadded up and tangled with his shoes at the base
of the blanket.

                         CLYDE
                   (chuckling, apparently
                   quite pleased)
            Damn!...damn...damn!

He casts a sidelong glance to BONNIE, wanting some sort of
overt reaction from her.  She's just smiling slightly.
CLYDE's underlying anxiety begins to surface.

                         CLYDE
                   (not looking at her)
            Hey, listen, Bonnie, how do you feel?

                         BONNIE
                   (watching him
                   steadily, her slight
                   smile growing)
            Fine.

                         CLYDE
            I mean you feel like you're s'posed
            to feel after you've uh...

                         BONNIE
            Just.

                                                          117.


                         CLYDE
                   (doesn't know what
                   the fuck to say,
                   desperately wants her approval)
            Well, that's good, ain't it.
            Reason I ask is, I uh... Well, I
            figger it's a good idea to ask.  I
            mean how else do I tell if I did it
            the way...

                         BONNIE
                   (stopping him, with
                   great warmth)
            Hey.  You done just perfect.

CLYDE looks at her for the first time, tremendously relieved.
He can see she means it.  Now his buoyancy, utterly,
unchained breaks through:

                         CLYDE
            I did, didn't I?  I mean I did, I
            really did.  I did it, I did, I
            mean this was my first time and it
            was just like rollin' off a log
            when it comes right down to it, it
            was easy, I mean I didn't even have
            to try...

Lovingly, laughing, altogether overwhelmed with himself,
CLYDE pulls BONNIE into him.  He kisses her, wants to make
love again, but then pulls back and keeps chattering at
sixty miles a minute.  He's waited twenty-three years to
talk about this, and he's got the perfect audience.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

INT. KITCHEN.  MOSS FARM.  TWILIGHT.

After dinner.  There are four empty plates, but only C.W.
and MALCOLM in the kitchen.  C.W. is scraping the bottom of
a wilted "EVA'S HAND-PACKED ICE CREAM" carton.  MALCOLM
studies his son's quiet intensity in this direction for a
moment, then moves very close, whispers when he speaks.

                         MALCOLM
                   (whispering)
            Boy, they expect you to go downtown
            with 'em tomorrow?

                         C.W.
                   (out loud, licking
                   his ice cream)
            Who?

                                                          118.


                         MALCOLM
                   (raising his own
                   voice, infuriated by
                   his son's obtuseness)
            Bonnie and Clyde!...
                   (he slaps the carton
                   out of C.W.'s hands;
                   whispering again)
            Bonnie and Clyde.

                         C.W.
            Sure, I always go with them.

MALCOLM thinks hard about this.

                         MALCOLM
            ...better go then, you better go,
            better go...
                   (forcing C.W. to sit
                   at table)
            --but when they get back in the car
            to come on home, don't get in with
            them.

                         C.W.
                   (genuinely puzzled)
            Why, Daddy?

                         MALCOLM
            You just listen to your Pa fer once!
            Cain't you do that?  I'm yore
            Daddy, I'm your kin, not Clyde.

                         C.W.
                   (still confused)
            Well, what should I tell 'em? "I
            can't get back in the car with you?"

MALCOLM is ready to kill--his son's obtuseness and his fear
of CLYDE is whipping him into a quiet frenzy.

                         MALCOLM
                   (squeezing C.W.'s arm)
            No, you tell them nothin', hear?
                   (hesitates, then)
            I made a deal and got you off with
            a coupla years!

                         C.W.
                   (a piercing treble)
            Made a deal with who, Daddy?

                                                          119.


MALCOLM hauls off and whacks C.W. across the top of his head
with the flat of his hand, then momentarily holds his hand
over C.W's mouth.

                         MALCOLM
                   (we can see his own fear)
            ...the law.  Just don't get back in
            that car.
                   (eyeball to eyeball)
            And whatever you do, don't let onto
            them, hear?

C.W. suddenly smiles, as if he knew something.

                         C.W.
                   (expletive)
            Whew!... You think them laws are
            gonna catch Bonnie and Clyde in town?

C.W. returns to the ice cream carton--MALCOLM lets him,
figuring he better find out what he can.

                         MALCOLM
            What do you think, Clarence?

                         C.W.
                   (matter of fact)
            They ain't gonna catch 'em.  Don't
            matter whether I let on or not.

                         MALCOLM
                   (playing along)
            Mebbe.  Just you be off'n the
            streets of that town when they go
            to get in their car.

                         C.W.
                   (looking directly at Malcolm)
            Nobody catches Clyde.  Clyde's got
            a sense, don't you know that, Daddy?
            Nobody catches Clyde.

MALCOLM knows better, but for just a moment he stares at his
son, fearing that maybe C.W., for all his limitations, has a
sense about CLYDE's sense.  C.W. has finished with the
carton and crumples it, licking the last remnants of cream
off his fingers.

INT. BEDROOM.  MOSS FARM.  NIGHT.

BONNIE and CLYDE's bedroom, the middle of that night.  Both
are wide awake, lying on opposite sides of the double bed.
Both are staring into the night, disquiet.

                                                          120.


                         CLYDE
                   (suddenly)
            Bonnie?  Bonnie, will you marry me?

There is a silent gasp from BONNIE, a barely perceptible
stiffening.  Then she talks in a voice falsely formal, still
staring up at the ceiling.

                         BONNIE
            How could I do that, Clyde?  You
            know it's impossible.  We'd have to
            go to a Justice of the Peace and
            the Justice of the Peace is a
            lawman.  We couldn't even take out
            a license.

                         CLYDE
                   (with a chuckle)
            Hey now, you sound like you been
            givin' it some thought on your own.

                         BONNIE
                   (with a grim irony,
                   her voice getting
                   more and more emotional)
            Oh no, I never gave it thought.  I
            haven't thought about it at least
            ten times a day, I haven't thought
            about it every minute of my life
            since I met you.
                   (suddenly her voice
                   cracks into tears)


She flings herself violently across the bed and buries
herself into CLYDE's chest, her knees drawn up, her head
tucked down into him, her body shaking with sobs.

                         CLYDE
                   (a bit startled by
                   this, attempting to
                   hold her, awkwardly,
                   and placate her.  He
                   puts his arm around her)
            Bonnie...are you crying, honey?

BONNIE nods yes and slowly gets control over her tears.

                         BONNIE
                   (her face still
                   buried in CLYDE's
                   chest, she whispers)
            Clyde, why do you want to marry me?

                                                          121.


CLYDE thinks a minute and then grins.

                         CLYDE
                   (in an attempt to be humorous)
            To make an honest woman out of you.

BONNIE is silent.

                         BONNIE
                   (finally, in a voice
                   charged with
                   anticipation and dream)
            Clyde...what would you do, what
            would you do it some miracle
            happened and we could walk out
            tomorrow morning and start all over
            again, clean, with no record, with
            nobody after us?

CLYDE thinks about it a minute.

                         CLYDE
            Well...I guess I'd do it all
            different.  First off, I wouldn't
            live in the same state where we
            pull our jobs.  We'd live in one
            state and stay clean there, and
            when we wanted to take a bank, we'd
            go to another state...and...

Suddenly he realizes that he has said the worst thing he
could have, that it was not the answer BONNIE wanted to hear.
He looks down at her, his voice anxious.

                         CLYDE
                   (continuing)
            Bonnie?

She is silent.

                         CLYDE
            Hey, Bonnie?

But she does not answer.

EXT. ROADSIDE.  EARLY MORNING.

We see MALCOLM jacking up the back wheel of his pickup truck
which is parked on the side of the road in a wooded area.

                                            CUT TO:

                                                          122.


EXT. ARCADIA STREET.  MID-MORNING.

A street in Arcadia.  The car is parked.  BONNIE and CLYDE
walks toward the car carrying big bags of groceries and
supplies and put them inside.

                         CLYDE
                   (looking around)
            What happened to C.W.?

                         BONNIE
            He stopped off in that hardware
            store to get light bulbs for his
            daddy.

CLYDE opens the door of the driver's seat and sits down.

INT. CAR.  ARCADIA STREET.  DAY.

                         CLYDE
            Boy, my feet are sweatin'.

He takes off his shoes.

                         BONNIE
                   (kidding around)
            You plannin' to drive with your
            shoes off?

                         CLYDE
            Sure, why not?

He reaches in his shirt pocket and takes out his sunglasses.
As he goes to put them on, one of the lenses falls out.

                         CLYDE
            Damn!

He puts them on.

                         BONNIE
                   (laughing)
            You gonna wear 'em?

                         CLYDE
            Sure, drive with one eye shut.

BONNIE gets in the car, rummages around in one of the bags
and pulls out something wrapped in tissue paper.  She
unwraps it and puts it up on the dashboard, displaying it.
It is a little porcelain shepherdess holding a crook in her
hand, worth about thirty cents.

                                                          123.


                         BONNIE
                   (admiring it)
            Isn't that the prettiest thing, hon?
            Just look here, you can see every
            little fingernail on her hands.

She shows him.

                         CLYDE
            It is a pretty thing, honey.

CLYDE turns on the radio and gets some hillbilly music.
They are singing "Little Church in the Valley."  He beats
time on the steering wheel, getting a little impatient.
BONNIE puts her shepherdess away and begins looking in the
grocery sack.

                         BONNIE
            We got any peaches?  I sure could
            go for a peach right now.

She burrows in the bag and comes out with a peach.  She
takes a big bite.  The juice drips down the side of her
mouth.  She looks beautiful.

                         CLYDE
                   (he stops drumming
                   his fingers, suddenly
                   has an idea)
            Whyn't we do it tomorrow?

                         BONNIE
            Do what?

                         CLYDE
            Tomorrow's Sunday, ain't it?  We
            could drive all night and be on
            that golf course tomorrow morning!

                         BONNIE
            You sure you feel up to it?

                         CLYDE
                   (enthused)
            Yeah, why not?
                   (now feeling anxious
                   and excited, he is
                   impatient to move)
            Where is that boy?  He's gone too
            long.

                                                          124.


                         BONNIE
                   (humming to the radio)
            He'll be here.
                   (holding the peach to him)
            You take a bite, hon.

                         CLYDE
                   (getting worried)
            No, it's takin' too long.  What if
            something happened?

                         BONNIE
            Nothin' happened.

                         CLYDE
                   (more urgently)
            Go take a look, see what's keepin'
            him.

Not too delighted with the chore, BONNIE goes off.  We
remain with CLYDE, getting anxious.  The music plays on.
BONNIE comes back, hurriedly, now anxious herself.

                         BONNIE
            He ain't there.

CLYDE jumps into action, slams his door.

                         CLYDE
            C'mon, let's go.

BONNIE gets in.  They drive off.

INT. STORE.  CLOSE-UP C.W.  DAY.

--hiding inside a store, peering out through a curtained
window at them driving away.  His expression is disturbed;
his face half in shadow.

EXT. ROAD.  DAY.

BONNIE and CLYDE's car coming down the road.  Camera sees
from CLYDE's P.O.V.  MALCOLM standing in the road, waving
him down.  The pickup truck, its back jacked up, is parked
beside him on a shoulder of the road.

INT. CAR.  DAY.

                         BONNIE
            What's wrong?

                         CLYDE
            I don't know.

                                                          125.


EXT. ROAD.

CLYDE reaches the spot, pulls off the road and stops the car.
He gets out.  Camera pulls back.  CLYDE talks to the old
man, BONNIE stays in the car.  Cut to a shut down the trench
of the law, tense.

Suddenly, a truck loaded with chickens comes riding down the
road from the opposite direction.  HAMER sees it from a long
way away and realizes that he cannot afford to let anything
pass between him and his quarry.  He decides the time is now.
He leaps up from the trench and yells at CLYDE.

                         HAMER
            Barrow!

The OLD MAN dives under his truck to hide.  The shooting
starts.

We see the chicken truck.  Two men in the front seat.  They
see ahead of them an incredible shooting match and, in
terror, they jam on the brakes and leap out of the truck.
They run as fast as they can into the meadow, away from the
trouble.

The gun fight takes just seconds during which law fires
eight-seven shots at BONNIE and CLYDE, giving them absolutely
no chance.  The sound is rapid, deafening.

At no point in the gun fight do we see BONNIE and CLYDE in
motion.  We see, instead, two still photographs cut into the
sequence: one of Clyde, half out of the car, taking careful
dead aim with his gun, just as he did in the teaching scene:
one of BONNIE, in terror, a pack of cigarettes in her hand
clutched tight, looking as fragile and beautiful as she can
be.

The noise stops at once.  Utter silence.  It has been a
massacre.  BONNIE and CLYDE never had a chance to return the
gunfire.  We see the car, a complete shambles.  We never see
BONNIE and CLYDE dead, though for a moment we discern their
bodies slumped in the car.

The camera pulls above the car until it is on a level with
the opposite side of the road.  Then, slowly, the six lawmen
stand up in the trench.  On the faces of the five deputies,
horror and shock at what they have just done.  HAMER,
however, registers no emotion.  His face is a blank.  He
lights a cigarette.  Slowly, slowly, the five men begin to
edge closer to the car to see the result.  Music, the wild
country breakdown music, begins on the sound track.

                                                          126.


Before they reach the car, the camera swings away from them,
past them, and zooms out and above into the meadow where the
two truck drivers are standing--tiny, distant figures.

The truck drivers begin to walk toward the camera, coming
back to the road to see what happened.  They get closer and
closer to the camera until they have reached a middle
distance and, as they continue to walk at us, it is--

                           THE END

                                            CUT TO BLACK.

          EXT. BOYLESTON STREET, BOSTON -- MORNING


          
          The boulevard is empty, eerie silence. No cars, no people. A man
          walks down the middle of the street, long trench, dark shades.
          Though he does not speak, we hear...

          

                                 MAN V.O.
                     There's two kinds of people in this
                     world when you boil it all down. You
                     got your talkers and you got your
                     doers.

          
          We recognize this man as ROCCO. He crosses Copley Square toward the
          looming dome of the Trinity Church.

          

                                 ROCCO V.O.
                     Most people are just talkers. All they
                     got is talk. But when all's said and
                     done, it is the doers who change the
                     world. And when they do that, they
                     change us. That's why we never forget
                     them...So, which one are you? Do you
                     just talk about it? Or do you stand up
                     and do something about it? Because
                     believe you me all the rest of it is
                     just coffee house bullshit.

          

          FADE TO BLACK...

          

          EXT. DEEP COUNTRYSIDE -- DAY


          
          SUBTEXT:   "Ireland"

          
          From behind we see two men perched atop a boulder. A flock of sheep
          encircles them. Their army sacks and shotguns are nearby. They roll
          their own cigarettes with effortless synchronicity and light up.
          CONNOR and MURPHY MacMANUS (30's) now have long hair with heavy
          facial growth. Rugged. Piercing eyes. Looking to the horizon...

          

                                 MURPHY
                     Looks like a storm's comin'.

          

                                 CONNOR
                     Aye.

          Murphy cuts a sheep from a thicket and sets it off.

                     Peace, they say, is the enemy of
                     memory. So it had been for my boys.

          

                                                                           2.

          

          
          Connor shares some jerky with a sheep dog as the flock surges.

          

                                POPPA M V.O. (CONT'D)
                    For some time now, their past had felt
                    like a dream to them...faded and worn.

          
          Murphy touches the faded Celtic Cross tattoo on his forearm. Connor
          sees. The music takes us to a secluded, pioneer-esque ranch.

          
          CLOSE ON: POPPA M's (58yrs) face as he coughs and watches his sons
          approach from his rocking chair on the porch.

          

                                POPPA M V.O. (CONT'D)
                    And then suddenly, as if not a day had
                    passed...it was back. I could see it
                    in their eyes.

          

          INT. FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT


          
          Poppa M and his sons eat a rustic dinner.   It storms outside.

          

                                POPPA M V.O.
                    I could feel it, heavy in their
                    presence. Something calling them back.

          
          Poppa M looks to his boys who just keep eating. DIP TO BLACK...

          

          INT. FARMHOUSE, FRONT PORCH -- NEXT MORNING


          
          Very early dawn, shadowy morning light. Connor and Murphy sip
          coffees and look out into the rain. Lightening lights up the flock.

          
          Through the open door behind them, Poppa M stokes a warm fire.

          
          Connor touch the Celtic Cross tattoo on his forearm. The boys look
          at each other as the rain suddenly stops and all the "little sounds"
          of morning cease. Something's amiss. Thunder. Ominous music as...

          

          EXT. BOSTON, TRINITY CHURCH -- NIGHT


          
          From behind, we see a man with a CREW CUT, staring at the dome of
          the Trinity.

          
          SLO-MO, CLOSE ON: Crew Cut's boots as he paces toward.    The
          threatening music bleeds over to...

          

          EXT. FARM -- MOMENTS LATER


          
          Just inside the trees, a pack of wolves stalk the sheep flock...

          
          SLO-MO, CLOSE ON:   A wolf's paws as it paces toward...

          
          We intercut between BOSTON and IRELAND as chaos erupts...

          

                                                                           3.

          

          
          BOSTON:    Crew Cut quickly enters the church.

          
          IRELAND:    The wolves burst from the tree line.

          
          BOSTON: A frantic priest in his 50's weeps and begs as Crew Cut
          slams him to his knees with a .9 mm to his head.

          
          IRELAND:   The wolves savagely attack the screaming sheep.

          
          BOSTON:    Muzzle flash, blood splatters on the altar.

          
          IRELAND: BOOM! BOOM! Connor and Murphy blast shotguns at the
          wolves. One is hit, the rest retreat. The boys perform mercy
          killings on the wolf and one sheep.

          
          Everything calms as Poppa M rushes up with a mag light and stops.
          He coughs roughly. Moody choral music begins...

          

                                  POPPA M V.O.
                      "And they cried out, How long O'Lord
                      dost thou not judge and revenge our
                      blood upon them that dwell on the
                      earth?"

          

          EXT. FIELD -- LATER


          
          The boys toss the wolf carcass onto a bonfire.     It rains again.

          

                                  POPPA M V.O.
                      And God said, "All will fear the wrath
                      of the lamb. For the great day of
                      their reckoning hath come."

          
          Poppa M looks across the blaze to his sons. Connor and Murphy stare
          into the fire, bathed in the light of angry flames.

                                  POPPA M
                      "And they that holdest my name shall
                      come with the shaking of the earth and
                      the roiling of the oceans."

          

          EXT. FARM -- NIGHT


          
          Downpour. A rugged old jeep tears through the mud. It stops at the
          farmhouse. Poppa M and the boys come out onto the porch. A dark
          figure with a fedora and rain slicker exits the jeep and hurries to
          the porch. Meet Uncle SIBEAL (62yrs). He wears a priest's collar.

          

                                  SIBEAL
                      Something's happened.

          

                                                                           4.

          

          

          EXT. CHURCH -- MORNING


          
          Breaking news. REPORTER #1 is live from outside a church.   Squads,
          coroner's vans, CSI etc. Police hold back crowds.

          

                                REPORTER #1
                    There is no new information on the
                    victim found slain this morning inside
                    Trinity Church. As you can see the
                    size of the crowd here has increased
                    substantially over the last couple of
                    hours. People are demanding answers as
                    to how a priest could be murdered in a
                    church. But perhaps more shocking, we
                    have confirmed that the body was
                    ritualized with pennies in the eyes.
                    Many remember this as the grisly
                    calling card of the prolific vigilante
                    killers known as the Saints, who went
                    on a murder spree here in Boston.

                    A rampage that ended six years ago,

                    footage from that harrowing day, our
                    singular tiny glimpse of these infamous
                    and controversial killers.

          
          We are back with Reporter #1 at the church.

          

                                REPORTER #1
                    As police have yet to confirm the
                    Saints' possible involvement, the
                    ominous question hangs heavy in the
                    air. "Are they back?"

          

                                                                         5.

          

          

          INT. FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT


          
          Sibeal, Poppa M, Connor and Murphy sit around the table.   The boys
          have a look of controlled anger. Presently...

          

                                  MURPHY
                    The priest.    Did they release his name?

          

                                SIBEAL
                    No. But I made a few calls, still got
                    some friends in the diocese there.
                    McKinney. Father Douglas McKinney.

          
          The boys flash with recognition.

          

                                SIBEAL (CONT'D)
                    You knew him?

          

                                CONNOR
                    Knew of him. Everybody did. A regular
                    Mother Theresa. Youth hostels, soup
                    kitchens. Even made it into the
                    newspapers sometimes.

          
          Sibeal considers this.    He genuflects and turns.

          

                                SIBEAL
                    Listen boys. I think it's best that ya
                    just stay put and we'll try ta figure
                    out what...

          
          Connor and Murphy are out the door and headed for the barn.
          Confused, Sibeal looks to Poppa M, who just sips his coffee.

          

          INT. BARN -- MOMENTS LATER

          MOODY MUSIC: The boys begin to look more like "themselves" as the
          they cut their hair and beards with sheep sheers.

          
          The brothers lift a chest from a hole in the barn floor. They load
          guns and money into black duffel bags and place their signature
          rosaries around their necks, clasping their hands in prayer...

          

          INT. TRINITY CHURCH, ALTER -- MOMENTS LATER


          
          Detective GREENLY (38yrs) is alone on the alter. Police line all
          around as Greenly stares at the body like the detective has seen a
          ghost. He turns and nervously staggers toward the front vestibule.

          

          INT. VESTIBULE -- SAME TIME


          
          Detectives DOLLY and DUFFY are scared.   In hushed tones...

          

                                                                           6.

          

          

                                DUFFY
                    We need to keep our heads, here.   It's
                    probably not even them.

          

                                DOLLY
                    Of course it ain't them but that
                    doesn't really matter, does it. Our
                    skeletons just came screaming out of
                    the closet. We're fucked.

          

                                DUFFY
                    We're not fucked.

          
          Greenly enters from the church proper.   Dolly and Duffy turn.

          

                                GREENLY
                    We are totally fucked!

          Greenly, disguised as a correctional officer, lets Connor, Murphy
          and Poppa M out of a paddywagon. FLASH!

          
          The Saints enter the Suffolk Courthouse, undetected.   FLASH!

          
          Dolly, dressed as a civilian, pulls the fire alarm.    FLASH!

          
          The Saints execute Poppa Joe Yakavetta before many terrified
          witnesses, the alarm blaring in the b.g. FLASH!

          

          INT. BACK TO PRESENT, VESTIBULE -- MOMENTS LATER


          

                                GREENLY
                    ...and not just fucked, like elephant
                    dick, pounded in the ass, no reach
                    around, jungle fucked!

                                DUFFY
                    Now's not the time to panic, Green
                    beans!

          

                                GREENLY
                    Oh, I disagree. Now's the perfect time
                    to panic. We're all Accessories to...

          

                                DOLLY
                    Don't you fucking say it!

          
          They all argue over one another. OFFICER #1 peaks his head in the
          front door. The detectives grind to a halt.

          

                                OFFICER #1
                    Her E.T.A. is ten minutes.

          CLOSE ON:   a gravestone.   "Paul M. Smecker,    1956 - 2003"

          
          We reveal a pair of sexy female legs, expensive "Jimmy Choo" heels.
          From behind we see the woman rest a rose at Smecker's Grave. "Legs"
          turns and walks toward a waiting squad car in b.g.

          

          EXT. CHURCH -- MOMENTS LATER


          
          Dolly, Duffy and Greenly stand outside in the entry way of the
          church. Though still on edge, they have calmed.

          

                                  DOLLY
                      I didn't even know he had a protege.
                      What is this bullshit?

          
          Duffy whips out his trusty note pad.

          

                                  DUFFY
                      Special Agent Eunice Bloom, 32 years
                      old. Smecker plucked her right out of
                      class at Quantico.

          

                                  GREENLY
                      Smecker hand picked her? Aw, man.
                      This brawd's gonna be a nightmare.

          

                                  DUFFY
                      She was assigned to OCD two years back.
                      She can shoot a gun, set three course
                      records during her training.

          

                                 GREENLY
                      Great. A bull dike, Annie Oakley wanna-
                      be. We gotta get rid of her.

                                  DUFFY
                      She is also an authority on the Saints
                      case. Which means Smecker must have
                      walked her through it.

          
          The cops suddenly flush with fear.

          

                                  DOLLY
                      And the hits just keep on comin'.

          

          INT. FARMHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER


          
          Sibeal waits as Poppa M thinks, then shakes his head.

                                POPPA M
                    Naw...I'm in no condition.   I'd just
                    slow 'em down.

          

                                SIBEAL
                    Well, are ya at least gonna try ta talk
                    them out of this?

          
          Poppa M shakes his head.

          

                                SIBEAL (CONT'D)
                    We don't even know what this is yet!
                    Somebody could just be tryin' ta get
                    away with murder here!

          

                                POPPA M
                    Aye. Only there's about a thousand
                    easier ways ta do that. Trust me.
                    Someone's callin' them out, Sibeal. Ya
                    kill a priest in a church and make it
                    look like they did it. Bring 'em back
                    with a vengeance. Don't know who.
                    Don't know why. But someone thinks
                    he's real fuckin' clever. Only one
                    problem with his little plan.

          

                                  SIBEAL
                    What's dat?

          

                                  POPPA M
                    It worked.

          
          Fear and frustration burst from Sibeal.

          

                                SIBEAL
                    Jesus Christ! D'er's too much we don't
                    know and if you're won't at least try
                    ta talk some sense into them, I will!

          
          The door opens and in comes Connor and Murphy. Sibeal notes the
          change in appearance. The boys stand at the kitchen table's
          opposing end, hands in their pockets. Their resolve fills the room.

          
          The brothers face off with Poppa M and Sibeal: a bizarre board
          meeting. Poppa M cocks a brow at Sibeal who clears his throat.

          

                                SIBEAL (CONT'D)
                    Exactly what do you intend to do?

          
          Silence. Nobody moves. Connor withdraws a hand from his pocket and
          looks down. He flips a penny on the table. It clatters to a stop.

          

                                                                          9.

          

          

                                 MURPHY
                     Every last motherfucker that had
                     anything to do with it.

          

          EXT. CHURCH -- LATER


          
          A squad pulls up.    Dolly, Duffy and Greenly turn.

          

                                  DOLLY
                     Game time.   How are we playing this?

          

                                 DUFFY
                     Feds love to pull the divide and
                     conquer routine. We hard line her.
                     Stick together on this. Agreed?

          

                                  DOLLY
                     Agreed.   We're a brick wall.

          
          They all nod and stiffen their resolve.

          

                                 GREENLY
                     Let's rock this bitch.

          
          Rockin' music fades in as a uniform opens the squad door.

          
          SLO-MO:   EUNICE BLOOM (32yrs) exits the squad and moves toward.

          
          She is simply delicious: sexy, blonde hair, a woman's business
          suit, short skirt, brass rimmed specs. Each detective's face drops.
          Soon she is before them. Music cuts. She smiles and speaks with a
          southern drawl a la Doc Holiday.

          

                                 EUNICE

                     Eunice Bloom. A pleasure.

          
          Dolly and Duffy shake and manage a nod.    Greenly is still enamored.

          

                                 EUNICE (CONT'D)
                     And you must be Greenly. Smecker
                     always said you were the funny one.

          

                                 GREENLY

                     high school football.

          
          She chuckles.   Dolly and Duffy fume.

          

                                                                            10.

                                 DOLLY
                    Excuse me?

          

                                EUNICE
                    You see there's a "special" before my
                    "agent." If we are going to address
                    each other formally, I'd prefer if you
                    popped it in there. Makes me feel, I
                    don't know...special. Of course, I'd
                    hoped we could be a little more
                    personable. In fact, I'd like you to
                    call me Eunice.

          
          The cops are dumbfounded.      Duffy snaps out of it.

          

                                DUFFY
                    O'kay, Eunice. I don't see why the
                    fuck the Fed is...

          

                                EUNICE
                    Whoa, whoa, "fuck?" This isn't a
                    "fuck" situation, is it? I can see a
                    "God Damn" or two but why skip all the
                    way to "fuck" right off the bat? Let's
                    start slow and work our way up to it.

          

                                DUFFY
                    What is the Fed's interest in this?
          The detectives harden, brick wall.     Eunice furrows her brow.

          

                                EUNICE
                    Their interest, Detective, is capturing
                    the men responsible for the murders of
                    22 of Boston's finest criminals. Y'see
                    public perception is that these boys
                    stepped in, did our jobs for us and
                    then disappeared into thin air as we
                    fecklessly searched for them. The FBI
                    tends to take exception to such things.
                    They coulda sent anyone. They sent me.
                    Why do you think that is?

                                EUNICE (CONT'D)
                    It is because I am so fucking smart
                    that I make smart people feel like
                    retards. Now, we seem to be getting
                    off on the wrong foot here. I'd
                    appreciate a bit of cooperation. Let's
                    chalk it up to paying respect to the
                    memory of a dearly departed mutual
                    friend. A man who taught me everything
                    I know.

          
          After a moment of consideration, the cops concede with nods.

                    Now what's with the circus?

          

                                DUFFY
                    The victim was killed late last night.
                    When people gathered for morning mass,
                    they found the front entrance chained
                    and padlocked. A locksmith came out,
                    cut the chain and surprise, surprise.
                    Cell phones. Half of them called the
                    cops. Half of them called the media.
                    But regardless...word's out.

          
          Eunice turns and looks over the crowd.

          

                                EUNICE
                    And it looks like that's just the way
                    somebody wanted it. What say we scrape
                    the shit off this cow's ass, fellas?
                    Detective Greenly? Escort a lady onto
                    the crime scene?

          

                                 GREENLY
                    What?   No, yeah, no.   Of course.

          
          Greenly escorts her as Dolly and Duffy walk behind, mystified.

          

                                GREENLY (CONT'D)

          Eunice stands, looking down the aisle at the altar. Behind her, the
          Detectives are curios as Eunice slides on pink latex gloves.

          

                                                                        12.

          

          
          She puts in ear plugs and all ambient sound ceases.   She starts
          slowly down the aisle...

          
          TOTAL SILENCE AS...Eunice inspects the smashed door of a
          confessional booth. She looks over the body closely then turns from
          the altar and walks to the detectives. She pulls her earplugs and
          all sound returns.

                    already knew that.

          
          The detectives nod.

          

                                DUFFY
                    The two "V's." The victim and venue
                    don't add up.

                    Let's go with the venue first. Our

                    never commit such an act on sacred
                    ground. And as for the victim?

          

                                DOLLY
                    All their vics were criminals. Clearly
                    not the case here. So, it wasn't them
                    which means this is a local matter and
                    it falls under our jurisdiction. No
                    need for Federal involvement so with

                    Man, I hate it when people say that.
                    "With all due respect." Because it is
                    inevitably followed by a disrespectful

          Dolly fumes.   Duffy and Greenly share an "oh shit" look.

          Close up on Greenly's enraptured face. We pull back and see he is
          on his knees before Eunice and staring longingly between her legs.

                                EUNICE
                    Very well, David.

          
          Duffy and Dolly stand behind Greenly, chest to chest, each mimicking
          guns to the back of the kneeling cop's head.

                    his knees and each dropped iron to the
                    back of his head.

          
          This is torture for Greenly and he turns his head from Eunice's
          crotch. She immediately adjusts him back into place.

                    Eyes front, David. The position of the
                    victim and the angles produced by the
                    killers' stance created a unique
                    scenario. The bullets criss crossed in
                    the skull and exited the eye sockets.
                    Here, this did not occur. The rounds
                    moved on a straight trajectory through

                    over us!

          

                                CAPO #4
                    Forget the cops! What about these
                    Saints fuckers?! These guys were long
                    gone! And now you're trying to bring
                    the devil right back to our doorstep?!

          
          Concezio wipes his mouth, stands and adjusts his cuffs.   He slowly
          circles the table as he speaks.

          

                                                                20.

          

          

                                CONCEZIO
                    Six years ago, with the backing of an
                    adoring public, these vigilante fucks
                    put my father on his knees and executed
                    him...in public. Mi Patrigno, a blood
                    relative and benefactor to all of you.
                    Poppa Joe made you rich and his murder
                    remains un-revenged...

          
          A few roll their eyes at this verbal blunder.

          

                                CONCEZIO (CONT'D)
                    This too, is infamita. These homicidal
                    maniacs nearly wiped this family out.
                    It's taken a lot of time to build
                    ourselves up again, brick by brick.
                    And now that we've re-acquiesced our
                    original power, can we really afford to
                    have these guys pop out of the woodwork
                    someday and try to finish the job when
                    we least expect it? Now, for those of
                    you who have forgotten, let's recap.
                    These fuckers walk into rooms full of
                    gangsters...
                             (denotes surroundings)
                    Outnumbered, outgunned. They kill
                    everyone...and leave.

          
          Some look as if they are starting to get his point.

                    You think I don't know that each one of
                    you's been waking up in night sweats
                    over this the last couple years? These
                    sons of bitches prison fucked us with
                    no lube, wiped their dicks on our
                    drapes and walked away! And we been
                    living in silent fear ever since. Oh,
                    we don't talk about it. Rape victims
                    often don't. But it's there. Knowing
                    they're still out there, somewhere.
                    Thinking...what if?

          
          Fear and realization.

          

                                CAPO #4
                    Concezio is right. Pretending you
                    don't got a problem don't solve
                    nothing.

          
          Heads nod in shameful agreement.

          

                                                                        21.

          

          

                                CONCEZIO
                    Thank you, Doctor Phil. So, let's take
                    a moment to look at the serendiplious,
                    diperous, serendip...

                             (FRUSTRATION)
                    ...type situation we find ourselves in
                    here. There's a good chance they'll
                    show. No catching us with our pants
                    down this time. We can deal with them
                    proactivitously. The cops were
                    embarrassed by these guys too. With a
                    second bite at the apple, they got
                    every reason in the world to crank up
                    the heat. And as for their doting
                    public. I'd imagine they're gonna lose
                    a few fans.

          
          Heads nod all around.   Sold.

          

          INT. BERTH -- LATER


          
          Murphy sits, bare chested on a crate. With the rigged pen, he
          tattoos his brother's back. Connor cooks something, in a pot, on
          the hot plate. The resin of anger is evident.

          
          TATTOOS: Murphy's back has the crucified feet of Christ and
          Connor's shows Christ's downcast head on the cross.

          

                                CONNOR
                    The prodigal son, huh?   He wants us,
                    he's fuckin' got us.

          

                                MURPHY
                    But why would he do something so
                    public?

                                CONNOR
                    Think about it. People figure we did
                    it. Makes it more likely someone will
                    drop a dime. Way easier to get to us
                    in prison, isn't it, now.

          
          The berth door is slightly ajar. In pops a bottle of Whiskey, then
          Romeo's head. He's expecting a cheer but the brothers have their
          backs to him. He's instantly taken by their ink.

          

                                MURPHY
                    But how would anyone recognize us?

          

                                CONNOR
                    You don't remember those sketches on
                    the news channel?

          

                                                             22.

          

          

                                MURPHY
                    Shit. That's right. Y'know, every
                    time they show those composites on TV
                    and then they catch the guy, it looks
                    nothin' like him. But ours?

          

                                CONNOR
                    Just our luck. We get Leonardo fuckin'
                    Divinci as a sketch artist.

          
          Romeo listens with suspicion.

          

                                MURPHY
                    Maybe we should dye our hair.

          

                                CONNOR
                    What?

          

                               MURPHY
                    Yeah. These guys are always dyin'
                    their hair. You know, like in "The
                    Fugitive." It's covert and shit.

          
            Connor smirks privately.

          

                                CONNOR
                    What color would you dye it?

          

                                MURPHY
                    I don't know...lighter, I guess.

          

                                CONNOR
                    Y'mean...blonde?

          

                                MURPHY
                    I didn't say that!

                                CONNOR
                    California, surfer boy, gay, gay
                    blonde?!

          

                                MURPHY
                    I'm warnin' ya!

          

                                CONNOR
                    Just keep your hands off my ass back
                    there and, "stay gold, Pony Boy."

          
          Connor laughs heartily.

          

                                MURPHY
                    Fuck you!

          

                                                                         23.

          

          
          Murphy stabs the ink pen into his brother's shoulder.

          

                                CONNOR

                    AAAAAH!

          
          Connor bolts up, knocking over the pot. Hot water and pennies
          spread across the floor. Connor pulls the pen out.

          

                                CONNOR (CONT'D)
                    You motherfucker!

          
          Romeo steps inside and sees the pennies.

          

                                MURPHY
                    Serves ya right!

          
          The boys are just about to fight when...

          

                                ROMEO
                    Oh, shit.

          
          The brothers snap their heads toward.   A stunned Romeo points to
          them, then the pennies.

          

                                ROMEO (CONT'D)
                    I know who you are. You guys are the
                    fuckin'....

          

                                MURPHY

                    SHUT IT!

          
          Murphy moves behind Romeo, shuts the door and shoves him in.

          

                                ROMEO
                    Oh, this is so fucking cool, man. I'm
                    from Boston. I love you guys. Shit,
                    everybody does! I mean, holy fucking
                    shit! Maybe I could get in on this,
                    you know? Bring some La Raza ta this
                    thing. Spice it up a little. Hey, is
                    it true you guys say a prayer before
                    you grease somebody?

          
          Connor pulls a gun. The boys jump on Romeo and pin him to the
          floor. Murphy clasps a hand over Romeo's mouth. Connor puts the
          gun to Romeo's head. Their faces glaze over, religious ecstasy...

          

                                CONNOR
                    And an awesome wailing was heard
                    throughout heaven...

          
          Romeo's eyes go wide and muffled cries of terror are heard.

          

                                                                      24.

          

          

                                MURPHY
                    ...as the terrible hand of the Lord
                    struck upon the earth.

          

                                CONNOR
                    And as Almighty God created you...he
                    now calleth you home.

          
          He pulls the trigger - "click."

          

                                CONNOR (CONT'D)
                    Ooops. Busy signal. We'll hafta
                    calleth back.

          

                                MURPHY
                    Let's have a shot while we're waitin'.

          
          The boys laugh, snatch the bottle.   Romeo is in shock.

          

                                ROMEO
                    That shit was NOT funny, man!

          
          The brothers laugh harder. Romeo rolls on his side and slides a
          hand down the back of his pants. He seems relieved.

          

                                ROMEO (CONT'D)
                    Oh, thank you, Jesus. Thought I
                    greased my drawers.

          

          INT. BERTH -- LATER


          
          The boys and Romeo smoke and pass the bottle around.

          

                                CONNOR
                    No.

                                ROMEO
                    But I got conex all over Bean Town.
                    Romeo'll hook you up like a tow truck!

          

                                MURPHY
                    No.

          

                                ROMEO
                    Why not?!

          

                                MURPHY
                    We don't hafta give you reasons.
                    Forget it.

          

                                ROMEO
                    It's because I'm Mexican, isn't it!

          

                                                              25.

          

          

                                CONNOR
                    How dare you, sir, insinuate such a
                    thing? The fact that you're a greasy
                    spic's got nothin' ta do with it.

          
          The boys laugh.

          

                                ROMEO
                    I'm gonna let you have that one. Look.
                    I can do this. It's not rocket
                    science. You two find bad guys doing
                    bad shit and you kill them, right?

          

                                CONNOR
                    It's not that simple.

          

                                 MURPHY
                    Yes it is.

          

                                CONNOR
                    S'pose you're right. I'd sorta hoped we
                    were a little more artistic than that.

          

                                ROMEO
                    Well, you ain't. Can't you guys see
                    it? This shit's fate, man. Like
                    preordained type shit. Mea fucking
                    Culpa! Why do you think you just
                    happened to be in that hatchway today?

          

                                MURPHY
                    Oh, don't start gettin' all super
                    fuckin' natural on us. We saw those
                    guys goin' in there!

          

                                ROMEO
                    Ah, ha! That's what you say. I say it's
                    because Jeeeeesus wanted it that way!

          

                                 CONNOR
                    Oh, no.

          

                                ROMEO
                    Fine. Then what exactly do you intend
                    to do when you hit U.S. soil?

          

                                CONNOR
                    We'll go after all Yakavetta's people
                    and operations till we get to the man
                    himself.

          

                                MURPHY
                    Yeah, work our way up the food chain.

          

                                                                      26.

          

          
          The brothers seem pleased with themselves.

          

                                ROMEO
                    So, what's your first gig?    What's the
                    first thing you gonna do?

          
          The boys look to one another.   They're stumped.

          

                                CONNOR
                    Well, I don't suppose we have a
                    succinct plan, y'know, per se.

          

                                MURPHY
                    Yeah. It's not fully developed yet,
                    y'know, as it were.

          
          A slow smile splits Romeo's face.

          

                                ROMEO
                    You two need to chill in the green
                    room, sip on some Pellegrinos and let
                    your manager handle the details. And
                    you better get my Cub Scout badge
                    ready. Cuz if you want to kick
                    Yakavetta in the nuts, let him know
                    you're in town...Romeo's got an ace in
                    the hole for you.

          

          INT. / EXT. NEWS FOOTAGE, MAN ON THE STREET INTERVIEWS


          

                                HOT DOG VENDOR
                    These guys have gone "mad dog" here.
                    They need to be put down.

          

                                CAB DRIVER
                    I think it's disgusting.   I wish they'd
                    have stayed gone.

          

                                PEDESTRIAN
                    I don't believe it for a second!   No
                    bleep-in way the Saints did it!

          

          INT. BOSTON P.D., WAR ROOM -- MORNING


          
          The CHIEF (50's) sits, arms folded. The detectives are present.
          Eunice stands before a wall adorned with crime scene photos,
          reports, Concezio and his Capos.

          

                                EUNICE
                    And that's all she wrote. Everything
                    points in the same direction.

          
          She taps Yakavetta's picture on the wall.

          

                                                              27.

          

          

                                CHIEF
                    Why would Yakavetta want them back
                    here? Him of all people.

          

                                DUFFY
                    To have them executed. Revenge.
                    Oldest motive in the book.

          

                                GREENLY
                    The Saints killed his daddy six years
                    ago, right? He was inside when that
                    happened doing a nickel for extortion.

          

                                DOLLY
                    Yeah. From inside he could only do so
                    much. Since he got out nine months
                    ago, the Yakavetta's have regained
                    their original strength. Looks like
                    their clearing all their open accounts.

          
          The Chief rubs his chin.

          

                                CHIEF
                    Well...it's a theory.

          

                                EUNICE
                    More than just a theory, Chief.

          
          She nods to Duffy.

          

                                DUFFY
                    C.I.'s came back. Cold hits all
                    around. Concezio Yakavetta and his six
                    Capo Regime, all blood relatives, have
                    disappeared.

                               CHIEF
                    So?

          

                                GREENLY
                    So, it fits. He's gone to the
                    mattresses with his top brass. He's
                    protecting them till this is over.

          

                                EUNICE
                    And word's been put to all his
                    lieutenants that the Saints are to be
                    taken out, on sight.

          

                                DOLLY
                    That means his resources on the streets
                    are battening down the hatches, waiting
                    for them to show.

          

                                                                          28.

          

          

                                CHIEF
                    Look, I been stone walling the media on
                    this thing but the Mayor's been riding
                    me like a rented mule here. I got half
                    of New England thinking the Saints
                    whacked a priest and the other half
                    thinking their innocent. Its a powder
                    keg. I'm talking riot gear at Celtics
                    games, here. I could clear them of
                    this murder, take the piss right out of
                    this thing, keep the peace in the
                    Commonwealth. Gimme one good reason
                    why I shouldn't go public right now.

          

                                EUNICE
                    Walk with me, Chief.    Let's talk.

          
          He stands and she takes his arm as they exit.     Duffy quietly closes
          the door and turns. Hushed tones...

          

                                DUFFY
                    This is not good.   She's gunning for
                    the boys hard.

          

                                DOLLY
                    This brawd, trying to put a feather in
                    her cap is gonna get us locked up.

          

                                DUFFY
                    Just calm down.

          

                                GREENLY
                    And you know they'll send us to the
                    Hoag. We put half those deranged sex
                    freaks in there. I hope you guys like
                    cock sandwiches. Cuz we'll be eating
                    them for breakfast, lunch and dinner!

          

          INT. PRECINCT HALL -- SAME TIME


          
          The Chief and Eunice walk down the hall.

          

                                EUNICE
                    I understand you got a job to do,
                    Chief. But if Yakavetta even sniffs
                    that we're onto him, he puts a bullet
                    in Napoleon's head, plants him at the
                    bottom of the ocean and walks. This
                    pint sized killer is the only thing
                    that puts Yakavetta right in the middle
                    of this. It is imperative that we find
                    this man.

          

                                                                        29.

          

          
          The Chief looks as if he is sold.

          

          INT. WAR ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER


          
          In hushed tones.

          

                                DUFFY
                    We need to figure what we're gonna do
                    when the boys show and start doin' what
                    they do best. Cuz that's when the
                    shit's really gonna hit the fan.

          

                                DOLLY
                    That's another thing. Everyone's
                    assuming that they're going to come
                    back. I mean, we got no way of knowing
                    that for sure.

          

                                GREENLY
                             (ray of hope)
                    Yeah. That could totally happen.    They
                    could not come back.

          

                                DUFFY
                    What dream world did you two just slip
                    into?!

          
          They argue.   Duffy snaps a photo of the dead priest from the wall.

          

                                DUFFY (CONT'D)
                    Point blank! We know the boys. Is
                    there any part of you that thinks
                    they're are just going to let this
                    slide? Believe this. They are either
                    on their way...or they're already here.

          EXT. BOSTON, DOCKS, PARKING LOT -- NIGHT


          
          CLOSE ON: Connor, Murphy and Romeo peaking over a concrete wall.
          Three sets of eyes.

          
          Our trio is atop a dumpster, peaking over at the loading dock.
          Chinese Gangsters supervise unloading of crates onto a flatbed.

          

                                ROMEO
                    It's been all over the papers the last
                    two years. Yakavetta's in bed with the
                    Chinese. They're using international
                    shipping routes to smuggle it in. This
                    is Little Yaka's shit.

          
          Connor and Murphy smile.

          

                                                                     30.

          

          

                                CONNOR
                    Let's follow 'em down the rabbit hole,
                    Alice.

          
          Murphy claps Romeo on the shoulder.

          

                                MURPHY
                    You just scored a few points, Rome.

          

                                ROMEO
                    Well, dust off my "Members Only"
                    jacket.
                             (pulls set of keys)
                    Cuz the kid has also supplied the ride!

          

          INT. CAR -- LATER


          
          Murphy looks displeased. We hear a stressing motor. Romeo drives,
          Murphy sits shotgun. Connor is in back, loading guns. Pull back to
          reveal our trio rides in a '68 VW Bug. It is green with patches of
          Bondo, exposed engine, low-pro rims, neon runner board lights - a
          low riding "work in progress."

          

                                MURPHY
                    I thought you said your car was
                    inconspicuous.

          

                                ROMEO
                    I don't like words that got 'spic'
                    right in the middle. Besides, it
                    is...where I live.

          

                                MURPHY
                    Where's that? Pimpville?

          

                                ROMEO
                    Hey! I hail from a colorful people.
                    Besides, you wouldn't know style if it
                    pitched a tent in your ass!
                             (looks into rear view)
                    What do you think of the ride, Conman?

          

                                CONNOR
                    The only way I could be more
                    embarrassed right now is if I was
                    ridin' a moped.

          

                                MURPHY
                    Yeah...while fuckin' a fat girl.

          

                                CONNOR
                    Yeah...rollin' through the gym at my
                    high school reunion.

          

                                                                       31.

          

          

                                   ROMEO
                      All right!   I get the fucking point!

          

          INT. WAREHOUSE -- LATER


          
          CHINESE GANGSTERS #1-#5, shovel mounds of coffee grounds out of
          crates and pull kilos of white powder. Machinery noise in b.g.

          

          EXT. WAREHOUSE -- SAME TIME


          
          CLOSE ON:   Three sets of eyes peaking over oil drums.

          
          Our trio watches as a DOCK WORKER (22yrs) drives a forklift,
          unloading the crates from the flatbed and driving them through the
          huge open bay doors. The boys and Romeo huddle up.

          

                                  CONNOR
                      O'kay, here's the plan.

          

          EXT. "THE PLAN," WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT


          
          The "Queen" classic, Another One Bites the Dust, presides over this
          fantasy sequence. The boys, looking more "quaffed," do a pointless
          slow motion walk toward the forklift, throwing up their collars.

          
          Romeo, also looking polished, executes a "Dan Tana" pistol whipping
          on the Dock Worker who perfectly out of frame.

          
          INSIDE WAREHOUSE: The lift pulls to a stop before the gangsters,
          crate on the forks. Romeo is behind the wheel.

          
          SLO-MO: Connor and Murphy pop from the crate and fire on their
          Asian foe, hitting each squarely in the chest.

          
          SLO-MO: The boys leap down and light cigs as Romeo does the "one
          arm action star hang" off the side of the lift in b.g. WHIP PAN...

          EXT. WAREHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER


          

                                  CONNOR
                      We skin out, go ta Doc's for a shot of
                      Irish. We're home in time for tacos.

          
          Murphy looks unsure.     Connor turns to his brother.

          

                                   CONNOR (CONT'D)
                      What?

          

                                  MURPHY
                      Well, it's...uh...you know, it's...

          

                                                                        32.

          

          

                                ROMEO
                    It's genius. I can even drive an F-
                    lift, man. Got my class "D" license
                    and everything.

          

                                CONNOR
                    Now, dat's the spirit.

          

                                ROMEO
                    I need a gun.

          

                                 CONNOR AND MURPHY
                    Forget it.

          

                                ROMEO
                    What the fuck? I'm in on this shit,
                    man! I'm working here!

          
          The boys look to each other. Murphy shrugs. Relenting, Connor
          pulls a metallic object and shoves it in Romeo's hand.

          

                                CONNOR
                    You can consider yourself a fuckin'
                    pledge until we say different.

          
          Romeo holds up the gun in displeasure, a tiny .22 caliber lady's
          purse pistol. Murphy snickers.

          

                                ROMEO
                    Can I consider myself your girlfriend,
                    too?

          

                                CONNOR
                    That's what you get.   Is there a
                    problem?

                               ROMEO
                             (beat, fuming)
                    It's fine.

          
          Connor scopes the warehouse.   Murphy claps Romeo on the shoulder.

          

                                MURPHY
                    Don't worry, Rome.   Shit like this
                    builds character.

          

                                ROMEO
                    Yeah, the character of a little bitch.

          

                                MURPHY
                    Now, dat's just unprofessional.

          
          He turns and joins his brother as Romeo continues sulking.

          

                                                                       33.

          

          

                                MURPHY (CONT'D)
                    What do we think?

          

                                CONNOR
                    I think Yakavetta murdered a good man
                    just to send us a message.

          

                                MURPHY
                    Well...let's send him one back.

          
          As they spirit themselves off.   DISSOLVE TO...

          

          INT. WAREHOUSE -- LATER


          
          CRIME SCENE: Crime scene workers toil. We do not see specifics of
          the scene, just enough to see the place is trashed and the bodies.

          
          Greenly prowls the scene with his iPod playing. His musical choice
          is the 80's Nightranger standby, "Motoring." He riffs on air guitar
          while assessing. Dolly and Duffy look on...

          EXT. WAREHOUSE -- SAME TIME


          
          Eunice walks toward the crime scene with the CHIEF (50's).

          

                                CHIEF
                    Your boss, John Kuntsler called. Tells

                    Unfortunately, authority's developed a
                    problem with me.

          

                                CHIEF

                    So you spoke to Kuntsler.      Anything
                    else.

          
          They reach the Detectives.      Greenly, still rockin', doesn't notice.

          

                                CHIEF
                    If it's confirmed that the Saints are
                    back and too many bodies start showing

                    fast.

          
          She smiles and nods.   Greenly removes his ear pieces.

                    It's them.

          
          Greenly looks emasculated. Dolly and Duffy smirk at him. Eunice
          stands and prowls the scene, intense, intrigued, in her own world...

          EXT. FLASHBACK, WAREHOUSE -- EARLIER


          
          On the flatbed, the brothers shovel coffee out of the final crate
          which rests on the forks of the lift. Below them stands the Dock
          Worker holding his bleeding head. Romeo covers him with his 22.

          

                                DOCK WORKER
                    You didn't have to bash me in the
                    skull.

          

                                ROMEO
                    Sorry, man. We got a plan going, here.
                    Technically, I was supposed to knock
                    you out.

          

                                DOCK WORKER
                    Christ! You got a gun. You could have
                    just pointed it at me and said SCRAM!

          
          Connor points his gun at the Dock Worker.

          

                                  CONNOR

                    SCRAM!

                    You got it!

          
          He runs off.   Romeo turns up to them.

                                ROMEO
                    So, let's not let this one, small
                    incident get in the way of...

          Romeo hops into the driver's seat.

          

                                MURPHY
                    Well, at least the plan is off to a
                    winning start.

          They pull wrapped white kilos.    Connor dips in a finger and tastes.

                    It's heroin.

          INT. WAREHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER


          
          Romeo's winging it, jerky moves, grinding gears as the forklift
          staggers across the mammoth warehouse toward the gangsters at the
          opposing end. The crate blocks Romeo from view. He's driving blind
          as the rickety crate jiggles on the forks.

          
          INSIDE CRATE:   Connor and Murphy are sardined, back to back.

          

                                  MURPHY
                    Jesus!    What the fuck's he doin'?!

                    He can't see where he's goin'!

          
          Murphy peaks through a crack.

          

                                  MURPHY
                    Shit!    Tell him to go left, now!

          
          Connor puts his mouth to a knot hole.

          

                                  CONNOR
                    Go left!    Go left!

                                 ROMEO
                    What?!

          
          Connor sticks his finger out the hole and points. Romeo wrenches
          the wheel and they narrowly avoid machinery. The crate rocks...

          

                                MURPHY
                    I can't fuckin' believe I let you talk
                    me into this! This is a stupid plan!

          

                                CONNOR
                    I didn't notice you throwin' out any
                    ideas, ya creative asshole!

          

                                 MURPHY
                    Fuck you!

          

                                                                        37.

          

          
          The boys start elbowing each other in a close quarters scrap while
          hurling obscenities.

          

                                 ROMEO
                    Hey!   What's goin' on in there?!

          
          INSIDE CRATE: Murphy suddenly stops, eyes wide as he looks through
          the crack. They are headed for a "Mechanic's Well."   A long,
          rectangular cement hole in the floor six feet deep.

          

                                MURPHY
                    Jesus Christ! Tell him to stop!

          
          Connor slams his mouth to the knot hole.

          

                                 CONNOR

                    BRAKES!   BRAKES! BRAKES!

          
          A few of the Chinese turn as Romeo slams on the brakes, screeching
          to a halt just before the well. The crate slides right off and
          falls in, disappears from sight. CRASH!

          
          A large cloud of coffee dust plumes.   A wide eyed Romeo is exposed.
          The Asian gangsters stare in shock.

          
          Hard techno music! Suddenly, Romeo whips it in reverse, cranks the
          wheel guns it and navigates the well. Speeds toward the gangsters.

          
          MECHANIC'S WELL: (SLO-MO) The brothers burst from the debris,
          covered in coffee grounds and white powder. They draw their weapons
          and walk toward the ramp at the well's opposing end.

          
          The Chinese pull and start firing. Romeo dives off and rolls behind
          some machines. The lift continues on target.

          
          The brothers emerge and tear right in, firing at the gangsters.
          Romeo fires his useless 22. In the ensuing fire fight the brothers
          kill all but Chinese Gangster #3.

          
          The forklift crashes through the table with the stacked heroin.

          
          SLO-MO: The brothers slam the final Gangster to his knees and level
          to the back of his head and recite the following in synchronicity...

                    swiftly carry out Thy command. So, we

                        Just got a call from my best snitch.
                        Never steered me wrong. He says its
                        this guy.

                        "Gorgeous" George Tuffano. He's
                        trusted bruglione to Yakavetta but not
                        blood. He's been left control of the
                        streets. He's running all of it.

          
          Eunice looks over the mug shot.

          

                                    GREENLY
                        They call him "Gorgeous" cuz he likes
                        his silk suits and jewelry. He's even
                        got the 'out of season' fake bake going
                        on, a real peacock, this guy.

                        That's like bringing a knife to a

                        gun...to a gunfight.

          
          They all blank stare Greenly for a moment.        Moving on.

                    three shooters. This is one of them.

          

                                EUNICE
                    Well, I'm having a hard time believing
                    that one of the three most lethal
                    individuals on the planet just switched
                    over to bird shot.

          

                                DOLLY
                    Maybe we're reading it wrong. The
                    priest was a frame job, right?

          

                                DUFFY
                    Yeah, maybe somebody's trying to
                    eliminate some competition here.

          
          Eunice considers this.   The Detectives seem hopeful.

                    have ourselves a change in the line up,

          The detectives all look at one another nervously.

          

                                GREENLY
                    Fine, they're back.   What's the plan?

                    figure out where Yakavetta's hiding.

                    WHAT THE FUCK!?

          
          He bolts to his feet.

          

                                GEORGE (CONT'D)
                    You fucking bitch!

          
          He rounds the massage table, arms outstretched. Eunice draws her
          side arm and sticks it in his face, halting him dead.

          

                                GEORGE (CONT'D)
                    Whoa, whoa, whoa.

                    Who are you?

          

                                EUNICE
                    Why, I'm a lady, George. That fact
                    alone demands a certain amount of...
                             (cocks hammer back)
                    ...cordiality.

          

                                GEORGE
                    I'm, I'm sorry I called you that.

          

                                EUNICE
                    Well, how courteous of you to
                    apologize. Courtesy is so important.
                    Don't you agree?

          

                                GEORGE
                    Y, yeah...I'm with that.

          

                                 EUNICE

          George sits. Eunice reholsters, wiggles her skirt straight and sits
          on the massage table. George looks at her legs as she slowly
          crosses them. Trepidation as he covers his genitals. Eunice smiles
          as she flashes her FBI credentials. George relaxes.

                                EUNICE
                    Yeah. There's a lot of stuff you don't
                    know, Hoss. For instance, why aren't
                    you safely tucked away in some ivory
                    tower with all the other big wigs,
                    sucking on cannoli and shrimp cocktail?
                    Why are you the one he left on the
                    streets, George?

                    That's bullshit and I ain't saying
                    another fucking word to you.

          

                                EUNICE
                    Good. Then you can just listen. The
                    jig is up. We know Concezio had that
                    priest killed.

          
          George snaps his head to Eunice in shock, then recovers.

          

                                EUNICE (CONT'D)

                    just got thrown into a meat grinder.

          
          Eunice goes to leave but stops and turns back.

          EXT. ESTABLISHING SHOT, "EL CAVA" RESTAURANT -- DAY


          
          A Mexican joint, tucked away down by the docks.

          

                                ROMEO V.O.
                    You wanna find something in Boston that
                    don't wanna be found you go to the
                    Oracle, ese. My Uncle Cesar is hooked
                    up with the Underground.

          

          INT. RESTAURANT -- SAME TIME


          
          The boys, Romeo and UNCLE CESAR (58yrs) sit in a booth. Cesar is
          noble looking, silver hair. Silence as he looks them over.

          

                                CESAR
                    Word is, Yakavetta's gunning for you
                    boys hard. The whole city's on edge.
                    I even heard he posted a reward like
                    Jesse James style and shit. Any of his
                    guys that take you out gets his palm
                    crossed, two hundred and fifty grand.

          

                                 ROMEO
                    Whew.   A quarter of a mill for us?

          

                                CESAR
                    Us? What the fuck are you talking
                    about "us?"

          
          They begin to argue in Spanish.

          

                                ROMEO
                    Uncle, why do you have to disrespect me
                    in front of them?!

          

                                CESAR
                    Cool it, Mr. Big Shot! A year ago you
                    were washing my pots and pans!

          

                                ROMEO
                    Well, I don't wash fucking pots
                    anymore! I'm part of this, Uncle!

          

                                CESAR
                    Hey! This isn't my first bar-b-que!
                    Now shut up and stop interrupting! Let
                    me talk to them and I'll figure out
                    whether your in on this or in your own
                    fucking fantasy world!

          

                                                                       46.

          

          
          Romeo swallows his anger.   Murphy speaks Spanish.

          

                                 MURPHY
                    He's in.   All the way in.

          
          Cesar looks at Murphy surprised.   In English.

          

                                CESAR
                    Is my nephew pulling his weight?

          
          Connor nods while tapping his chest.

          

                                CONNOR
                    Mucho corazon.

          
          Cesar looks to his nephew with a new found respect and touches his
          hand. Romeo is very affected by this. Back to business.

          

                                CESAR
                    Gorgeous George is running the show for
                    Little Yaka. Drugs, prostitution,
                    sharking, the whole cha cha. If
                    anybody knows where he is, it's that
                    fat fucking pedico. I'll put it out on
                    the wire.

          

          INT. THE GREEN MACHINE -- LATER


          
          Romeo quietly weeps as he drives. The brothers are "highly aware"
          and give respectful silence. As Romeo sniffles we show slow motion
          remembrances of Cesar nodding and giving Romeo a look of respect and
          then touching his nephew's hand.

          
          Back in the Green Machine - an excruciating amount of time passes.
          Murphy tries to break the ice.

                                MURPHY
                    Hey, uh, maybe we should...

          

                                 CONNOR
                    Shut up.   Romeo's crying.

          
          A moment of silence....then all three burst into laughter.

          

                                ROMEO
                    You fucking assholes!

          

          INT. PRUDENTIAL BUILDING, LUXURY APARTMENT -- DAY


          
          A sprawling high rise apartment, overlooking Boston: buffet table,
          plasma screen, etc. The Capos are taking advantage of the
          amenities. Concezio's not here. Capo #5 - #6 fill their plates...

          

                                                                          47.

          

          

                                CAPO #5
                    That shipment of "H" was gonna square
                    our books for six months. Shit.

          

                                CAPO #6
                    We always bounce back. Besides, look
                    at the bright side. Better the chinks
                    than us, right.

          

                                CAPO #5
                    I guess.  Like the boss said...
                             (Concezio impression)
                    "This is war. There's gonna be
                    casuwalities."

          
          They laugh. Suddenly, George enters with an overnight bag.      The
          Capos are confused. Feigning a capitol mood...

          

                                GEORGE
                    Oh! Like the Roman Empire in here!
                    Where's all the concubines and shit?

          
          George laughs. Nobody else does. He looks at the food table.      We
          pull close on shrimp cocktail and cannoli. A look of dread.

          

                                  CAPO #3
                    George.    What gives, here?

          

                                GEORGE
                    I need to see the Boss, right away.

          

                                CAPO #4
                    Jimmy the Gofer!

          
          In hustles JIMMY THE GOFER (20's), skinny, weak looking.

                                CAPO #2
                             (to Jimmy)
                    Il cortina.

          
          Jimmy draws back a large curtain, exposing a steel panic room. Next
          to the vault door, is a video screen which displays the unamused
          face of Concezio. His voice booms over loudspeakers.

          

                                CONCEZIO
                    Get over here!

          

                                 GEORGE
                    Whoa!

          
          George hustles over.   He stands before the screen, confused.

          

                                                                       48.

          

          

                                 GEORGE (CONT'D)
                    Uh.   Hey, Boss! I just came by to...!

          

                                CONCEZIO
                    Push the talk button, numb nuts.

          

                                GEORGE
                    Oh.
                             (he does)
                    Can you here me? Over.

          

                                CONCEZIO
                    I can hear you fine, Smokey and the
                    Bandit. Now, what the fuck are you
                    doing here?

          

                                GEORGE
                    Everything's in motion. All our guys
                    are gunning for these Jesus Freaks. I
                    figure, no need for me to be on the
                    streets no more. So, which room do I
                    take, eh?

          

                                CONCEZIO
                    You stupid motherfucker! I told you,
                    you're on the streets till this is
                    over! Now get the fuck outta here!

          
          A terrified George hustles for the door.

          

                                CONCEZIO (CONT'D)
                    And don't come back here till I tell
                    you to, you fat fucking waste of space!

          
          George trips over his luggage.   The Capos giggle.

          INT. HOTEL ROOM -- EVENING


          
          Cheap, depressing room. Crew Cut, in his underwear, repairs a
          broken rosary chain with string and puts it on.He pulls a shoe box
          from a shopping bag. The brand is "Hushes." Slogan: "Measure up
          to your dreams."

          
          He puts on one shoe. Crew Cut stands before the mirror going up and
          down on the one shoed foot, noting the height that has been added.
          The shoe has been cleverly constructed to disguise the higher heel.

          

          EXT. AUTO BODY -- EVENING


          
          We are out back, among scrap cars. George talks with JO JO RHAMA
          (38yrs). Jo Jo is built like a fire plug and clearly a hoodlum.

          

                                                    49.

          

          

                       JO JO
          A priest.   The sick fuck.

          

                      GEORGE

          holding the bag while him and his are
          living it up at the Taj fuckin' Majal,
          not a care in the world.

          

                      JO JO
          So, until the Saints get popped, we're
          all lambs to slaughter?

          

                      GEORGE
          Yeah! And he don't care how many of us
          they wipe out in the meantime!

          What do you need me to do, Skipper?

          

                      GEORGE
          Spread the word to all the brugliones.
          No bullshit. From your mouth to their
          ears.

          Everyone? North and South?   That could
          get a little dicey.

          Fuck their old grudges. All of them
          are in this, like it or not. Tell them
          everything we discussed.

          

                      JO JO
          Even the panic room thing?

                        GEORGE
          Sure.

          

                      JO JO
          Good. That's a nice ice breaker.
          They'll get a kick outta that. I
          didn't even know those things were
          real. I thought they made that shit up
          for that movie? With that brawd and
          that kid? With those guys in that
          house?

          

                        GEORGE
          Panic Room?

                    Stop fuckin' around! This is serious
                    shit, here! Tell 'em we meet tomorrow
                    night. I'll call you with the

                    Rosary bead. They found it pushed into
                    the carpet near the victim. Father
                    McKinney wasn't wearing a rosary so
                    it's probably been there a while.
          Duffy comes in with a stack of papers.   He heaves it down.

          Crew Cut finishes ritualizing the priest and looks deeply at his
          victim. He removes a glove and places his tiny hand next to
          McKinney's large one. Silent rage. Bare handed, Crew Cut snatches
          the priest's rosary from about his wrist, breaking the bead chain.

          The brothers and Romeo walk through the Mausoleum. They approach a
          grave slate with respect. The name reads, "David Della Rocco."
          There is a picture of him. Murphy narrows his eyes and leans in.

          

                                MURPHY
                    What the...did they use his mug shot?

                    embarrassed cuz the guy had to hold up
                    all his long hair behind his head?

                    Look at that.

          
          We see Murphy's finger denote a bad "airbrush" job.

          

                                MURPHY (CONT'D)
                    That's an arm.

          
          Connor looks close.

                    Oh...that's fuckin' harsh.

          
          The boys look at one another, then bust out laughing.

                    Y'er one of a kind, Roc.

                    You, sir, are no David Della Rocco.

          
          A sound. Instantly, the boys turn and level weapons. There stands
          ROY (32yrs) thick glasses, geeky. He drops his flowers.

          The Manager lets George slip in. He steels into a tanning room.A
          Mexican towel boy has spied George. He picks up a phone...

          is being crushed beneath his weight. Connor kneels.

          nearby. He tosses it to Connor. Text message, "WHERE?"

          

                                CONNOR
                    You meeting someone tonight, George?

          

                                 GEORGE
                    Yeah.   The brugliones.

          

                                MURPHY
                    The what?

          

                                GEORGE
                    Yakavetta's racket chiefs. Street
                    guys.
                             (suddenly brightens)
                    Your kind of guys. You could take a
                    real bite outta crime here, huh? I
                    could help you.

                                CONNOR
                             (re: phone)
                    What's this?

          

                                GEORGE
                    Nobody forgot what you guys did to us
                    last time. They're staying indoors. I
                    give out the location an hour before.

          

                                ROMEO
                    My Uncle's place is closed tonight.    I
                    got the key.

          

                                MURPHY
                    It's down by the docks.   Dead as a
                    doornail at night.

          

                                                                           56.

          

          

                                CONNOR
                    Yeah. You could set off fourth of July
                    fireworks in dat place and nobody would
                    hear. How's Mexican for you, George?

          

                                GEORGE
                    No difference to me. I think I just
                    shit my Speedos, anyway.

          

          INT. EUNICE'S MERCEDES -- NIGHT


          
          Eunice drives.   Her cell rings.   She checks the I.D. then...

          

                                EUNICE
                    How do, David?

          
          Greenly is at his desk.   Alternating coverage.

          

                                GREENLY
                    Hey, DMV came up dry on the partial.
                    INTERpol's still working it. Should
                    only be another couple of hours.

          

                                 EUNICE
                    Lovely.   Anything else?

          

                                GREENLY
                    Yeah. Nothing big. We just dumped a
                    text message from George's cell. Just
                    two words. "El Cava." It's a Mexican
                    joint down by the docks. He sent it to
                    his enforcer, Jo Jo Rhama. Guess
                    gangsters gotta eat too, huh?

          

                                EUNICE
                    I think I'll drop in on their supper,
                    see if I can shake them up a little.

          

                                GREENLY
                    You need a body guard?

          

                                EUNICE
                    No thank you, Mike Tyson.    Bye now.

          

                                GREENLY
                    Bye.

          
          She hangs up and we are left with Greenly.   Red handed.

          

                                GREENLY (CONT'D)
                    Oh, shit.

          

                                                                        57.

          

          

          INT. "EL CAVA," KITCHEN -- LATER


          
          Close up, three shot. George, looking very uncomfortable, is
          flanked by the brothers. He is positioned to covertly view the
          restaurant from the kitchen.

          
          We see NORTHSIDE BRUGLIONEs #1 - #3 and SOUTHSIDE BRUGLIONES #1 and
          #2 are at the bar.

          

                                GEORGE
                    Just two more to go. Uh...You guys are
                    gonna let me go, right?

          

                                MURPHY
                    We'll see, won't we.

          
          George grimaces.   Looks as if he'll cry.

          

                                GEORGE
                    Jesus, this is some embarrassing shit.

          
          We see the three men from behind. George is still in his Speedos,
          which now have a pronounced shit stain in back.

          

          INT. EL CAVA, BAR -- MOMENTS LATER


          
          Romeo, frazzled and in a busboy uniform, has got two blenders of
          margaritas going. The Brugliones mow through appetizers.

          
          Northside doesn't interact with Southside and there is an empty bar
          stool between them. N.S. Bruglione #1 slides Romeo a platter.

          

                                N.S. BRUGLIONE #1
                    Yo, spicaroo. More nachos and mas
                    salsa, capisce?

                                S.S. BRUGLIONE #1
                    Hey and I need a refill there, pepe?

          

                                ROMEO
                    Si, muchachos.

          
          SOUTHSIDE BRUGLIONE #3 enters behind everyone.   All suddenly turn,
          going for their guns.

          

                                  S.S. BRUGLIONE #3
                    Whoa!    Easy...Jesus.

          
          Everyone calms. S.S. Bruglione #3 gives a respectful nod to the
          Northside guys but sits with his own.

          

                                                                         58.

          

          

          INT. EL CAVA, KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER


          
          We do not see George just below frame as the boys are "working on
          him" in some way, putting on finishing touches. Romeo barrels in.

          

                                ROMEO
                    These dagos are getting antsy and I'm
                    getting Spicaroo'd and Pepe'd. The
                    kid's about to go Poncho fucking Villa
                    out there!

          

                                CONNOR
                    Stick it out. Waitin' on one more.

          

          EXT. PARKING LOT -- MOMENTS LATER


          
          Jo Jo exits his Cadillac and walks toward El Cava.   There is a
          "closed for private function" sign on the door.

          

          INT. JACKED UP SUV, NEARBY -- SAME TIME


          
          Crew Cut watches Jo Jo.   He dials his cell.

          

          INT. GREENHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER


          
          From behind we see the Old Man gardening.    He answers a ringing
          phone, nearby. We do not see his face.

          

          INT. SUV -- MOMENTS LATER


          
          The following conversation is in Italian.

          

                                CREW CUT
                    He is not with them.

          

                                OLD MAN
                    Are you certain?

          

                                CREW CUT
                    Yes. It is only the sons. They have a
                    Spaniard with them. They will
                    slaughter everyone.

          

                                OLD MAN
                    Let them. If you kill the sons...the
                    father will come.

          
          Crew Cut develops a sinister smile.

          

          INT. EL CAVA, KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER


          
          Connor watches Jo Jo greet the others.    He turns to Romeo who is
          angrily cooking up a storm.

          

                                                                       59.

          

          

                                CONNOR
                    The gang's all here.

          
          Without missing a beat, Romeo slams the hot pans into a dish sink.
          He stands fuming with his hands on his hips.

          

                                ROMEO
                    Gimme my fucking bee bee gun.

          

                                 MURPHY
                    Naw.   You've earned your stripes, Rome.

          
          Murphy throws him a .9 mm.   Romeo smiles.

          

          INT. BAR -- MOMENTS LATER


          

                                JO JO
                    So....where's Gorgeous?

          
          Suddenly, George comes rolling out of the kitchen, unconscious and
          tied, face down, to a bus cart. There is writing on his back.
          Everyone pulls their weapons and moves toward.

          

                                N.S. BRUGLIONE #2
                    What the fuck is going on, here?

          

                                S.S. BRUGLIONE #2
                    Where's that spic barkeep? Yo, Pepe!
                    Where you at?!

          
          As the gangsters achieve the cart, the brothers creep over the bar
          in the b.g. Brugliones look down on George, painted on his back...

          

                                S.S. BRUGLIONE #3
                    "Erin go brah?" What the hell does
                    that mean?
          Connor and Murphy are standing 25 feet behind them.

          

                                MURPHY
                    It's Irish for "You're fucked."

          
          Hard core music as the Brugliones turn in horror. Everyone begins
          firing and we have slow motion gunplay to pulsating music.

          
          Several are chewed up as chests explode and they are blown into
          George on the cart, knocking it over. George comes to.

          
          Romeo appears and tears in, sending several more crashing into the
          salad bar.

          
          Murphy, while firing, dives back over the bar as bottles explode.
          Connor rapid fires as he dives into a booth.

          

                                                                         60.

          

          
          The boys rise and lay out a second barrage, blasting the rest into
          buffet tables and a soda fountain. The music cuts.

          

                                ROMEO
                    Viva La Mejico, bitches!

          
          George bolts up.    The bus cart is still tied to his fat belly.

          

                                GEORGE
                    Uh, I've seen the light! You guys have
                    really turned me around on this! I'm
                    like born again and shit! I swear!

          

                                MURPHY
                             (to Connor)
                    What do ya think? Let him go?

          
          Connor slips one bullet in a revolver, spins the barrel and snaps it
          shut. He points it to George's forehead. George weeps in earnest.

          

                                CONNOR
                    We'll let God decide if you get a
                    second chance.

          
          He slowly cocks the hammer back, pulls trigger, "click."

          

                                CONNOR (CONT'D)
                    Well, praise the Lord.

          
          The terrified ex-gangster staggers toward an exit while wriggling
          out of his bonds. Just as he touches the door.

          

                                 CONNOR (CONT'D)
                    George?
                             (George turns)
                    All good boys go to heaven.
          George nods and exits. Romeo is confused as our trio gathers.
          Connor tosses the bullet he palmed to Romeo and he nods.

          

                                MURPHY
                    Now, that was, perhaps the finest
                    example of spiritual guidance that I
                    have ever had the good fortune ta
                    witness.

          

                                CONNOR
                    Well, thank you very much.     Mysterious
                    ways. Mysterious ways.

          
          SLO-MO: Suddenly, Eunice bursts through the kitchen door and levels
          her weapon at the brothers and Romeo. Romeo levels back.

          

                                                                      61.

          

          
          Eunice fires as the boys dive on Romeo. Crew Cut is revealed behind
          our trio, firing from the shadows. Eunice and Crew Cut exchange
          fire as the boys reload.

          
          Eunice hits Crew Cut in the side. The assassin has a moment of
          outrage but persists firing as he makes a hasty exit.

          
          In the confusion it is a few moments before anyone realizes he is
          gone. Silence falls. Presently, Romeo and the boys bolt up. Romeo
          goes for the door and the boys level at Eunice.

          

                                CONNOR (CONT'D)
                    Drop the gun! Drop it!

          
          She "places" her gun on a nearby table.

          

                                EUNICE
                    Easy fellas. I'm alone.

          
          The boys are before her as Romeo returns.

          

                                  ROMEO

                    37 bodies later and we're finally back
                    where it all began. Y'ever heard of
                    the southern expression, "We have an
                    elephant in the living room?"

          
          She knocks on the door.   The cops are mortified.

          Connor and Murphy are seated at the bar. They turn.   The cops are
          dumbfounded. Duffy turns to Eunice, mystified.

          

                                DUFFY

          Dolly actually drops to his knees in abject relief. Greenly laughs
          and plants a kiss on Eunice's cheek. Doc pours shots. Eunice
          smiles as all her guys hug and make merry. DISSOLVE TO...

                    kind of a retard.

          
          They all laugh, cheers and drink. Conversations buzz all around.
          Eunice chats with the boys as she sips a cosmo.

          She hands the INTERpol file to the brothers.

          INT. GREENHOUSE -- LATER

          Crew Cut lies on the shop table. He's lost a lot of blood and is in
          shock. Using gardening utensils, the Old Man removes the bullet.
          We see his face for the first time. Unremarkable. In Italian...

          INT. BASEMENT -- NIGHT


          
          The Irish GUN DEALER (30's) from the first film leads the brothers
          and Romeo through a basement to a large, steel vault door.

          

                                                                       71.

                    quite the underground followin'.

          
          He swings the vault open. Romeo and the boys stand in angelic light
          at the gates of Heaven. Cheesy music as they enter...

          

          INT. VAULT -- CONTINUOUS


          
          Expanded indeed. Gleaming weapons everywhere. Sheer awe.
          Something catches Romeo's eye and he moves off. To boys...

          

                                GUN DEALER
                    Please, gentlemen. Preferred customers
                    select from my private reserve.

          
          He withdraws two Mahogany boxes.

          

                                GUN DEALER (CONT'D)
                    If I may make a suggestion.

          
          He lifts the lids. In each box is a pair of Desert Eagle .50 cal
          "Black Outs". The triangular barrels have been fitted with matching
          triangular silencers. The boys are mystified.

                    now.

          
          He pulls a few duffel bags.

          

                                GUN DEALER
                    Full accessory packages.      I'm sure
                    you'll find them useful.

          
          Romeo suddenly appears and slaps down a metal box.

          

                                ROMEO
                    I'll take these.

          
          The boys look to him.    He sniffles.   Red eyes.

          

                                                                       72.

                    Have you been crying again?

          
          Romeo snaps to him, eyes wide in challenge.

          

                                ROMEO
                    Yeah!  Tears of joy!
                              (to Dealer)
                    How much?

          

                                GUN DEALER
                    You guys are on the house.

                    Let's see.

          
          Romeo withdraws two gold plated .45's, intricately engraved, pearl
          handles with a Mexican flag. The boys snicker.

          

                                 ROMEO
                    What?

                    make me look gay?
          Romeo poses.    The Dealer shrugs.

          

                                GUN DEALER
                    You look like you might have seen one
                    up close.

          

          EXT. COMMON HOME -- MORNING


          
          This is a common home at the end of a cul de sac. The Old Man picks
          up the paper on his front stoop and shuts the door.

          
          He opens the paper with shock. A big picture of Crew Cut on the
          front, "SAINTS INNOCENT, NEW SUSPECT IN PRIEST'S MURDER" He reads
          frantically. "New evidence discovered at the crime scene..."

          

                                                                       73.

                    Evidence?

          
          He ambles into the house and to a...

          

          INT. BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS


          
          The Old Man moves to Crew Cut's bedside. He sees the rosary about
          the slumbering man's neck and rips it off. Crew Cut bolts awake!

          

                                OLD MAN
                    Foolish, arrogant boy!   What have you
                    done?!

          
          He whips Crew Cut with the rosary, until he cowers in the corner,
          weeping profuse apologies in Italian.

          

          INT. PANIC ROOM -- AFTERNOON


          
          Monitors show angles of the apartment outside. This small space is

          With this, the panic room door slides open and Concezio emerges
          holding a bag. He dumps a bunch of cell phones on the coffee table.

          At the hall's opposing end, two maintenance workers move toward.

          She turns and walks the marble floor which is like a runway, lined
          with pulverized statues. A long table of ravaged food extends.
          Crime scene personnel toil. Ritualized bodies everywhere.   Greenly
          is by the panic room. He pushes the "talk" button.

          barrels in with his G-MEN #1 - #3.

                    to take credit for all your hard work.

          
          He chuckles as all return to work.   Kuntsler turns to Eunice.

          Romeo looks through his wallet.

                             (shows him wallet pic)
                    Lovely wife and kids. How old are
                    they? Nevermind. Here's the
                    situation, Lloyd. Me and a couple of
                    friends of mine are fittin' to do some
                    killin' here tonight. I'm talking
                    bullets and blood, custom-wholesale
                    slaughter. You following me, Lloyd-O?
                             (Lloyd nods)
                    Good. Now, I've run into a little
                    snag. I need to figure out a tag line.
                    You know, something cool to say when
                    it's all over like..."I'll be back,"
                    but mine, y'know? I need to own this
                    one. I think this'll help me get
                    through the quote, unquote event. I'm
                    going to take your gag off and you and
                    me are going to riff a little, o'kay?
                    Let's have fun with this.

          
          Lloyd nods and Romeo rips off his gag.

                                LLOYD
                    I can't believe you! I'm a fucking
                    janitor. What do I know about bullets
                    and slaughter and shit?

          

                                ROMEO
                    Not riffing, Lloyd! Now, I need an
                    "Hasta La Vista" line, toute fucking

          SLO-MO: The brothers smash through the glass.    They fire as they
          swing over Eunice's head.

          
          SLO-MO: Eunice leaps onto the table as the boys cut their ropes in
          mid air with the Rambo knives. The brothers land on their knees.
          Their momentum carries them, sliding on either side of the table.

          
          SLO-MO: Eunice runs along the table top, crushing food and keeping
          pace with the boys as all three let the led out.

          
          SLO-MO:   The gangsters and button men return fire in chaos.

          
          SLO-MO: Gangsters are torn up as they are blown over furniture,
          into walls. Romeo blasts. Slow motion gun battle.

          
          SLO-MO: Yakavetta runs toward his panic room. At the last second,
          Jimmy the Gofer hip-checks him and dives in. The door slides shut.

          
          For a few moments the gun battle rages around Eunice who stands in
          the center rapid firing at the gangsters.

                     YEEEEEEE HAAAAAAAW!!!

          
          Soon it is over. The brothers slam Concezio to his knees and level
          to the back of his head. As he begs for his life...

          

                                 BOTH
                     And shepherds we shall be, for Thee, my

                     forth from Thy hand, that our feet may
                     swiftly carry out Thy command.

                     So, we shall flow a river forth to Thee
                     and teeming with souls shall it ever
                     be.

          
          Romeo watches in awe.

          

                                 BOTH (CONT'D)
                     In Nomine Patris, e Filii, e Spiritus
                     Sancti.

          
          Boom.   Concezio drops.   Romeo's been waiting, guns up and...

          

                                 ROMEO
                     "Who ordered the whup ass fajita!?"

          

                                  MURPHY
                     What?

                     Whup ass fajita?

          
          The brothers turn to each other.

          

                                 CONNOR AND MURPHY
                     That's fuckin' stupid.

          
          Eunice whistles in sympathy as she lifts her brim with a Colt.

          

                                 EUNICE
                     Hold up, now.

          
          Everything freezes in place.     Eunice shuffles over to Romeo.

          

                                 EUNICE (CONT'D)

          Romeo snaps his head toward the entry with inspiration in his eyes.
          QUICK CUT: He breaks down the door. QUICK CUT: The brothers shoot
          Yakavetta. QUICK CUT: Romeo, guns up and once more with feeling...

                     Ding dong, motherfucker, diiiing dong!

          
          The brothers look at Romeo, then to each other.

          

                                                                       87.

          WHIP PAN...

          

          INT. BACK TO PRESENT, LUXURY APARTMENT -- LATER


          
          Eunice stands before the panic room door.   She is totally
          disheveled. She swipes her hair back.

          

                                EUNICE
                    And that, gentlemen...is the sound of
                    the fat lady singin'.

          
          Everyone stands in shock, Kuntsler, his G-men, the detectives even
          crime scene workers. Greenly whispers to Duffy...

          

                                GREENLY
                    Should we...clap or something?

          

                                 DUFFY
                    Shut up.

          
          Suddenly, the panic room door slides open and Jimmy yanks Eunice
          inside. The door shuts. Everyone rushes toward.

          

                                 KUNTSLER
                    Hey!

          
          Duffy bangs on the door.

          

                                  DUFFY
                    Eunice!    Oh, shit!    Eunice!
          Greenly slams the talk button.

          

                                GREENLY
                    If you hurt her, you piece of shit, I

                    me? I'll kill you!

          
          Greenly wheels around, facing Kuntsler.

          

                                GREENLY (CONT'D)

          INT. PANIC ROOM -- CONTINUOUS


          
          Eunice has Jimmy pinned face down to the couch, arm twisted behind.

          

                                 JIMMY

                    Just lemme explain. I have
                    information, like pertinent
                    information. Ouch! Look, I was
                    listening to you out there and that's,
                    like, exactly what happened. That's
                    what made me think you were the person
                    to talk to.

          
          Eunice lets him go and stands.   Jimmy sits up.

          

                                EUNICE
                    Yakavetta had a partner, didn't he.

          
          Jimmy looks scared.

          

                                 JIMMY
                    Yeah.

                    for a second but I think I could ID
                    him. I don't know his name, though.
                    Concezio always called him the "Old
                    Man" accept one time when he called him
                    something else, like he fucked up and I
                    wasn't supposed ta hear it.

                    He called him...the Roman.

          

          EXT. LUXURY APARTMENT -- MOMENTS LATER


          
          Panic room door opens and Eunice emerges with Jimmy in tow.

          

                                                                       89.

          Jimmy is cuffed by two uniforms.

                    yourself. You're the professional.

          
          She walks out and the detectives follow.

          There are coroner vans and moderate police activity here as Eunice
          talks with the detectives who all seem perplexed.

          EXT. ALLEY ACROSS FROM PLAZA -- SAME TIME


          
          Crew Cut watches Eunice and the detectives from the dark alley.    He
          has shaved his head bald, giving him a sinister look.

          

                                                                        90.

          

          

          INT. MCGINTY'S -- LATER


          
          The place is empty except for Connor and Murphy having a celebratory
          shot at the bar and cleaning their weapons.

          

                                MURPHY
                    When's Romeo returnin' to the "hide

                                CONNOR
                    Soon as he's done apologizin' to his
                    uncle for wreckin' his restaurant.

          

                                MURPHY
                    And he should be sorry.   The
                    disrespect.

          
          They chuckle as a loud knocking is heard.   As Doc peeps through the
          spy hole and unchains the front doors...

          

                                DOC
                    Hold your damn horses!

          
          He lets Greenly in and locks it behind him. Greenly takes a few
          steps in, stops and grabs his crotch with both hands.

          

                                GREENLY
                    Sack-o-matic, I said!

          
          As the boys guffaw, BOOM! A shotgun blast through the door sends
          Greenly to the floor with a gaping wound in his back.

          
          Crew Cut bursts in with a smoking pig nose shotgun hanging from a
          shoulder strap. He pulls two Sigs and rapid fires at the brothers.

          
          The boys jump over the bar frantically try to reassemble their
          weapons. Connor and Murphy check their clips.

          

                                MURPHY
                    I got nothin'!

          
          Connor racks his .50 cal and looks in the chamber.

          

                                CONNOR
                    One in the hole.

          
          They see a shotgun behind the bar. Murphy grabs it.   Just as they
          are about to stand, they hear Doc cry out.

          

                               DOC
                    Boys!

          They stand and level. Crew Cut has Doc from behind, .9mm to his
          temple. Thick accent...

          

                                CREW CUT
                    Put dem down! Throw dem over!

          
          The boys do not flinch. Crew Cut pushes his gun into Doc's temple
          hard. He cries out in pain.

          

                                CREW CUT (CONT'D)
                    Throw dem over!

          
          The boys toss their guns over the bar. Crew Cut levels toward them,
          holding Doc in place. He whispers in Doc's ear.

          

                                CREW CUT (CONT'D)
                    Brothers, eh? Which one first?      This

                    Dee other, eh?

          
          He cocks back his hammer. A silence POP! rings out from the
          shadows. Crew Cut's hand is hit. He drops, crying out in pain.

          
          SLO-MO: Poppa M emerges from the shadows and moves to Crew Cut with
          a smoking, silenced Walther pistol in hand.

          
          The brothers have just a moment of shock before Greenly chokes up
          some blood. They jump the bar and rush to him.

          

                                MURPHY
                    Jesus Christ!

          

                                 CONNOR
                    Doc!   Call da fuckin' ambulance!
          As they hold Greenly and beg him to hold on, we move to Poppa M
          standing over Crew Cut. Crew Cut looks up at him in awe.

          

                                CREW CUT
                    You.

          

                                POPPA M
                    Where is the Old Man?

          

                                CREW CUT
                    Never.

          
          Poppa M pulls two .38 revolvers. He snaps the rotary chambers out,
          puts one bullet in each gun, spins the chambers and snaps them shut.
          He holds them out to Crew Cut. The boys weep, oblivious to this.

          

                                                                         92.

          

          

                                MURPHY
                    Just hold on.

          

                                CONNOR
                    Hang in there, brother.     They're
                    comin'.

          
          Greenly struggles to speak.

          

                                GREENLY
                    Naw, boys...it's over. Don't
                    worry...proudest day of my life.

          
          He seizes violently and dies. The brothers are in anguish. Crew
          Cut picks a .38 and stands. He and Poppa M level to each other's
          foreheads. Crew Cut is excited. Poppa M is calm, tranquil. The
          brothers bolt up in shock.

          

                                  BROTHERS
                    Da!

          

                                  POPPA M
                    Easy, boys.

          
          The boys watch in horror, trying to figure it out. Poppa M motions
          for his opponent to go first. Crew Cut cocks his hammer back with a
          "click." The brother's eyes go wide.

          

                                MURPHY
                    What the fuck's he doin'?

          
          Crew Cut pulls the trigger, "click!"

          

                                BROTHERS

                    JESUS CHRIST!
          Connor rushes over and grabs up the shotgun.

          

                                CONNOR
                    I'm gonna blow this mother fucker's
                    brains out, right now!

          
          He cocks it and levels to Crew Cut's head.

          

                                  POPPA M

                    CONNOR!

          
          Connor stops.   Poppa M holds out his free hand.   Halt.

          

                                POPPA M (CONT'D)
                    Son...Daddy's workin'.

          
          Connor lowers the gun.    Poppa M pulls back the hammer, "click."

          

                                                                           93.

          

          

                                 POPPA M (CONT'D)
                     Where is he?

          
          Crew Cut is unsure of himself. He thinks. Shakes his head.       The
          brothers focus on Poppa M's gun as he tenses on the trigger.

          

                                  CONNOR AND MURPHY

                                (WHISPER)
                     Come on.

          
          Crew Cut clenches up, bracing for impact. Poppa M pulls, "click."
          The brothers drop to their knees and pray hard. Crew Cut recovers.
          He smiles, pulls back the hammer. In Italian...

          

                                 CREW CUT
                     Make me famous.

          
          "Click!"   Crew Cut's eyes widen in fear.

          

                                  POPPA M
                                (pulling back hammer)
                     Where?

          
          The brothers pray faster as Crew Cut thinks in horror.

          

                                   CREW CUT

                     FUCK YOU!!!

          
          BOOM!   Crew Cut falls dead.

          

          INT. UNCLE CESAR'S HOUSE, KITCHEN -- LATER


          
          The boys sit at the kitchen table with Poppa M.      Romeo is propped up
          on a counter, nearby. Cesar sets out coffee.

          

                                 POPPA M
                     I'm so sorry, boys.      This is all my
                     fault.

          
          Cesar takes Romeo and leaves, giving them some privacy.

          

                                 MURPHY
                     What are ya talkin' about, Da?

          
          Poppa M strokes the faded "butterfly" tattoo on the back of his
          hand. Presently...

          

                                 POPPA M
                     I was an immigrant to the U.S. in 1958.
                     I was sixteen. I came to New York
                     where my father, Jacob MacManus, was a
                     cobbler.

                                 (MORE)

          

                                                                       94.

                                POPPA M (CONT'D)
                    Had a little shop and I was to learn
                    the family business. Mafia was
                    everywhere in those days.

          

          INT. FLASHBACK, COBBLER SHOP -- DAY


          
          Italian THUGS #1-4 talk to JACOB MacManus (43yrs). In these
          flashbacks we will refer to young Poppa M as "Noah." NOAH (16)
          works in back but watches.

          

                                POPPA M V.O.
                    Simple extortion...protection money.
                    But your grandfather was proud.

          

                                JACOB
                    I can't help ya with dat, lads. Ya got
                    problems with your shoes, I'd be happy
                    to have a look, got fair prices.

          

                                POPPA M V.O.
                    I just...watched.

          
          Noah stands shaking as he watches his father beat to death. We fade
          into later as he holds his father's body, wailing. An Italian kid
          with a leg brace, LOUIE (18yrs), staggers in and hobbles to Noah.

          

                                LOUIE
                    Il ochio de dio! We gotta call the
                    polizia, Noah! We gotta call somebody!

          

          EXT. FUNERAL -- MORNING


          
          Noah, Louie and a priest are the only ones present at this modest
          affair. Louie weeps. Noah is emotionless.

          

                                POPPA M V.O.
                    I buried my father, then I buried the
                    men who killed him. Louie, my best
                    friend, helped me...

          

          INT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT


          
          Noah holds a knife to Thug #1's throat at a card table. He has THUG
          #2's head pinned to the table top with a .38 cal. Nearby, Louie
          holds a large .44 magnum with shaking hands. Seated Thugs #3 and #4
          hands raised, are scared as they look at Noah's dead eyes.

          

                                THUG #3
                    Come on, kid. It was an accident.
                    We can work dis out. Whatever you want.

          

                                                                         95.

          

          

                                THUG #4
                    He ain't gonna do shit.
                             (to Thug #3)
                    I'll take two.

          

                                THUG #3
                    What da fuck's da matter with you?
                    Can't you see...

          

                                THUG #4
                    I see just fine. Deal.

          

                                THUG #1
                             (in Italian, to Louie)
                    You're Italian, kid. Help us out here.
                    Put one in the back of his head and you
                    get anything you want!

          

                                LOUIE
                    I, I, I...am his friend.

          

                                THUG #4
                    Fuck him and fuck his friend. Deal the
                    cards! He ain't got the balls.

          
          Noah shoots Thug #2 then cuts Thug #1's throat. The other Mafiosi
          scream in horror. Louie kneels and weeps. Noah shoots Thug #3 in
          the heart and calmly takes aim at Thug #4. He shoots him in the
          throat and he is blown to the floor, grasping his bleeding neck.

          
          Noah rounds the table and takes aim. The man is choking on his own
          blood. Noah slowly lowers his gun and just watches.

          

          INT. COBBLER SHOP -- AFTERNOON


          
          Louie works on a pair of shoes.   They are both a bit older.

                                POPPA M V.O.
                    It started out slowly. Just the ones
                    who were a threat to us.

          
          MAFIOSO #1 and #2 talk to the stoic Noah.

          

                                MAFIOSO #1
                    Come on, kid. It's good for you, good
                    for us. We'll move it right out the
                    back of the place.

          

                                MAFIOSO #2
                    It'll never touch you. You got the
                    word of the Bonnavese family on that.

          
          No response from Noah.   Dead eyes.

          

                                                                           96.

          

          

                                MAFIOSO #1
                    What's da matter with you, eh?

          
          We see Louie peeking through the curtains.

          

                                LOUIE

                             (WHISPERING)
                    Easy, Noah...easy friend.

          

                                MAFIOSO #2
                    What are you, stupid or something?

          
          He smacks Noah across the face.

          

                                                          CUT TO:

          

          EXT. WOODS -- NIGHT


          
          Noah and Louie bury the bodies of Mafioso #1 and #2.      Louie stops
          and rests. He watches Noah and thinks.

          

          INT. COBBLER SHOP -- DAY


          
          "CLOSED" sign in the door.   Noah and Louie eat sandwiches.

          

                                POPPA M
                    Then one day...

          

                                LOUIE
                    Why should we not help others who
                    suffer these Mafia thugs?

          
          Noah puts down his sandwich. Louie talks to Noah with passion,
          m.o.s. and he listens while nodding his head.

          

                                POPPA M V.O.
                    Then it began.

          
          Over dialogue and music we see the following images...

          
          Noah cuts out a chalk sketch on a large sheet of shoe leather.

          
          Louie helps Noah make a "serious looking" leather vest.

          
          Louie hobbles in with a sack.   He dumps a bevy of handguns on a
          table. All different makes.

          

                                POPPA M V.O. (CONT'D)
                    Louie would pick the marks and plan
                    everything in detail.

          
          Louie draws a map on a note pad and speaks m.o.s.

          

                                                                       97.

          

          
          Holsters and bullet belts are sewn into the vest.

          
          Noah loads the vest with guns as Louie tightens the buckles, stands
          back and looks Noah over. Ominous.

          

                                POPPA M V.O. (CONT'D)
                    And I would go in and do the jobs.

          
          A mob boss and two body guards wait for an elevator. The doors
          open. Insides is Noah, dark jacket, English Mac (hat). He opens
          his coat, revealing the vest. He draws two weapons, executes them
          all and calmly hits a button. The doors close.

          

                                POPPA M V.O. (CONT'D)
                    I would execute, over and over again,
                    those who had taken my father from me.

          
          We do a montage of Noah killing Mafiosi in many different ways.

          

                                POPPA M V.O. (CONT'D)
                    So it went for years.

          

          EXT. BACK TO PRESENT, KITCHEN -- LATER


          
          We pan to the gaping mouthed brothers.

          

                                  MURPHY

                                POPPA M
                    Back in '75, I did a hit, came out and
                    the police were waitin' for me. He set
                    me up, 25 to life.

                                MURPHY
                    Wait...why did he set you up?

          

                                POPPA M
                    Can't wait ta ask him.

          

                                CONNOR
                    Why didn't ya flip on him? Cut down
                    yer time? The guy fucked ya.

          

                                  POPPA M
                    I couldn't.

          

                                CONNOR
                    Why the hell not?

          Connor and Murphy hang their heads.      Connor looks up.

          

                                  CONNOR
                      Do you know Louie's full name?

          Greenly's bagged body is about to be loaded into an ambulance.
          Eunice stops the EMTs, unzips it and touches his face. She weeps
          and then crushes into Dolly's chest.

          
          He holds her and cries too as Duffy watches in anguish. Eunice's
          cell rings. She ignores it and Dolly pulls it from her pocket and
          tosses it to Duffy, never letting go of Eunice.

          

                                  DUFFY

          INT. POLICE STATION -- LATER


          
          Eyes still red from crying, Eunice covertly works at a computer.
          She types. Soon a picture of the Roman comes on up. Eunice looks
          at his face with trepidation and then...

          We drift by a poker game and young Italian thugs, betting horses and
          sports. T.V.s and smoke are abundant.

          
          The phone is set on a back table. PATRONAZZI (75yrs), an ancient
          Italian man drinking espresso picks up.

          

                                  PATRONAZZI
                    Si.

                                  PATRONAZZI
                    Many years.    Are you in need?

          

                                OLD MAN
                    Yes. I am making marinara and alas, I
                    have run out of tomatoes. To help an
                    old friend...how many can you spare?

          
          Patronazzi looks up.    Slowly, many of the young thugs turn.

          

                                PATRONAZZI
                    I am in good supply of tomatoes.

          The boys slumber. We push in on their staggered profiles.       They
          simultaneously take a deep breath. FLASH TO WHITE...

          

          INT. DREAM SEQUENCE, FENWAY PARK -- DAY


          
          The boys stand in a huge cement access corridor of Fenway Park.        It
          is empty and quiet as a church. A man walks toward them. They
          struggle to see. Presently, we reveal ROCCO. He passes them.

          

                                   ROCCO
                    Come on.     The game's starting.

          
          The brothers follow him.    Red Sox emblems are abundant.

          

                                ROCCO (CONT'D)
                    Funny thing about the Red Sox. We
                    never gave up hope, y'know? It's what
                    kept us going all those years. And
                    they did it. They finally fuckin' did
                    it. What are we all gonna do now, huh?

          
          They emerge into the stands.    Perfect baseball field, empty park.

          

                                                                       100.

          

          

                                ROCCO (CONT'D)
                    I lost a lot of money on 'em. But I
                    gotta admit. Always felt
                    better...betting the underdogs.

          
          Rocco walks on.   The boys follow.

          

          EXT. BASEBALL DIAMOND -- MOMENTS LATER


          
          The boys stand on the mound.   Rocco walks a circle around it.

          

                                ROCCO
                    So, how's things going?

          
          The boys drop their heads.

          

                                ROCCO (CONT'D)
                    Yeah. I know. It's rough having your
                    faith shaken.

          
          The brothers have a pained expression.

          

                                ROCCO (CONT'D)
                    But it happens to all of us.

                             (BEAT)
                    You know what's always tripped me out?
                    How hundreds of years ago, a bunch of
                    desperate gamblers in leaky ass ships,
                    crossed the ocean blue. They had no
                    clue what was on the other side of it.
                    Took real balls. But they sailed into
                    infinity and made it all the way to the
                    shores of the New fucking World...
                             (re: surroundings)
                    ...and all they had was their faith.
                    I'm always surprised how so many people
                    miss the simple fact that faith...is
                    the reason all of us are even here.
                    You can't underestimate the power of
                    it. Shit, you were the ones that
                    taught me that.

          
          Rocco looks to his left and right.   Secretly.

          

                                ROCCO (CONT'D)
                    Listen, your my boys so I'm gonna give
                    you some inside. The Sox are gonna do
                    it again this year. The line in Vegas
                    is huge. Put everything you got on it.

          
          The boys look to each other.   Eyes wide.

          

                                                                       101.

                    You're sure, Roc? You know this?

          
          Rocco smiles.

          

                                  ROCCO
                    No...I   just have faith. And for a
                    second   there, you almost did too.
                    Y'see,   it's contagious. And if enough
                    people   catch it...look out, baby.

          
          A roaring cheer arises, shaking the very foundations of the arena.
          The boys turn in awe. The stands are still empty.

          Poppa M, the brothers and Romeo walk kneel at the altar before a
          memorial to McKinney: Candles, pictures, cards, flowers etc.

          
          As they pray, a dozen or so church patrons who are in the pews begin
          to realize who they are. Our foursome stands and walks back down
          the aisle. They make eye contact with a few people.

          
          When the Saints are gone, the churchgoers gather in the aisle and
          stare at the front door in disbelief. Excited whisperings. One guy
          opens his cell phone. Then he thinks...and closes it.

          The Roman's common, two story home looms in the b.g. at the end of a
          cul-de-sac. Walking down the middle of the street, is Poppa M:
          black trench, hat, dark shades. He opens the door and enters the...

          

          INT. COMMON HOME -- CONTINUOUS


          
          Poppa M listens, far off scratchy music. He moves quietly through
          the house, stopping at the foot of the stairs...listens. He removes
          his rosary, hangs it on the banister and moves on, pulling a weapon.

          

          INT. GREENHOUSE -- SAME TIME


          
          The Roman, swirls a tomato in a plate of salt and bites into it.
          Beside him, a horned phonograph plays 40's Jazz. Behind him, we see
          that the greenhouse is merely an extension of the home.

          
          The Roman sits in front of a sunken fire pit at a low flame. Across
          the pit, an empty chair. Extended before him is a stunning garden,
          standing in stark contrast to the common house: vines, flowers,
          cobblestone walks, fountains. The center piece is a Turkish pool
          with pure white Lillys afloat.
          Poppa M slowly approaches the Roman from behind. He holsters his
          weapon and sits. The Roman halts the phonograph.

          The Roman smiles and gestures the surroundings.

                    are a destroyer, Noah.

          

                                POPPA M
                    You know my reasons.   You know why I

                    Then explain this.

          
          The Roman flicks a photo over. It lands in Poppa M's lap.    It is
          the picture we saw earlier. A woman holding two babies.

                    follow in the footsteps of their
                    father. They have inherited your
                    blood, Noah...your anger.

          
          Poppa M looks at the photo deeply.

          Poppa "M" stands, throwing open his trench and revealing his leather
          vest, a six gun rig in the front. The Roman in awe.

          
          The double doors crash in and men barrel through as Poppa M turns,
          pulls two weapons and fires upon them, hitting one.

          
          The boys crash through the glass ceiling of the greenhouse on either
          side of Poppa M. They fire as they fall, hit the ground and roll.

          
          Romeo bursts into the fray from inside the house, blasting away with
          his gold .45's, a shotgun hanging on his back.

          
          The garden is being torn apart as the brothers, Poppa M and Romeo
          hit their marks and the hit squad returns fire. The boys dive
          behind fountains which are then pulverized.

          
          The gun battle rages around the Roman who remains seated in the very
          mouth of madness. His heart breaks as his sanctuary is shredded.

          
          Romeo fires as a large rack of wine behind him is torn apart.

          
          Murphy fires over a statue and bodies crash into the pool.

          
          Connor stands, firing in a Jesus Christ pose.

          
          Poppa M drops his empty weapons and pulls two more, laying down a
          second barrage.

          
          Romeo is simultaneously hit in the leg and shoulder. He falls,
          dropping his .45s. He struggles to fire the shotgun.

          
          Poppa M takes one in the chest.

          
          Connor is wounded in the shoulder but continues firing.

          
          Murphy is hit in the leg but continues firing.
          The boys and Romeo manage to take out the last of the Thugs, who are
          blasted into the Turkish pool. It is over. The music fades...

          They get him to his feet. Poppa M turns to the Roman. He levels a
          revolver toward the seated man. With his last bit of strength...

          

                                 POPPA M (CONT'D)
                     I'll see you in a minute, Louie.

          
          Poppa M fires one right between the Roman's eyes.    Poppa M crumbles.
          His sons lay him down.

          

                                 CONNOR
                     Oh, no, no, no.

          
          Poppa M smiles as he looks up at the sun through the blown out glass
          ceiling. A plume of butterflies escape.

          

                                 POPPA M
                     It's a beautiful day.

                     Aye.    It is...it is, Da.

          
          He dies. The brothers weep. Nearby, Romeo is slumped and bleeding,
          on the edge of consciousness. A strange calm comes over the
          brothers as they stand and look to one another.

          
          S.W.A.T. can be heard surrounding the perimeter. The boys look to
          Romeo. He smiles at them and nods. The brothers turn and walk into
          the house. The echoed voice of Poppa M.

                       It doesn't change anything. What they
                       did is still more important. It's
                       still the issue.

          Connor and Murphy's faces split with evil grins.   They mimic guns at
          the cons and gesture as if shooting them.

                                   Shooting Script:  White August 28, 1997

                

               INT.  GOTHIC CHURCH  10:00 A.M.  ST. PATRICK'S DAY

               DOWNTOWN BOSTON

               As we open we see the inside of an enormous church. A young 
               looking PRIEST in his mid-thirties is finishing the delivery 
               of the Lords Prayer. In the back of the church, in the last 
               pew, there are two who kneel on the cold, stone floor.

               They do not stand to sing, nor do they offer signs of peace 
               when told, but they pray. They grip and rub their rosaries. 
               They mutter their words in Latin.

               CONNOR and MURPHY MacMANUS (mid-twenties) are shrouded in 
               thick waist length navy P-coats, worn leather boots and the 
               hungry clothes of the poor. The boys heads are shaved and 
               they have facial hair.

                                     MONSIGNOR
                              (dismissing young 
                              priest)
                         Thank you Father Macklepenny, for 
                         coming all the way across town to be 
                         our guest speaker today. I hope you 
                         found our little parish to your 
                         liking.

               Macklepenny takes his seat on the alter along side the regular 
               priests of the church. The MacManus brothers suddenly stand, 
               as all others remain seated. Each church goer between them 
               and the aisle shifts his/her position to allow the boys 
               passage, as if on command. The two turn and begin to stride 
               for the alter, eyes down, determined.

                                     ANNABELLE MACMANUS (V.O.)
                              (thick Irish accent)
                         They've never been like anyone else. 
                         From the moment they were born, of 
                         the same womb, on the same day, they 
                         just had their own way, my boys did. 
                         And I always knew that one day they 
                         would do something of true greatness. 
                         I just never expected they would 
                         bring about such a... such a 
                         reckoning.

               The MacManus brothers are fraternal twins. As Annabelle 
               MacManus speaks, Macklepenny is taken aback as he scans the 
               congregation amazed to find that he is the only one who thinks 
               this out of the ordinary.

               The monsignor begins his sermon. Macklepenny rises to stop 
               the boys from this disgraceful disturbance.

               The elder clergyman finds Macklepenny's arm, keeping him 
               seated while shaking his head. Macklepenny's confusion gives 
               way to awe as he watches the brothers step onto the altar, 
               brush by the six seated priests, and approach the enormous 
               crucifix.

               They both fall to their knees and kiss the feet of Christ. 
               They rise and as abruptly as they came, they turn and head 
               back down the aisle for the front door. They stop at the 
               rear of the church, turning to listen to the sermon.

                                     MONSIGNOR
                              (loud, authoritative)
                         ...and I am reminded of this holy 
                         day of the sad story of Kitty 
                         Geneviese. This poor soul cried out 
                         time and time again for help but no 
                         person answered her calls. Though 
                         many saw, not one so much as called. 
                         Her assailant wiped the bloody knife 
                         off on her lifeless little body. 
                         They watched as he simply walked 
                         away. Nobody wanted to get involved. 
                         Nobody wanted to take a stand... We 
                         must fear evil men and deal with 
                         them accordingly but what we must 
                         truly guard against, what we must 
                         fear most
                              (beat)
                         Is the indifference of good men.

               The MacManuses turn and walk out the door.

               EXT. CHURCH STEPS  SUNNY MORNING

               The boys put on their dark glasses and pause at the top of 
               the steps to light up their cigarettes. They both roll their 
               cigarette butts along their tongues and screw them into their 
               lips. In this unique way they light up, seemingly oblivious 
               to their synchronicity and mimic.

                                     CONNOR
                              (Irish accent)
                         I do believe the Monsignor finally 
                         got a point.

                                     MURPHY
                              (Irish accent)
                         Aye.

               They leave.

               INT. NOLAND'S MEAT PACKING PLANT  4:00 P.M.  SAME DAY

               Murphy, wearing a white blood soaked smock and apron stands 
               around the corner of the entrance to the loading dock. He 
               grips a gigantic, bloody slab of meat and smirks. Connor 
               flips his cigarette out the loading dock and passes his 
               brother's hiding place. He notices the workers have stopped, 
               and are looking at him.

                                     CONNOR
                         What?

               Murphy slaps Connor square in the face with the bloody slab.

               Connor's face is caked with blood as he stands stunned. He 
               then leaps on Murphy, sending him into a pile of nearby 
               hamburger. He grabs a large cow tongue from a nearby heap 
               and begins slapping Murphy in the face with it as they both 
               laugh and the workers cheer.

               Their boss, McGERKIN approaches with a very large woman.

               Her head is clean-shaven. The two are still laughing, out of 
               breath, they turn.

                                     MCGERKIN
                         Boys this is Rose, Baum, Gurtle... 
                         Gurtle.

                                     ROZ
                         Rozengurtle Baumgartner.

                                     MCGERKIN
                         You'll be training her today, and do 
                         a good job.

                                     BOTH BOYS
                         Aye.

                                     CONNOR
                              (wipes hand and extends 
                              it)
                         Pleased ta meet ya Rozie.

               She points to a tattoo on her neck that reads untouched by 
               man.

                                     ROZ
                         I prefer to be called Rozengurtle by 
                         men.

                                     CONNOR
                              (taken aback)
                         Okay then... let's get ya started.

               Connor exits with Roz.

                                     MURPHY
                         Christ, that's the largest woman 
                         I've ever seen.

                                     MCGERKIN
                         It's self-imposed affirmative action. 
                         If we hire big, fat, angry lesbians, 
                         then the leftist groups representing 
                         big, fat angry lesbians, won't think 
                         we're violating their rights.

                                     MURPHY
                         Well, how politically correct you 
                         are. That's good stuff.

                                     MCGERKIN
                         Hey, those people can shut ya down. 
                         They'll sue you into the ground 
                         claiming they were put under mental 
                         duress, inner pain. and sufferin'.

                                     MURPHY
                         Well, as long as we're hirin' fat 
                         lesbians, give your ma a call.

               Murphy laughs as he jogs away.

                                     MCGERKIN
                         Fuck you Murphy.

               INT. NOLAND'S MEAT PACKING PLANT  CUT STATION  SAME DAY

               Rozengurtle and Connor stand in front of a bunch of co-workers 
               who are cutting meat as it goes by on assembly.

                                     CONNOR
                         Okay, just cut off as much fat as 
                         you can as it goes by and the rule 
                         of thumb here is...

                                     ROZ
                         Rule of thumb?

                                     CONNOR
                              (questioningly)
                         Yeah?

                                     ROZ
                         Do you know where that term comes 
                         from? In the early 1900's it was 
                         legal for men to beat their wives as 
                         long as they used a stick no wider 
                         than their thumb.

               Connor holds up his thumb and stares at it.

                                     CONNOR
                         Can't do much damage with that. 
                         Perhaps, it shoulda been the rule of 
                         wrist. Ha!
                              (he elbows her)
                         Rule of wrist.

               She returns an icy stare. He hands her the knife. The co-
               workers all seem wary of Roz.

               Murphy stands on one side of Roz, Connor on the other, 
               surrounded by a tight group of workers. Everyone is within 
               ear shot of one another, cutting meat as it goes by. Knowing 
               glances are shared by everyone. It is an uncomfortable mood.

                                     CONNOR
                         Hey Murphy?

                                     MURPHY
                         Aye.

                                     CONNOR
                              (slight smirk)
                         How many feminists does it take to 
                         screw in a light bulb?

                                     MURPHY
                         How many?

                                     CONNOR
                         Two. One ta screw it in and one ta 
                         suck my cock.

               Everyone burst out laughing. Rozengurtle jabs a knife in a 
               piece of meat and turns to Connor. She pushes him and starts 
               walking toward him. He starts backing up, laughing.

                                     ROZ
                              (angry)
                         I knew you two pricks would give me 
                         problems. Give me shit cause I'm a 
                         woman. I'm not gonna take your male 
                         dominance bullshit!

                                     CONNOR
                              (trying to calm her, 
                              but still chuckling)

                         Oh, come on now Rozengurtle. I was 
                         just tryin' ta get a rise outta ya.

                                     MURPHY
                         Yeah. Just tryin' ta break the ice 
                         is all.

                                     ROZ
                              (to Murphy)
                         Fuck you...
                              (to Connor)
                         ...and fuck you!

                                     MURPHY
                         Oh, come on its St. Patty's Day. 
                         It's all in good fun.

               Employees gather around all the excitement.

                                     ROZ (V.O.)
                         Baumgartner sound Irish to you, fuck 
                         face?

                                     CONNOR
                         Now look Rozengurtle, we're sorry. 
                         Just relax.

               She reaches back and punches Connor full force in the face.

               He takes the hit very well. He stops backing up.

                                     CONNOR
                         Why don't you save all your aggression 
                         for protests and marches and what 
                         not.

               She suddenly drives her boot into his crotch, sending him to 
               the floor reeling with pain. Two female co-workers leap to 
               his aid.

                                     ROZ
                         You fuckin' slaves. Kowtowing to the 
                         needs of men! Get up! Get the fuck 
                         up! Leave him there.

               Rozengurtle begins to turn, raising her fist to Murphy.

               Murphy winds up and punches her square in the face. She lands 
               on her back. The on-lookers are stunned as he walks over and 
               stands above her.

                                     MURPHY
                         Guess you'll have ta change that 
                         tattoo now, won't ya Rozie!?

               INT. HALLWAY  MACMANUS' TENEMENT APT  BUILDING  DAY

               The brothers get to the top of the stairs. Connor is hunched 
               over and moving slowly. Murphy giggles.

                                     CONNOR
                         Fuck you.

               Connor flicks his cigarette butt out the large open loading 
               doors at the end of the hall. The red brick buildings stretch 
               down the alley both ways. The glowing butt falls to a filthy 
               resting place, directly next to a dented green dumpster with 
               half the paint job scraped off.

               INT. CONNOR AND MURPHY'S APARTMENT  EARLY EVENING

               This is a decrepit, illegal loft. The boys enter, hang their 
               rosaries by the door and begin taking off their clothes.

               Connor sits naked on the couch and gently places a bag of 
               ice on his crotch. Murphy stands naked in the open quantity 
               shower. Murphy turns on the water and sticks his hand in the 
               stream.

               INT. CONNOR AND MURPHY'S APT  EARLY EVENING

               Connor, still seated, cracks open a Guinness and sips it 
               lovingly. The phone rings.

                                     CONNOR
                         Hello.

                                     MOM (V.O.)
                         Connor, is that you?

               Something is obviously wrong in her voice.

                                     CONNOR
                              (interested)
                         Mother, is that you?

                                     MOM (V.O.)
                         Is that worthless brother of your 
                         there? I want you both ta hear this.

                                     CONNOR
                         Ma, what's wrong?

               Murphy shuts off the water.

                                     MURPHY
                         No fuckin' hot water man. That...

                                     CONNOR
                         Shut it. It's Ma.

               Murphy sees the concern in Connor's eyes and takes a step 
               closer.

                                     MOM (V.O.)
                         It's all your fault. Both you little 
                         bastards. I was a fool to believe 
                         you would bring me any peace. The 
                         day your Da left us when you were 
                         almost too young to remember, he 
                         said the two of you would do me right 
                         and make me proud, but he was wrong 
                         and I got nothin' ta live for.

                                     CONNOR
                         Mother, what are you sayin'? You're 
                         talkin' crazy here.

               Murphy is drawing closer with concern.

                                     MURPHY
                         What's the matter with her?

               INT. ANNABELLE MACMANUS' HOUSE  IRELAND  NIGHT

               A wrinkly female hand grabs a large revolver resting next to 
               a half empty bottle of Hennessey.

                                     MOM
                         I finally found your Da's army 
                         revolver, Connor.

               INT. CONNOR AND MURPHY'S APT  EARLY EVENING

                                     CONNOR
                         What the hell are you doin' with 
                         Da's gun!?

                                     MURPHY
                              (widening eyes)
                         What the...?

                                     MOM (V.O.)
                         I got it ta my head now.
                         I got it ta my head now.

                                     CONNOR
                         What?! What are you doin'?

                                     MOM (V.O.)
                         I want ta tell ya one last thing 
                         before I pull the trigger.

                                     CONNOR
                              (screaming)
                         Pull the trigger?! Have ya lost it 
                         woman?! Now just calm down here.

                                     MURPHY
                              (eyes widen)
                         Oh my god!

                                     MOM (V.O.)
                         I...

                                     CONNOR
                         No ma! No!

                                     MOM (V.O.)
                         BLAME...

                                     CONNOR & MURPHY
                         Oh Jesus, No! No! Oh God! No Ma!

                                     MOM (V.O.)
                         YOU...!

               Connor and Murphy are both screaming in panic.

               EXT. ANNABELLE MACMANUS' BACK STOOP  NIGHT

               Mom stands on the back stoop holding the door ajar with her 
               hip. She holds the phone receiver up in her left hand and 
               the gun directly next to it, in her right. She squeezes off 
               a loud shot toward the heavens.

               INT. CONNOR AND MURPHY'S APT  EARLY EVENING

               As soon as the deafening sound pierces through the receiver, 
               Connor instinctively jumps up to a standing position. The 
               bag of ice bursts as it hits the floor and spreads across 
               it. He throws the receiver and covers his ears with both 
               hands.

               The phone then falls to the ground, skipping through the 
               cubes as the boys dive for it screaming. The two naked, 
               hysterical boys fumble for the phone, flailing on their 
               stomachs in the field of ice. They finally catch it and both 
               put their ears to the receiver in panic. As they scream MA 
               intermittently, the pauses get longer and longer.

               INT. ANNABELLE MACMANUS' APARTMENT  NIGHT

               Mom's got her hand covering her mouth, face red from holding 
               back laughter, as she walks back into the house. She can 
               take it no longer and she bursts out with hearty guffaws.

               INT. CONNOR AND MURPHY'S APARTMENT  EARLY EVENING

               The boys are relieved, but angry.

                                     CONNOR
                              (grabs his balls, 
                              rolls over)
                         Aaaww, shit!... evil woman!

                                     MURPHY
                         Lord have mercy. That was a good one 
                         ma.

                                     MOM (V.O.)
                         Oh, Jesus! No ma! Christ ma! No!

               Murphy holds the receiver in the air. Mom's still laughing.

                                     MURPHY
                              (to Connor)
                         Oh, she's quite proud of herself.

                                     MOM
                         Okay, seriously, both you listen ta 
                         me now.

               They both put an ear to the phone.

                                     CONNOR
                         All right, we're both here.

               Mom pauses and cackles endlessly once again.

                                     MOM
                              (finally)
                         It's only 11:00 here boys so I got 
                         lot's more drinkin' ta do with your 
                         worthless relatives down at the Anvil.

                                     MURPHY
                         Just called ta torture us did ya?

                                     CONNOR
                         How's Uncle Sibeal?

                                     MOM
                         Well, you know how it is with him. 
                         Always complainin' he's never turnin' 
                         a profit on St. Patty's. Whole damn 
                         family goes down there with no money, 
                         cause we know he can't bear ta charge 
                         us.

               They all laugh.

                                     MOM
                         But he's been havin' himself a nip 
                         or two as well... Been up the 
                         waitress' skirt all night, poor girl.

                                     MURPHY
                         Well you tell him ta take it easy 
                         with that. He's gotta learn ta respect 
                         women the way Connor does.

                                     CONNOR
                         Oh, Jesus.

                                     MURPHY
                         I gave him his first lesson in 
                         sensitivity toward the fairer sex 
                         just today.

                                     CONNOR
                         Don't even do it, ya bastard.

                                     MURPHY
                              (laughs)
                         He got beat up by a girl. 

                                     CONNOR
                         If that was a girl I want ta see 
                         some papers. She had ta be just 
                         preoperative for Christ sakes.

                         Lord's name.

                              (genuflecting, 
                              impassionate)
                         Mother Mary, full of grace.

                                     MOM
                         What did you do, Connor?

                                     CONNOR
                         Well, we tried ta make friends and 
                         she gave me a shot ta the nuts.

                                     MOM
                              (aghast)
                         What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya 
                         trounced her a good one!

                                     CONNOR
                         Well, I didn't but...

                                     MURPHY
                              (shaking his fist)
                         Don't worry, I respected the hell 
                         out of her for ya, Ma.

               Mom laughs.

                                     MOM
                         Well listen, I know how my boys take 
                         ta scrappin' when they take ta 
                         drinkin'.

                                     BOTH
                              (semi-condescending)
                         Yes mother.

                                     MOM
                              (light-hearted anger)
                         I mean it now. I carried the two of 
                         you little bastards around in my 
                         belly at the same time you ungrateful 
                         pissants. Ya ruined my girlish figure 
                         in one fell swoop, and then ya sucked 
                         me dry.
                              (grabbing her breast)
                         My tits are saggin' down ta my ankles. 
                         I trip over em for Christ sakes, now 
                         ya listen ta me, NO FIGHTEN!

               The boys laugh.

                                     MOM
                         Promise me boys.

                                     MURPHY
                         We promise.

                                     CONNOR
                         Yeah, we promise.

                                     MOM
                         Well, there's my boys.
                              (pulls back curtain, 
                              looks out window)
                         Shit. I gotta go. Looks like I caused 
                         a ruckus with that shot. Half the 
                         damn neighborhood is comin'.

                                     MURPHY
                         All right, love ya ma. Listen, before 
                         ya go just give us the goods, eh?

                                     CONNOR
                         Yeah. It's been twenty-seven years.

                                     MOM
                         Still bickerin' over that, huh?

                                     CONNOR
                         Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came 
                         out first?

                                     MOM
                         All right, I suppose you have the 
                         right ta know.

               The boys stand shoulder to shoulder, naked. They peer into 
               the distance, ears to the phone, awaiting this most important 
               information.

                                     MOM
                         Are ya ready?

                                     BOTH
                         Aye.

               Slight pause as mom slams a shot of Hennessey.

                                     MOM
                              (yells)
                         The one with the biggest cock!

               Mom slams down the phone and lets out a throaty laugh. The 
               boys sign angrily. Connor walks over and hangs up the phone.

                                     CONNOR
                         Crazy woman.

               When he turns, he notices Murphy is fixated on his brothers 
               crotch. A triumphant smile spreads across his face.

                                     CONNOR
                         Don't start. I've had ice on mine.

               EXT. AN ALLEY  MORNING

               PAUL SMECKER, F.B.I. agent, is lead by the Boston Chief of 
               Police through a jungle of ravenous reporters, police lines 
               and uniformed officers. He is impeccably dressed in a deep 
               red suit. He is smiling, confident as he walks. He is a very 
               good-looking, slender man.

               He looks intently, for a moment, at four uniformed officers.

               They approach two dead bodies, laying next to a dented green 
               dumpster with half the paint job scraped off.

               One man, IVAN CHECKOV, lays on his stomach, closer to the 
               dumpster than the other. The ass of his pants has been burnt 
               out and a large cotton bandage is in its place.

               The other, VLADDY, has a blood soaked bandage around his 
               head and is on his stomach as well. There are hundreds of 
               pieces of porcelain of various sizes everywhere. Three plain-
               clothed homicide detectives, DUFFY, DOLLY and GREENLY hover 
               close to the bodies. Dolly and Duffy listen to GREENLY, an 
               obvious rookie, give his over-confident theory of what took 
               place.

               The chief is about to interrupt them, but Smecker holds him 
               back with a smile. The two wait and watch in a position, 
               where the unsuspecting detectives have their backs to them.

                                     GREENLY
                              (thick Boston accent)
                         ...so these guys are just kickin' 
                         the shit out of each other. This guy 
                              (points to Vladdy)
                         Picks up an old kitchen sink that 
                         some one threw out and crushes this 
                         guy 
                              (Checkov)
                         With it. All right, so it makes a 
                         big bang and alerts their friend, 
                         who's standin' look out around the 
                         corner. So he comes over and gets 
                         into it with this guy, 
                              (Vladdy)
                         He's angry at him, right? They get 
                         into an altercation in which the 
                         look out guy crushes this guy by 
                         jumpin on him. And look at the damage 
                         here.
                              (Vladdy)
                         I mean this guy's fuckin' hamburger 
                         man. His spine is crushed. He's all 
                         twisted and shit. That guy had to be 
                         one big mother fucker. Huge, 3-400 
                         pounds, fuckin huge.

               Smecker listens.

               The Chief is embarrassed.

                                     GREELY
                         Or, okay. Check this out. Say these 
                         two don't even know the huge guy. 
                         They're just staggerin' home from a 
                         bar this morning, still all fucked 
                         up from St. Patty's last night. So 
                         they figure they'll take a short cut 
                         down the alley and this big mother 
                         fucker, he's just waitin'. And what 
                         could be more perfect for strong arm 
                         robbery? Two drunk guys all bandaged 
                         up. They're already injured for Christ 
                         sakes. He takes a blunt object and 
                         whacks the guy with the bandage on 
                         his head, right? Cause he's smart. 
                         He knows the guy with the bandage on 
                         his ass, he ain't going nowhere. 
                         Matter of fact, this guy's probably 
                         helping his friend with the rectal 
                         problem along. They're limping around 
                         like a couple of decrepit old broads. 
                         So once this guy's out of the picture
                              (denotes Vladdy)
                         this poor asshole, he tries to run. 
                         But look how far he gets fore the 
                         huge bastard catches up with him. 
                         Only a few yards. And what does he 
                         do? He gets creative. He picks up a 
                         sink and crushes the poor mother-
                         fucker. Then, he ain't done yet. He 
                         comes over here, jumps on this guy's 
                         back and crushes him to death.
                              (Vladdy)
                         He steals their shit and beats it! 
                         Thanks for comin' out!
                              (beat)
                         And look at this print...

               Greenly points out a large foot print on Vladdy's back.

               Some detectives nod in agreement. Smecker chuckles as he 
               shakes his head.

                                     GREENLY
                         That's one big fuckin' shoe!... and 
                         think about it. Of all the ways to 
                         kill a guy, crushin' him to death. 
                         That's very particular. You don't 
                         get many of those. I dunno. I feel 
                         something big here. I wouldn't be 
                         surprised if we see more of these 
                         turning up.

                                     SMECKER
                              (stepping into the 
                              open)
                         Brilliant. So now we got a Huge guy 
                         theory and Serial crusher theory. 
                         Top fucking notch.
                              (to Greenly)
                         What's your name?

                                     GREENLY
                         Detective Greenly. Who the fuck are 
                         you?

               Smecker saunters up to Greely and pulls his I.D. out of the 
               breast pocket of his sport coat and lets it hang. The large, 
               light blue letters, F.B.I. can be easily seen.

                                     SMECKER
                         That's who the fuck I am.

               All the detectives seem disgruntled and look to the Chief 
               for an explanation.

                                     CHIEF
                         Listen, I gotta go by the numbers on 
                         this one. I.D. just came back on 
                         these guys. They've got connections 
                         to the Russian mob. That makes it a 
                         federal matter and Agent Smecker, 
                         here, is heading up the investigation 
                         with our full cooperation.

                                     SMECKER
                              (transfixed on Greely)
                         Why don't you get me a cup of coffee.

                                     GREENY
                         What the fuck?

                                     SMECKER
                         Café latte.

                                     GREENLY
                         Who the...

                                     SMECKER
                         Twist of lemon!

                                     GREENLY
                              (to Chief)
                         Chief, what the fuck is this?

                                     SMECKER
                         Sweet-n-low!

               Greenly looks helplessly to the Chief, who simply nods. He 
               storms off the scene, upset. Smecker turns his back on 
               everyone and puts earphones in. He reaches down and hits 
               play. The choir song "Agnus dei" overtakes. He begins to 
               investigate. He kneels at the bodies for a moment then stares 
               at the opposite brick wall. He picks up a piece of porcelain 
               and scrapes it with his thumb.

               He quickly cocks his head toward the sky and begins to chuckle 
               as he says Jesus Christ, under his breath. He brushes some 
               paraffin on each of the dead men's hands. Duffy and Dolly 
               watch defiantly. They start to smile at one another as they 
               collectively realize his homosexuality. He is slightly 
               effeminate buy not overly fey.

                              (loudly)
                         Mitchell, Langley!

               Two uniformed officers approach.

                                     MITCHELL
                         Yes sir.

                                     SMECKER
                         Find the manager of this building. 
                         See if he has had any complaints of 
                         water coming down in any apartments, 
                         starting just this morning. If he's 
                         not there, knock on every door 
                         starting from the third floor up. 
                         Langley, you take this building, 
                         same thing.

               Mitchell and Langley exit.

                         Chaffey, Newman.

               Two more uniforms approach.

                                     CHAFFEY
                         Yes sir.

                                     SMECKER
                              (to Chaffey)
                         Look in the trash around their hands. 
                         See if you can find me two bullet 
                         casings. 45's, if my eye serves me 
                         right. Don't disturb them. Mark them 
                         as they lay. Newman, root through 
                         this shit.
                              (points to the mountain 
                              of garbage)
                         If this was a sink find me some metal 
                         parts. Gimme a faucet or a drain 
                         cover or something.

               The two begin their tasks. Chaffey finds a casing near 
               Checkov's hand, hidden under the edge of the pile.

                                     CHAFFEY
                         Got it. It's a 45.

               The homicide detectives are surprised as Chaffey looks for 
               the second shell. Smecker lights up a smoke.

                                     SMECKER
                         Chief, could you get ballistics down 
                         here and tell them they have to dig 
                         a 45 slug out of a brick wall.

               He points to a bullet hole in the opposing and tattered wall.

                                     SMECKER
                         ...and locate another that's been 
                         fired through a dumpster.

               He points to another bullet hole at the dumpster's base.

                                     CHIEF
                         I got the best ballistics guy in the 
                         world. He's mobile. Got all his stuff 
                         right in the van. Can have him down 
                         here in 10 minutes.

                                     DOLLY
                         How did you know that?

                                     SMECKER
                         Paraffin came up positive. And bullet 
                         holes are usually a big clue.

                                     CHAFFEY
                         I can't find the second one, sir.

                                     SMECKER
                         Look under the body.

                                     CHAFFEY
                              (obeys)
                         Got it.

               Smecker turns to detectives with a smirk.

                                     SMECKER
                         You guy's ready for this?

               They both nod.

                                     SMECKER
                         This was no gangland assassination. 
                         Though creative, it was way too 
                         sloppy. Something went wrong here. 
                         This has personal written all over 
                         it. Now, these men were crushed and 
                         the first natural reaction the body 
                         has to such trauma is to tense up. 
                         So now the two shots fired here were 
                         reflex rounds. These guys weren't 
                         shooting at anything, but they were 
                         just about to.

               Mitchell returns.

                                     MITCHELL
                         Agent Smecker,
                              (pointing to MacManus 
                              building)
                         This is all illegal loft housing so 
                         there's no manager on the premises 
                         but I found a lady on the fourth 
                         floor said she's had water dripping 
                         down on her whole place. Started 
                         just this morning.

                                     SMECKER
                         Fourth floor huh? Then we're heading 
                         to the fifth. Let's go up and see 
                         just how right I am.

               INT. MACMANUS' APT. BUILDING  FIRST FLOOR  MORNING

               The detectives pile into the elevator, Smecker last. Greenly 
               has rejoined them. Smecker sips his latte.

                                     DUFFY
                         So what are you thinkin' here?

                                     SMECKER
                         Really want to know?

               All the detectives chant the affirmative. The doors close.

               INT. MACMANUS' APT. BUILDING  ELEVATOR  FIFTH FLOOR  MORNING

               As the doors open, all the detectives chorus their disbelief.

                                     GREENLY
                         No way. You know how big a guy's 
                         gotta be to do that? Fuckin' huge.

               Smecker turns to Greenly in disbelief.

                                     SMECKER
                              (beat)
                         Oooo. I might be wanting a bagel 
                         with my coffee.

               Smecker exits the elevator leaving the three silent detectives 
               with that thought.

                                     GREENLY
                              (to Dolly)
                         I ain't getting him no fuckin' bagel.

               The detectives exit the elevator.

               INT. MACMANUS' DOORWAY  INSIDE APT  LOOKING OUT TO HALL  
               MORNING

               Smecker appears first, glancing in momentarily. The detectives 
               pile in behind him. They survey the situation in total awe.

                                     SMECKER
                              (to Greenly)
                         We'll start the ass kissing with 
                         you.

               EXT. MACMANUS' APT. BUILDING  FRONT STEPS  MORNING

               Smecker saunters out, detectives on his heels.

                                     MITCHELL
                              (approaches Smecker)
                         Agent Smecker. I know this 
                         neighborhood pretty good. There's a 
                         bar called McGinty's down the block. 
                         It's a good bet they were there last 
                         night.

                         Good work, Mitchell. I'll check that 
                         out myself.

               Duffy starts walking down the street. A REPORTER is hot on 
               his heels.

                                     REPORTER
                         Hey, Duffy. What the fuck happened 
                         here? You owe me. This is the one I 
                         want.

                                     DUFFY
                         Let's go get a cup of coffee. You 
                         ain't gonna fuckin' believe this 
                         one.

               Smecker is standing on the front steps in front of uniformed 
               officers and homicide detectives.

                                     SMECKER
                         I want A.P.B.'s put out. I want more 
                         uniforms on the streets. One thing's 
                         for sure, wherever these guys are 
                         they're hurting.

               INT. EMERGENCY ROOM  DAY

               A potent song takes our ears as The MacManus brothers sit in 
               the E.R. They have already received care. Their faces are 
               beaten and there are bandages and dried blood in various 
               spots. Connor's injuries exceed Murphy's. They are both clad 
               in only their leather boots, boxer shorts and worn out old 
               bathrobes.

               Young kids wait for medical attention, as their knife wounds 
               bleed. Two nuns in the corner console a third, whose robes 
               are ripped and face is beaten. A woman toward the end of the 
               hall is so badly beaten she is unrecognizable.

               As the song builds to a more harrowing chorus, a man enters.

               His clothes suggest he's a pimp. He is not injured. He looks 
               around as he stands, perturbed, at the end of the hall.

               He reaches over and grabs the beat up woman by the hair and 
               begins to drag her out. She is kicking and screaming from 
               the floor, grabbing at his wrists as he hauls her away.

               (Slo-mo) The boys, instantly furious, stand and begin to go 
               toward the action, but Connor's legs give out on him and he 
               falls to the floor. Connor, still trying to go after the 
               pimp, crawls towards him. Murphy helps his brother to his 
               chair and hold him tight.

                                     MURPHY
                         Okay. Just calm down. Take it easy. 
                         He'll have his day. He'll have his
                              (turns)
                         FUCKIN' DAY!

               Music fades.

               INT  EMERGENCY ROOM  DAY  FEW MINUTES LATER

               An old Irishman enters the E.R. DOC (70 yrs.) has a serious 
               facial twitch and is prone to blinking uncontrollably. He 
               has a mild stutter. He also has Tourette's Syndrome and is 
               apt to yell his two chosen swear words every now and then, 
               first fuck! and after a slight pause, ass! He rushes up as 
               they stand to greet him. Murphy holds Connor up.

                                     MURPHY

                         J-Jesus. What the fuck happened? Are 
                         ya b-boys all right?

                         An F.B.I. agent came by the bar. He 
                         left me his c-c, he left me his c-c, 
                         he left me this.

               He hands them a card with Smecker's name on it. They survey 
               it with interest.

               Everyone in the E.R. looks at Doc in shock. Connor and Murphy 
               don't even avert their eyes from the card.

                                     DOC

                         We're going to turn ourselves in. It 
                         was self defense.

                         Don't know. He didn't say.

               The boys look puzzled. Murphy helps Connor down to his seat.

                                     MURPHY

               Doc exits, say one more "Fuck,...Ass", on the way out.

               INT. BOSTON POLICE STATION  PRECINCT OFFICE  DAY

               The station is abuzz with the story. Connor and Murphy's 
               names are on all tongues. A legend starts. Every available 
               officer is in the room along with the homicide detectives.

               Smecker walks right down the middle.

                                     SMECKER
                         First of all, I'd like to thank 
                         whichever one of you donut munching, 
                         barrel-assed dip-shits leaked this 
                         to the press. That's just what we 
                         need now, some sensational story in 
                         the papers making these guys out to 
                         be super heroes, triumphing over 
                         evil. And let me squash the rumors 
                         now. These two aren't heroes.
                              (rolls his eyes)
                         They are two ordinary men who were 
                         put in an extraordinary situation 
                         and they just happened to come out 
                         on top. Yes, nothing from our far 
                         reaching computer system has turned 
                         up jack shit on these two. All we 
                         know is what we found out from their 
                         neighbors. And the general consensus 
                         is that they're... angels.
                              (pause)
                         But angels don't kill and we got two 
                         bodies in the morgue that look like 
                         they've been...

               Smecker looks to Greenly. Dripping with sarcasm.

                                     SMECKER
                         ...serial crushed by a huge fuckin' 
                         guy.

               Some of the cops and homicide detectives laugh and chide 
               Greenly.

                                     CHAFFEY
                         Are these me considered armed and 
                         dangerous?

                                     SMECKER
                         Well, not armed. If they had guns, 
                         they'd have used them. But dangerous? 
                         Oh yeah.

                                     MITCHELL
                         What makes you think they're 
                         dangerous? They were just protecting 
                         each other.

               EXT. BOSTON POLICE STATION STEPS  DAY

               The two are limping up the precinct stairs. Connor is draped 
               over Murphy who helps his brother along, they are still 
               attired as in the E.R.

                         or the other. Just be careful and go 
                         by the protocol on this one.

                              (to Officer Mitchell)

                         Any word back from the E.R.s?

                         No help at all. Swamped from St. 
                         Patty's. Packed with drunk, bloody 
                         Irish.

                                     SMECKER
                         Just hit the bricks nice and hard.

               Grunt police work is going to bring this one in.

                                     GREENLY
                              (talking loudly)
                         These guys are miles away by now.

               The brothers quietly enter in the back of the room. All the 
               officers are seated with their backs to them. Smecker and 
               the brothers make eye contact. He knows who they are. They 
               don't interrupt Greenly.

                                     GREENLY
                         But if you want to beat your head 
                         against a wall, then here's what you 
                         look for. These guys are scared like 
                         two little bunny rabbits. Anything 
                         in a uniform or flashing blue lights 
                         will spook them. So the only thing 
                         we can do is put a potato on a string 
                         and drag it through South Boston.

               There is light chuckling from the police at this crack.

                                     MURPHY
                              (loud)
                         You'd probably have better luck with 
                         a beer.

               Everyone turns and looks.

               INT. INTERROGATION ROOM  BOSTON POLICE STATION  LATER

               The boys sit in two chairs at a plain table with a recording 
               device on it. They are very serious and alert. Mitchell enters 
               with coffee for them. He shakes their hands and says he really 
               respects what they did. Surprised, they thank him. Chaffey 
               enters with donuts and a repeat performance of respect. Slowly 
               officers start to gather around the interrogation room door.

               INT. INTERROGATION ROOM  BOSTON POLICE STATION  DAY LATER

               There are at least 20 officers and detectives packed in the 
               tiny room. The MacManus' visit with the excited cops. All 
               are in high spirits.

               The room is loud as Smecker walks in.

                                     SMECKER
                         What the fuck is this!? This isn't a 
                         fuckin' tea party. Get out! Only 
                         thing I want in here is them.

               They all file out. Smecker and the boys look each other over.

                                     SMECKER
                         This conversation is going to be 
                         recorded. Just answer to the best of 
                         your knowledge.

               Smecker reaches for the record button. Murphy puts out his 
               hand to stop him.

                                     MURPHY
                              (politely)
                         Excuse me, sir.

               Murphy turns to his brother and speaks in Latin, in hushed 
               tones. It is subtitled in English.

                                     MURPHY
                         "What do we tell him about the guns 
                         and money?"

                                     CONNOR
                         "We just got up and left. Bum musta 
                         rolled them before the police got 
                         there."

                                     MURPHY
                              (to Smecker)
                         Okay. We're ready.

               Smecker in intrigued with this tiny display. He hits the 
               record button.

                                     SMECKER
                         You guys are not under oath, here. I 
                         am assuming you knew these two guys 
                         from before, huh?

                                     CONNOR
                         We... met them last night.

                                     SMECKER
                         They had some pretty interesting 
                         bandages. Know anything about that?

               They look at each other.

               FLASHBACK. INT  MCGINTY'S PUB  NIGHT  ST. PATRICK'S DAY

               McGinty's's is packed to the walls with drunken Irish. A lot 
               of faces are recognizable from Noland's Meat. Connor is in 
               front of the bar. He and Doc are staring at each other as if 
               waiting for one man to give in. Connor has his arms across 
               the chests of Murphy and some friends, holding them in place. 
               They are interested in the competition.

               PRESENTLY...

                                     CONNOR
                              (presently, imitating 
                              Doc's voice)
                         Would someone please come over here 
                         and...

                                     DOC

                         me up the...

                                     DOC
                         Ass!

               Everyone falls down laughing. Doc is angry and starts throwing 
               ice at them. DAVID DELLA ROCCO makes his way through the 
               crowd. Rocco is thirty-two years old. He has shoulder-length, 
               dark hair and a full beard and mustache that wrap around his 
               big smile. He charges up to the bar and yells to Doc.

                                     ROCCO
                         Hey! Fuck! Ass! Get me a beer!

               This sends everyone even further into laughter. Doc throws 
               two huge fists full of ice at him. He backs away laughing.

               The boys get up off the floor and have a huge group hug with 
               Rocco as they all scream each others names.

               They all laugh and commence drinking.

               INT. MCGINTY'S PUB  NIGHT

               The bar is trashed. It's mostly empty now except for the 
               brothers, Rocco, Doc and four friends. Everyone is very drunk, 
               including Doc.

                                     ROCCO
                              (trying to connect 
                              with Connor)
                         ...It's not that I'm homophobic. I'm 
                         just afraid of faggots.

               Connor pauses then bursts out laughing. Doc calls everyone 
               to gather round.

                                     DOC
                         I got some bad news. Looks like I'm 
                         gonna have ta close d-down the bar. 
                         The Russians have been buying up 
                         buildings all over town, including 
                         this one... Fuck!... Ass! And they're 
                         not letting me renew my lease. I got 
                         'til the end of the week to come up 
                         with 26,000 dollars, or they take 
                         the place. I left them a note telling 
                         them not to show their faces t-
                         tonight. They been pressuring me ta 
                         close and take the last few days ta 
                         get all my shit outta here but it's 
                         my right to stay open ta the last.

               Long pause as everyone absorbs. They are upset.

                                     ROCCO
                         Let me talk to my boss, may I can...

               He is cut off by everyone who obviously opposes Mafia 
               involvement.

                         know what they say; People in glass 
                         houses sink ships.

               Everyone has quizzical looks on their faces.

                                     ROCCO

                         like a proverb book or something.

                         What?

               Everyone chuckles.

                              (imitating Doc)
                         A p-penny saved is worth two in the 
                         bush.

                         get out of the kitchen.

               Everyone laughs heartily. Just then, three large Russians in 
               suits enter. The obvious leader, CHECKOV, stands in front 
               with VLADDY behind one of Checkov's shoulders, with another 
               guy behind the other shoulder. They mean business. The 
               laughter fades.

                                     CHECKOV
                              (thick Russian accent)
                         I am Ivan Checkov. You will be closing 
                         now.

                              (after a long pause)
                         This is McCoy... we find Spock and 
                         we got enough for an away team.

               Everyone laughs. Ivan is angry.

                                     CHECKOV
                         Oh, how extraordinary. A bunch of 
                         Irishmen... and they are being drunken 
                         idiots. You are killing the 
                         stereotype. I'm in no mood for 
                         discussion.
                              (points to Doc)
                         You! You stay. The rest of you go 
                         now.

               The locals roll their eyes at Doc's blunder.

                                     CONNOR
                         Calm down, Doc. I'm sure they're 
                         reasonable fellows.

               He and Murphy each grab a Guinness and a shot of Hennessey 
               and they approach the Russians with the peace offering.

                                     CONNOR
                         Listen fellas, Y'know he's got 'til 
                         this week's end. Ya don't have ta be 
                         hard asses, do ya?

                                     MURPHY
                         Yeah, it's St. Patty's day. Everyone's 
                         Irish tonight. Now, why don't ya 
                         pull up a stool and have a drink 
                         with us?

                                     CHECKOV
                         You insult me. I would never drink 
                         that sewage. Especially with you 
                         people. You are fools.

               Checkov slaps the beer to the floor.

                                     CHECKOV
                         This is no game! If you won't go, we 
                         will make you go!

               The boys look at each other, remembering what Mom said.

               They still hold the shots.

                                     CONNOR
                         If ya want a fight, you can see you're 
                         outnumbered. We're trying ta be civil 
                         here, so I suggest you take our offer.

                                     CHECKOV
                         I make the offers, ass-hole.

               Rocco pushes off the bar. He's had enough.

                                     ROCCO
                              (standing between the 
                              two brothers)
                         Hey, there Boris. What would you say 
                         if I told you that your pinko, commie 
                         mother sucked so much dick...

               Wham! Ivan punches him in the face. He is quickly down and 
               out. Connor and Murphy's faces turn to stone as they speak 
               the next few lines in flawless fluent Russian with English 
               subtitles.

                                     CONNOR
                         "Now, that wasn't too polite, was 
                         it?"

                                     MURPHY
                         "I'm afraid we can't let that one 
                         go, Ivan."

               Checkov is completely taken aback. All the Irish are fairly 
               impressed as well.

                                     CONNOR
                         I don't think Ma would mind.

               They clink the glasses together, throw back the Hennessey, 
               ball up the thick glasses in their fists, drop to one knee 
               and both deliver a devastating blow to each of Checkov's 
               quads. Murphy on the left, Connor on the right. He's down 
               for the count, writhing on the floor.

               The boy's each take a Russian guy and start fighting as the 
               others start kicking and spitting on Checkov. This is a bar 
               brawl, lots of punches don't connect. Connor dismantles his 
               man quickly. Murphy is still fighting as all the Irish try 
               to jump in and help Murphy but Connor goes into psycho mode, 
               pushing them all back.

                                     CONNOR
                         Let the boy go. He knows what the 
                         fuck he's doing!

               They all back off and start to cheer him on. Murphy and Vladdy 
               are ripping each other apart. Vladdy backs him against a 
               wall and pulls back, exhausted, for one good punch. Murphy 
               reaches up behind his head with both hands and pulls two 
               bottles of wine from a wall rack. He swings them toward each 
               other with Vladdy's head as the mid-point. The bottles 
               haphazardly connect, one on each side of his head. He crumples 
               to the ground in an explosion of glass and wine.

               There is shock and silence.

                                     CONNOR
                         Nicely done, boy!

               INT. MCGINTY'S PUB  NIGHT  A FEW MINUTES LATER

               They have Ivan Checkov tied down to the bar on his stomach.

               Connor stands with an unlit cigarette dangling from his lips 
               next to Ivan. He pours Hennessey all over Checkov's buttocks.

               They all cheer. Ivan's face is battered as Rocco wakes and 
               approaches. He punches Checkov in the face in complete rage.

               Two friends subdue him as all chuckle.

                                     CONNOR
                         Now, like my fine brother says, on 
                         St. Patty's everyone's Irish. And 
                         this piece of shit is about to be 
                         initiated.

               As they cheer, Connor lights up his smoke and tosses the 
               match on Ivan's butt.

               The Hennessey is instantly ablaze and Checkov is screaming 
               and wiggling in horror. Some just stand there stunned, but 
               most of the remaining onlookers leap to Ivan's aid. They 
               furiously pat him out and turn on Connor.

                                     FRIEND #1
                         Are ya tryin' ta kill him, ya fuck?

               INT. CONNOR AND MURPHY'S APT  EARLY NEXT MORNING

               Connor and Murphy, fairly beat up, sit up on their beds.

               They wear tattered bathrobes and boxer shorts. They put their 
               feet down into their leather boots. The boys examine the 
               extent of one another's injuries and reflect on their 
               hangovers. They both laugh and grab their heads in pain.

               Boom! The door breaks open and in hobbles Checkov and Vladdy, 
               guns drawn. Checkov is all beat up and the ass of his pants 
               is burnt out. A bulky bandage covers his buttocks. Vladdy 
               has a large bandage around his head. The boys stand in 
               surprise.

               Ivan smashes Connor in the forehead with his gun, sending 
               blood gushing down his face as he falls to the floor. Murphy 
               helplessly yells his brother's name as he is brought to his 
               knees by Vladdy. Ivan positions Connor on his knees before 
               the toilet, which is open to the room. Checkov puts his foot 
               on Connor's head and proceeds, as he struggles, to hand cuff 
               him to the old toilet. So now Connor is bleeding and hugging 
               the commode with his hands cuffed behind the bowl base.

                                     CHECKOV
                              (almost whispering)
                         I was going to kill you. But I'm 
                         not... I'm going to kill your brother. 
                         I'm going to take him down to the 
                         dumpster and I'm going to shoot him 
                         in the head. Then I'm going to throw 
                         his dead body in the garbage.
                              (looks at this watch)
                         Trash guys are coming in 10 minutes, 
                         gotta go.

               Checkov walks towards the door and says "let's go" to Vladdy.

                                     MURPHY
                         It was just a bar fight. You guys 
                         are fuckin' pussies!

               Vladdy pulls him to his feet and leads him away following 
               Checkov.

               Connor, blood running from his face, listens to absolute 
               silence for just a moment. Suddenly his face reads the gravity 
               of the situation. In a split second he turns into an animal. 
               He's yelling, pulling, tugging and growling.

               His body is a whirlwind of motion. The skin on his wrists 
               bleeds profusely.

               EXT. ALLEY  MORNING

               Vladdy and Checkov lead Murphy out back into the alley.

               Murphy is on his knees next to the dumpster. Checkov has his 
               gun to the boy's head. He acts like he's going to pull the 
               trigger, but he stops. Vladdy is standing twenty feet away 
               with his back to them keeping a look out, gun in hand.

               INT. CONNOR AND MURPHY'S APT.  MORNING

               Connor becomes so venomous, that he pulls the entire toilet 
               right out of the floor.

               INT. TO EXT.  MACMANUS' TENEMENT  LOADING DOORS  MORNING

               (slo-mo) Connor steps out onto the sill of the huge, open 
               loading doors. He is five stories up. His muscles ripple 
               with the weight of the toilet. His face is barbaric.

               EXT. ALLEY  MORNING

               From his kneeling position, Murphy can see his brother perched 
               50 feet overhead. He does not let his face betray him.

                                     CHECKOV
                         I hope your conscience is clear, 
                         Irishman.

               EXT. MACMANUS' TENEMENT  LOADING DOORS  MORNING

               (slo-mo) Connor bends his knees and heaves the toilet upward 
               and swings one arm directly beneath it. He is no longer 
               tethered around the basin. He holds it at a cocked angle.

               The heavy porcelain tank cover slips off the toilet.

               He tosses the toilet in a left and outwardly trajectory, 
               then he jumps off the sill to the right. He is sailing through 
               the air about twenty feet behind, and to the right of the 
               toilet, cuffed hands above his head, robe up like a cape 
               behind him. Murphy screams

               EXT. ALLEY  MORNING

               (slo-mo) Checkov begins to laugh heartily. The tank top lands 
               pristinely on a garbage bag just behind Murphy. Ivan's look 
               turns to one of terror. Bam! He is crushed by the toilet. 
               Boom! His gun goes off, punching a hole in the dumpster near 
               the bottom. Vladdy hears the bang and crouches as he turns 
               to see a wave of tiny porcelain bits.

               Connor lands squarely on Vladdy's back. His gun discharges 
               firing a hole in the brick of the opposing wall. He is 
               savagely crushed against the ground. Connor bounces off and 
               hits the wall, landing in the garbage completely unconscious.

               Murphy takes his hands from his head. There is dead silence.

               He runs to his brother, pulls him from the trash and checks 
               his vital signs. He seems okay. Vladdy, still alive, slowly 
               crawls for his gun, inadvertently covering his own bullet 
               casing. Murphy goes over, picks up the tank cover and clubs 
               the man to death with two hard and fast blows, then throws 
               it up and behind him. It lands in the dumpster with a 
               resonating boom.

               Murphy quickly takes everything from the scene; guns, money, 
               wallets, watches and a pager. He shoves it in a garbage bag 
               and throws Connor over his shoulder and runs out of the alley.

               BACK TO PRESENT. INT. BOSTON POLICE STATION INTERROGATION 
               ROOM  AFTERNOON

               Smecker stares astounded at Connor and Murphy. The boys 
               examine Smecker for a reaction. He slowly builds to a chuckle. 
               The brothers join in.

               The brothers laugh. Chaffey enters.

                                     MURPHY
                         Aye, she can. 
                              (beat)
                         Any way we can stay here?

                                     CHAFFEY
                         Sure, we have an empty holding cell, 
                         They can... can they stay?

                                     SMECKER
                         Well, we'll have to check with your 
                         mother, but it's ok with me if your 
                         friends sleep over.

               They all chuckle. Chaffey is embarrassed. Smecker stands.

                                     SMECKER
                         Time to feed the dogs.

               Smecker leaves.

                                     CONNOR
                         He's a nice guy.

               Murphy speaks with the characteristic gay man's lingering 
               "S".

                                     MURPHY
                         Yes... he is.

               They laugh.

               EXT. BOSTON POLICE STATION  FRONT STEPS  EARLY EVENING

               The police chief is standing on the front steps of the police 
               station making a statement to the ravenous press: cameras 
               and pushy reporters. Agent Smecker stands slightly behind 
               him.

               Rocco stands amidst the sea of reporters as the chief begins.

                                     CHIEF
                         This is our official statement. The 
                         MacManus brothers are not being 
                         charged with a crime. It was a clean-
                         cut case of self defense. We have 
                         thanked them for their cooperation 
                         and we thank you, the media, for 
                         your tireless pursuit of the truth.

               The press is ablaze with questions. Smecker turns and walks 
               down the precinct steps, passing Rocco, who carries a bunch 
               of folded clothes, and heads for the police station. Smecker 
               glances in Rocco's direction, barely noticing the man who 
               has already passed him.

               INT. MACMANUS' CELLS  EARLY EVENING

               Rocco approaches the wide open cell as Chaffey and Mitchell 
               play cards with the brothers. Happy to see each other the 
               boys and Rocco embrace. He hands them their clothes.

               INT. MACMANUS' CELL  NIGHT

               The boys are in a tight cell with a bed on each side. They 
               are in their own clothes now. The brothers are fast asleep.

               Suddenly, they lurch forward, throwing their chests out, 
               lips tight, still asleep.

               INT. POLICE STATION BATHROOM  NIGHT.

               An officer turns on the faucet of a sink and begins to wash 
               his hands. We go down to the pipes beneath the porcelain 
               basin. An old leak seeps water through a crack in the floor.

               INT. MACMANUS' CELL  NIGHT

               A water leak starts on the ceiling. It drips faster and 
               faster. The water begins to follow a water damaged crack 
               along the ceiling. It slowly spreads in two directions.

               The brothers struggle for air in their sleep. Then slowly, 
               and at the same time, they each reach up one arm apiece and 
               simultaneously curl their hands as if grabbing something.

               Their straining faces are brought from darkness to light as 
               they sit up quickly, face to the ceiling.

               Their eyes open wide and they each draw their first breath 
               as drops of the creeping water land on their foreheads.

               They look at each other across the room in shock as the drips 
               of water still fall between them.

                         Destroy all that which is evil...

                                     MURPHY
                         ...so that which is good may flourish

               INT. MANMANUS' CELL  NEXT MORNING

               Murphy and Connor sleep. Murphy awakes to a beep, beep, beep.

               He removes Checkov's pager from the pocket of his bathrobe.

               INT. PRECINCT OFFICE  MORNING

               Connor and Murphy enter as Greenly, Dolly, Duffy, Chaffey 
               and Mitchell are having coffee and donuts. They greet each 
               other warmly. Connor grabs a pen and walks to the hallway.

                                     CONNOR
                         Be right back...

                                     DUFFY
                         We would be honored, sir, if you 
                         would join us peasants, in a donut.

               Duffy hands Murphy a jelly donut and a cup of coffee as Dolly 
               spreads a copy of the Boston Globe in front of Murphy. The 
               headlines read "The Saints of South Boston." All the 
               detectives chuckle as Murphy is momentarily absorbed. He 
               takes the paper.

                                     MURPHY
                         Saints?  
                              (beat)
                         I will not accept this pizzle until 
                         my feet have been properly anointed.

               They laugh.

               INT. PRECINCT OFFICE  MORNING

               Connor cradles the receiver of a pay phone between his cheek 
               and shoulder. He pockets the pager. As the phone rings, he 
               readies his pen. The other end of the line picks up and a 
               thick Russian accent instantly begins speaking. Connor 
               responds by speaking a few words in Russian before he realizes 
               it's a recorded message. He begins writing. He hangs up the 
               phone and smiles as he lights up a cigarette.

               INT. POPPA JOE YAKAVETTA'S OFFICE  DAY. A.K.A. THE JOKE.

               Rocco, still sporting a shiner, enters an office. There are 
               papers everywhere and it is a cluttered mess of telephones, 
               filing cabinets, lamps and chairs. Rocco clutches a brown 
               paper bag as if it is made of gold. POPPA JOE YAKAVETTA, 
               Rocco's boss, is on the phone. He is in his late forties.

               He's always comfortably dressed; sleeves rolled up, collar 
               unbuttoned.

               VINCENZO LIPAZZI swaggers across the office to Rocco. He is 
               in his late thirties. He goes out of his way to look like 
               Elvis; open shirt, gold chains and medallions. He is 
               overweight and has a bouffant hairdo, accompanied by Elvis 
               shades. Vincenzo flips a half dollar in his hand constantly.

               Rocco and Vincenzo hate each other. Yakavetta talks on the 
               phone.

                                     VINCENZO
                              (hushed)
                         Well, it's the funny man. Give it 
                         here, package boy.

                                     ROCCO
                              (a bit defiant)
                         Joey Bevo said it was important. 
                         Said I had to give it to him myself.

                                     VINCENZO
                              (snatching the package)
                         Gimme the fuckin' thing. Now sit the 
                         fuck down!

               Rocco obeys like an angry child. Vincenzo puts it in front 
               of Yakavetta. He sits on a filing cabinet and flips his coin. 
               Vincenzo giggles and whispers as he pokes fun at Rocco.

               The two of them resemble kids behind the teacher's back.

                                     VINCENZO
                              (hushed)
                         I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man. Heee 
                         Hee. I'm so fuckin' funny. Hee Hee.

                                     ROCCO
                         Fuck you Vincenzo.

                                     VINCENZO
                              (hushed)
                         Tell me a joke funny man. Hee Hee.

                                     ROCCO
                         I caught your show down at the velvet 
                         room at the Holiday Inn, loved it 
                         when you busted into Viva Las Vegas.

               Vincenzo's face drops he gets up and starts walking toward 
               Rocco. Roc points at him from a seated position. He's scared.

                                     ROCCO
                         Hey, hey, hey...

               Suddenly Yakavetta jumps to a standing position. He yells.

                                     YAKAVETTA
                         Fuck you! I could snap my fingers 
                         and have you dead in four hours, 
                         rotting in a truck off of Boyleston! 
                         You insignificant little fuck! I 
                         always get my fuckin' money!

               He slams the phone down. Rocco and Vincenzo are shocked but 
               try to look composed.

                                     YAKAVETTA
                         Fuckin' 90's are killin' me. I 
                         shouldn't a done that. You're not 
                         supposed to tell a guy you're gonna 
                         kill him anymore. I gotta tip-toe 
                         through the tulips with these 
                         assholes. I prance. I'm a prancer. 
                         It's what I do... sucked all the fun 
                         right out of this job.

               As he speaks he unwraps the wax paper in the bag. Rocco looks 
               over his shoulder. It's a sandwich. He's embarrassed.

               Vincenzo smirks at him.

                                     ROCCO
                         Poppa Joe, you want me to go now?

                                     YAKAVETTA
                         Yeah. Thanks, Rocco. See ya.

               Rocco starts for the door. Vincenzo begins whispering in 
               Yakavetta's ear.

                                     YAKAVETTA
                         Hey, Rocco, wait. Come back here.

                                     ROCCO
                         Yeah boss?

               Vincenzo continues whispering for a few more seconds, long 
               enough for Rocco to see. Vincenzo's lips are tight. His teeth 
               grind.

                                     YAKAVETTA
                         I always see you talking to the boys 
                         and making them laugh. They always 
                         come around telling me what a crack 
                         up you are. What is it they call 
                         you?

                                     ROCCO
                              (totally intimidated)
                         The... The funny man.

                                     YAKAVETTA
                         The funny man. Well, I got a new job 
                         for you, just for now. Roc, I'm having 
                         a real shitty day. I'm depressed. 
                         Tell me a funny story or a joke.

                                     ROCCO
                              (terrified)
                         Uh. Okay... um... you hear the one 
                         about the, no fuck that one... uh... 
                         oh! oh! Well... shit. Okay, there's 
                         a white guy. He's walkin' along the 
                         beach and he finds a, a pot, y'know 
                         and ah, he rubs it and this genie 
                         pops out. But this genie, he's a 
                         ni... he's a black guy.

                                     YAKAVETTA
                         He's a nigger.

                                     ROCCO
                         Yeah. And uh, he's pissed off. He 
                         says, "Why you crackers always gotta 
                         find my mother fuckin' pot? And he 
                         tells him he's gonna grant all his 
                         three wishes but he's gonna give all 
                         the black guys...

                                     VINCENZO AND YAKAVETTA
                         Niggers!

                                     ROCCO
                         Sorry! Sorry! All the niggers on the 
                         planet get double what he wishes 
                         for. "I'll take a million dollars," 
                         he says. Genie give it to him and 
                         says every nigger on earth just got 
                         two million. "I don't care gimme a 
                         yacht." Poof there it is.
                              (intimidated, losing 
                              steam)
                         E-every bl... every nigger just got 
                         two yachts. Genie goes...
                              (gives up)
                         I'm sorry Poppa Joe. I can't. This 
                         joke sucks.

               Yakavetta takes a long pause.

                                     YAKAVETTA
                         Continue the joke.

                                     ROCCO
                              (deflated)
                         He says, "What's your third wish?" 
                         And the guys says, "I-I want you to 
                         beat me half to death."

               There's a long tense pause. Suddenly, Yakavetta throws his 
               head back and roars with laughter. Vincenzo joins in. Rocco 
               lets out a semi-audible sign of relief and gradually starts 
               laughing himself.

                                     YAKAVETTA
                              (still in guffaw)
                         Very good stuff, Rocco. Very good 
                         stuff. Tell me another one.

               Rocco returns to terror. Yakavetta erupts again pointing at 
               Rocco.

               INT  COMMON BOSTON HOME  ANTEROOM  TWILIGHT

               Connor and Murphy give a huge Irishman guns, money and gold 
               watches. He hands them two big black duffle bags and motions 
               for them to help themselves as he counts the money. They 
               enter a well equipped arsenal. They are giddy as they go on 
               their first shopping spree. They toss in masks and gloves.

               They toss in four identical black finished 9mm handguns with 
               silencers.

                                     CONNOR
                         Know what we need, man?... some rope.

                                     MURPHY
                         For what?

                                     CONNOR
                         Charlie Bronson's always got rope.

                                     MURPHY
                         What?

                                     CONNOR
                         Yeah, these guys always got a lot of 
                         rope strapped around em in the movies 
                         and they always end up using it.

                                     MURPHY
                         Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?

                                     CONNOR
                         I'm serious.

                                     MURPHY
                         Me too. That's stupid. Name one thing 
                         we're gonna need it for.

                                     CONNOR
                         I don't know they just always need 
                         it.

                                     MURPHY
                         What is all this "they" shit? This 
                         ain't a movie.

               Connor pulls a large hunting knife from Murphy's bag.

                                     CONNOR
                         Is that right, Rambo?

                                     MURPHY
                         All right, get the stupid fuckin' 
                         rope.

               INT. SMECKER'S BEDROOM  NIGHT

               Paul Smecker lies in bed with his young lover, Reuben (mid-
               twenties). He has an innocent, feminine look and a GQ air 
               about him. The two have just had sex and Reuben is far more 
               excited about it than Smecker.

               Reuben pants and gestures that it was a wonderful experience.

               Smecker watches TV.

               Reuben reaches over and affectionately places a hand on 
               Smecker's chest. Paul tosses it off with indifference.

               Reuben has a pouty look. The phone rings.

                                     SMECKER
                         Uh,huh. 
                              (pause)
                         Room number.

               Reuben throws an arm over Smecker's abdomen and places his 
               head on Paul's bare chest as if to now force affection.

                                     SMECKER
                         We got a time of death?

               He is visibly miffed with Reuben's sudden display. He tries 
               to pull the arm away but Reuben holds tight.

                                     SMECKER
                              (sighs)
                         What's the body count?  

               Smecker is annoyed. He slaps Reuben semi-gently once on his 
               exposed cheek. Reuben closes his eyes and holds even tighter.

                                     SMECKER
                         Uh, huh.

               He bites his lower lip in anger and smack Reuben again on 
               the same cheek, hard. Reuben jumps to a sitting position 
               holding his cheek. He is shocked and hurt.

                                     SMECKER
                         I'll be down there in a bit. Keep 
                         the press out.

               He hangs up. Immediately to Reuben, semi-angry.

                                     SMECKER
                         What are you doing?

                                     REUBEN
                              (beat)
                         I was just trying to cuddle.

                                     SMECKER
                         Cuddle?... 
                              (yelling)
                         What a fag!

               INT. PLAZA HOTEL  HALLWAY  NIGHT  12:30 A.M.

               Smecker saunters down the hall, his usual confident smile.

               He is impeccably dressed in a brightly colored suit. Greenly 
               stands directly outside an open door at the hall's end. A 
               steady flow of detectives and forensics filter in and out.

               Smecker halts before Greenly and looks straight into his 
               eyes.

                                     SMECKER
                              (intrigued)
                         He's struck again, hasn't he, Greenly?

                                     GREENLY
                         Why do you always disrespect me like 
                         that?

                                     SMECKER
                         Respect is earned, Greenly, never 
                         given. Guys like you should have to 
                         follow me around squabbling for the 
                         scraps from my table.

               INT. PLAZA HOTEL  SUITE LIVING ROOM  NIGHT

               Smecker and Greenly walk into a large sunken living room 
               with high ceilings. There is a huge white shaped pit couch 
               in the center with seven dead bodies draped across it. All 
               the bodies have been turned so they are either seated or on 
               their backs and bright new pennies have been place in their 
               eyes. There is one corpse directly in the middle of the living 
               room, making eight. This victim (THE FAT MAN) is overweight 
               and is lying in debris made up of sheet rock and broken wood 
               which spreads thinly for a five foot radius around him.

               The victims' body positions are in a circle with the fat man 
               as the hub. Smecker is instantly engulfed. The regular 
               homicide detectives are on hand with their I.D.s hanging out 
               of their breast pockets. They see Smecker and back off.

               Duffy wears an especially loud tie. Smecker lights up a smoke. 
               He circles around and sees another body behind the couch, 
               which makes nine. The victim is on his back, with pennies 
               stuck in his eyes.

                                     SMECKER
                         How many bodies, Greenly?

                                     GREENLY
                              (still Dejected)
                         Eight.


               Smecker's eyes widen as he turns to Greenly.

                                     GREENLY
                              (catching himself)
                         No! Shit! I didn't see that one. 
                         Nine! Nine!

               Smecker takes a beat. He addresses the detectives.

                                     SMECKER
                         While Greenly's getting coffee, 
                         anybody else want anything?

                                     GREENLY
                              (as he walks to the 
                              door)
                         Shit! Shit!

               Smecker surveys the scene.

                                     SMECKER
                         So Duffy, got any theories to go 
                         with that... tie.

                                     DUFFY
                              (looks down)
                         These guys were pros. I think they 
                         were coming for one target, the fag 
                         man, he was the...

                                     SMECKER
                         The what man?

                                     DUFFY
                              (surprised)
                         The fat man.

                                     SMECKER
                         Well, Freud was right. So you think 
                         they came for the fag man, huh? And 
                         what do you base this upon?

                                     DUFFY
                         He was the only one done right. Two 
                         in the back of the head.

                                     SMECKER
                         And the pennies?

                                     DUFFY
                         New hitman wants to leave his mark

                                     SMECKER
                         That's a possibility. Y'know you 
                         Boston cops are perking up. That's 
                         two sound theories in one day, neither 
                         of which deal with abnormally sized 
                         men. 
                              (pause)
                         Another possibility is that they 
                         were placed there with religious 
                         intent.

                                     DUFFY
                         Yeah. Some cultures still put pennies 
                         in the eyes of the dead, or silver.

                                     SMECKER
                         The Greeks. The Italians.

                                     DUFFY
                         The Sicilians.

                                     DOLLY
                         What's the symbology there?

               Smecker tosses the Idiot glance to Dolly.

                                     SMECKER
                         Symbology? Well, now that Duffy has 
                         relinquished his King Bone Head crown 
                         I see we have an heir to the throne. 
                         I'm sure the word you were looking 
                         for was symbolism. What's the 
                         symbolism there? Let me explain it 
                         to you. In Greek and Roman mythology 
                         when you died you would have to pay 
                         the toll to Charon, the boatman who 
                         ferried you across to the gates of 
                         judgment. This made sure the dead 
                         came to atone for what they did during 
                         their lives, Detective...

               Smecker looks at his I.D.

                                     SMECKER
                         Dollapoppaskalious.

               The detectives are impressed.

                                     DOLLY (DOLLAPOPPASKALIOUS)
                         Holy shit. You're the first one that's 
                         ever got that.

                                     SMECKER
                              (aside)
                         Yeah, well... I'm an expert in name-
                         ology.

               The detectives chuckle.

               INT. PLAZA HOTEL  SUITE LIVING ROOM  NIGHT

               Smecker is chain smoking. His clothes appear unkempt. His 
               eyes show emotion at every new found clue. The detectives 
               watch closely. He is hunched over the body of the fat man 
               probing his wounds with his gloved fingers. Greenly has re-
               entered. He defiantly holds a cup of coffee but is too 
               intimidated to interrupt Smecker. He sets it down and folds 
               his arms.

                                     SMECKER
                         I've seen burns like these before. 
                         They used silencers. Look at these 
                         entry and exit wounds. They're 
                         identical.

               He stands up and gives a lesson to the now eager detectives.

               He points his two index fingers to the back of his own skull.

                                     SMECKER
                         The two bullets went in here, through 
                         the top of the skull, criss-crossed 
                         and exited through the eyeballs. 
                         This one clue tells us three distinct 
                         facts. Number one... Duffy.

                                     DUFFY
                         They shot him at a downward angle.
                              (makes connection)
                         They put him on his knees.

                                     SMECKER
                         Excellent! Number two. Greenly.

                                     GREENLY
                         Uh. 
                              (thinking hard)
                         Shit, I, uh...

                                     SMECKER
                         It tells us that he was the last to 
                         die. All these men 
                              (fans across the 
                              corpses with his 
                              hand)
                         Were carrying. They came in, dropped 
                         all in seconds and then took their 
                         time with fag man. Didn't they, 
                         Duffy?!
                              (psychotic laugh)
                         They sure as fuck did!

               A wide-eyed Duffy joins with Smecker, by nodding his head.

               Smecker is seducing all of them.

                                     SMECKER
                         And number three, Dolly.

                                     DOLLY
                         Uh... two shooters!

                                     SMECKER
                         Fan-fuckin-tastic!

               Greenly and Duffy want to know how.

                                     SMECKER
                         Now stay with me, boys. What did 
                         they do to make two such identical 
                         wounds? Did one guy put him on his 
                         knees, pop a cap in, sit him back up 
                         and shoot him again the same way? 
                         No. Two men of similar height dropped 
                         this guy down, each put some iron to 
                         his head and boom! That's all she 
                         fuckin' wrote!

                                     DUFFY
                         What about one guy with two guns?

                                     SMECKER
                         Possible, but unlikely. The angles 
                         are too extreme. A guy holding two 
                         guns to the back of your head is 
                         gonna shoot straight ahead. He 
                         wouldn't cock out his elbows, makes 
                         no sense. Besides, you telling me 
                         one guy came in here and killed eight 
                         men with eight extremely well aimed 
                         shots in just a few seconds? No way. 
                         Had to be at least two.

               INT.  PLAZA HOTEL  SUITE LIVING ROOM  NIGHT  LATER

               Smecker is now a complete mess. His hair is totally frazzled.

               He is sucking on cigarettes long and hard. His clothes are 
               completely disheveled.

                                     SMECKER
                         Television,... television is the 
                         explanation for this.

               Smecker points toward the ceiling revealing a huge gaping 
               hole in it just above the living room.

                                     SMECKER
                         You see this is bad television.
                              (again pointing out 
                              the hole in the 
                              ceiling)
                         The little assault guys creeping in 
                         through the vents and coming in 
                         through the ceilings. That James 
                         Bond shit never happens in real life. 
                         Professionals don't do that. So we've 
                         got this up here, which has novice 
                         written all over it. And all this 
                         down here that's simply a perfect 
                         textbook assassination. So here's 
                         our two possibilities. We either 
                         have rank amateurs that got lucky or 
                         consummate professionals that fucked 
                         up.

               The detectives nod in agreement. They are now completely 
               taken in by Smecker's spell.

                                     SMECKER
                         Join me in a drink, gentlemen.

               They go over and grab seats at the bar. Smecker mixes himself 
               a gin and tonic on the other side. He is calming down now 
               and going back into cool mode. He starts to tuck his clothes 
               back in and fix his hair. He leans over the bar and sips his 
               drink. The three detectives lean in.

                                     SMECKER
                         With the exception of my coffee boy, 
                         you Boston detectives are starting 
                         to show signs of intelligence. So, I 
                         am going to make you privy to some 
                         information that you would not 
                         normally be. These men are all Russian 
                         mob. Not like those two peons in the 
                         alley the other day. These guys are 
                         all syndicate bosses and underbosses. 
                         I have a dossier on every man in 
                         this room. Since the Iron Curtain 
                         has gone down, the Russian syndicates 
                         have started to come here. And in 
                         the spirit of Glasnost the Soviets 
                         have opened their borders to the 
                         mafia. But the Italians, they're not 
                         convinced that the grounds in mother 
                         Russia are fertile enough for 
                         organized crime yet. So they ain't 
                         ready to commit. The Russians are 
                         coming here anyway. They are 
                         unwelcome. What we have here, 
                         gentlemen, is possibly the beginning 
                         of the first international mob war... 
                         unless I've totally missed something.

               All their faces read the gravity of the situation.

                                     SMECKER
                         Now, what is this going to look like 
                         to those who do not know what I just 
                         told you?

                                     DUFFY
                         It's gonna look like the bad guys 
                         are killing each other.

                                     SMECKER
                         And is there an American, shit is 
                         there a man seated among us that 
                         hasn't thought about it many times, 
                         let's just put them all on an island, 
                         give them guns and let them kill 
                         each other. This is our wet dream 
                         come true. You can expect federal 
                         and local law enforcement to go only 
                         deep enough to satisfy the law, then 
                         bury it from here on out.

                         So, what do we do now?

                                     SMECKER
                         That depends. You either do your job 
                         or get ethical.

               INT. ROCCO'S APARTMENT  NIGHT

               Rocco comes out of the bathroom. He storms out to his small, 
               round, living room table at which the boys are seated. He is 
               wearing a white, polyester shirt with gold trim that is a 
               uniform of some kind for perhaps a chain of restaurants. It 
               is unbuttoned all the way down and his white t-shirt is 
               hanging out. He is wearing a name tag that reads "Jaffar".

               He is upset. He slams down a chair across from the brothers 
               who are sitting there cleaning guns and silencers. All the 
               accouterments of death are sprawled before them. They are 
               smoking as they carefully disassemble their firearms.

                                     ROCCO
                         This better be good. 
                              (viciously ties his 
                              hair back)
                         Talk!

               The boys look at each other.

               FLASHBACK EXT.  SIDEWALK  DOWNTOWN BOSTON  NIGHT

               The boys are walking across Copley Square. Connor looks at 
               the note he wrote at the police station. They stand on the 
               sidewalk and light smokes. They are in their regular garb; 
               thick naval P-coats, jeans and leather boots. They each carry 
               a mid-sized, black, duffle bag. They are serious and business-
               like. They scan the Plaza Hotel from across the street. The 
               elite exit and enter the hotel. Connor glances at his pocket 
               watch. It's 8:45.

               INT.  PLAZA HOTEL  ELEVATOR  NIGHT

               They enter. They look ahead, stone-faced, as the elevator 
               climbs.

                                     MURPHY
                         Nervous?

                                     CONNOR
                         A bit.

                                     MURPHY
                         Me, too.

               The elevator stops at the lobby level. Nine, well-dressed 
               men enter. Their faces are not shown. The boys move to the 
               back wall.

               One guy says something quickly to another in Russian. The 
               other gives a one word Russian response. They boys look at 
               each other. As the elevator climbs, their eyes focus.

               The door opens. As the men exit the elevator, each face is 
               seen individually, all are victims from Smecker's crime scene.

               The elevator goes up half a floor. They hit the stop button 
               and rummage in their bags. They suit up; black gloves and 
               black masks. They strap on four 9mm. pistols with silencers, 
               in shoulder holsters, one under each arm. Connor takes a 
               large coil of black rope and drapes it around himself. He 
               looks at Murphy and at the rope in his bag. Murphy is too 
               excited to argue.

                                     MURPHY
                         You and your fucking rope.

               He puts it on. They drop to their knees, making the sign of 
               the cross. Then, up through the ceiling they go.

               INT.  PLAZA HOTEL  ELEVATOR SHAFT  NIGHT

               They stand on top of the elevator before a long air shaft.

                                     CONNOR
                              (smiling)
                         See. I told you there'd be a shaft.

                                     MURPHY
                              (smiling)
                         Just like on TV.

               They jump into the air shaft.

               INT.  PLAZA HOTEL  AIR SHAFT  NIGHT

               They start crawling with Connor in front and Murphy behind.

               INT.  PLAZA HOTEL  SUITE  NIGHT

               The plump boss is standing in the middle of the sunken living 
               room.

               His eight Russian comrades are around him seated on the U-
               shaped pit couch. They speak Russian, but no subtitles are 
               seen. The fat man yells. He's mad about something.

               INT.  PLAZA HOTEL  AIR SHAFT  NIGHT

               Connor is taking lots of random turns, left and right. He is 
               starting to look a bit confused.

               INT.  PLAZA HOTEL  SUITE  NIGHT

               The fat man is really yelling at them now. He is screaming 
               and pointing at each man.

               They seem to be taking it seriously.

               INT.  PLAZA HOTEL  AIR SHAFT  NIGHT

               Their brows are drenched with sweat. Murphy crawls up next 
               to Connor. There is only enough room for the two to lie on 
               their sides facing each other.

                                     MURPHY
                         Where the fuck are you going?

                                     CONNOR
                         We'll find it. Just calm down.

                                     MURPHY
                         No, fuck you. This rope is bullshit. 
                         I'm sweatin' my ass off draggin' 
                         this stupid thing around. Must weigh 
                         30 pounds.

               Murphy takes off the rope.

                                     CONNOR
                         We're doing some serious shit here. 
                         Now, get a hold of yourself, asshole.

                                     MURPHY
                         Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin' 
                         Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's 
                         getting' us lost!

                                     CONNOR
                         Sh, sh! Fuck you!

               Connor grabs Murphy's shirt.

                                     MURPHY
                         No, fuck you!

               The boys get into a close quarters battle. An occasional 
               insult is thrown as feet kick and fists fly. They begin to 
               get tangled in their own rope. The seam of the duct breaks 
               and a tangled mess of rope and MacManuses pour out.

               INT.  PLAZA HOTEL  SUITE  NIGHT

               They crash through the ceiling right above the fat man's 
               head. The rope gets caught and slams the boys to a halt, 
               hanging them upside down, back to back about six feet above 
               the floor. They are turning in circles. The boss is balled 
               up in the fetal position on the floor. The shocked Russians 
               say only a word or two in panic before the MacManus brothers 
               react, reaching for their guns. The Russians start to reach 
               for their guns. It's too late. The boys draw and fire as 
               they spin. Taking four shots apiece.

               There are eight dead Russians. Chests explode as they fall 
               back on the couch in a loose circle. One victims is blasted 
               over the couch.

               They notice the fat man directly beneath them. Murphy grabs 
               his Rambo knife, reaches up and cuts the rope. They land in

               a heap, scramble over to the doomed man and place him on his 
               knees. They each put a gun to the back of his head and recite 
               this prayer in perfect unison.

                                     BOTH
                         And shepherds we shall be. For thee, 
                         my Lord, for thee. Power hath 
                         descended forth from thy hand that 
                         our feet may swiftly carry out thy 
                         command. So we shall flow a river 
                         forth to thee and teeming with souls 
                         shall it ever be. E nomini patri, et 
                         Fili e spiritu sancti.

               With the silenced pop from their guns we cut the sound and 
               go to black and white. (Slo-mo) Choral music starts with 
               Latin script being read in the background. They take their 
               rosaries out. They slowly walk around, mumbling prayers as 
               they care for the dead. They gently turn over the bodies 
               that were on their stomachs. They brush the hair back from 
               the victims faces. They place pennies in the eyes of al the 
               corpses. When they finish their ritual, they pull off their 
               masks and look at each other. They start to grin and look 
               around. They work each other into a healthy chuckle.

                                     CONNOR
                              (looks up)
                         That was some good fuckin' rope.

               They both laugh.

                                     MURPHY
                         That was way easier than I thought.

                                     CONNOR
                         Aye.

                                     MURPHY
                         On TV ya always get that asshole 
                         that jumps behind the couch.

                                     CONNOR
                         Yeah, and ya gotta shoot at him for 
                         ten minutes.

                                     MURPHY
                         Oh, we're good man.

                                     CONNOR
                         Yes, we are.

               They are already striding for a suitcase full of money.

               Murphy picks up a wad of bills.

                                     MURPHY
                         I love our new job.

               Just then, there's a knock at the door. They snap into action. 
               They stand at each side of the double doors, looking through 
               the peepholes. They see Rocco on the other side dressed as a 
               hotel employee. He wears a polyester shirt with gold trim 
               and a name tag that reads Jaffar. He has a good cart in front 
               of him.

               They look at each other and grin. Murphy nods. As they open 
               the door, Murphy grabs the food cart and pulls it in.

               Connor seizes the mortified Rocco and pulls him in, slamming 
               the door shut behind him. They run, dragging him and then 
               throw him in the midst of the bodies. They put their guns 
               right in his face.

                                     ROCCO
                         Oh, God! Don't kill me! We're on the 
                         same side! The boss musta sent you 
                         in as back up, huh? Oh, shit, please! 
                         I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man.
                              (almost crying)
                         They call me the funny fuckin' man!

                                     CONNOR
                              (attempting to hide 
                              accent)
                         Where's your gun?

                                     ROCCO
                         Chest pocket. 
                              (they take it)
                         Shit!

                                     CONNOR
                         This is a six-shooter.

                                     MURPHY
                              (hiding accent)
                         Nine bodies.

                                     CONNOR
                         Oh, you're good. What were you gonna 
                         do? Laugh the last three to death, 
                         funny man?

                                     ROCCO
                         Poppa Joe said there was only two. 
                         In and out.
                              (trying to make friends)
                         Boy, you guys sure did a good job. 
                         You're good, huh? Cool masks. Where'd 
                         you get them?

                                     CONNOR
                         Let's do him right here.

                                     MURPHY
                         Right now.

                                     ROCCO
                              (screaming like a 
                              baby)
                         Don't kill me. Oh shit, please no. 
                         I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man!... the 
                         funny man... the funny.

               The boys put their faces close to his and demask. They start 
               laughing but Rocco just lays there, wide-eyed, in shock.

               They boys saunter to the bar. Rocco takes a long beat.

                                     ROCCO
                         What did you do?! Fuckin'... what 
                         the fuckin' fuck! Who the fuck, fucked 
                         this fuckin'? fuck. How did you two 
                         fuckin', fucks?......... FUCK!!!

                                     CONNOR
                         Certainly illustrates the diversity 
                         of the word.

               The brothers laugh.

                                     ROCCO
                         What the fuck are you doing here? 
                         What, huh!? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? ANSWERS! 
                         I WANT FUCKIN' ANSWERS!

                                     CONNOR
                              (slaps his face)
                         Get a hold of yourself, man.

               Rocco is silent and surprised. Murphy, also surprised, looks 
               at Rocco. All is quiet.

                                     MURPHY
                         Yeah, get a hold of yourself.

               Murphy jokingly slaps Rocco a second time. Rocco instantly 
               jumps on Murphy, cursing and punching. The brothers burst 
               into laughter as they subdue Rocco. As he calms down, they 
               release him.

                                     CONNOR
                         Listen, we gotta get outta here now. 
                         We'll take separate exits and meet 
                         at Rocco's.

               Murphy puts the two suitcases in his duffle bag and the two 
               brush by Rocco who is still unsatisfied with his explanation.

                                     ROCCO
                         Fuck!

               BACK TO PRESENT  INT.  ROCCO'S APARTMENT  NIGHT

               Rocco has removed his hotel jacket.

                                     ROCCO
                         Anybody you think is evil?

                                     CONNOR
                         Yes.

                                     ROCCO
                         Don't you think that's a little 
                         psycho? A little weird?

                                     CONNOR
                         Weird, huh?... Know what I think is 
                         weird? Decent men with loving families 
                         go home every day after work. They 
                         turn on the news and see rapists, 
                         murderers, and child molesters all 
                         getting out of prison.

                                     MURPHY
                         Mafiosos getting caught with 20 kilos 
                         and walkin' on bail the same day.

                                     CONNOR
                         Little girls catchin' stray bullets 
                         in their heads, playin' hopscotch in 
                         their front yards. And everyone thinks 
                         the same thing... Someone should 
                         just go kill those motherfuckers.

                                     MURPHY
                         Kill em all. Admit it, even you've 
                         thought about it.

               Rocco ponders this as the boys continue to clean their 
               weapons.

                                     ROCCO
                         You guys should be in every major 
                         city.

               The boys chuckle. Rocco steadily works himself into a humorous 
               frenzy.

                                     ROCCO
                         This is some heavy shit. This is 
                         like Lone Ranger-heavy man. Fuck it! 
                         There's so much shit that pisses me 
                         off. You guys should recruit 'cause 
                         I am sick and fuckin' tired of walkin' 
                         down the street waitin' for one of 
                         these assholes to get me, y'know?

                                     MURPHY
                              (chuckling)
                         Hallelujah, Jaffar.

                                     ROCCO
                         So you're not just talkin' mob guys. 
                         You're talkin' anyone, right? Even 
                         like pimps and drug dealers and all 
                         that shit?

               The boys look at each other and nod.

                                     ROCCO
                         Well fuck, you guys could do this 
                         every day.

                                     MURPHY
                         We're like 7-Eleven. We ain't always 
                         doing business, but we're always 
                         open.

                                     CONNOR
                         Nicely put.

               INT.   ROCCO'S APARTMENT  NIGHT  ONE HOUR LATER

               The three are partying hard. There's a pizza surrounded by 
               Guinness cans as they whoop it up, sitting at the round table.

               Rocco wears one of the masks. They're all drunk. The house 
               cat is lounging on the table comfortably.

                                     ROCCO
                         You fuckin' guys. You ruined me. I'm 
                         fuckin' done. Permanent package boy.

                                     MURPHY
                         Who says that? You could take credit 
                         on it.

                                     ROCCO
                         What are you serious?

                                     MURPHY
                         Yeah, fuck it. If you think about 
                         it, it's all you can do really. You 
                         can't tell him it was us. Go in 
                         braggin' and shit.

                                     CONNOR
                         Climb the corporate ladder, boy. Don 
                         Rocco.

                                     ROCCO
                         Fuck it! I'm doing it. I deserve it. 
                         I've been working for those fat 
                         bastards since I was in high school 
                         and look at this place.

               The boys nod in agreement.

                                     ROCCO
                              (working into a frenzy)
                         They're fuckin' me man! Hey, they 
                         can suck my pathetic little dick. 
                         And I'll dip my nuts in marinara 
                         just so the fat fucks can get a taste 
                         of home while they're at it. That's 
                         it, it's done, I'm doing it.

               Rocco slams his fist down on the table next to Murphy's gun.

               The gun goes off with a bang! and blows the lounging cat 
               right off the table. A softball-sized hole is blasted in the 
               wall as a large splatter of blood sprays the area surrounding 
               the hole. Everyone is in shock for a second.

                                     MURPHY
                         I can't fuckin' believe that just 
                         happened!

               INT.  ROCCO'S APARTMENT  NEXT MORNING  11:30 A.M.

               The three are passed out all over the apartment. Rocco 
               awakens. He stumbles past the wall with the large, round, 
               pink stain on it. There is a crooked picture hanging in the 
               middle of it.

               Rocco staggers to the kitchen and throws water in his face 
               over a sinkful of dirty dishes. Connor awakens, grabs his 
               jacket and follows Rocco out.

               EXT.  ROCCO'S FRONT STEPS  CONTINUOUS

                                     CONNOR
                              (hung over)
                         Donna's gonna be angry about her 
                         cat.

                                     ROCCO
                         Shit. She's on every drug know to 
                         man. She'd have sold that thing for 
                         a dime bag. Screw her. 
                              (beat)
                         But I do kinda feel like an ass-hole.

                                     CONNOR
                              (chuckles)
                         You sound real remorseful.

               Connor lights up two smokes and hands one to Rocco.

                                     ROCCO
                         She ain't been around in weeks anyhow.

                                     CONNOR
                              (beat)
                         Listen. Something's been bothering 
                         me about last night.

                                     ROCCO
                         What?

                                     CONNOR
                         Well... what if your boss knew how 
                         many guys were supposed to be there... 
                         in that room?

                                     ROCCO
                         What are you saying?

                                     CONNOR
                         Think about it man. Nine men, six 
                         bullets.

                                     ROCCO
                         You think they sold me out? No way.

                                     CONNOR
                         He probably knew you'd end up nailing 
                         the fat guy, maybe one or two more, 
                         but he had to know you weren't walking 
                         out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's 
                         dead on the scene. No in-depth 
                         investigation. It'd slide right off 
                         his back. 'Cause as much as I love 
                         ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. 
                         What would he be losing? A thirty-
                         five year old delivery boy?

                                     ROCCO
                         No, no. That's just not the way things 
                         are done. Besides, how's he know I 
                         don't just get in there see there's 
                         too many and just serve em their 
                         fuckin' food and beat it?

                                     CONNOR
                         He knows you, man. He knows all you 
                         want is to move up. That's all. A 
                         smooth hitter woulda gone in there, 
                         seen it was a wash and slipped out. 
                         But a guy like you? Knowin' this is 
                         your only chance? Waitin' eighteen 
                         years?

                                     ROCCO
                         No. No man. That's... that's... you 
                         don't know what you're talking about. 
                         That's bullshit. I know these guys. 
                         I mean, thanks for your concern, but 
                         that just ain't the thing of it.

                                     CONNOR
                         Do me a favor and roll it around for 
                         a bit on your way in.

                                     ROCCO
                         No, look. No rolling. Nothing needs 
                         to be rolled.

               Murphy stumbles enters scene with Rocco and Connor.

                                     MURPHY
                              (to Rocco)
                         Where are you goin'?
                              (to Connor)
                         Did you tell him?

                                     CONNOR
                         Yes.

                                     MURPHY
                              (to Rocco)
                         Then what the fuck?

                                     ROCCO
                         Hey. You don't know that shit for 
                         sure.

                                     MURPHY
                         Oh, Jesus. You're such a fuckin' 
                         retard!

                                     ROCCO
                         Fuck you!

                                     MURPHY
                         Use your brain for once. Is it so 
                         unbelievable they don't care about 
                         you? You are fuckin' dead, you go in 
                         there today. Dead!

                                     ROCCO
                         Oh yeah. You two fuckin' Micks know 
                         what's going on, huh?
                              (flips them off)
                         Fuck you!

                                     CONNOR
                              (trying to calm him)
                         Hey, this ain't a thing you should 
                         gamble on, Roc.

               A girl rides by on a bicycle, they pause as she rides between 
               them.

                                     MURPHY
                         Fuck it! What kind of flowers ya 
                         want at your funeral? Ya dumb Wop. 
                         This is the last time I'll see you. 
                         Bye-bye ya stupid son of a bitch.

                                     ROCCO
                              (walking away)
                         I'll be back at 9:00.

                                     CONNOR
                         Hey. You get in there and start 
                         getting a bad vibe, get the fuck out 
                         quick.

               INT.  ROCCO'S APARTMENT  LATE AFTERNOON

               Connor picks up the place as Murphy watches t.v. The phone 
               rings.

                                     MURPHY
                         Hello?

                                     ROCCO (V.O.)
                         Hey Murph.

                                     MURPHY
                         Roc. You okay?

                                     ROCCO (V.O.)
                         Yeah. Anybody call for me?

                                     MURPHY
                         No. You sure you're okay?

                                     ROCCO (V.O.)
                         I'm fuckin' fine.
                              (beat)
                         Catch you on the flip side.

               Rocco hangs up. Just then DONNA and her friend RAYVIE enter 
               the apartment. They are consummate junky sluts who are very 
               doped up and giddy.

                                     DONNA
                              (trying hard)
                         Here kitty, kitty...... kitty.

               INT.  SIN BIN  SMALL ROOM  NIGHT

               Smecker ascends the three, small steps up to the round room.

               A NUDE DANCER sits there on the couch in a robe. She is crying 
               as she is being consoled by Detective Duffy. This small room 
               is where men watch girls through a large glass window.

               In this room a dancer performs on a floor a few feet above 
               the three private booths where each man watches from his own 
               booth. She appears as if on stage. All three windows are 
               shattered and there is blood on the wall of all three booths.

               We see assorted body parts in each booth, but no faces.

                                     DOLLY
                              (approaches Smecker)
                         She was in here when it went down.

                                     SMECKER
                         Can she I.D. them?

                                     DOLLY
                         They were wearing masks.

                                     SMECKER
                         Of course they were. How many?

                                     DOLLY
                         Three.

               Smecker looks at Dolly surprised.

                                     DOLLY
                         Only two did the shooting.
                              (beat)
                         So what are you thinking, Russian 
                         retaliation?

                                     SMECKER
                         Nah, too quick half their 
                         infrastructure got taken out at the 
                         Copley plaza. Besides, if you're a 
                         hitter, you're either working for 
                         the Russians or the Italians. There's 
                         no riding the fence. Our little theory 
                         from last night just got blown to 
                         shit. Something... new is going on 
                         here.

               Smecker sits next to the girl. He has Compassion. She Cries.

                                     SMECKER
                         Probably shouldn't work another shift 
                         for awhile.

                                     DANCER
                         Fuck this job. I'm getting out of 
                         the porno business and I don't care 
                         who I gotta blow to do it.

               INT.  SIN BIN  SMALL ROOM  NIGHT

               The bodies have been removed and chalk outlines replace them.

               The bullet holes in the walls have been marked either A or 
               B. The detectives watch Smecker. He is a mess. His clothes 
               are disheveled and his hair is frazzled.

                                     SMECKER
                         After talking to the dancer we know 
                         that their mark was the guy in the 
                         middle booth. After she watches them 
                         whack him, she passes out.
                              (pause)
                         Why the two extra victims?

                                     GREENLY
                         Witness?

                                     SMECKER
                         No way they could have seen it.

               Smecker hits an orange button on the wall and a black steel 
               door with a money slot comes slamming down in front of the 
               first booth. He does the same thing to the last booth, leaving 
               the middle one open. Both doors possess peep holes.

                                     SMECKER
                              (sarcastic)
                         Allow me to enlighten you gentlemen 
                         to the protocol of the porno industry, 
                         as I'm sure you've never been in one 
                         of these places before. A man goes 
                         into the booth, puts the money in 
                         the slot. The dancer gets it on the 
                         other side. She hits the button, 
                         door goes up, now there is only glass 
                         between you and it's
                              (makes a masturbatory 
                              gesture with hand)
                         little fireman time.

                                     DUFFY
                         No way they could have seen it?

                                     SMECKER
                         Those doors were down... which means 
                         this. They looked down in through 
                         the peep hole, saw these guys and

                         Pop, pop, pop, right through the

                         Maybe the three of them had something 
                         in common.

                         These two are street-walking scum.

                         Then that's what they had in common. 
                         They were all bad guys... now they're 
                         all dead bad guys.

               Smecker seems side-tracked and ponderous at Greenly's 
               observation. He hits the orange buttons and raises the doors.

                         We got another thing to think about 
                         here. We got us a genuine Kennedy 
                         assassination style bullet theory. 
                         Two guns were used here, guns A and 
                         B. The guy in the middle was done 
                         with both. But this guy...
                              (denotes right booth)
                         ...he was killed with bullets from 
                         gun A only. And this guy...
                              (denotes left booth)
                         ...gun B only. But ballistics dug 
                         two slugs out of the wall from over 
                         here where the victim was done with 
                         A.

               Smecker points to two bullet holes in the wall of the booth 
               on the left. Each is marked "B". He walks over to the right 
               booth where in the exact location are two identical holes 
               marked "A".

                         That scene over at the coffee shop 
                         today tapped me out.

                         A guy went nuts over off of 
                         Commonwealth today. Shot three guys 
                         to death in a coffee shop in broad 
                         daylight. Fled the scene. Don't have

                         scumbags in the quiet city of Boston 
                         start dropping dead and you think 
                         it's unrelated?! Greenly, the day I 
                         want the Boston Police doing my 
                         thinking for me, I will have a fucking 
                         tag on my toe! Now, get me a squad 
                         car and get me over there. I want 
                         the crime scene photos and any witness 
                         statements. NOW!

               Smecker storms from the room. The detectives begin to follow.

               Smecker comes barreling back in, shoving them out of the 
               way. He looks at the bullet holes in the walls marked "A and 
               B" again. Something has clicked.

               INT. LAKEVIEW LUNCH  NIGHT

               Smecker surveys photos and papers, as he smokes profusely.

               He stands next to a table in the back where chairs are knocked 
               over. Body chalk and blood stains are everywhere. The 
               detectives seem like they don't want to be there, again.

                         Friends, Gentlemen. They were friends.

               Smecker flashes them a photo of a dead body. The victim is 
               shot in the head and face down in his plate of food. His 
               hands are on the table in front of him.

                         These guys were packing. Not one 
                         hand near a gun. It's simple human 
                         behavior. Someone you don't know 
                         approaches you, you put your hand on 
                         it. This guy's got his hands on the 
                         table. He's eating his food, for 
                         Christ sakes. They were friends.

               Smecker looks over the bar.

                         These two fucking scenes are related.

                         He would have shot everyone in here. 
                         He just ran out of bullets.

                         with intent. Maybe he didn't know 
                         exactly what he was gonna do but he 
                         had a pretty good idea. The bartender 
                         wasn't a fucking accident.

                         talking.

                         questions at both of these crime 
                         scenes, with no answers. WHY did 
                         they kill the guys in the other two 
                         booths? WHY did he do the bartender? 
                         It would seem unnecessary, even 
                         stupid.

                         favor, tell me when the next guy 
                         dies, cause these guys are not done

               Smecker walks across the street, still angry, and goes to a 
               payphone. There's an extreme close-up on his hand as he puts 
               in a quarter. As the quarter jingles in...

               ...there is a close-up on a hand pulling back from the coin 
               slot. The hand moves up to pull a cigarette from its 
               possessor's mouth. It is Rocco. He dials the phone.

               on the gas stove and pours some salt in a pot of water with 
               a handful of pennies boiling to a shine in it. Rocco bursts

                         You... oh god, why?

                                     ROCCO
                         I felt it would bring closure to our 
                         relationship!

                                     DONNA
                              (crying)
                         You killed my... my...

               She stops, unsure of the cat's name.

                                     ROCCO
                              (screaming)
                         Your what?! Your fuckin' what?!

                                     DONNA
                         My, my...

                                     ROCCO
                              (puts his gun to his 
                              own head)
                         Your what, bitch? I'll shoot myself 
                         in the head, you can tell me that 
                         cats name! Go ahead... Your what? 
                         Your precious little...
                              (waiting for her 
                              response)

                                     DONNA
                              (flustered, crying)
                         Pee...Per...Man.

                                     ROCCO
                         Peeperman? WRONG? What color was 
                         it?!!!

                                     DONNA
                         It was... It was...

                                     ROCCO
                         Male or female, bitch?!!

                                     RAYVIE
                         Don't you yell at her you fuckin' 
                         prick!

                                     ROCCO
                         Shut your fat ass, Rayvie! I can't 
                         buy a pack of smokes without running 
                         into nine guys you fucked.

                                     DONNA
                         Don't you yell at her!

               Rocco rummages through her purse and finds her car keys.

                                     ROCCO
                         All right, let's get the fuck outta 
                         here!

               They exit. Rayvie and Donna are hugging each other, crying.

                                     RAYVIE
                         Is my... I mean it's not really...?

                                     DONNA
                         No. No. It's not fat.

               INT.  CAR  EARLY EVENING

               Rocco is in the back. Connor is driving.

                                     ROCCO
                         Those rat fucks! All of them were 
                         all laughing at me man!

                                     MURPHY
                         You sure you killed them?

               INT.  FLASHBACK  SALAMONE'S  DAY

               Rocco is standing at the back table while his cohorts remain 
               seated. They are OLY, and VINNIE.

                                     ROCCO (V.O.)
                         Fuckin-A-right I did. I had a goddam 
                         turkey shoot over there.

                                     VINNIE
                         I'll bet it was a test. Vincenzo 
                         came in here shooting his mouth off. 
                         He was makin' sure we knew. But we 
                         did what we were supposed to, eh? We 
                         kept our mouths shut. You did your 
                         part. They know we're goodfellas 
                         now. We'll get taken care of.

                                     ROCCO
                         What? Did everyone know? Next thing 
                         you'll tell me Sal was in on it.

               Rocco looks at Sal the bartender who reaches for the phone.

                                     OLY
                         Fuck. Vincenzo told Sal first. That 
                         fat fuck knew before we did.

               They all start laughing together.

                                     OLY
                         At least we got our funny man back.

               They all laugh as Rocco pulls his gun and shoots Oly in the 
               head. He lands face down in his plate of food. He shoots 
               Vinnie in the chest then turns on Sal. He yells "Funny, funny, 
               funny" as he pumps the remaining rounds into him.

               INT.  BACK TO PRESENT  DONNA'S CAR

                                     CONNOR
                         Anybody see ya?

                                     ROCCO
                         Fuck, man! I may as well have posted 
                         flyers. Right out in public, man.

                                     MURPHY
                         Liberating isn't it?

                                     ROCCO
                              (smiles at last)
                         Y'know it is, a bit.

               The boys laugh.

                                     ROCCO
                         Stop the car!

               Connor pulls over directly in front of a pink neon sign that 
               says The Sin Bin.

                                     ROCCO
                         Vincenzo, that fat motherfucker, 
                         Yakavetta's right hand. He's the one 
                         who set me up. Then he went around 
                         shooting his mouth off, telling 
                         everyone I was as good as dead. He 
                         goes in there every Wednesday night 
                         around 10:00, he jerks off in the 
                         same booth to the same titty dancer. 
                         Never misses.

                                     MURPHY
                         So?

                                     ROCCO
                         So let's kill the motherfucker. I 
                         mean, what are you guys... like that's 
                         your new thing right?

                                     CONNOR
                              (looks at Murphy)
                         Yeah, well...

                                     ROCCO
                         Oh, what the fuck? How do you guys 
                         decide who you're... I mean, who 
                         makes the cut? Is there a raffle or 
                         something?

                                     MURPHY
                         Well, truth be known, those first 
                         ones just kinda fell into our laps.

                                     ROCCO
                         Well, what'ya do?

                                     CONNOR
                         I guess we really don't have a system 
                         of deciding who.

                                     ROCCO
                              (excited, yelling)
                         MEEE! ME! I'm the guy! I know 
                         everyone, their habits, where they 
                         hang out, who they talk to. I know 
                         where they fuckin' live. We could 
                         kill everyone!

                                     MURPHY
                              (to Connor)
                         So what do you think?

                                     CONNOR
                         I'm strangely comfortable with it.

               EXT.  ALLEY BEHIND SIN BIN  NIGHT

               Rocco, Connor and Murphy are looking very serious as they 
               smoke outside the rear door, in the alley. A drug dealer in 
               a hooded Boston Bruins jacket emerges from the opposing alley.

               He stops a 13 year-old kid. The kid is scared as the drug 
               dealer slaps him. The kid give him money and the drug dealer 
               stuffs a small baggie in the boy's shirt. He lets him go and 
               withdraws into the alley.

               As the boys and Rocco watch this from the opposing alley, 
               they begin to head for them, but Vincenzo's car pulls up 
               across the street. Rocco stops the boys and denotes Vincenzo.

               The boys head in the front door. Rocco moves back into the 
               alley.

               INT.  SIN BIN  NIGHT

               Vincenzo enters and shuffles past the bar where the brothers 
               stand. He walks through a bead curtain at the back of the 
               busy porno house. The boys follow him.

               INT.  SIN BIN  HALLWAY  NIGHT

               They go to the back, open the exit door and let Rocco in.

               The three wind down long dark hallways with Rocco leading 
               the way until they reach a green door. The boys stand, side 
               by side, directly in front of it. Rocco is just behind them.

               The three pull identical 9mm.'s and the boys pull on their 
               masks. Rocco puts on a mask that he made from a dock worker's 
               cotton hat. He looks ridiculous.

                                     MURPHY
                         Okay Roc, this is...

               He turns and is instantly taken with laughter at Rocco's 
               appearance. Connor turns, and has the same reaction.

                                     ROCCO
                         What? You guys got masks.

               They are now pointing and laughing.

                                     MURPHY
                              (through laughter)
                         You look like Mush Mouth from Fat 
                         Albert.

                                     ROCCO
                              (takes off mask)
                         Fine! Fuck it! When we're done she 
                         can I.D. me. I don't care. Just tryin' 
                         to be professional, but no...

                                     CONNOR
                              (still laughing)
                         No. No. It looks good. C'mon, put it 
                         back on. It's good.

               He begrudgingly puts it back on. They reassume their position.

                                     CONNOR
                              (imitating mush mouth)
                         Okay Roc. You sure you're O-B-kay-B?

               INT.  SIN BIN  SMALL ROOM  NIGHT

               They burst into the room, climb up a few steps and are in a 
               small round room with a couch in it. A topless dancer sits, 
               smoking and drinking coffee, on the couch in front of three 
               big black steel doors with money slots in them. Rocco seizes 
               her, puts a hand over her mouth and a gun to her head.

                                     ROCCO
                         Which one is he in?

               She points to the middle door.

                                     ROCCO
                              (takes his hand off 
                              her mouth)
                         What's his routine?

                                     DANCER
                         H... h... he jerks off in there. 
                         Th... then he puts money through the 
                         slot and I raise the door.

                                     MURPHY
                         How?

               She points to an orange button. Each door has a button to 
               the left of it.

                                     ROCCO
                         Then what?

                                     DANCER
                         He watches me do my thing and f-
                         finishes himself off.

               INT.  SIN BIN  CENTER BOOTH  NIGHT

               We see the fuzzy reflection of a cheap porno movie being 
               reflected in Vincenzo's Elvis style sunglasses. He is shaking 
               as he masturbates.

                                     VINCENZO
                              (grunting, muttering)
                         Don't you talk to me like that, you 
                         dirty little... give it to daddy... 
                         give it ta da King... garbage mouth, 
                         garbage mouth.

               INT.  SIN BIN  SMALL ROOM  NIGHT

               Rocco is looking through the peep hole down on Vincenzo. He 
               still holds the terrified, crying dancer.

                                     ROCCO
                         Oh man. He is some sicko.

               They back up and focus on the money slot. A hundred dollar 
               bill comes through. Connor gives it to the dancer.

                         You've earned this.

               The boys begin to recite their prayer. Rocco is smiling and 
               excited, he still hangs on to the now hyperventilating dancer.

               They press the button. The door goes straight up. Vincenzo 
               has one moment of shock before the MacManuses decimate him 
               through the glass with silenced bullets. The glass silently 
               spiders and begins to fall in spots. His chest explodes, 
               sputtering medallions and bits of gold chain inside the booth.

               The dancer faints and Rocco lays her down gently.

               The boys step down in the boot and begin their ritual.

               Rocco watches intently, intrigued. They finish and turn around 
               to see Rocco is immersed in grabbing one of the unconscious 
               dancer's breasts. They pull up their masks.

                                     CONNOR
                         What the fuck are you doing?

                                     ROCCO
                         I-I'll tip her.

                                     MURPHY
                         We've teamed up with a sex offender.

                                     CONNOR
                         So, when are you getting a plastic 
                         fuck doll?

                                     ROCCO
                         All right. I'm sorry. I'm pathetic.

               He gets up and starts tossing money on her as the boys giggle.

               Just then two more bills come through the slots of the other 
               two doors, which have remained closed. Murphy looks through 
               left peep hole, Connor the right. Smiles spread across their 
               faces and they look at each other. They switch and each looks 
               through the other guy's peep hole.

                                     ROCCO
                         What? What is it?

                                     CONNOR
                         This place is like a scumbag yard 
                         sale.

                                     MURPHY
                         We gotta come down here once a week 
                         and clean house.

               Rocco looks in one. He says "Oh, wow" as he crosses and checks 
               out the other one.

                                     ROCCO
                         You sure about this guy?

               The boys look at each other affirmatively.

                                     ROCCO
                         Oh man. You gotta let me do these 
                         guys. I'm such a moron. I gotta make 
                         up for the tit thing.

                                     CONNOR
                         No way. I've been waitin' for this 
                         asshole.

                                     ROCCO
                         Aw, c'mon. I gotta clear my family 
                         name here. I've brought shame to the 
                         house of Della Rocco.

                                     MURPHY
                         Give the guy a shot.

                                     CONNOR
                              (thinks it over)
                         Rocco, this is the real deal. We 
                         must kill without hesitation, without 
                         guilt or remorse. Evil man, dead 
                         man.

               Rocco gets serious and nods his head. Connor replaces the 
               clip in his gun and hands it to Rocco. Murphy does the same.

               He stands with one in each hand, aiming one gun at each door.

               The boys both place a finger on the appropriate orange 
               buttons, as Rocco slowly cocks his head back. With wide eyes 
               he thrusts his head forward. The doors fly up. Rocco fires 
               both guns yelling "Yeah, take it, take it!" Both the drug 
               dealer from outside and the pimp from the emergency room are 
               destroyed. Rocco then crosses his arms and fires two more 
               shots from each gun. On the opposing walls of each booth two 
               identical bullet holes appear.

                                     ROCCO
                         Wyatt-fuckin'-Earp, man!

               INT.  SIN BIN  JUST OUTSIDE THE PRIVATE BOOTH  MINUTES LATER

               Rocco shuts the door.

                                     ROCCO
                         You guys gotta teach me that prayer, 
                         man. That's some good shit.

                                     CONNOR
                         Forget it. It's a family prayer. My 
                         father, his father before him that 
                         sort of shit.

                                     ROCCO
                         C'mon!

               INT.  RITZY RESTAURANT BATHROOM  NIGHT

               An old man appears to look at himself in the mirror of an 
               empty but very upper class bathroom. His eyes are very glazed 
               over. He puts a large leather case on the counter near the 
               sinks. A red and white blind stick hangs off his right 
               forearm.

               Yakavetta enters, crosses behind him and stands next to him.

               AUGUSTUS (72 years) sniffs the air. A look of angry 
               realization overtakes his face.

                                     AUGUSTUS
                         Fuck you.

                                     YAKAVETTA
                         Hey, Augustus, I need your help, I 
                         got a serious problem here. I'm not 
                         screwing around.

                                     AUGUSTUS
                         I bounced you on my knee at family 
                         reunions, for Christ sakes. Your dad 
                         and me ran the whole east coast 
                         syndicate you snot-nosed little prick. 
                         And when you took the wheel, who was 
                         beside you?

               Augustus begins to remove items from his suitcase. First a 
               plate. He sets it down next to the sink. Then assorted 
               colognes, cigarettes and chewing gum. He begins arranging 
               them in neat rows, always feeling with his guiding hands.

                                     YAKAVETTA
                         Hey, I just...

                                     AUGUSTUS
                         Don't start with your shit. Don't 
                         you talk to me. Oh, hey Uncle Gussy, 
                         thanks for years of service. Here's 
                         a gold watch and a job sniffing other 
                         guys' shit eight hours a day. What 
                         am I, a retired bus driver?

                                     YAKAVETTA
                         I need Il Duce.

                                     AUGUSTUS
                         The Duke? 
                              (beat)
                         What did you do?

                                     YAKAVETTA
                         This kid, this package boy could 
                         bring down the whole east coast. If 
                         he decides to turn states he could 
                         dismantle us... totally. But it looks 
                         like for now, he's content with just 
                         killing us one by one. And even worse 
                         the kid is good at it. I mean I had 
                         a prodigy on my hands the whole time 
                         and didn't even know it.

               Yakavetta puts an envelope of money in the plate.

                                     AUGUSTUS
                         Listen kid, I think you better 
                         understand who you're dealing with 
                         here.

                                     YAKAVETTA
                         Yeah. I was only twelve or thirteen 
                         when you guys used to talk about 
                         him, like he was a ghost or something.

                                     AUGUSTUS
                         Your dad and I used him three times 
                         over twenty years, only when 
                         everything went totally fucked. 
                         Believe me kid, you don't want this 
                         guy unless you are 100% sure you 
                         need him. He is... a fuckin' monster.

               INT.  PRISON PROCESSING ROOM  DAY

               This is a gigantic three tiered room with guards on all tiers.

               They all cock their shotguns.

               A PRISONER is shackled barefoot to a small metal cart on 
               wheels. His hands are cuffed before him with a chain linking 
               his hands and feet. A guard is pulling the cart through the 
               prison to the parole board room by a long chain. The cons 
               have their mirrors out to get a better look. His face is in 
               shadow as he bows his head.

               A metal cage is lowered around him from the ceiling. The 
               parole board looks him over. A stenographer sits poised

                                     MR. COBB
                              (English accent)
                         Do you feel you have been 
                         rehabilitated?

               No response is given by the prisoner. The stenographer looks 
               at MR. COBB who gives her the nod. She begins typing though 
               no words are spoken.

               INT.  RITZY RESTAURANT BATHROOM  DAY

                                     AUGUSTUS
                         I've had this guy in front of me, 
                         and I couldn't tell you what he looks 
                         like, sounds like. He is the Picasso 
                         of assassins, kid. He plants hair 
                         samples, blood. Puts skin under 
                         fingernails. He is a fucking genius. 
                         Only one problem. He's been rotting 
                         in prison for twenty-five or thirty 
                         years. Don't even know if he's still 
                         alive. Or if he's even up to it.

               Augustus hands him a piece of paper he scribbled on.

                                     YAKAVETTA
                         There's ways around that.

                                     AUGUSTUS
                         Go find one.

               INT.  PAROLE PROCESSING ROOM  DAY

               A large piece of paper is placed on the table and stamped 
               with the words parole granted across it.

               INT.  HOTEL ROOM  BOSTON  DAY

               The prisoner, Il Duce enters. He is clad in a long dark trench 
               coat with the collar pulled up, dark round glasses and a 
               dark hat. He puts a suitcase on the bed.

               He walks over to the window. He slowly puts his hand outside 
               and watches the sun bounce off it. Tears begin to flow from 
               beneath his glasses as he breaks down. He begins to take off 
               his clothes as he weeps, casting them aside.

               EXT.  HOTEL ROOM FIRE ESCAPE  BACK ALLEY  DUSK

               The Duke is fully naked, except for a hotel blanket which is 
               wrapped around his waist, sitting on the fire escape. He 
               smiles and is still misty-eyed as he beholds the sun setting.

               Scattered around him are all the furnishings of freedom; 
               Snickers bars, all kinds of empty candy wrappers, Coke cans, 
               and many assorted magazines.

               INT.  COFFEE HOUSE  NIGHT  2:00 A.M.

               Rocco and the brothers sit in an old Boston coffee house.

                                     ROCCO
                         Let's talk some business here. I 
                         know a sick fuck... makes the ones 
                         we been doing look like altar boys. 
                         Worst night of my life when I met 
                         this guy.

               FLASHBACK  EXT.  SUBURBAN BEAVER CLEAVER-TYPE HOUSE  DUSK

               Rocco waits in a late model Chevelle in front of a white 
               house. A man exits the house and walks across the sprawling 
               front lawn. Rocco leans over and says How ya doin', man?

               The man doesn't respond and sits in the passenger seat.

               During the following scenes we FLASHCUT between bits of 
               Rocco's experience that night to the coffee house and catch 
               bits of dialogue as he explains.

                                     ROCCO
                         The guy never says a fuckin' word to 
                         me. We're driving for 25 minutes. 
                         Never a sigh, no throat clearing, 
                         nothing. And his face, blank man. 
                         Just nothing there.

               EXT.  DECREPIT HOUSE  NIGHT  CONTINUED

               FLASHCUT: They pull up to a house in a scummy, Boston Logan 
               Airport neighborhood. Rocco gets out and sits on the hood 
               smoking as the man makes his way up the walk.

               INT.  DECREPIT HOUSE  CONTINUED

               Two tough looking wiseguys walk across a hallway cocking 
               shotguns. They disappear into a room.

               FLASHCUT : He quietly enters the house and pulls a large 
               bright-blue plastic tarp from his coat and spreads it across 
               the floor in the hallway. We hear the sound of Sega video 
               games being played. He pulls out two pistols with silencers 
               and walk.

               He disappears into the living room. Two white flashes and 
               the sounds of silencers. A hookerish looking mom enters frame 
               in the B.G. in the kitchen. She is talking on the phone. She 
               disappears from view. The man reappears and walks to the 
               kitchen. A white flash and the sounds of silencer.

               He walks right down the hall and halts right in front of us 
               and listens. He goes into the room the wiseguys had entered.

               We hear a second of male voices in protest. Two flashes of 
               light and the sounds of silencers. A dog is heard barking.

               The man reappears in the hall and walks to its end, through 
               the kitchen. He opens a pair of sliding doors and steps out 
               of our view. A flash of white light and the sound of a 
               silencer.

               EXT.  DECREPIT HOUSE  NIGHT  CONTINUED

               Rocco is out front listening as the barks abruptly cease.

               INT.  DECREPIT HOUSE  NIGHT  CONTINUED

               FLASHCUT : The man drags a dead dog across the kitchen floor, 
               leaving a streak of blood. FLASHCUT : He drags the bodies of 
               two kids, two men and the woman down the hall toward us 
               leaving the hall carpet streaked with blood.

                                     ROCCO
                         I didn't see what he was doing while 
                         he was in there.

               FLASHCUT : The man pulls out a large hunting knife and 
               disappears into each room. The sounds of hacking are heard.

               He reappears holding different pieces of bloody debris. A 
               telephone, a piece of carpet, pieces of drywall. He takes a 
               mop and cleans off the blood on the linoleum of the kitchen 
               floor.

               He walks toward us and stabs the mop in right before camera.

               It stays standing.

               FLASHCUT : We see from his p.o.v. a pile of broken bodies, 
               bloody debris and a dead dog with a mop sticking out the 
               top.

               EXT.  DECREPIT HOUSE  NIGHT  CONTINUED

               FLASHCUT : The man steps outside and motions Rocco in.

               FLASHBACK  EXT.  BACK FACTORY LOT  NIGHT

               Rocco's face is now expressionless as the two load the last 
               body in the furnace and toss the dog in, unloading from 
               Rocco's trunk. They shut the furnace door and there is just 
               the low hum of a furnace and the light wind blowing.

                                     THE MAN
                         I have a poker game at the house 
                         every Saturday with a couple of guys 
                         you know. Why don't you come down? 
                         Wife makes a hell of a bar-g-que.

                                     ROCCO
                              (pause)
                         Yeah... yeah, I'd like that. Tell me 
                         something. What did they do?

                                     THE MAN
                         I don't know.

               BACK TO PRESENT  INT.  COFFEE HOUSE  NIGHT

               Rocco is looking down in silence.

                                     ROCCO
                         Worst day of my life, man.

                                     MURPHY
                              (pause)
                         Well, I'm sold.

                                     CONNOR
                         Don't worry, Roc. We'll do this guy 
                         right and you'll feel a lot better.

               INT.  ROCCO'S MOM'S KITCHEN  NEXT DAY  1:00 P.M.

               The three burst in, all yelling at each other. They are all 
               bleeding profusely from gun shot wounds. Connor turns on the 
               gas stove and slams a new clothing iron down on the burner. 
               He has wrapped the cord around the handle so it won't burn. 
               They have all ripped their clothes haphazardly and have made 
               tourniquets to nurse their wounds.

                                     CONNOR
                         Who the fuck was he, Rocco? I know 
                         you fuckin' know!

                                     ROCCO
                         Fuck you! I told you I never saw him 
                         before!

                                     MURPHY
                         Well he sure as fuck knew you!

                                     ROCCO
                         Fuck you both! Ya ask me, he was 
                         aiming at you!

               The scene fades into total silence as they viciously argue.

               They then take turns hold each other down as they cauterize 
               their wounds with the hot iron. Two guys will hold a third 
               down and force a wadded up pillow case in his mouth, as they 
               burn him

               EXT.  BOSTON SUBURBAN BEAVER-CLEAVER TYPE HOUSE  SAME DAY 
               5:00 P.M.

               Smecker sits on the balls of his fee on a sprawling front 
               lawn. He looks out to the street and sees a forensics 
               technician kneeling before a new, gray Ford Taurus riddled 
               with bullet holes. The man marks a sea of different-sized 
               bullet casings that stretch for thirty-five feet down the 
               sidewalk. He circles two blood stains on the side walk with 
               orange chalk.

               Smecker turns and looks at the front of the house. It is 
               peppered with bullet holes, all seemingly concentrated on 
               the front stoop area. Men try to lift blood samples off the 
               white paint around the door. He stands and Dolly, Duffy and 
               Greenly are ready with pens and notebooks behind him.

                                     SMECKER
                         Okay. Here's what happened.

               FLASHBACK  INT.  PARKED FAMILY VAN  SAME DAY  NOON

               Connor, Murphy and Rocco sit in a parked van, down the street 
               from the Beaver Cleaver house. The three are sitting next to 
               each other in the longer back seat. They have a counter in 
               front of them with all their guns and accessories on it.

               The clicking of bullets into clips, and smacking of clips 
               into guns are heard. Smecker sits in the captain's chair 
               directly across from them, calmly smoking a cigarette. They 
               finish their preparation. Rocco holds up his guns.

                                     SMECKER
                         They waited in a parked car down the 
                         street for the kid to leave.

               Murphy spies a young boy peddling his bike out of the 
               driveway. He goes to the front of the van.

                                     MURPHY
                         There he goes.
                              (turns back to them, 
                              pulls his guns)
                         Okay, gentlemen. Are we ready to 
                         bring this man into the light? Are 
                         we ready to truly do the work of the 
                         Lord?

                                     CONNOR
                              (cocks his pistol)
                         A-fuckin'-men!

                                     ROCCO
                         This is so fuckin' cool!

               EXT.  SUBURBAN BEAVER CLEAVER TYPE HOUSE  DAY

               Connor, Murphy, and Rocco make a frenzied exit from the van 
               and walk across the front lawn, each carrying a black duffle 
               bag and clutching a mask. The garage is opened a crack.

               They pull it up all the way. The sun shines in on Smecker 
               who stands there smoking.

               INT.  SUBURBAN "BEAVER CLEAVER" TYPE HOUSE  GARAGE  DAY

               They enter and close the door behind them

                                     SMECKER
                         They went in through the garage. The 
                         kid says he leaves it open when he 
                         takes his bike out.

               They dive into their bags and suit up with leather gloves, 
               masks, navy P-coats and their guns.

               INT.  SUBURBAN "BEAVER CLEAVER" TYPE HOUSE  DAY

               The three open the door and enter the house and walk 
               deliberately down the hallway.

                                     SMECKER (V.O.)
                         Now, they know the wife is the gate 
                         keeper. She knows the code.

               EXT. SUBURBAN "BEAVER CLEAVER" TYPE HOUSE  BACKYARD  DAY

               They walk with the terrified woman around the pool to a steel 
               door pool house entrance. There is a number pad next to the 
               door. Rocco positions her in front of it.

                                     ROCCO
                         Don't fuck with me lady. I'll kill 
                         you.

               She slowly punches in the numbers. Smecker is standing there 
               smoking.

                                     SMECKER
                         The wife says she doesn't know what 
                         happened after she hit the code. She 
                         just remembers going down. But, 
                         judging by the burn mark on her back, 
                         I think what they did...

               Rocco pulls a stun gun and zaps her with it. She goes down.

                                     SMECKER
                         ...was use a stun gun on her.

               Connor reaches for the knob but Rocco stops him. They wait, 
               guns drawn and focus on the door knob.

                                     SMECKER
                         Now the guy knows a friend is coming 
                         to the game. And they know that this 
                         door can only be opened from the 
                         inside. So they wait... and when 
                         that door opens, man...

               The knob turns and they kick it in.

               INT.  POOLHOUSE - DAY

               They burst in and line up shoulder to shoulder, guns aimed.

               Smecker stands beside Rocco with his thumb and forefinger 
               extended to mimic guns. Five mafiosos sit around a poker 
               table in front of time. Two men are playing pool to their 
               left. Rocco quickly scans the room.

                                     ROCCO
                         All of them.

               They begin firing. Men are dying, their chests exploding.

               Smecker moves his hands like firing guns and yells over the 
               noise.

                                     SMECKER
                         Nobody was ready for it. Devastation, 
                         panic! This was like shooting fish 
                         in a fuckin' barrel!

               Smecker points to the pool table as the two players dive 
               under it.

                                     SMECKER
                         Now these guys dove under the table. 
                         The trajectory on the bullets show 
                         they came from straight across. So 
                         this means one of our shooters... 
                         dropped to his knees...

               Smecker drops to his knees in perfect synchronicity with 
               Rocco. They are side by side and leaning back.

               Rocco fires and the men under the table skip around as they 
               are riddled with bullets. Smecker's mimicking hands follow 
               him perfectly with each shot. The boys and Rocco demask.

               Rocco goes around to all the bodies and looks earnestly at 
               each one, as Connor and Murphy pick up bullet casings.

                                     ROCCO
                         Shit!... Shit! He ain't here.

                                     MURPHY
                         What the fuck do you mean?

                                     ROCCO
                         I mean he ain't here.

                                     CONNOR
                         Look again for fuck sake!

                                     ROCCO
                         I know what the fuck he looks like!

                                     SMECKER
                         Something went wrong. Right here.

               INT.  POOLHOUSE  BATHROOM  DAY

               The man they came for gets off the toilet and pulls up his 
               pants. He is expressionless. He pulls a towel rack from the 
               wall.

               INT.  POOLHOUSE  DAY

               The door behind Rocco begins to open outward. As the door 
               swings open, Rocco tries to angle a gun around to shoot the 
               man who is opening it. But as soon as the man sees his hand, 
               bam! he comes down on it with the towel rack. Rocco pulls 
               back in pain dropping his other gun but the gun fires, as 
               the man's blow connects. The shot pierces his stomach and 
               sends him against the wall. He holds his abdomen in pain.

               There is a moment of recognition between the man and Rocco.

               Rocco is terrified as the man dives on him and they begin 
               fighting. Murphy jumps to help, but Connor pulls him back.

               They both stand in front of the pool table about thirty feet 
               from Rocco.

                                     CONNOR
                         Let the boy go!

               He is now being choked, as he glares at them in disbelief.

                                     MURPHY
                         C'mon Roc!

                                     SMECKER
                         Now, one of these guys is a real 
                         sicko. He knew this man. He wanted 
                         him to suffer, to feel every second 
                         of a painful death.

               As Rocco is wrestling and punching on the floor. He looks 
               up.

                                     ROCCO
                         Help me you assholes! 
                              (they continue to 
                              cheer)
                         He's gonna fuckin' kill me!
                              (he fights harder)

                                     SMECKER
                         This guy is one bad motherfucker.

                                     ROCCO
                         I don't wanna die!!!!!

               Murphy is aching to help but Connor is more steady. A man 
               who has been shot starts to regain consciousness. Connor 
               turns his back to shoot him (slo-mo). Murphy sees his 
               opportunity, pulls the cue ball from the table, and rolls it 
               silently across the carpet toward Rocco.

               Connor fires with his left hand and as the casing ejects 
               from the gun he catches it in mid air and makes the sign of 
               the cross. Rocco is on his back, the man is straddling him.

               They both have each others throats and are trying to strangle 
               one another. When the ball is within arms reach, Rocco slams 
               his hand down on it and knocks his assailant in the skull.

               He straddles him and begins to mercilessly beat his face in 
               with the cue ball, yelling "You sick fuck!"

               He finally stops, gets up, runs toward the boys, and throws 
               an exhausted punch at Connor who just lays Roc down on the 
               pool table and says, "Nicely done, boy". Murphy tends to 
               Roc. Connor checks out the man and seems surprised.

               Murphy takes the bloody cue ball from Rocco's hand and 
               polishes it off on his jacket, making sure Connor cannot 
               see. He replaces it perfectly on the table. Smecker now stands 
               in front of the table with the cue shining in the background.

                                     SMECKER
                         I've never seen wounds like these 
                         before, but whatever he used on this 
                         guy, it was a blunt object and they 
                         took it with them.

               Smecker exits to the left as Greenly enters from the right, 
               following Smecker out. He walks by the table furiously 
               scribbling in his notebook. Connor, Murphy and Rocco exit 
               the room, pennies in the eyes of all the corpses in the 
               background. Rocco holds two duffle bags full of poker money.

               Greenly stops, picks up the cue ball and looks at the dead 
               man. He shakes his head and says, "Nah".

               EXT.  SUBURBAN "BEAVER CLEAVER" TYPE HOUSE  FRONT LAWN  DAY

               Smecker stands in the middle of the front lawn. His hair is 
               a mess. He's chain-smoking. His clothes are disheveled.

               His eyes are psychotic. He points to the parked Taurus as 
               six men in dark suits appear in a fuzzy, out-of-focus shot.

               They line up shoulder to shoulder on the sidewalk.

                                     SMECKER
                         They exited out the front door. And 
                         they had no fucking idea what they 
                         were in for.

               EXT.  SUBURBAN "BEAVER CLEAVER" TYPE HOUSE  FRONT LAWN  DAY

               Rocco, Connor and Murphy walk toward the front door.

               EXT.  SUBURBANK "BEAVER CLEAVER" TYPE HOUSE  SIDEWALK  DAY

               (Slo-mo) Two black leather boots slowly walk up the sidewalk 
               and stop in front of the new, gray Ford Taurus then turn 
               toward the house. Il Duce removes a white balloon filled 
               with a few ounces of fluid from the pocket of his black trench 
               coat. He throws it on the walk, the blood splatters. He picks 
               up the remnants of the balloon and puts them back in his 
               pocket and stands there waiting, looking at the house.

               EXT.  SUBURBAN "BEAVER CLEAVER" TYPE HOUSE  FRONT STOOP  DAY

               The boys come out, Rocco in the middle and slightly ahead of 
               them. They look out to the walk, stunned.

                                     SMECKER
                         Now they are staring at six guys 
                         with guns drawn. It was a fucking 
                         ambush.

               Our three heroes stand, their jaws dropping as their point 
               of view reveals the Il Duce, standing alone, his hands folded 
               in front of him.

               Suddenly, he throws open his trench coat to reveal a special 
               leather vest beneath. Six guns, all different, are holstered 
               on the front of it: three on each side extend from just below 
               his collar bones to his abdomen. Connor and Murphy don't 
               hesitate. They each draw one of their now unsilenced guns 
               from their shoulder holsters and aim, one arm over each of 
               Rocco's shoulders. The Duke draws his top two weapons and 
               aims.

                                     SMECKER
                         And this was a fucking bomb dropping 
                         in Beaver Cleaverville! For a few 
                         seconds this place was Armageddon! 
                         There was a fire fight!

               They all start shooting at once. The noise is deafening.

               The Taurus is being pierced and the front of the house is 
               splintering as it is riddled with bullets. Smecker is still 
               in the middle, hands raised to the heavens, turning circles.

               Rocco's pinky finger gets shot off, sending blood splattering 
               against the house. He dives in the bushes reeling. He pulls 
               a gun and starts firing.

               Murphy catches a bullet in the arm and dives for the bushes 
               as well. Il Duce with lightening speed, drops the guns and 
               pulls the next two down as he walks to his right about ten 
               feet. He commences firing and the casings hit the sidewalk, 
               all different calibers and sizes are dropping down the walk.

               It's him and Connor and nobody is backing down. They both 
               grind their teeth as they fire rapidly at each other. At the 
               same moment, The Duke gets hit in the arm and Connor takes a 
               bullet in the leg. The firing ceases for a moment.

               Connor remains steady and Il Duce looks down at his arm and 
               his own blood splattered on the sidewalk.

                                     IL DUCE
                         No!... No! No!...

               He drops the guns and pulls the last two as he moves to the 
               right. He fires with wrath as he screams the word No over 
               and over. Rocco and Murphy return fire from the bushes yelling 
               and swearing, as Connor does the same from his position on 
               the stoop.

               The Duke turns and runs, leaving a sea of casings, and guns 
               that extend for 35 feet down the walk. There are also two 
               blood stains.

               In a frenzy the boys and Rocco get up and withdraw some spray 
               bottles from their bags. The begin spraying all their own 
               blood stains on the stoop and the front of the white house.

               They then pick up their things and run off.

               EXT. SUBURBAN "BEAVER CLEAVER" TYPE HOUSE  FRONT LAWN  DAY

               Smecker comes back to reality and lights a cigarette in front 
               of Dolly, Duffy, and Greenly.

                                     GREENLY
                         What if it was just one guy with six 
                         guns?

                                     SMECKER
                         Why don't you let me do the thinking, 
                         huh, genius?

               He turns to the forensics guys at the front of the house and 
               begins to walk over to him.

                                     SMECKER
                         What is taking so long with those 
                         blood samples?

                                     FORENSICS WOMAN #1
                         I can't get a good sample. There is 
                         variable here I'm not seeing.

               Smecker puts his finger through a big blood stain on the 
               door and smells it.

                                     SMECKER
                              (in shock, and rage)
                         They used ammonia... none of this 
                         shit is any good... Fuck... You know 
                         what this means?! Even if we get 
                         suspects in this case, we got 
                         nothing... Nothing!

               He starts kicking the bushes and trying to tear them with 
               his hands as he rages. The police and forensics all back 
               off.

                                     SMECKER
                              (screaming)
                         Who the fuck are they?! I've never 
                         seen any-fucking-thing like this in 
                         my whole fucking life. Who the fuck 
                         are they?!!

               He backs against the building and slides down to a sitting 
               position in the bushes as if he has given up. He raises his 
               head and there he sees Rocco's pinky finger lying undiscovered 
               in the bushes. He pulls a small plastic bag from his pocket 
               and scoops it up. He shoves it back into his pocket and races 
               off.

                                     DUFFY
                         What? That's it?!

               INT.  ROCCO'S MOM'S KITCHEN  NIGHT

               Rocco, Connor, and Murphy are sitting around the table.

               They are numb with pain and silently sipping beers. Suddenly, 
               Smecker comes on the news making an announcement that he is 
               heading up the investigation to find the three of them.

               Rocco shuts it off.

                                     CONNOR
                         Shit.

                                     ROCCO
                         What?
                              (points to TV)
                         What, that guy?

                                     MURPHY
                         That's the guy that got us off the 
                         hook with the "Checkov" thing.

                                     CONNOR
                         And he is one smart man.

                                     ROCCO
                         They got nothing.

                                     CONNOR
                         This guy is very sharp. If he hasn't 
                         figured us out yet, he will.

                                     MURPHY
                         You bet your ass he will.

                                     ROCCO
                         Well, I'd say that makes him a lia-
                         fuckin-bility.

               The boys look at each other.

                                     CONNOR
                         He isn't to be touched.

                                     MURPHY
                         He's a good man.

                                     ROCCO
                         Okay... whatever.
                              (looking at the bloody 
                              mess)
                         My Mom's gonna kill me.

               INT.  SMECKER'S BEDROOM  NIGHT

               Smecker is sitting at a computer terminal. He has just hooked 
               into the F.B.I.'s computer network with his authorization 
               code. He is disgusted as he puts on surgical gloves and finger 
               prints the severed finger onto a scanner. He waits for a 
               moment. Rocco's face and rap sheet come up on his screen. He 
               is in disbelief.

                                     SMECKER
                         No. This is all wrong. David Della 
                         Rocco?

               FLASHBACK  EXT.  POLICE STATION FRONT STEPS

               Rocco on the steps of the police station when Rocco brought 
               the boys their clothes.

               BACK TO PRESENT  INT.  SMECKER'S BEDROOM  NIGHT

               He picks up the phone.

                                     MARIA (V.O.)
                         Boston Police Department.

                                     SMECKER
                         Yeah. Maria, this is Smecker. Could 
                         you find me the visitor's list for 
                         the day the MacManus brothers were 
                         in and read me all the names?

               She reads a few names then hits David Della Rocco.

                                     SMECKER
                         Okay, thank you.

               He hangs us, puts in a smoke, and knocks his head back in 
               deep thought.

               INT.  GAY BAR  NIGHT

               Smecker is drinking like a fiend. He is disturbed and rowdy.

               He's a bad drunk. He downs a shot and motions for another 
               one. The BARTENDER comes over.

                                     BARTENDER
                         You've had quite a bit, Paul. Are 
                         you sure you...

                                     SMECKER
                         Pour the drink, faggot-ass!

               He obeys. A good looking gay man comes up and whispers in 
               Smecker's ear and points to the back room.

                                     SMECKER
                         Okay... But I don't cuddle.

               They proceed to the back. Smecker is stumbling.

               EXT.  STREET IN FRONT OF CHURCH  EARLY MORNING

               Rocco pulls Vincenzo's car to the curb and the MacManus' 
               exit.

                                     ROCCO
                         Hey! We gotta talk about this early 
                         morning church shit.

                                     MURPHY
                         We have to go now.
                              (giggles)
                         We're on the lamb.

               EXT.  STREET IN FRONT OF THE GAY BAR  EARLY MORNING

               Smecker staggers out of the bar. He is an absolute wreck.

               Rocco exits a package store just down the street. He is 
               opening a new pack of cigarettes. He is surprised when he 
               sees Smecker at the other end of the block. He follows the 
               stumbling agent, fumbling for his gun.

               EXT.  STREET IN FRONT OF CHURCH  EARLY MORNING

               Paul sees a church and reflects for a moment before crossing 
               the street and going in, Rocco a safe distance behind.

               INT.  CHURCH  EARLY MORNING

               Connor and Murphy are at prayer in the back of the church.

               It is mostly empty because of the early hour.

               Connor looks up and sees Smecker and Rocco way up in the 
               front. His eyes are ablaze. He is up and walking and does 
               not bother Murphy, who remains penitent. There are two 
               confessional booths with a priest booth in the middle.

               Smecker goes in the booth on the far left. Rocco tries the 
               door, it's locked. A middle-aged PRIEST slips a key in the 
               priests booth and opens the door. Rocco shoves him in and 
               goes in behind him. Connor has quickened his pace. He tries 
               both doors. They're locked. He goes into the confessional on 
               the right.

               INT.  CHURCH  PRIEST'S BOOTH  EARLY MORNING

               Rocco puts his gun to the priest's head.

                                     ROCCO
                         You gonna do what I say, got it?

                                     PRIEST
                         Yes.

                                     ROCCO
                         I'm sorry you're gonna hafta see 
                         this. Don't look at me!

                                     PRIEST
                         I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't see.

                                     ROCCO
                         Shut up! Shut the fuck up!

               INT.  CHURCH  CONNOR'S CONFESSIONAL  EARLY MORNING

               Connor is furiously working his fingers through the lattice 
               work to open the slider to the priest's booth from his side.

               INT.  CHURCH  PRIEST'S BOOTH  EARLY MORNING

               Rocco takes the priest and puts his face in front of the 
               slider to Smecker's booth, gun to the back of his head.

                                     PRIEST
                         Don't do this my son.

                                     ROCCO
                         Open it!

                                     PRIEST
                         Have you no fear of God?

                                     ROCCO
                         That's who I'm doing this for, now 
                         open the fuckin' thing.

               Connor gets the slider open. Rocco's long hair hangs just 
               inches from Connor's face. Connor puts his thumb and 
               forefinger through, desperately reaching for a lock of Rocco's 
               hair. Rocco jostles the priest and puts the gun hard to his 
               head.

                                     ROCCO
                         Father, I'll do you right here.

                                     PRIEST
                              (slowly obey, 
                              whispering)
                         God have mercy on my soul.

               Rocco starts to move the priest aside and put his gun to 
               Smecker's now open slider.

               Just then Connor snags a piece of Rocco's hair and pulls him 
               back hard and fast by it, until his head slams into the 
               lattice work. Rocco grabs the priest back into position.

               Connor grabs a nice wad of Rocco's hair with his left hand, 
               so that the side of Rocco's face is now pressed to the 
               lattice. Connor then puts a gun to Rocco's head.

                                     CONNOR
                              (hard whisper)
                         You little fuck. Let him go. I'll 
                         drop you right here.

                                     ROCCO
                         Okay, just calm down. He could hurt 
                         us, brother. He could ruin the whole 
                         thing.

                                     CONNOR
                         Let him go or I will deliver you, 
                         right now.
                              (pulls hammer back)

                                     ROCCO
                         You won't do it Connor, you won't. 
                         You love me man.

               INT.  CHURCH CONFESSIONAL BOOTHS  EARLY MORNING

               Smecker wakes up from a drunken stupor. He looks through the 
               slider window at the barely discernible face of the now crying 
               priest.

                                     SMECKER
                              (slurred, loud)
                         Hello? You there?

                                     PRIEST
                         Y-Yes my son.

                                     ROCCO
                              (whispers)
                         Do your thing Father. Don't fuck 
                         this up.

                                     PRIEST
                              (whispering to Rocco)
                         What do you want me to say?

                                     ROCCO
                         Just be natural, goddamit.

                                     PRIEST
                         How long since your last confession, 
                         my son?

                                     SMECKER
                         Oh, Christ, uh, I've never confessed.

               The priest can hear Connor and Rocco whisper, but Smecker 
               cannot.

                                     SMECKER
                         According to the dogma of the Catholic 
                         church, I should probably burst into 
                         flames right here in this booth. But 
                         I've come here for advice, not 
                         salvation.

               Connor and Rocco stop and listen now.

                                     PRIEST
                         Why have you come to a church for 
                         council if you're not religious?

                                     SMECKER
                              (ponderous)
                         Why have I come to a church? I never 
                         have before. I guess I just... felt 
                         I should.

                                     PRIEST
                         What is it my son?

                                     SMECKER
                         It's ethics. I put evil men behind 
                         bars, but the law has miles of red 
                         tape and loopholes for these... 
                         cocksuckers to slip through. I've 
                         found out there are these two young 
                         men who fix the situation with an 
                         iron fist. As if they have God's 
                         permission. But what they do is wrong 
                         and I should arrest them... 
                         technically.

                                     PRIEST
                         God's permission? God doesn't...

               Rocco shakes the priest.

                                     SMECKER
                         But in this day and age I believe 
                         what they do is... necessary. I feel 
                         it is... correct.

                                     PRIEST
                         You believe?

                                     SMECKER
                         Yes.

                                     PRIEST
                         You feel?

                                     SMECKER
                         Yes.

                                     PRIEST
                         You feel? A soul is what gives you 
                         feelings. Happiness, guilt, right or 
                         wrong. It is a conduit through which 
                         the Lord speaks to us. You felt that 
                         your answers would be here in the 
                         house of God today. You feel these 
                         men are necessary. The Lord has spoken 
                         to you twice this day.

               Rocco and Connor show their individual looks of surprise.

                                     SMECKER
                              (sarcastically)
                         Has he now?

                                     PRIEST
                         You have entered the house of the 
                         Lord of your own free will speaking 
                         of beliefs and feelings. Is it so 
                         much to believe that God has brought 
                         you here?

                                     SMECKER
                         I guess not.

                                     PRIEST
                         It is easy to be sarcastic about 
                         religion. It is harder to take small 
                         hints from God, your feelings and 
                         listen to them... to take a stand.

               The look of surprise on Rocco and Connor's faces show that 
               the priest is doing a hell of a job.

                                     SMECKER
                         You're right.

                                     PRIEST
                         Those who do not act are in a constant 
                         state of ethical indecision.

                                     SMECKER
                         I want to stand for what I believe 
                         in, father.

                                     PRIEST
                         Then you must find out what your 
                         beliefs are.

                                     SMECKER
                         I believe these young men are right.

                                     PRIEST
                         You know them personally?

                                     SMECKER
                         Yes.

                                     PRIEST
                         Do you think they would harm an 
                         innocent man, for any reason?

                                     SMECKER
                         No. They would never do that.

               The priest starts to show signs of anger as he starts turning 
               to Rocco.

                                     SMECKER
                         Well, the two Irish guys wouldn't. 
                         But the Italian guy, he might. He's 
                         kind of an idiot.

               Fear returns to the priests face. Rocco presses the gun hard 
               to the priests head and jostles him.

                                     ROCCO
                              (whispers to priest)
                         Goddam right, I am.

                                     SMECKER
                         I'm beginning to see. I've been doing 
                         my job... well for fifteen years and 
                         it's just not enough. All the things 
                         I wish I could do, these guys are 
                         doing. Millions of dollars in tax 
                         payers' money wasted on shit like 
                         wire taps and surveillance. Theses 
                         boys go in and take care of it for 
                         the price of a bullet.
                              (looks up)
                         Ww-what do you think I should do? 
                         Because I'm a law man.

               Rocco jostles the priest again.

                                     PRIEST
                         The laws of God are higher than the 
                         laws of man.

                                     SMECKER
                              (the clouds have lifted)
                         Yes! Yes! I was thinking that, too. 
                         No. I was feeling it. All I needed 
                         was to hear you say it! Amen! I'll 
                         help them.

                                     PRIEST
                              (whispers)
                         Forgive me father.

                                     SMECKER
                         Thank you, Father, thank you.
                              (he attempts the sign 
                              of the cross but 
                              screws it up)
                         Whatever. Goodbye, amen.

               Smecker exits and they all let go after a brief pause. Rocco 
               turns and starts fixing up the priest's ruffled suit.

                                     ROCCO
                         I wouldn't have, uh, killed you, 
                         Father. 
                              (signs cross)
                         Dominus Ominus. Remember, you're 
                         bound. You can't talk about this... 
                         to anyone.

                                     PRIEST
                         Just go!

               INT.  CHURCH  EARLY MORNING

               Rocco exits the booth and shuts the door behind him. Connor 
               is standing outside, hands on his hips. Rocco smiles at him 
               as Connor fumes.

                                     ROCCO
                              (giggling)
                         The Lord works in mysterious ways.

               Connor slaps him in the back of the head and kicks him in

               We shoot alternating coverage between the two locations.

                         Well, the light caught the side of 
                         his face for a second. And it looked 
                         like he had a gray beard, maybe... 
                         late fifties, early sixties.

                         So you're telling me it was one guy 
                         with six guns? A-and he was a senior 
                         fucking citizen?

                                     CONNOR
                         I think it's better if we find this 
                         man before he finds us again.

                         in touch with you?

                         right in the comfort of his own home. 
                         Then we move on to New York. It's 
                         getting a bit hot for us here.

               INT.  RITZY RESTAURANT BATHROOM  NIGHT

               Smecker stands beside Augustus, just the way Yakavetta did.

                                     AUGUSTUS
                         I don't know who he is. Nobody does.

               Smecker tosses an envelope of cash in his plate, just as 
               Yakavetta did.

                         Needed an outsider. The package boy 
                         knows everyone. He'd spot our hitters 
                         a mile away.

                         his guys, right? He's scared of the 
                         kid. Says he's real good, got every 
                         available gun in the city up there.

                         Up his house. I don't know what's 
                         going on but I know it's gotta have 
                         something to do with this kid.

               INT.  YAKAVETTA'S HOUSE  BASEMENT HALL  NIGHT

               There are several bodies in the hall, some with pennies in 
               their eyes, some without. Down the dark basement halls there 
               is more gore. The boys and Rocco can be heard screaming from 
               a room in the basement. Yakavetta's voice is heard yelling 
               and in command.

               INT.  YAKAVETTA'S HOUSE  BASEMENT ROOM  NIGHT

               Connor, Murphy, and Rocco are all hand cuffed to chairs in 
               the seated position. Their clothes are ripped and they have 
               been beaten severely. Blood covers them. Rocco has been 
               uncuffed and two men hold his open hand up as Yakavetta puts 
               a pistol at the base of his remaining pinky finger. Several 
               other hold him down as he and the boys scream in tough 
               protest.

                                     YAKAVETTA
                              (yelling)
                         You gonna tell me what's going on 
                         here?! Huh! You little fuck! Gimme 
                         some answers!

               They all yell for him to fuck off. Although Rocco is 
               terrified, he is holding out. Yakavetta fires and Rocco's 
               finger is gone. The blood splatters on Connor's face. Rocco 
               screams in pain saying fuck you through his sobs. After re-
               cuffing Rocco, Yakavetta and his goons exit.

               INT.  YAKAVETTA'S HOUSE  BASEMENT HALL  NIGHT

               Yakavetta is in the hall with four men. GENO (35 yrs.) very 
               big. CHAPPY (22 yrs.) wears sunglasses even in the dark, 
               trying to look cool. HOJO (28 yrs.) is slick and good-looking.

               Another Mafioso cohort is with them as well.

                                     YAKAVETTA
                         What do you guys think?

                                     GENO
                         They're tough. No way they're gonna 
                         talk.

                                     HOJO
                         I know Rocco. He ain't smart enough 
                         for this shit. These other guys are 
                         the brains. He's just a player.

                                     YAKAVETTA
                         There's only one way to get them to 
                         talk.

               INT.  YAKAVETTA'S HOUSE  BASEMENT ROOM  NIGHT

               He walks back into the room. He saunters up to Rocco very 
               nonchalantly and shoots him in the chest. His chair is blown 
               back to the floor. The boys are screaming and crying as 
               Yakavetta walks out.

                                     ROCCO
                              (struggles to talk)
                         You guys?

                                     CONNOR
                              (crying)
                         We're here brother.

                                     ROCCO
                         You gotta keep going.

                                     MURPHY
                              (sobbing)
                         We'll keep going, Roc.

                                     ROCCO
                         You'll make it outta here. You can't 
                         ever stop, not ever.

               As Rocco dies, they fall into prayer.

               INT.  YAKAVETTA'S HOUSE  FRONT FOYER  NIGHT

               Yakavetta lights up a cigar and talks to his men.

                                     CHAPPY
                         Once you set him in motion, you can't 
                         call him off. He thinks it's still 
                         on.

               Yakavetta stops as if terrified with a thought.

                                     YAKAVETTA
                         Oh Jesus Christ!

                                     HOJO
                         What? I...

                                     YAKAVETTA
                         Hey, I don't have my name spray 
                         painted on the front of this house. 
                         There are no big pictures of me 
                         anywhere. If this guy thinks the job 
                         is still a go then I got green money 
                         says the mother fucker's out in the 
                         bushes already. I'm fucking gone! 
                         I'm leaving you guys to deal with 
                         this.

               The four guys are left alone. They all look far from confident 
               except for Geno.

                                     GENO
                         One fucking guy, so what.

                                     HOJO
                         Why don't you take the front.
                              (points)
                         You guys cover those other exits and 
                         if you see him, don't flag him down, 
                         just kill the mother fucker. I'm 
                         going back down to work on these 
                         pricks.

               INT.  YAKAVETTA'S HOUSE  BASEMENT ROOM  NIGHT

               Murphy has scootched his chair in front of Connor's. He has 
               his back to Connor.

               He stretches his neck over and bites at the collar of his p-
               coat. He gathers as much of the material in his mouth as he 
               can. He starts to yell, "Do it!" but it is muffled.

               Connor, still sobbing, begins to kick his brother's left 
               hand repeatedly. He turns it into a bloody piece of broken 
               meat as Murphy screams through the shirt. Finally, it is 

               broken enough and Murphy pulls it through the cuff.

               He stands and breaks the chair into pieces and grabs the 
               sharpest piece. Hojo enters and Murphy shoves the sharp stick 
               up through the bottom of his chin into his head. He drags 
               him around the room yelling mumbo jumbo into his face as 
               Connor jumps up and down in his chair in rage, wanting a 
               piece of the action.

               Murphy throws the man down and Connor proceeds to viciously 
               kick his dead body. The two have turned into barbarians.

               Murphy removes the man's two guns, shiny nickel-plated 45s.

               INT.  YAKAVETTA'S FRONT FOYER  NIGHT

               There is a knock at the door. Geno jumps with fright and 
               then looks out the peep hole. He sees a well-formed pair of 
               woman's breasts in a cheap dress. He opens the door. A 
               stunning blonde stands before him. She looks like a hooker.

               She wears a short, hot pink dress and a white scarf around 
               her neck, as well as six inch platform heels.

                                     SMECKER AS WOMAN
                         Joey Bevo sent me over. As 
                         entertainment.

               The woman speaks and it is apparent that this is actually 
               Smecker in drag.

                                     GENO
                         Listen baby. Tonight ain't the night

                              (beat)
                         Bevo's so great. Always sending us 
                         hot girls.

                         You look like you could use a quickie.

               Smecker kisses him full on the lips and rubs up against him.

               Geno is convinced. He brings her inside.

                                     GENO
                         Hey, Chappy!

                                     CHAPPY
                              (Chappy, emerges way 
                              down the hall)
                         What the fuck?

                                     GENO
                         I ain't been laid in a week. Take 
                         five minutes.

                                     CHAPPY
                         If I die cause you're getting a piece 
                         of ass, I'll come back and beat you 
                         to death with a big rubber dick.

               INT.  YAKAVETTA'S HOUSE  NIGHT

               He takes Smecker into a small bathroom adjoining the foyer.

               They are instantly in the throws of passion. They grope each 
               other and Smecker cleverly avoids any contact with his crotch. 
               Smecker lies down on the floor and starts to wiggle and 
               seductively touch himself. Geno stands over him, straddling 
               Smecker's hips as he undoes his pants. Suddenly, Smecker 
               grabs both of Geno's ankles and has him locked in position. 
               He repeatedly kicks Geno in the balls from his lying position 
               on the floor. The guy falls on his back unconscious. Smecker 
               uses a silencer, shoots him in the head.

               INT.  YAKAVETTA'S HOUSE  HALL  NIGHT

               He starts to whisper, "It's on now. It's on now. Too far." 
               as he walks down the hall, striding in his high heels, wig 
               back in place. He thoughtlessly blows Chappy away as he passes 
               his position and runs down a long hallway. He turns a corner 
               and points his gun at the Mafioso cohort but pauses.

               He is already sitting with his throat cut. Smecker looks 
               puzzled as Il Duce withdraws from the shadows behind him.

               The Duke pistol whips Smecker. He's out.

               INT.  YAKAVETTA'S HOUSE  BASEMENT ROOM  NIGHT

               Connor and Murphy are on their knees in front of Rocco, whom 
               they have sat back up in the chair. They are gently placing 
               pennies in his eye and sobbing as they begin to recite the 
               prayer. As they speak, Il Duce watches. He then begins to 
               whisper the prayer right along with them. Their words match 
               up perfectly. He leans against the wall, holsters his guns, 
               and withdraws a cigarette.

               He rolls it along his tongue and twists it into his lips.

               The boys are still reciting as he strikes a match. They react 
               instantly. Still kneeling they each point a nickel-plated 45 
               toward The Duke. They turn in time to see the light from the 
               match illuminate his face. Il Duce pauses then he strides 
               into the room and proceeds to recite the last half of the 
               prayer.

               He stops between the kneeling boys and finishes off the 
               prayer. The boys are stunned as they realize this is their 
               father. He makes the sign of the cross over Rocco. Then he 
               looks down to the upturned faces of his sons. He places a 
               hand on each of their cheeks.

               INT.  CHEAP BOSTON HOTEL ROOM  NIGHT  3 MONTHS LATER

               Both sleeping boys throw their arms out, mimicking a crucified 
               Christ. Their father turns, sees this, turns back.

               The boys wake with a start. Connor looks to his father, who 
               is already staring at him.

                                     CONNOR
                         How far are we going with this, Da?

                                     FATHER
                         The questions is not, "how far?" The 
                         question is, "Do you possess the 
                         constitution, the depth of faith to 
                         go as far as is needed?"

               INT.  COURTHOUSE  BACK FOYER AREA  MORNING

               Smecker opens the door from the inside and lets the MacManus 
               father and sons in. He walks one way they walk the other 
               through the grand courthouse halls.

               INT.  COURTROOM  MORNING

               The media, with their cameras and notebooks, are at the back 
               of the courtroom. Yakavetta is testifying on the stand. He 
               is cocky. The judge warns Yakavetta that he will have no 
               more of this behavior in his courtroom.

                                     MEDIA MAN 1
                              (whispering to #2)
                         Look at his charisma. He's the next 
                         John Gotti.

                                     MEDIA MAN 2
                         He'll walk. Even with all this 
                         evidence.

                                     MEDIA MAN 1
                         Look.
                              (points to the left 
                              and right sections 
                              of courtroom seating)
                         All Yakavetta's people are on the 
                         right. All the families of the men 
                         he has killed are on the left. 
                         Everyone wants some justice.

                                     MEDIA MAN 2
                         Look at him. He doesn't have a care 
                         in the world. He's gonna walk.

               INT.  FOYER TO COURTROOM  DAY

               The MacManusus stand in the foyer. There are a pair of doors 
               that go to the outside hallway and a pair that go to the 
               inside courtroom. There is an armed guard directly inside 
               the courtroom, in front of the doors.

               The door opens a crack and Connor waves the guard into the 
               foyer and starts talking to him. Then dad zaps him with a 
               stun gun. The guard is on the floor, incapacitated and 
               drooling as the boys handcuff him.

               Connor pulls out a length of chain and drapes it through the 
               door handles that lead from the hall into the foyer. He locks 
               them in with a padlock.

                                     FATHER
                         How long do these put a man down 
                         for?

                                     MURPHY
                         Ten minutes.

               The father zaps the incapacitated man a second time as he 
               lay.

                                     FATHER
                         Twenty is a bit better.

               They suit up, Connor and Murphy in their usual masks and 
               gloves, Dad is already in his usual dark hat and glasses.

               The boys start for the courtroom door but dad gently holds 
               them back. He takes a moment, then slowly removes his hat 
               and glasses. His sons look at one another and then remove 
               their masks. The three look into each others eyes for a 
               moment.

               INT.  COURTROOM  DAY

                                     JUDGE
                         Due to the lack of hard evidence......

               The three burst in, guns drawn, and are walking down the 
               aisle.

                                     FATHER
                         All media to the back! Drop the 
                         cameras! Drop 'em!

               Terrified, they all obey. Connor and Murphy pull Yakavetta 
               from the witness booth by his hair and place him on his knees 
               just before the judge's bench. They face him toward the 
               occupants of the courtroom. The father walks up and motions 
               for the judge, who is now banging his gavel and shouting in 
               protest, to come off the stand.

               As soon as he is within arms reach, dad takes him by the 
               collar and drags him down the aisle all the way to where the 
               media stands in horror. He turns and walks back down the 
               aisle.

                                     FATHER
                              (loudly)
                         You people have been chosen to reveal 
                         our existence to the world. You will 
                         witness what happens here today and 
                         you will tell of it afterwards.

               All eyes to the front.

                                     YAKAVETTA
                              (looking to his 
                              comrades)
                         Fuckin' do something!

               The father keeps them covered. He passes the front, he looks 
               and sees a VIRGINAL-LOOKING WOMAN with her head down crying 
               into her hands. She is on the left side. He gently tilts her 
               chin forward, her eyes fixated on a faded blue butterfly on 
               the back of his hand.

                                     FATHER (WHISPERS)
                              (whispers)
                         You must watch dear. It'll all be 
                         over soon. 
                              (she obeys)

               The father takes out a flask. He pours the booze on the judges 
               bench and set it ablaze. Fire alarms start to sound.

               Connor and Murphy jump up on the lawyers' tables. Murphy on 
               the prosecution side, Connor on the defense. The father has 
               his sawed-off to the back of Yakavetta's head.

                                     CONNOR
                              (yelling over the 
                              alarm)
                         Now, you will receive us.

                                     MURPHY
                              (yelling over the 
                              alarm)
                         We do not ask for your poor or your 
                         hungry.

                                     CONNOR
                         We do not want your tired and sick.

                                     MURPHY
                         It is your corrupt we claim.

                                     CONNOR
                         It is your evil, who will be sought 
                         by us.

                                     MURPHY
                         With every breath we shall hunt them 
                         down.

                                     CONNOR
                         Each day we will spill their blood 
                         till it rains down from the skies.

                                     MURPHY
                         Do not kill, do not rape, do not 
                         steal. These are principles which 
                         every man of every faith can embrace.

                                     CONNOR
                         These are not polite suggestions. 
                         They are codes of behavior and those 
                         that ignore them will pay the dearest 
                         cost.
                              (points to Yakavetta)

                                     MURPHY
                         There are varying degrees of evil. 
                         We urge you lesser forms of filth
                              (pointing to 
                              Yakavetta's people)
                         Not to push the bounds and cross 
                         over into true corruption... into 
                         our domain.

                                     CONNOR
                         For if you do, there will come the 
                         day when you look behind you and see 
                         we three. And on that day you will 
                         reap it.

                                     MURPHY
                         And we will send you to whatever God 
                         you wish.

               Connor and Murphy jump off the table. They approach Yakavetta 
               and stand on either side of their father. All three men hold 
               guns to his head and recite the prayer. As they speak, the 
               right side of the courtroom screams in protest. The left 
               watches in wide-eyed terror, although some men encourage 
               them to do it. The MacManus' read the prayer. They do not 
               falter as the flames rage behind them.

               Yakavetta, accepting his fate, closing his eyes. Peacefully, 
               he does the sign of the cross. The all fire at once. The 
               room explodes in confusion. The three exit the back.

               INT.  LONG CEMENT HALLWAY  SUBLEVEL OF COURTHOUSE

               The MacManuses are all shackled and in blue jumpsuits of the 
               Boston lock-up facility with bags over their heads. Duffy is 
               in full uniform with a shotgun behind them. Smecker is leading 
               the prisoners down the hall. He flashes his F.B.I. 
               identification to every cop he encounters.

               INT.  COURTHOUSE INSIDE GRANDE FOYER STEPS  DAY

               The media is in a frenzy. Little bits of the story are known.

               The people from the left and right sides of the courtroom 
               are yelling and pushing each other as cameras and microphones 
               try to pick up the news. Finally all the focus comes to the 
               virginal woman who had been sitting in the front row. All 
               lights, cameras and microphones are on her.

                                     REPORTER 2 (V.O.)
                         Yes! Were you in the courtroom miss? 
                         Did you see?

                                     WOMAN (FRAIL)
                              (frail)
                         Yes. I was there.

                                     REPORTER (V.O.)
                         How do you feel about what they did?

               (Slo-mo) She sees at the grande hall's end Smecker leading 
               the three out, bags still over their heads. She sees Dad's 
               butterfly tattoo. She knows.

                                     WOMAN
                         I guess we all know what is right 
                         and wrong. We all know. Nobody needs 
                         to be convinced of what he was... 
                         I'm going home now to have my first 
                         real full night's sleep.

               The people who had been on Yakavetta's side of the courtroom 
               threaten her and force their way through the crowd toward 
               her, thus causing the two sides to fight. Everyone, even 
               reporters are in it. The camera tilts up ending on the statue 
               of the Blind Lady of Justice.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

       screenplay by Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson




EXT. ALLEY. DAY

ANTHONY and DIGNAN walk down an alley behind a convenience
store. Anthony's nineteen. He's got on a red jacket with an
Enco patch. Dignan's twenty. He has a buzz-cut and wears a
short-sleeved terrycloth shirt. He carries a vinyl tennis
bag. It's got a pouch for a racquet but no racquet in it.

                         DIGNAN
            What color hair does he have?

                         ANTHONY
            Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.

                         DIGNAN
            Making Hutch David Soul?

                         ANTHONY
            Right. The blond guy.

                         DIGNAN
            OK. That's wrong.

                         ANTHONY
            Dignan, it's --

                         DIGNAN
            Plus where's Huggie Bear?

                         ANTHONY
            He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't
            in every single episode.

                         DIGNAN
            I think you might of dreamed this
            one, Anthony.

                         ANTHONY
            No. It's a real episode. The killer
            is leading him across the city by
            calling different pay phones.

They climb over a high wooden fence.

EXT. BACKYARD. DAY

They walk through somebody's backyard.

                         DIGNAN
            Why?

                         ANTHONY
            As part of his plan. I don't know
            why.

                         DIGNAN
            See, that's what I'm saying. It has
            the logic of a dream.

                         ANTHONY
            The point is the killer always
            goes, May I speak to Starsky? He
            says his name.

                         DIGNAN
                   (pause)
            What does Starsky say?

                         ANTHONY
            He says. This is he.

                         DIGNAN
            This is he?

                         ANTHONY
            No. This is he.

They climb another fence. There's big house on the other side.

INT. HOUSE. DAY

Anthony and Dignan are inside walking through the foyer.
Anthony goes up the stairway quickly and quietly.

Dignan walks to the master bedroom. Goes in the closet and
grabs a box. Looks inside. Dumps it into his bag.

Anthony goes into a bedroom. Looks in a dresser and takes
out two watches. Digs through some socks and finds some cash.

Dignan goes in the study. Opens a drawer and closes it.
Opens another and lifts out a set of thin leather coin books.

Anthony's in a kid's room. Looking at posters of a football
player and John McEnroe on the walls. He grabs a walkman and
a calculator. Then suddenly stops moving. He crouches down.
Looks at a shelf of dozens of little metal soldiers. They're
in formations with different uniforms.

Dignan is walking down the hallway as Anthony comes down the
stairs. They walk to the door and go out.

INT. DINER. DAY

A twenty-four hour diner. Anthony and Dignan are eating at
the counter.

                         ANTHONY
            Did you see what I meant about the
            window?

                         DIGNAN
            Kind of. Except we've already got
            the keys.

                         ANTHONY
            That's true. But what if they
            change the locks?

                         DIGNAN
            Would they do that?

                         ANTHONY
            Who knows? That's why I filed it
            down.

Dignan nods.

                         ANTHONY
            Now that window can never be locked.
            It's impossible.

                         DIGNAN
            See, your mind is very good with
            the more mechanical details.
            Whereas my strength would be --

A good-looking WOMAN about forty-five years old interrupts
them.

                         WOMAN
            Can I use your Tabasco?

                         ANTHONY
            Sure.

Anthony hands her a bottle of Tabasco off the counter. She
walks away. Down the counter.

                         ANTHONY
            You don't see many women who like
            Tabasco.

They watch her for a minute. Dignan looks away.

                         ANTHONY
            She's really kind of hot.

                         DIGNAN
                   (looks back at her, nods)
            She's an attractive older woman.

EXT. BOB'S HOUSE. DAY

A huge house with a wide lawn. BOB, who's about twenty-six,
wearing black jeans and a V-neck T-shirt, is spraying down a
battered 1972 Mercedes with a garden hose. He's got his
shirt off and a towel around his neck. Dignan has an
expression of intense concentration as he looks at the car.

                         BOB
            Well, what do you think?

                         DIGNAN
            I don't know, Bob. What about one
            of those?

Dignan points to a new BMW and a Lexus in front of the garage.

                         BOB
            I'm not allowed to drive those.

                         DIGNAN
            Not even for emergencies?

                         BOB
                   (a little angry)
            No.

                         DIGNAN
            I thought your parents were in Italy.

                         BOB
            They are.

                         DIGNAN
            So who's going to know?

                         BOB
            My brother.

                         ANTHONY
            Future Man.

                         BOB
            Who?

                         ANTHONY
            Futute Man. You know. Cause he
            looks like he's from the future.

                         DIGNAN
            He looks like he was designed by
            scientists. For desert warfare.

                         BOB
            That never would of --

                         DIGNAN
            Let's cut the bullshit.

Silence. They all look at the car. Pause.

                         ANTHONY
            It's got a V-8, Dignan.

                         DIGNAN
            What do you think the cops have?

INT. BOB'S HOUSE. DAY

They're sitting at the coffee table in Bob's great big
living room. It's got high ceilings and two Persian rugs.
They're eating sandwiches and chips.

                         BOB
            If you're that worried, maybe we
            should just steal one.

                         DIGNAN
            What are you talking about, Bob?

                         BOB
            Can you use a coaster.

Bob slides a coaster under Dignan's glass.

                         ANTHONY
            Did you ever steal a car bdfore?

                         BOB
            Yeah. I've stolen two cars before.
            One Jaguar. And one Trans-Am. With
            T-Tops. That Trans-Am was fun to
            drive.

                         DIGNAN
            You stole a Trans-Am.

                         BOB
            Yes. I did.

                         DIGNAN
            OK, Bob.

                         BOB
            It's true, Dignan.

                         DIGNAN
            Well. What do you want to do? You
            want to steal one or just drive
            your car?

                         BOB
                   (thinks for a minute)
            I'll just drive my car.

INT. DELI. DAY

Anthony's playing pinball at a machine in the back of a
little grocery store. Dignan's watching.

                         DIGNAN
            Anthony, we'll get two hundred for
            the coin collection alone. That's
            less than what it's appraised at.

                         ANTHONY
            But Dignan, do you really know that
            much about rare coins?

                         DIGNAN
            I know about money, Anthony. I know
            the value of money. Plus the
            earrings are worth three times that.

Anthony looks at Dignan. Dignan points at the pinball machine.

                         DIGNAN
            Your ball.

Dignan tries to hit the flipper.

                         ANTHONY
            I told you not to take the earrings.

Anthony keeps looking at Dignan. Dignan doesn't look up from
the machine. Anthony turns and walks away.

                         DIGNAN
            You got another ball.

Dignan watches him go.

                         DIGNAN
            I'm playing your game.

EXT. SIDEWALK. DAY

They're walking fast down the sidewalk.

                         ANTHONY
            The list, Dignan. I know you
            remember the list because you
            signed it. "Things Dignan was not
            supposed to touch."

                         DIGNAN
            Every valuable item in the house
            was on that list.

                         ANTHONY
            That doesn't make any difference. I
            bought those earrings for my mother
            on her birthday. They have a very
            special value for her.

                         DIGNAN
            Yeah, but I can't be sorting
            through that shit in the middle of
            a burglary. There's just not time
            for it.

                         ANTHONY
            Then you shouldn't of gone in
            there, Dignan. Maybe we should of
            robbed your house. Did you ever
            think of that?

Dignan stops walking. Anthony looks back at him. Pause.

                         ANTHONY
            What?

Dignan turns and starts walking the other way.

                         ANTHONY
            Where are you going?

                         DIGNAN
            I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.

                         ANTHONY
            How was I ridiculing you?

                         DIGNAN
            You're making fun of my family. You
            know there's nothing to steal from
            my mom and Craig. You know exactly
            what you're saying.

                         ANTHONY
            That's not what I meant, Dignan.

They both see something. They keep walking. Dignan looks
back down the sidewalk.

                         DIGNAN
            Did you see that?

                         ANTHONY
            Yeah, I saw it.

                         DIGNAN
            I'm lookout.

                         ANTHONY
            Dignan, it's got an alarm.

                         DIGNAN
            I don't think so. Just reach on in.

                         ANTHONY
            That sets it off.

                         DIGNAN
            No, just do it real quick.
                   (starts down the sidewalk)
            I'll meet you down there.

Dignan cuts into an alley. Anthony turns back. Looks at a
parked car. Looks left and right. Walks to the car and
reaches in the half-open window.

An alarm goes off. Anthony unlocks the door and opens it.
Leans inside. Grabs a wallet off the seat.

A MAN standing on the sidewalk watches Anthony get out of
the car. Anthony looks at him, then walks down the sidewalk
not too fast. He turns down an alley and runs.

EXT. ALLEY. DAY

Anthony comes around the corner and meets Dignan beside a
dumpster. The alarm is still ringing in the distance.
Anthony starts looking through the wallet.

                         ANTHONY
            It had an alarm.

                         DIGNAN
            Yeah, I heard that.

                         ANTHONY
                   (counting the money)
            Five, seven, eight dollars.

He looks at Dignan.

                         DIGNAN
                   (taking the wallet)
            Holy shit. What'd I tell you?

                         ANTHONY
            Eight dollars.

                         DIGNAN
            That's not bad.

Anthony keeps looking at Dignan. Dignan smiles. He hands
Anthony a five dollar bill. Anthony looks at it. He takes it.
He puts it in his pocket. Dignan puts out his hand to shake.
Anthony waits a second. He shakes Dignan's hand for just a
second and walks down the alley. Dignan smiles and walks
behind him.

INT. HAMBURGER PLACE. NIGHT

Anthony and Dignan are sitting at a table with Bob.

                         ANTHONY
            What do herbs have to do with it? I
            don't understand the --

                         BOB
            Pot is an herb. It's just like any
            type of gardening.

                         DIGNAN
            How much could you grow?
            Realistically.

                         BOB
            As much as I want. When these
            plants bud I'll probably have about
            six thousand dollars worth of weed.

                         DIGNAN
            Six thousand dollars? Come on, Bob.

                         BOB
            You should take a look. I have an
            entire crop in my backyard.

                         ANTHONY
            In your backyard? How do you
            protect them?

                         BOB
            It's private property. Plus I have
            Hector.

                         ANTHONY
            Hector woudn't do anything.

                         BOB
            But he's got a loud bark. That's
            the most important thing is a loud
            bark.

                         DIGNAN
            If it's that easy why doesn't
            everybody grow them?

                         BOB
            Good question.

Bob looks at Anthony and Dignan. He suddenly gets worried.

                         BOB
            Don't you guys tell anybody about
            my plants.

                         DIGNAN
            You're paranoid, Bob.

                         BOB
            Yeah, but don't tell anybody.

                         ANTHONY
            Could you grow cinnamon?

                         BOB
            I don't know. Sure, I guess.

                         ANTHONY
            You could make your own cinnamon
            toast.

Bob looks at Anthony for a second. He looks at Dignan. Back
at Anthony.

                         BOB
            Are you a fag?

                         LITTLE RICHARD
            You're the faggot.

Bob turns around to see LITTLE RICHARD, short but muscular,
wearing a down vest and a baseball cap.

                         BOB
            Little Richard. I don't believe it.
            They'll let anybody in this place.
            Sit down.

Little Richard sits down.

                         BOB
            Dignan and Anthony, this is Little
            Richard. He's crazy. Totally nuts.

                         LITTLE RICHARD
                   (smiling)
            I don't know about that.

                         BOB
            Little Richard. Trust me. You're
            insane. Jesus, this guy used to
            carry a percussion bomb around in
            his trunk. You do not want a guy
            like that loose on the streets.

                         LITTLE RICHARD
            It seemed like a good idea at the
            time.

                         BOB
            The one and only Little Richard.

                         DIGNAN
            Are you named after THE Little
            Richard?

                         LITTLE RICHARD
                   (stares at Dignan)
            Ha! Ha! Ha! Why don't you stick it
            up your ass. Great group of guys
            you're hanging out with.

Little Richard goes out the door.

                         DIGNAN
            What was that all about?

                         BOB
            I can't believe you said that.

                         DIGNAN
            What did I say?

                         BOB
            I told you he's crazy.

                         ANTHONY
            But he didn't say anything.

                         DIGNAN
            Hang on a second.

Dignan gets up and walks out of the restaurant. Anthony and
Bob look at each other. They start to get up.

EXT. HAMBURGER PLACE. NIGHT

Anthony and Bob go out the door. Dignan is walking over to a
station wagon. Little Richard is getting in.

                         DIGNAN
            Little Richard. Wait a second. Hang
            on. I didn't mean to --

Little Richard opens his door hard into Dignan's legs, then
gets out fast and takes off his shirt. Dignan tries to hit
him but doesn't connect. They grab onto each other and start
knocking around. Another GUY gets out of the station wagon.
Two more GUYS rush out the door of the burger place. Anthony
and Bob stand back, nervous.

                         ANTHONY
            Let them fight.

                         BOB
            Let them fight.

They all watch. Dignan keeps trying to punch Little Richard,
but he's hanging onto him too tight. They keep spinning
around together, moving down the sidewalk.

                         DIGNAN
                   (calling out)
            Anthony.

Anthony looks at the other guys then moves toward Dignan.

                         ANTHONY
            OK. Break it up. Break it up.

Little Richard lets go of Dignan. They separate.

                         DIGNAN
            I separated my shoulder.

Dignan is holding onto his arm. He kind of moans.

                         ANTHONY
            OK. Hang on.

Anthony grabs hold of Dignan's arm. Everybody's watching.

                         DIGNAN
            Just pull straight up.
Anthony pulls up hard on Dignan's arm. Dignan tries not to
yell, then suddenly he's OK and relieved.

                         ANTHONY
            Is it back in?

                         DIGNAN
                   (moving arm slowly)
            Yeah.

                         GUY #1
            OK, man. Let's go.

                         DIGNAN
            No. I'm not fighting anymore.

                         ANTHONY
            His shoulder went out, man. It's
            over.

                         GUY #2
            You guys better get out of here.

Guy #2 pushes Dignan. Anthony turns and pounds him in the
face. Right on the nose. The guy goes crosseyed. He falls
down with his legs all tangled-up in a strange position.

Everyone stands there stunned. Anthony takes a step back. He
looks up. He and Dignan take off. Bob stands there. Frozen.
Everyone looks at him. Bob looks at Little Richard.

                         LITTLE RICHARD
            Bob?

Bob takes off.

INT. CAR. DAY

The next day. They're driving with Bob. Dignan's up front.
He's banged-up from the fight.

                         DIGNAN
            The guy is fucking insane.

                         BOB
            I warned you, Dignan.

                         DIGNAN
            You said it like it was a big joke,
            Bob. Like he's wild.

                         BOB
            No, I was saying crazy like a
            lunatic.

                         DIGNAN
            I know that now. He's a fucking
            psycho.

                         BOB
            Well, don't blame me. I told you.

                         DIGNAN
            I do blame you, Bob. And woah. Look
            at her.

There's a beautiful GIRL on the sidewalk. They drive past her.

                         DIGNAN
            Loop around real fast.

                         ANTHONY
            Just turn right here.

Bob immediately turns and they drive past the girl again.
They don't say anything as they go past her. They all just
look at her. They drive on.

                                            CUT TO:

A minute later. They've looped back. They're looking for the
girl.

                         DIGNAN
            Where'd she go?

                         BOB
            Maybe she turned.

                         ANTHONY
            There she is.

She's on a side street. Bob hits the brakes hard. The girl
looks back at them. They back up a few feet and turn down
the street. They drive slowly toward the girl.

                         ANTHONY
            Bob, don't be so obvious.

The girl keeps looking back at them.

                         DIGNAN
            I think we might of scared her.

                         BOB
            Let's just go.

They come up, beside the girl. She looks right at them,
still walking.

Her expression is angry and also a little scared.

They drive away.

                         DIGNAN
            You blew it, Bob.

INT. COFFEE SHOP. DAY

Anthony, Dignan, and Bob are meeting with TEMPLE. Temple is
in his mid-fifties, short, heavy, completely expressionless
wide face. They listen intently as he briefs them on the
intricacies of firearms.

                         TEMPLE
            A gun is a firearm. A pistol is a
            firearm. But anything you hold in
            your hand is a weapon. A knife. A
            wrench. A ballpoint pen.

                         ANTHONY
            A ballpoiht pen?

                         TEMPLE
            Anyone who tells you a ballpoint
            pen is not a weapon needs intensive
            psychiatric treatment. You can
            stick them in the esophagus. You
            give them a ballpoint tracheotomy.

They nod seriously. Temple laughs.

EXT. FIELD. DAY

They're standing behind Temple's car in the middle of an
open pasture. The trunk is open. Temple's got some guns in
metal cases. They draw targets on pieces of paper. Anthony
draws a man running on his target. They fire a bunch of
different pistols. The last one they shoot's a .44 Magnum.
They buy it.

INT. BOB'S HOUSE. DAY

The TV room. There are two big couches and a nice giant TV.
The doors are open onto the balcony. The .44 is on the
coffee table. Dignan is sitting there with a map and some
diagrams laid out. Anthony and Bob are on either side of him.
Dignan's pointing at a notebook page with the heading
"Escape Route."

                         DIGNAN
            OK. Escape route. The most important
            thing you can have is an escape
            route. Just in case somebody's
            tailing us. Or even chasing us, as
            the case may be --

                         ANTHONY
            You think we're going to be chased?

                         DIGNAN
            That's a good question. No. I don't.
            I'm just being hypocritical here.
            However, I will say --

Bob reaches for the .44.

                         BOB
                   (quietly)
            I'm going to take a look at this.

                         DIGNAN
                   (puts hand on gun)
            Hang on This is important, Bob.
            Anthony and I are responsible for
            the internal situation. The money
            and the people. You're responsible
            for the external situation. The
            streets and the getaway.

                         BOB
                   (nods)
            That's my responsibility.

                         DIGNAN
            That's your domain.

                         BOB
            OK.

Anthony is making a little man out of a scrap of paper.

                         DIGNAN
            Now. One thing we need to discuss
            is timing. Timing is absolutely
            crucial. What are you doing? Anthony!

                         ANTHONY
                   (looks up)
            Nothing. Go ahead.

Bob picks up the gun.

                         BOB
                   (to himself)
            How many bullets can that hold?

Dignan grabs the gun away and sets it down out of Bob's reach.

                         DIGNAN
            Bob.

                         BOB
            I'm paying attention. I just want
            to look at it for a minute.

                         DIGNAN
                   (screaming)
            What's your fucking problem? You're
            a shithead!

                         BOB
            I just want to see how much bullets
            it takes.

Anthony picks up the gun off the table. He clicks the action.

                         DIGNAN
            Anthony, give me the fucking gun!

                         ANTHONY
                   (pulling away)
            No, Dignan. It's not your gun. It's
            all of ours.

                         BOB
                   (quietly)
            I paid for it.

                         DIGNAN
            God DAMMIT.

Dignan stands up, grabbing his papers.

                         DIGNAN
            You two just don't give a shit, do
            you?

Dignan starts out of the room. Anthony stands up.

                         ANTHONY
            Dignan, calm down.

                         DIGNAN
                   (turns back, screaming)
            You're out! I'm not working with
            either one of you!

                         ANTHONY
            Dignan! Stop!

Dignan stops. Looking at Anthony.

                         ANTHONY
            Calm down. Take a deep breath.

                         DIGNAN
                   (pause)
            You're right. You're right.

Dignan sits back down and starts spreading out his papers
again. Freezes. Looks at Bob. Bob's looking at the gun. Bob
looks at Dignan. Bob looks away. Nobody moves.

EXT. DECK. EVENING

Anthony and Dignan have moved outside to the hot tub.
Anthony pets Bob's dog HECTOR. Bob's brother FUTURE MAN
walks up the path from the driveway with his blonde
cheerleader GIRLFRIEND.

                         FUTURE MAN
            What are you guys doing?

                         ANTHONY
            Nothing. We're just --

                         FUTURE MAN
            You seen my brother?

                         DIGNAN
            He's inside.

Future Man goes inside. His girlfriend stands there on the
deck.

                         GIRLFRIEND
                   (smiles)
            Hi.

                         ANTHONY & DIGNAN
            Hi.

She stands there, looking across the yard. Anthony and
Dignan sit there in the hot tub, looking around. We hear
Future Man's loud voice inside:

                         FUTURE MAN
            Goddammit, Bob! Get your shit
            together.

Future Man comes back out. He stops by the hot tub.

                         FUTURE MAN
            What are you guys up to tonight?

                         ANTHONY
            Nothing much.

                         DIGNAN
            Just hanging around.

Future Man walks back out the gate.

                         GIRLFRIEND
            Bye.

She follows Future Man. Anthony and Dignan watch them walk
away. Bob comes back out with some drinks. He looks shaken.

                         DIGNAN
            What'd Future Man want?

Bob shrugs and gets in the hot tub. They sip on their drinks.
Bob's got a Heineken.

                         BOB
            He doesn't get it. Held never
            understand what we're trying to
            accomplish here. It's too dangerous
            for him.

                         DIGNAN
            Well, in reality it's not that
            dangerous, Bob. It's only dangerous
            if you don't know what you're doing.

                         BOB
            Yeah, but what if some nut pulled
            gun on you?

                         ANTHONY
            The only nut with a gun is going to
            be Dignan.

Anthony gets out of the hot tub and dives in the pool.

                         DIGNAN
                   (whispering, very serious)
            You know, Bob, Anthony did kill
            someone. He electrocuted our
            janitor senior year.

                         BOB
            He electrocuted someone?

                         DIGNAN
            It was an accidental. I don't want
            to go into the details. It was just
            one of those senior pranks that
            didn't really go right. I mean,
            obviously, since Swifty's dead.
            That's why Anthony never graduated.

                         BOB
            His name was Swifty?

                         DIGNAN
            Yeah. One of the nicest old guys
            you'd ever know.

                         BOB
            That's too bad.

                         DIGNAN
                   (nods)
            You know, when somebody gets
            electrocuted, their skin starts
            smoking. At least Swifty's did.

INT. CAR. NIGHT

Anthony, Dignan, and Bob are sitting in Bob's car, parked in
the dark. Bob's at the wheel. Anthony and Dignan are in the
back. Anthony has on a dark blue ski cap. Dignan's wearing a
baseball cap with the brim pulled down low. He puts a piece
of adhesive tape across his nose and hands the roll to
Anthony.

                         BOB
            What are you doing?

                         DIGNAN
            I'm putting a piece of tape on my
            nose.

Anthony tapes his nose. They stare out the windshield. The
alarm on Dignan's digital watch goes off.

                         DIGNAN
                   (immediately, dead serious)
            Let's get lucky.

EXT/INT. BOOKSTORE. NIGHT

Anthony and Dignan walk through the shadows in front of a
huge bookstore. The lights are on inside. They watch for a
minute and then go to the front door. Dignan hides behind a
post. Anthony knocks on the glass. An EMPLOYEE appears.

                         ANTHONY
            I left my sweater inside.

The employee shakes his head. He can't hear through the glass.

                         ANTHONY
            Do you have a lost and found?

The employee unlocks the door and opens it an inch.

                         EMPLOYEE
            We're closed.

                         ANTHONY
            I left my sweater in there.

                         EMPLOYEE
            Oh. I see. Come on in.

Anthony goes inside. Dignan comes out from behind the post.

                         EMPLOYEE
            We're closed, sir.

                         DIGNAN
            Where's that guy going?

                         EMPLOYEE
            He left his sweater.

                         DIGNAN
            Well, I left some money in there.

                         EMPLOYEE
            Where?

                         DIGNAN
                   (pulls out the gun)
            In the cash relister. Step away
            from the door.

Dignan goes in. They walk through the store.

                         ANTHONY
            Where's the manager?

                         DIGNAN
            Where's the other stocker?

                         ANTHONY
            There's another stocker, right?

                         DIGNAN
            We know there's another stocker.

                         EMPLOYEE
            Rob?

Dignan points the gun at the employee.

                         DIGNAN
            Where is he? Where is Rob?

                         EMPLOYEE
            I don't know. Maybe in literature.
            That's his section.

                         DIGNAN
            You got that?

                         ANTHONY
            Sure. Literature. The classics.

The MANAGER is locking the door of his office.

                         ANTHONY
            Is that the manager?

                         DIGNAN
                   (to manager)
            Unlock that door.
                   (to Anthony)
            Check the aisles.

Anthony starts walking through the store, checking down each
aisle. He picks up a copy of The Air War on Hitler's Germany
and takes it with him. He goes through literature and sees
ROB in travel, kneeling in front of a low shelf with a
carton of books beside him.

                         ANTHONY
            Rob?

                         ROB
                   (looks up, a little puzzled)
            Uh-huh?

                         ANTHONY
            Why aren't you in literature?

                         ROB
                   (hesitates)
            It's all full up.

Dignan is in the office with the manager and the first
employee. He's pointing at a drawer.

                         DIGNAN
            Open it up.

The manager opens it. It's full of office supplies.

                         DIGNAN
            OK. Open the other. Let's go.

The manager opens the other drawer. It's full of cash.
Dignan looks at the manager. He looks back at the cash.

                         DIGNAN
            Put it in one of those.

Dignan points at some bookstore bags. The manager picks up a
little one and starts to put the money in it.

                         DIGNAN
            A bigger one, you idiot.

                         MANAGER
                   (glares at Dignan)
            Don't call me an idiot, you punk.

                         DIGNAN
            I'm sorry. But that bag's too small.

                                            CUT TO:

Anthony waiting outside the office door. Rob, the first
employee, and the manager are sitting against the wall in
the office. The manager's got an intense, angry look on his
face, staring at Dignan. Dignan hands Anthony five little
bags full of money and starts to close the office door.

                         DIGNAN
            OK, guys. Just...Sit tight.

Dignan closes the door.

INT. CAR. NIGHT

Anthony and Dignan jump into the car.

                         DIGNAN
            Go. Go. Drive slow.

Bob drives. Pretty slow. Anthony and Dignan keep looking
back out the rear window. They're nervous. Nobody says
anything for a block or two.

                         BOB
            What happened?

                         DIGNAN
            Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural.

                         BOB
            This is natural.

                         DIGNAN
                   (looks at speedometer)
            That's good. Keep it at forty.

                         BOB
            Did we get it?

                         DIGNAN
            Be cool, Bob. Be cool.
                   (quickly)
            Make that light.

They keep driving. Breathing hard.

                         ANTHONY
            Holy shit.

                         DIGNAN
            We got it. We got it.

                         BOB
            How much is there?

                         DIGNAN
            Don't count it.

EXT. HAMBURGER PLACE. NIGHT

A picnic table in front of a hamburger place. Dignan is
standing up with his drink in his hand.

                         BOB
            Was Dignan screaming like, Get me a
            bag!

                         DIGNAN
            No. I was calm.

                         ANTHONY
            What about what that guy said?

                         DIGNAN
            Oh, shit. That was scary. In the
            middle of the robbery. The manager
            looks at me. Right in the eye. And
            goes, I'm going to remember you.

                         BOB
            Are you serious?

                         ANTHONY
            Yeah. He said that.

                         DIGNAN
            I swear to God. In a very quiet
            voice.

                         ANTHONY
            Like he meant it.

                         DIGNAN
            Yeah.

                         ANTHONY
            Like he would find Dignan. One day.

                         DIGNAN
            Like I'm going to hunt you down and
            kill you.

Dignan stands there a minute and lets this sink in. Then he
finally sits down and they all eat their burgers.

                         BOB
            You really think he'll remember you?

                         DIGNAN
                   (smiles)
            No. All he'll remember is a guy
            with a piece of tape on his nose.

They laugh smugly.

EXT. 7-11. NIGHT

Anthony, Dignan, and Bob come out of a 7-11. Bob's got a
slurpee. He's carrying the WWII book.

                         BOB
            See you.

                         ANTHONY
            See you, Bob.

                         DIGNAN
            Hang on, Bob.

Dignan goes up to Bob and hugs him. Bob's not smiling.

                         DIGNAN
            That was really good driving.
            Seriously. I mean it.

Bob nods and starts walking away, down the sidewalk.

                         DIGNAN
            We'll see you later, Bob. Good
            driving.

Anthony and Dignan sit on the curb. Anthony's drinking a
milk. Dignan's still watching Bob walk alone down the
sidewalk.

                         DIGNAN
            What's wrong with him?

                         ANTHONY
            What do you think?

                         DIGNAN
            Anthony, he sat in the car and
            watched a 4-11 in progress. He got
            what he deserved.

                         ANTHONY
            He was the driver, Dignan. He did
            what he's supposed to do.

                         DIGNAN
            I didn't realize you were so
            sensitive to Bob's feelings.
            Considering I did the plans, you're
            actually lucky you got --

                         ANTHONY
            Don't even say it, man.

INT. BOB'S HOUSE. DAY

Dignan and Anthony are following Bob through his house. Bob
is playing his electric guitar, not plugged in.

                         DIGNAN
            Bob, will you please listen?

                         BOB
            I don't want to talk about it.

Bob strums more intensely. They're walking through the
kitchen.

                         DIGNAN
            Look, I admit I was wrong for not
            telling you before the robbery that
            your share wouldn't be as equal as
            ours. But the fact remains me and
            Anthony were much more exposed to
            danger.

Bob has now come to the big glass patio doors where Hector
sits outside, looking in. Bob keeps playing as he looks at
Hector.

                         DIGNAN
            I mean, Jesus Christ, Bob. You
            didn't have some vicious lunatic
            screaming, "I'm going to remember
            you!"

                         BOB
                   (smiles slightly,
                   keeps playing)
            That's true. That would give me
            nightmares.

                         DIGNAN
            Bob, I've got nightmares.

Bob stops playing. He looks at Dignan.

                         BOB
            You'll probably have them the rest
            of your life.

                         ANTHONY
            What was that?

Anthony opens the door to the patio.

                         DIGNAN
            What?

They hear breaking glass somewhere as they follow Anthony
onto the patio. A voice yells out.

                         VOICE
            Motherfucker!

                         ANTHONY
            What's going on?

Bob sets down his guitar as they go out of the yard to see
what's happening.

EXT. BOB'S HOUSE. EVENING

Anthony, Dignan, and Bob go around to the front. Bob's
neighbor PHIL runs down the driveway with a wrench in his
hand. Phil is short and heavy, wearing a golf shirt. He's
got a bloody nose.

                         BOB
            Phil. What happened?

                         PHIL
                   (hysterical)
            Motherfucker. I'll kill him.

                         BOB
                   (looks around,
                   suddenly concerned)
            Who?

PHIL'S GIRLFRIEND comes running out the front door.

                         PHIL'S GIRLFRIEND
            I've called the police. Oh, my God,
            Phil.

She reaches to hug him.

                         PHIL
            Don't touch me! I swear to God I'll
            get that guy.

                         PHIL'S GIRLFRIEND
            I know you will, Phil. There was
            nothing you could do. All you had
            was a golf club.

                         ANTHONY
            You're bleeding, man. Sit down.

A couple of NEIGHBORS have come over from across the street.

                         NEIGHBOR
            What happened?

                         PHIL'S GIRLFRIEND
            Some black man beat Phil up.

                         PHIL
            He didn't beat me up. He attacked me.

                         PHIL'S GIRLFRIEND
            He took two hundred dollars.

                         ANTHONY
                   (to Phil)
            Tilt your head back.

Later. It's dark out now. There's a police car parked across
the street and another pulling over, lights rolling. One of
the OFFICERS walks across the yard, shining a flashlight in
the bushes. Dignan is talking with one of the other officers.

                         DIGNAN
            He was probably on drugs.

                         OFFICER
            They usually are.

Two other cops are getting a statement from Phil. Anthony
and Bob are listening. Some neighbors are milling around
talking.

                         PHIL
            As soon as I opened the door I saw
            him. A black guy. Looking through
            my dad's tool box. I wanted to trap
            this guy. So I closed the garage
            door.

                         COP
            And that's when he hit you?

                         PHIL
                   (looking up to sky
                   and concentrating)
            He struck me. I fell down. He took
            my wallet. Then he opened the
            garage door and ran away.

                         COP
            How'd the window break?

                         PHIL
            I hit it with the golf club.

Dignan's still talking to the other cop.

                         DIGNAN
            How long do you have to go?

                         COP
            26 weeks.

                         DIGNAN
            And what does that cover?

                         COP
            Social issues. Crime prevention.

                         DIGNAN
            Hand to hand combat?

Dignan suddenly looks toward Bob's backyard. The cop nods.

                         COP
            Ground defense.

                         DIGNAN
            Did you hear that?

                         OFFICER
            What?

                         DIGNAN
            Shhh.

Anthony's looking up into the treetops.

                         BOB
            What the fuck is Dignan doing with
            that cop? He loves them.

                         ANTHONY
            There's a million places to hide
            around here.

                         BOB
            Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the
            guy.

                         ANTHONY
            I hope not.

                         BOB
            Phil probably provoked him.
                   (looking at Dignan)
            Where's he going?

Dignan and the officer are walking over to the backyard.

                         DIGNAN
            No, it was a rustling sound.

                         BOB'S VOICE
            The dog. Look out for the dog.

                         OFFICER
            Is this dog going to bite?

                         DIGNAN
            No. Shit no.

Dignan jumps the fence. The cop looks over and shines his
flashlight. Dignan's petting Hector. Hector's calm.

                         DIGNAN
            See? I don't know what he's talking
            about.

Bob starts walking across the street.

                         ANTHONY
            Where you going?

                         BOB
            Move.

As Bob walks away he is looking back, past Anthony, toward
the backyard.

                         ANTHONY
            What's wrong?

Anthony turns to look.

In the backyard. Dignan is looking in the bushes.

                         DIGNAN
            He probably went into the next yard.
            Shine the light over here.

Dignan looks across the yard at the officer. The officer is
shining the light on the marijuana plants. He looks at Dignan.

                         DIGNAN
            Those are...

Dignan sprints across the yard and over the gate.

                         OFFICER
            Halt! Sir!

Anthony and Bob are standing in the shadows across the
street. They see Dignan come racing down the driveway. The
officer is yelling behind the gate.

                         OFFICER
            Bill! He's running!

The other officers are running from their cars.

                         DIGNAN
            The prowler! That way!

The officers run past Dignan, toward the back. Anthony and
Bob take off as Dignan runs by. The three of them run full
speed down the street, cutting across yards, between houses.
They throw themselves over fences and scramble through bushes.

                         DIGNAN
            Way to go, Bob!

                         BOB
            I told you they were there.

                         DIGNAN
                   (about to explode)
            So it's my fault?

                         ANTHONY
            Be quiet.

INT. BOB'S CAR. DAY

Bob's at the wheel, Dignan in front, Anthony in the back.
They're driving fast down the interstate, past fields and
farmhouses. Dignan's drawing out a route in felt tip pen on
a Texaco roadmap.

                         DIGNAN
            In all probability nothing would of
            happened. But why take the chance?
            That's why I ran. I mean how many
            plants were even back there? Five?
            Ten?

                         BOB
            There were more than that.

                         ANTHONY
            Why don't you just tell them the
            truth. Those belong to my neighbor
            Phil.

                         BOB
            I don't know. I personally don't
            need that shit in my life right now.

                         ANTHONY
            Nobody does.

                         DIGNAN
            Obviously. That's why we go on the
            road. The thing about cops is they
            have short attention spans.

EXT. GAS STATION. DAY

Dignan fills up the tank and checks the oil. Bob tests the
tire pressure. Anthony does the windows.

                         DIGNAN
            Can I get that credit card from you?

                         ANTHONY
                   (pause)
            I don't like to use that credit
            card, Dignan.

                         DIGNAN
            Why not?

                         ANTHONY
            Because my mom gets the bill.

                         DIGNAN
            She's not going to notice, Anthony.

                         ANTHONY
            I don't want to use it.

                         DIGNAN
                   (pause)
            Well, then cut it in half.

                         ANTHONY
            I keep it for emergencies.

                         DIGNAN
            Anthony, we're on the run. This is
            an emergency. It's only fair that...

Anthony gets in the car. Pause. Dignan reaches into his
pocket and takes out a wad of cash. He counts some. Stands
there a minute. Goes inside to pay.

INT. CAR. DAY

Anthony stretches out across the backseat on pillows,
playing electronic football. Dignan reads Bob's WWII book.
Bob eats a Ding-Dong and smokes a cigarette.

EXT. FIREWORKS STAND. DAY

A fireworks stand on the side of the highway. The car's
pulled over and they're buying roman candles, M-80's, and
Black Cats from a KID wearing a baseball cap way back on his
head.

As they get back on the highway Anthony lights a roman
candle and fires it from the window. Dignan lights an M-80
and throws it out of the car.

EXT. LAKE. DAY

They drive to a big lake. A dog splashes in and swims for a
tennis ball. Anthony does some nice dives. Dignan swings
from a rope out over the water and lets go. Bob sits on a
bench.

EXT. CAR. DAY

Late afternoon. They're driving on the interstate. Anthony's
got a copy of Runner's World magazine.

                         ANTHONY
            Here's mine right here. See?

Anthony lifts up his foot so Dignan can compare his shoe
with the picture.

                         DIGNAN
            See if mine are in there.

                         ANTHONY
                   (looks at Dignan's shoes)
            Dignan, those aren't running shoes.

                         DIGNAN
            Yes, they are.

                         ANTHONY
            Look at the treads on those.

                         DIGNAN
            What about them?

                         ANTHONY
            They obviously weren't designed for
            racing.

                         DIGNAN
            Well, those treads stink. You'd
            blow a knee out racing on those.

                         BOB
            Will you guys shut up? God. It's
            like having two little kids in the
            car.

                         ANTHONY
            OK, Dad.

                         DIGNAN
            Really. OK, Dad. But seriously,
            Anthony. These are fast shoes.

                         ANTHONY
            You've never had a pair of fast
            shoes in your life, Dignan.
                   (to Bob)
            In fifth grade Dignan used to wear
            cowboy boots for P.E.

                         DIGNAN
            That's real cool, Anthony. Yeah, I
            wore boots. My parents wouldn't buy
            me any $200 running shoes like
            yours. I wasn't spoiled.

                         ANTHONY
            Don't call me spoiled, Dignan.

                         DIGNAN
            You were spoiled rotten.

                         BOB
            Enough. Jesus Christ.

EXT. SIDE OF HIGHWAY. DAY

Anthony and Dignan are lined up to race on the side of the
road.

                         ANTHONY
                   (yelling)
            You want to say it, Bob?

Fifty yards away, Bob's sitting on the hood of the car
parked on the shoulder. He's reading a magazine. He shakes
his head without looking up.

                         ANTHONY
            I'll just say it.

                         DIGNAN
            I'll say it.

                         ANTHONY
            OK. Go ahead.

                         DIGNAN
            On your marks...
                   (waits a second, says
                   very fast:)
            Get set go.

They take off. Dignan has the jump, but Anthony pulls past
him. A car blows by going the other way and they keep racing.
Anthony's out in front as they pass Bob sitting on the car.
Bob's watching. Dignan raises his fists into the air.

                         DIGNAN
                   (points at Anthony)
            You owe me fifty bucks.

                         ANTHONY
            Bob?

                         BOB
            Anthony won.

Bob gets in the car.

                         DIGNAN
            Bob wasn't even looking.

EXT/INT. MOTEL. DAY

A Holiday Inn. Bandera, TX. Bob's car is parked in front.
Inside: Dignan, Bob, and Anthony are checking in. There's a
teenage GIRL behind the counter. Dignan pays cash. The girl
hands over the keys. She's looking at Dignan's shirt:

                         GIRL
            Was that shirt made from a towel?

                         DIGNAN
            What?

                         GIRL
                   (seeing his reaction)
            It's just terrycloth, isn't it?

                         DIGNAN
            Yeah. I think so.

EXT. MOTEL. DAY

They're walking along the balcony, looking for their room.
Anthony has on his backpack. Dignan's got his tennis bag.
Bob's got two large suitcases, a carry-on, and a garment bag.

                         ANTHONY
            Look, man. She didn't know anything
            about shirts.

                         DIGNAN
            No, I'm not saying her. I'm just
            saying, I don't know.

                         ANTHONY
            It's a great shirt. Don't worry
            about it.

They find the room and unlock the door.

INT. CAR. NIGHT

Driving in a small town. Bob's behind the wheel. Dignan's in
front. Anthony's in back.

                         DIGNAN
            Armored trucks are very difficult
            to steal, Anthony.

                         ANTHONY
            I know. But once you get inside
            you're home free.

                         DIGNAN
            Right.. Get back to me on that one.
            Once your plan is worth a shit.

                         ANTHONY
            It's not a plan. It's just --

                         DIGNAN
            Actually. If you knew the exact
            route, you could plant explosives
            under a manhole cover and blow it
            up as it went over.

                         ANTHONY
            Yeah, but you wouldn't have the
            truck if you blew it up.

                         DIGNAN
            True.

There's a car stopped in front of them. A couple of girls
are standing beside it, talking to the driver. Bob can't get
around.

                         DIGNAN
            What the fuck is this?

Dignan leans over and holds down the horn for about five
seconds. The guy in the car sticks hi s hand out the window
and shoots the finger at them. Dignan sounds dead serious:

                         DIGNAN
            Ram him, Bob.

Bob waits for a nervous moment. He does two quick honks. The
guy's reverse lights go on.

                         DIGNAN
            Hit him!

Bob hits the gas and slams into the car. He puts his car in
reverse and backs up a couple of feet. He leans forward and
sees the back of the guy's car. It's all smashed up. The guy
gets out of his car, shaken up, and looks at them. His
expression is confused. Bob punches it and flies backwards
down the street. The guy stands beside his car and watches
them.

                         DIGNAN
            Shit, Bob. What the fuck did you do
            that for?

                         BOB
            He wouldn't move.

They go around the corner. Bob shifts into first and goes.

                         BOB
            Is he chasing us?

                         DIGNAN
            I don't know.

                         ANTHONY
            Speed up, Bob.

INT. MOTEL ROOM. NIGHT

They're unlocking the door. They go inside.

                         BOB
            You think he got my license plates?

                         ANTHONY
            He looked too shaken-up.

                         DIGNAN
            I'm sure he did. We'll have to get
            new plates.

                         BOB
            It's registered in my mother's name.

                         DIGNAN
                   (shakes his head)
            What the fuck possessed you?

                         BOB
            You're the one who kept saying ram
            him.

Dignan's walking into the bathroom.

                         DIGNAN
            I meant tap him. As a warning.

Dignan closes the door. Anthony lies down on one of the beds.
Bob just stands there.

INT. MOTEL ROOM. MORNING

The next day. Dignan and Bob are still asleep. Bob's on a
folding bed. Anthony's sitting at the table, reading a
newspaper eating some cereal from one of those little boxes
where you cut open the sides.

EXT. MOTEL POOL. DAY

Ahthony's swimming laps. He stops and hangs onto the side
for a minute. Across the pool he can see a good-looking
Mexican MAID about twenty years old standing beside her cart
looking at him. He waves. She waves and gets back to work.

A little while later. Anthony's sitting in a chair by the
pool, letting the sun dry him off. He's wearing just a
swimsuit. Dignan and Bob are fully dressed, standing beside
him.

                         ANTHONY
            Dignan, I can't get my hair cut.
            That's just not possible, all right?

                         DIGNAN
            Then you're going to have to dye
            it, Anthony. We've got to hide our
            identities. Especially after Bob
            crashed the car.

Bob has no reaction to this.

                         ANTHONY
            No, Dignan. I'm sorry. I can't do
            that.

                         DIGNAN
            Even if it's the difference between
            some trooper recognizing us and
            throwing us in prison or not?

Silence.

                         DIGNAN
            Well, Bob, Samson has decided that
            his hair is more important than our
            safety.
                   (screaming)
            My friend, that is a reckless
            decision! Let's go, Bob.

Dignan starts walking away.

                         DIGNAN
            Bob. Are you coming?

                         BOB
            See you in a little while.

                         ANTHONY
            See you, Bob.

INT. MOTEL ROOM. DAY

Anthony's wearing a bathrobe, sitting on one of the beds.
The maid unlocks the door and looks inside. She sees Anthony
and starts to go back out.

                         ANTHONY
            No, it's OK. Come on in.

She goes in and starts cleaning up. Anthony sits down in one
of the chairs and makes conversation.

                         ANTHONY
            It's hot out, isn't it? Yeah. This
            is a nice little town. So, what, do
            you do all these rooms yourself? Or
            what? I'm Anthony.

He puts out his hand. She shakes it.

                         ANTHONY
            What's your name?

                         MAID
            Inez.

                         ANTHONY
            Inez?

She nods.

                         ANTHONY
            Let me give you a hand with that.

He helps her make the beds.

EXT. MOTEL HALLWAY. DAY

Anthony walks with Inez from room to room, helpinq her clean
up.

                         ANTHONY
            How do you say nineteen?

                         INEZ
            Dies y nueve.

                         ANTHONY
            Right. Yeah. Yo soy dies y nueve.
            How old are you?

INT. MOTEL ROOM. DAY

Inez opens the door to one of the room.. They go in to clean
it.

                         ANTHONY
            Are you ever scared of finding a
            dead body in one of these rooms?

                         INEZ
                   (laughs)
            No.

                         ANTHONY
            It could happen. This is the exact
            kind of place where it happens. But
            I don't want to scare you.

Anthony picks up a magazine off somebody's suitcase. He
flips through it. Inez takes it out of his hands and puts it
back on the suitcase.

INT. BATHROOM. DAY

Inez is putting a new bar of soap in the shower. Anthony
picks up some wet towels off the floor. It's cramped in there.

                         ANTHONY
            People think because they're in a
            hotel they can act like a slob.
            It's bad manners.

Inez takes the towels. She pulls the shower curtain shut.

                         ANTHONY
            Were you born in Mexico?

                         INEZ
            Cuba.

                         ANTHONY
            Oh, really? That's interesting. Do
            you prefer Cuba or the United States?

Inez is trying to get out of the bathroom but Anthony's in
the way.

                         INEZ
            Scuse me.

EXT. MOTEL HALLWAY. DAY

Inez is pushing the cart. Anthony has his hand on the cart.

                         ANTHONY
            These towels are still warm.

He picks one up and holds it to his face.

                         ANTHONY
            I guess from the dryer.

He hands the towel to Inez. She holds it to her face.

                         ANTHONY
            I've never met anybody from Cuba
            before.

Inez says a few sentences of very fast Spanish. Anthony nods.
Inez knocks on the door of a room.

                         INEZ
            Housekeeping.

A WOMAN about thirty-five years old opens the door.

                         WOMAN
            We're just checking out.

The woman goes back into the room. Inez follows her.

INT. MOTEL ROOM. DAY

The woman's packing a bag on the bed. Anthony comes in. The
woman looks at him. 8he's about to say something when
Anthony takes the liner out of the trashcan. The woman's
HUSBAND comes out of the bathroom. Anthony picks up some
stuff off the floor.

                         HUSBAND
            Hi.

                         ANTHONY
            Hi.

Anthony follows Inez into the bathroom. The husband looks at
his wife.

INT. BARBERSHOP. DAY

Diqnan's sitting in the waiting area of a barbershop reading
a newspaper. We can see Bob out the window, talking on a pay
phone. He hangs up and comes inside.

                         DIGNAN
            You can go first, Bob.

                         BOB
            My brother's in jail.

                         DIGNAN
            What are you talking about?

EXT. BARBERSHOP. DAY

They're standing next to the spinning striped pole.

                         BOB
            The weed.

                         DIGNAN
            But it's not his. How can they
            arrest Future Man?

                         BOB
            They said he's a drug dealer.

Bob looks off into the distance. Sickened.

                         DIGNAN
            Those assholes. We got rapes.
            Murders. Violent crimes every
            second. And this is what they come
            up with.
                   (shaking his head)
            They're just fucking him because
            he's from a prominent family.

INT. DINER. DAY

They're sitting at a table, waiting for their order.

                         DIGNAN
            I don't think they can make it
            stick, Bob. I mean, what do they
            actually have on Future Man?

                         BOB
            Well, the marijuana crop is a good
            start.

                         DIGNAN
            That could be anybody's.

                         BOB
            They also found my two beam scale
            in the garage.
                         DIGNAN
            Since when is it a crime to have a
            scale in your house? Everybody has
            a scale.

                         BOB
            The cops say it's a special kind of
            scale drug dealers use in selling
            marijuana.

                         DIGNAN
            So tell them the truth. What do you
            use it for?

                         BOB
                   (pause)
            I was just going to use it to see
            how much I had.

Dignan mulls this over for a minute.

                         DIGNAN
            How long has he been in there?

                         BOB
            I don't know.

                         DIGNAN
            Then how come they haven't set the
            bail yet? That's unconstitutional.

                         BOB
            We'll have to see when we get back.

Dignan looks at Bob for a minute.

                         DIGNAN
            What do you mean get back?

                         BOB
                   (pause)
            Well, obviously, we got to go back.

                         DIGNAN
            Bob, that makes no sense.

                         BOB
            Dignan, he's my brother. I can't
            just leave him there.

                         DIGNAN
            This could be a trap.
                         BOB
            Come on, Dignan.

                         DIGNAN
            Don't "Come on, Dignan" me.

                         BOB
            I'm going back.

                         DIGNAN
                   (louder)
            Not in that car you're not.

                         BOB
            Watch me.

                         DIGNAN
            Good luck, since I got the keys.

Bob glares at Dignan. Dignan shrugs. The waitress brings
over some glasses of water, ice clinking. Nobody says
anything while she sets them down. She walks away.

                         BOB
            Give me the keys, Dignan.

                         DIGNAN
            I can't do that, Bob.

                         BOB
            Dignan. You're going to give me
            those keys or you're going to get
            hurt.

                         DIGNAN
            Don't threaten me, Bob.

                         BOB
            Goddammit, Dignan! It's my car! If
            you don't give me my keys, I swear
            to God --

EXT. STREET. DAY

Dignan drives the car slowly alongside: Bob walking down the
sidewalk, staring straight ahead. Dignan's, got his window
down.

                         DIGNAN
            Look, Bob. I understand your
            loyalty. You're a good person. But
            right now you're not using your
            best judgement.

Bob keeps walking.

                         DIGNAN
            Future Man would not want you to go
            to jail I promise you. Just get in
            the car and we'll talk about it.

No reaction. Bob keeps walking straight ahead.

                         DIGNAN
            Future Man would never go to jail
            for you, I'll tell you that.

                         BOB
            His name's not Future Man, Dignan.

                         DIGNAN
            I know it's not.

                         BOB
            You don't even know his name.

                         DIGNAN
            Yes, I do.

                         BOB
            What is it?

                         DIGNAN
            Just get in the car, Bob.

                         BOB
            What's his name?

                         DIGNAN
            OK, Bob. I don't know his name. You
            know why? Because I don't care.
            He's Future Man. But I care about
            you. And to me it doesn't make
            sense to go back to the scene of a
            crime. Will you get in the car, Bob?
            This is stupid.

Bob stops walking.

                         BOB
            It's not your decision and he's not
            your brother, Dignan.

                         DIGNAN
            That's right. I only have one vote.
            We'll go talk with Anthony and
            figure it out.

Pause. Bob gets into the backseat. Dignan looks back at him
for a minute.

                         DIGNAN
            You're going to ride in the back?

Bob nods and looks out the window.

                         DIGNAN
            Come on, Bob. Get in front.

Bob exhales and gets out. He gets in up front. Dignan looks
at him for a minute.

                         DIGNAN
            You've got a beautiful walk, Bob.

                         BOB
            Let's go.

INT. MOTEL ROOM. NIGHT

Dignan and Bob open the door and go in. Inside: Inez and two
other Hispanic MAIDS are sitting at the table by the window.
One's about seventeen and a little heavy, the other's in her
mid-thitties. There's a bunch of glasses and a bottle of rum
on the table. One of the maids is cutting up a banana. Inez
smiles at Dignan. Dignan looks puzzled.

                         DIGNAN
            Hi. How's it going.

Suddenly there's a loud crunching, grinding sound. Dignan
and Bob are startled. They look around the room. The sound
stops.

Anthony comes out of the bathroom carrying the pitcher from
a blender. It's full to the top with yellow liquid. He sees
Dignan and Bob and stops. Pause.

                         ANTHONY
            I thought you guys went to get your
            hair cut.

                         DIGNAN
            No. We didn't.

Silence.

                         ANTHONY
            We're making banana daqueris.

Anthony holds up the pitcher. Dignan looks at it. Nods. Pause.

                         ANTHONY
            This is Inez. Carmen. Anita.

                         DIGNAN
            Hi.

                         ANTHONY
            Inez, this is --

                         DIGNAN
            Jerry.
                   (pointing to Bob)
            And this is my associate Cornelius.

A strange expression crosses Bob's face.

                         DIGNAN
            May I have a word with you, please?

                         ANTHONY
            Sure.

EXT. MOTEL HALLWAY. NIGHT

Outside the room. Dignan closes the door. There's three
housekeeping carts in the hall.

                         DIGNAN
            What the fuck is going on here?

                         ANTHONY
            What. What's the matter?

                         DIGNAN
            Anthony, we're on the run from the
            law here. Did you tell these people
            your real name?

                         ANTHONY
            No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't
            speak English.

                         DIGNAN
            They don't?

                         ANTHONY
            No. Not really. Inez speaks a little.

                         DIGNAN
            Which one was that?

                         ANTHONY
            On the left.

Dignan cracks open the door and looks inside.

                         ANTHONY
            She's from Cuba.

                         DIGNAN
            No kidding.

                         BOB
            Dignan.

                         DIGNAN
                   (closes the door)
            Anthony. Bad news.

EXT. MOTEL POOL. DAY

They walk around the motel.

                         ANTHONY
            How long are they going to hold him?

                         BOB
            I don't know. I don't know anything.
            Except Phil says they got him. And
            he's in jail.

                         DIGNAN
            He needs to hire an attorney.

                         ANTHONY
            No, no. Look. OK. Let's stay here
            until we find out what's going on.

                         BOB
            Anthony, I --

                         ANTHONY
            And if Future Man doesn't get let
            out of jail in 48 hours, then we go
            back. All right?

                         DIGNAN
            Now that makes sense. We'll hang
            out for a couple of days. Get a
            little R&R. Make sure Future Man's
            OK and then get back on the road.

                         ANTHONY
            As long as he gets out OK.

                         DIGNAN
            Obviously. That's a given.

                         ANTHONY
            Bob?

                         BOB
            What?

                         ANTHONY
            Is that OK?

Pause. Bob looks at Dignan. Looks at Anthony.

                         BOB
                   (shrugs)
            Yeah. I guess so.

They shake hands and start back to the room.

                         DIGNAN
            See, now we've got a plan.

                         ANTHONY
            Don't worry about it, Bob.

INT. MOTEL ROOM. NIGHT

Anthony, Dignan, Inez, Carmen, and Anita are sitting crowded
around the little table by the window in the motel room.
They've got banana daqueris and a bottle of wine. Moonlight
comes through the window. Bob is standing up in front of
them with a banana daqueri in his hand. He's singing a blues
number acapella. He's got a good voice.

INT. MOTEL ROOM. NIGHT

Dignan and Bob are playing slapjack with Carmen and Anita.
Everyone's got their hands ready as  Carmen turns one card
then the next. Bob's having a conversation in fluent Spanish
with them about Las Vegas. He's talking about the rules at
different casinos: Bally's, Caesar's, the Desert Inn.
Dignan's paying close attention to the deck. A jack comes up
and he slams it.

EXT. MOTEL POOL. NIGHT

There's a light in the pool. Anthony and Inez are swimming.
Anthony swims around her with his eyes just above the water.
He goes under and comes up grabbing onto her. She laughs.

                         INEZ
            Does my skin feel soft, Anthony?

                         ANTHONY
                   (passionate)
            God, yes. Like silk.
Inez starts to giggle.

                         ANTHONY
            What?
                   (starts laughing)
            What?

                         INEZ
            Like silk?

                         ANTHONY
            God. That does sound corny.  Oh,
            your skin feels so soft and silky.
            But it really kind of does.

He kisses her.

                         DIGNAN
            No lifeguard on duty. Swim at your
            own risk.

They look up. Dignan's standng at the other side of the pool.
He smiles.

                         DIGNAN
            You know, I did save Anthony from
            drowning once, Inez. Tell her,
            Anthony.

                                            CUT TO:

Dignan sitting with his feet in the pool. Anthony and Inez
are sitting on the steps beside him, in the shallow end.

                         DIGNAN
            See, one day we were playing hot
            box over at my next door neighbor
            Mr. Langston's house and Anthony
            fell in the pool and got knocked
            unconscious. I had to dive in and
            save him.

                         ANTHONY
            This was in fourth grade.

                         DIGNAN
            Mr. Langston performed
            cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR.
            I've never said this before, but
            frankly I thought Anthony was dead.
            The veins in his face were all
            sticking out. His skin was blue. He
            truly did look dead.

                         ANTHONY
            After that my parents never let me
            go to Dignan's again.

                         DIGNAN
            They blamed my family for everything.
            They always said Mr. Langston saved
            Anthony's life.

Dignan stares wistfully across the pool. Anthony looks at
him for a minute.

                         ANTHONY
            But if it wasn't for Dignan I
            probably would of died.

                         DIGNAN
                   (nodding, whisper voice)
            Yes...It's true.

They're all quiet for a minute. Inez hangs onto the side.

INT. MOTEL ROOM. NIGHT

Bob's sitting in the room by himself, close to the TV,
watching a war movie.

EXT. MOTEL. DAY

The next morning. Dignan bursts out the door of the motel
room. He runs across the parking lot.

                         DIGNAN
            Son of a bitch.

Dignan runs back into the room. He comes out with Anthony.

                         DIGNAN
            He's gone. He stole the car.

                         ANTHONY
            Where was it parked?

                         DIGNAN
            Right here.

Anthony looks around the parking lot.

                         DIGNAN
            That coward. Son of a bitch.

                         ANTHONY
            Maybe he just went to the store.

                         DIGNAN
            He took his stuff. He's gone.
                   (pause)
            I should of seen this. I should of
            expected it. Bob doesn't have any
            character.

Anthony puts his hands in his pockets. Looks out at the
highway.

                         ANTHONY
            He went back for his brother.

                         DIGNAN
            We said 48 hours.

                         ANTHONY
            That's a long time to be in jail.

They stand there in the empty parking lot. Anthony goes
inside.

INT. MOTEL ROOM. DAY

In the room. The blinds are pulled. Anthony's sitting at the
end of a bed. Dignan's pacing around the room.

                         DIGNAN
            We'll get him. Don't worry about
            that. We'll go back. We'll find him.
            And we'll blow up his car. Or do
            something. I promise you.

Anthony gets up and walks to the bathroom. He shuts the door.
Dignan follows him over to the sink and sits on the counter.

                         DIGNAN
            I mean, let's face it. Bob was dead
            weight. We're a lot better off
            without him.
                   (pause)
            But who could expect it? Just like
            that. Steals the fucking car. What
            kind of person pulls that --

Anthony opens the door and walks out.

                         ANTHONY
            Bob didn't steal the car. He told
            me he was going. He had to go help
            his brother.

Anthony sits back down on the bed. Dignan's shocked.

                         DIGNAN
            When'd he tell you?

                         ANTHONY
            This morning.

                         DIGNAN
            Where was I?

                         ANTHONY
            You were asleep.

                         DIGNAN
            He told you and you let him do it.

                         ANTHONY
            He told me because he wanted to
            know if I wanted to go.

                         DIGNAN
                   (hesitates)
            If you wanted to go? What were you
            going to do? Just leave me here by
            myself?

                         ANTHONY
            Well, I didn't do it, did I?

                         DIGNAN
            So when you were saying Bob's at
            the store and acting real suprised,
            that was just an act. You were
            just --

                         ANTHONY
            Bob went to help his brother. I
            understand that and I can't help it
            if you don't.

                         DIGNAN
            I understand that if I had a few
            more friends like you and Bob I'd
            be dead.

                         ANTHONY
            If you say so.

INT. DINER. DAY

Anthony and Dignan are sitting at a booth. Anthony's got a
roadmap spread out on the table. There's a long silence.

                         DIGNAN
            If you'd gone with Bob you'd
            probably be in Weatherford by now.
            Of course I'd be here frantically
            worrying thinking you must of got
            kidnapped.

                         ANTHONY
            I didn't realize you had such an
            incredible ability to feel sorry
            for yourself, Dignan.

                         DIGNAN
            Well, the world is a little bit
            colder today.

Anthony sits there thinking for a second, stating into space.
Then he looks back at his map. He draws some lines in two
different colors of felt tip pens.

                         ANTHONY
            You want to look at the map?

Pause. Dignan kind of looks at the map, without leaning
forward. Anthony turns the map more in Dignan's direction.
Dignan leans forward, looking.

                         ANTHONY
            See. Here's where we are.

They look at the map for a minute. Dignan looks out the
window.

                         DIGNAN
            I didn't know he had it in him.
                   (pause)
            I guess you could say the child has
            become the father of the man.

EXT/INT. MOTEL/TOWN. DAY

Anthony runs down the sidewalk, cuts across the street, and
goes around the side of the motel. He pulls off his jacket
as he goes up the stairs. He spots Inez's cart. He walks
over to the room she's cleaning. She's in there making the
bed. Anthony closes the door and grabs her by her belt.
She's laughing and he pushes her onto the bed. He unbuttons
her dress. She jerks a sheet out of the way. It swings in
the air.

Then we see Anthony and Inez walking down the sidewalk. He's
got one arm wrapped tight around her shoulders and she's got
hers around his waist. They're talking while they walk,
going past people in the town.

They watch each other walking reflected in a window.

EXT. MOTEL. EVENING

Dignan is doing the butterfly in the pool. Anthony and Inez
walk over and wait for him at the end of the pool.

                         ANTHONY
            We're going over to this bar if you
            feel like going.

                         DIGNAN
            No. I'm going to swim. I'll see you
            later.

Dignan treads water. Inez looks at Anthony.

                         ANTHONY
            Why don't you come with us.

                         DIGNAN
            OK.

Dignan gets out of the pool.

INT. MEXICAN BAR. NIGHT

Anthony, Dignan, and Inez are drinking beers with limes and
salt. The mood is good and they're getting drunk. Anthony
and Inez dance. Then Dignan and Inez. Mexican-style, stomping
their feet and clapping. There's a scruffy dog in the bar
and he barks at the dancers. Anthony kisses Inez and they
whisper to each other. Dignan orders another beer and moves
over to the pool table. A skinny Mexican MAN puts his arm
around Dignan's shoulder. He's drunk and slurring his words.
So's Dignan.

                         MAN
            Hello, my friend. You in the Army,
            yes?

                         DIGNAN
            No. I just have short hair.

                         MAN
            Is that your chiquita?

                         DIGNAN
            No, my friend knows her.

                         MAN
            She Chicano, yes?

Dignan nods.

                         MAN
            You like Chicanos?

                         DIGNAN
            Sure.

He says something in fast Spanish to the people at his table
and they smile.

                         MAN
            Play pool? For one cerveza.

Dignan nods. The guy racks up the balls. They start shooting.
Dignan makes a hard shot.

                         MAN
                   (smiling)
            You a good pool player.

                         DIGNAN
            Got a little lucky.

                         MAN
            Where's your friend? He go with the
            chiquita?

Dignan looks over to the bar. Anthony and Inez are gone.

                         DIGNAN
            I don't know.

                         MAN
            She is a good looking woman.

Dignan ignores this. They keep playing. Dignan finally makes
the eight ball. The man shakes Dignan's hand and holds on.

                         DIGNAN
            Guess I'll get another Tecate.

                         MAN
            Si. Tecate. You like to fight?

                         DIGNAN
            What?

                         MAN
            Fight. You know.

He pulls Dignan in and with his other hand fakes a hard punch.

                         DIGNAN
            No. Just pool.

                         MAN
            You Hoto?

                         DIGNAN
                   (pulls away)
            Fuck you. You a Hoto.

                         MAN
                   (smiles)
            No. Me no Hoto. Tecate?

                         DIGNAN
            Right.

INT. BATHROOM. NIGHT

The bathroom is very small with one bare light bulb. Dignan
stands at the urinal, muttering to himself.

The door opens and Dignan turns around just in time to see
the Mexican man throw a hard punch. He hits Dignan in the
stomach, punches him in the face. Dignan goes down hard. The
guy kicks him and curses in Spanish.

                         MAN
            Pinche cabrone. Puta madre.

The bartender comes in with a bat in his hand and starts
talking fast and angry in Spanish. The guy gets out.

INT. MOTEL ROOM. NIGHT

Dignan's sitting in bed, watching TV. He's got a fat lip and
a big bruise over his eye. Anthony's sitting in a chair
beside him. Inez brings over a glass of water and some ice
in a washcloth. She gives the ice to Dignan for his eye. She
puts the glass of water on the nightstand where there's some
fast food layed out for Dignan: burger, fries, an apple pie.
Inez goes into the bathroom, closes the door, and turns on
the water. Anthony's sitting there with his hands clasped,
not looking at the TV.

                         ANTHONY
            I can't believe he just jumped you.

                         DIGNAN
            Can you hand me those french fries.

Anthony hands him the fries. Dignan watches the TV.

                         ANTHONY
            I wish I'd been there.

                         DIGNAN
            Would of been nice.

Anthony looks at Dignan.

                         ANTHONY
            Man. I'm sorry. We just went for a
            walk --

                         DIGNAN
            I don't really feel like talking
            about it. The only thing I feel
            like is getting the fuck out of
            this place.

                         ANTHONY
                   (pause)
            We need a car.

For the first time Dignan looks away from the TV, at Anthony.

                         DIGNAN
            I have an idea for that.

                         ANTHONY
            What?

                         DIGNAN
            Inez has a master key to all these
            rooms, doesn't she?
                   (pause)
            Doesn't she?

                         ANTHONY
            I don't think we can do that.

                         DIGNAN
            I know we can. It's real simple. We
            go into a room, grab some car keys
            and --

                         ANTHONY
            What I'm saying is she wouldn't go
            for that.

                         DIGNAN
            She doesn't need to know.

                         ANTHONY
                   (pause)
            I don't know, Dignan. I just --
                         DIGNAN
            Look. I'm ready to get the fuck out
            of here. It's real torture for me
            to be here. Getting the shit kicked
            out of me by Mexicans.

                         ANTHONY
            Shh.

                         DIGNAN
            No one to back me up. Now I have a
            good idea. So unless you come up
            with something better --

                         ANTHONY
            Dignan. I can't do that. All right?
            I just can't.

The bathroom door opens.

                         DIGNAN
            Then you better think of something.

Inez comes back in.

                         INEZ
            How are you, Jerry?

                         DIGNAN
                   (staring at TV)
            I feel great, Inez.

                         ANTHONY
                   (kisses her)
            I'll see you later.

Inez goes outside. She closes the door.

                         ANTHONY
            I don't think we need any keys,
            Dignan. I think I can hotwire a car
            for us.

                         DIGNAN
            You don't know how to hotwire.

                         ANTHONY
            Yes, I do. Bob taught me.

                         DIGNAN
            Bob taught you how to get
            electrocuted.

                         ANTHONY
            No, I'm serious. He made me a
            diagram.

EXT. SIDEWALK. DAY

Dignan's standing on a corner alone. He looks sullen.

EXT. SIDEWALK. DAY

Anthony walks down an alley. He goes past a beat-up
convertible. He stops, hands in his pockets. He looks both
ways.

He cuts back to the car, opens the door, and slips inside.

INT. STOLEN CAR. DAY

Anthony's behind the wheel. He hand signals a turn and pulls
up next to Dignan. Dignan shakes his head as he looks at the
car. He gets in. They drive through the town. The wind's
blowing hard. Anthony smiles at Dignan. Dignan tries not to
smile.

                                            CUT TO:

Dignan sitting in the parked car with the motor running. In
the side mirror he's watching Anthony and Inez. Anthony's
saying goodbye. He walks back to the car and gets in. He
puts it in gear and they drive off.

                         DIGNAN
            What'd you say to Inez?

Anthony shrugs.

                         DIGNAN
            "I'll come back for you. I love
            you, Inez."

Anthony is silent.

                         DIGNAN
            "I'm going to take you away from
            all this windexing and making beds."

Silence. Dignan exhales and looks out the window.

EXT. HIGHWAY. DAY

The car is on the shoulder, raised up on a Jack with the
hood open. Anthony's looking underneath the car. Dignan's
standing in the middle the road with his hands in his
pockets. No cars in sight.

Anthony starts messing around under the hood. He tests some
wires and connections. He steps away from the car.

                         ANTHONY
            Man, I don't know anything about
            cars.

Dignan stares down the road.

                         DIGNAN
            You really know how to pick them.

Anthony walks over to Dignan. He stands beside him for a
minute.

                         ANTHONY
            I think we better go home.

                         DIGNAN
            Don't panic, Anthony.

                         ANTHONY
            I'm not. But there's --

                         DIGNAN
            You can't just run home every time
            things get tough. First of all,
            we've got enough dough to --

                         ANTHONY
            Our money situation is not good.

                         DIGNAN
                   (clapping him on the back)
            You're so spoiled. What is "not
            good" to you? Only a few hundred --

                         ANTHONY
            We've got sixteen dollars.

                         DIGNAN
            That's not correct.

Dignan stares at Anthony.

                         DIGNAN
            Give it to me.

Pause. Anthony reaches into his pocket and pulls out the
money. Dignan takes it. He counts it. He looks at Anthony.

                         DIGNAN
            Sixteen dollars.

                         ANTHONY
            I know.

                         DIGNAN
            Where's the rest?

Dignan stares at Anthony. Pause.

                         ANTHONY
            I had to give some to Inez.

                         DIGNAN
            How much?

                         ANTHONY
            $383.

Dignan frowns slightly. Pause. He screams:

                         DIGNAN
            What!

Pause. Dignan runs at the car and kicks the door as hard as
he can. It makes a big dent. He runs down the shoulder and
grabs a big rock. He runs at the car and smashes the rock
through the windshield. He stands still. He turns to Anthony.
He walks back over to him, yelling.

                         DIGNAN
            You gave $383 to the goddamn
            housekeeper! What the fuck is your
            problem?

                         ANTHONY
            She needed it.

                         DIGNAN
            A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!

                         ANTHONY
            Her name's Inez. Stop calling her
            the housekeeper.

                         DIGNAN
            That's what she is!

                         ANTHONY
            I know that. But --

                         DIGNAN
            You're in love with the fucking
            housekeeper!

                         ANTHONY
            Shut up!

                         DIGNAN
            What are you going to do, get
            married? Have a bunch of little
            idiot janitor brats! And go around
            scrubbing the --

Anthony slaps Dignan hard in the face.

                         ANTHONY
            Stop!
                   (pause)
            Now listen to me.

Dignan punches Anthony is the face. Follows it up with one
after another. Anthony ducks and puts his arms out. He falls
on one knee. Dignan immediately turns and walks to the car.

Anthony stands up. He's got a bloody nose. He stares at
Dignan. Not angry. Just weary.

Dignan pulls his tennis bag out of the car. He shuts the
door and walks down the highway.

Anthony walks to the car and takes out his backpack. He
pulls it tight around his shoulders. He looks down the
highway at Dignan. Then turns and walks the other way, into
the distance.

                                            BLACKOUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. GOLF COURSE. DAY

A cold day on a nice country club course. Anthony watches
Bob hit a hard slide straight into the rough. Bob stands
there in a frozen follow-through. Then he suddenly swings
his club and hums it down the fareway. He starts to walk
back to the golf cart.

                         ANTHONY
            Bob, where you going?

                         BOB
            I'm not playing any more golf.

                         ANTHONY
            Why not?

                         BOB
            Cause I'm not getting any better.
            It's a waste of time.

                         ANTHONY
            You've only been playing for two
            weeks, Bob. It takes a long time to
            learn this game.

                         BOB
            You think I'm improving?

                         ANTHONY
                   (pause)
            Yes. You just got to stick with it.

Bob looks down the fareway. He takes a deep breath and
starts walking toward his club about twenty yards away.

INT. GOLF CART. DAY

In the cart. Bob's driving. There's a brief silence.

                         BOB
            You don't have to talk about it if
            you don't want to.

                         ANTHONY
            No, I don't mind.

                         BOB
            I know it must of been a bad
            experience. But it doesn't sound
            like it was your fault.

                         ANTHONY
            Well, I didn't mean to electrocute
            him. But the whole operation was my
            idea.

rewire a circuit breaker, short out the P.A. system,
electrify doors and windows. Anthony continues in VOICEOVER.

                         ANTHONY (VO)
            It took six months of research. I
            did all the wiring myself. Switched
            AC to DC. Doubled the voltage.
            Shorted out the generator. The
            whole school was shut down.

                         BOB (VO)
            That's pretty complicated for a
            senior prank.

                         ANTHONY (VO)
            I don't like that word prank, Bob.
            I was trying to do something more
            than a prank.

EXT. SCHOOL. DAY

A large school building. Tall oak trees and benches in the
shade. Green and blue lights blink in the windows. White
flashes and loud jolts of energy dance from room to room.
Mozart plays in the distance.

Students begin to swarm out into the yard.

                         ANTHONY (VO)
            I wanted to create an event.
            Something everyone would remember.
            And at first it worked perfectly.
            The whole school was standing
            around outside. Kids running all
            over the place. Everybody laughing.

EXT. GOLF COURSE. DAY

Anthony and Bob are standing on the seventeenth green.

                         ANTHONY
            Even the school custodian Swifty
            thought it was great. He kept
            laughing and shaking his head the
            whole time he tried to disconnect
            the generator. And then suddenly
                   (snaps his finger)
            total silence except for Swifty
            hanging off the generator with his
            leg stuck to it being electrocuted.

Anthony stares down the fareway.

                         ANTHONY
            Actually he died of a heart attack
            brought on by the shock. He was an
            older guy.

INT. GOLF CART. DAY

Anthony and Bob are driving back to the clubhouse.

                         ANTHONY
            I felt terrible. I'd known Swifty
            since first grade. He was Dignan's
            medicine man for Indian Guides.
            They called each other Rattlesnake
            and Killer Whale. Whenever Dignan
            came to visit me he would act like
            he and Swifty weren't that good of
            friends, but that was just to make
            me feel better. The whole rest of
            the school had turned against me.

EXT. BOB'S HOUSE. DAY

Anthony and Bob are sitting by the pool, drinking beers.
Future Man's swimming laps even though it's cold out.

                         ANTHONY
            At first they were going to charge
            me with manslaughter. That's partly
            why I was in custody so long. Sixty
            days.

                         BOB
            Sixty days?

                         ANTHONY
            Yeah. One minute you're studying
            Great Expectations and the next
            minute you're drawing the Holy Mary
            for some kid who tried to stab his
            girlfriend.

                         BOB
            Why were you drawing the Holy Mary?

                         ANTHONY
            Prison tatoos. I got to be pretty
            good. It's not like drawing on paper.

                                            CUT TO:

Future Man toweling off. He wears a Speedo swimsuit. He
walks over to Bob and Anthony. Anthony's just finishing a
drawing of a leaping jungle cat in black and red ink on
Bob's shoulder.

Future Man stops and looks at them with no feeling.

                         ANTHONY
                   (pause)
            It's a panther.

Pause. Future Man looks at Bob.

                         FUTURE MAN
            How's that 700 bucks coming?

                         BOB
            I'm working on it.

                         FUTURE MAN
            Hard to find it sitting by the pool
            drinking beer and bullshitting.

He walks inside.

                         ANTHONY
            I thought he didn't have to pay
            anything because of the technicality.

                         BOB
            Yeah, but he still has the
            aggravation. Three days sitting in
            a cell.

                         ANTHONY
                   (pause)
            Were you adopted, Bob?

                         BOB
            Why do you say that?

                         ANTHONY
            Well, because you guys don't look
            alike.

                         BOB
            No. I wasn't adopted.

Long pause.

                         ANTHONY
            Was Future Man adopted?

                         BOB
            Jesus Christ! No.

INT. CAR. DAY

Dignan and APPLEJACK are sitting in, a '72 Monte Carlo by
the curb two houses down from Bob's. Applejack is a small
black man with white hair. It's hard to tell exactly how old
he is. Around sixty-five.

                         DIGNAN
            There's a lot of valuable shit in
            there, Applejack. The silver and
            the china. The crystal. And the
            grandfather clock. Goddammit, I bet
            that clock's worth ten grand.

                         APPLEJACK
            Why the fuck do we need to blow up
            the car? It doesn't make any
            goddamn sense.

                         DIGNAN
            Just settling an old score. You
            might say revenge.

                         APPLEJACK
            That sounds like a lot of bullshit
            that'll land us in jail.

                         DIGNAN
            We might have to take that chance.
            Cause I feel pretty strongly about
            this.

                         APPLEJACK
            Is that Buckethead?

Anthony is walking Hector down the driveway.

                         DIGNAN
            Get down.

Anthony does some stretching exercises in the driveway.

                         APPLEJACK
            Is that him?

                         DIGNAN
            Wait a second.

They watch Anthony and Hector start down the street.

                         DIGNAN
            That's Anthony.

                         APPLEJACK
            That's your friend Anthony?

                         DIGNAN
            Yeah.

                         APPLEJACK
            What's he doing here?

                         DIGNAN
            Looks like he's staying with
            Buckethead. That's what I figured.
            He's probably got his own room.
            Let's see where he's going.

Applejack puts the car in gear. They drive slowly.

                         DIGNAN
            Don't get too close.

Anthony looks back.

                         DIGNAN
            Stop. He saw us.

Anthony keeps jogging with Hector.

                         DIGNAN
            Wait. Did he see us?

                         APPLEJACK
            We're going too slow. It looks like
            we're following him.

Anthony goes around a corner, down an alley.

                         DIGNAN
            Speed up.

They pull down to the end of the alley. Anthony and Hector
are racing down the alley.

EXT. ALLEY. DAY

Dignan gets out of the car.

                         DIGNAN
            Anthony!

Anthony looks back. He stops running.

                         DIGNAN
            Wait up.

Dignan jogs down the alley. He stops a few feet away from
Anthony.

                         DIGNAN
            Where you going?

Anthony points down the alley.

                         ANTHONY
            Just walking Hector.

Dignan looks down the alley. He looks at Anthony. Pause.

                         ANTHONY
            When'd you get back?

                         DIGNAN
            Ah. Couple days ago.

Pause.

                         DIGNAN
                   (under his breath)
            You want to shake hands.

Anthony puts his hand out. They shake. Pause. Anthony looks
down the alley.

                         ANTHONY
            Who's in the car?

                         DIGNAN
            That's Applejack. You want to meet
            him?

                         ANTHONY
            Sure.

They walk to the car.

                         DIGNAN
            This is Applejack.

They shake.

                         ANTHONY
            Nice to meet you, Applejack.

                         APPLEJACK
            You're Anthony?

                         ANTHONY
            Yeah.

                         APPLEJACK
            I hear you're a good thief.

Anthony shrugs and smiles. He nods.

EXT. HAMBURGER PLACE. DAY

A hamburger place with no other customers. Anthony, Dignan,
and Applejack are sitting at an outdoor table. It's cold and
their jackets are zipped up tight.

                         APPLEJACK
            I'm just sitting at this bar
            drinking my drink when this fine
            chick walks by. She was a living
            doll. And the big motherfucker who
            came in with her sees me looking,
            when he walks by he steps on my
            foot. Doesn't say shit. Just takes
            a seat with his lady. Well, I
            holler out to him, If I was as big
            as you, ain't no way in the hell
            you'd of stepped on my foot like
            that. He just laughed. He says,
            Little man, take your foot and put
            it in your pocket. I said, No, how
            about I take my foot and I stick it
            up your ass? Man, we went to war
            right there. I hit him so hard I
            knocked his nuts in his watchpocket.
            But this motherfucker wouldn't go
            down. Then all the sudden, out of
            nowhere, Dignan came up behind him
            and smashed a bottle on his head.
            And that big old boy went down.
            That's how I met Dignan. Good cat
            to have on your side. He'll go to
            war with you. He don't give a fuck.

Applelack and Dignan slap hands.

                         DIGNAN
            Applejack would of got him anyway.
            This was just the quicker war.

                         ANTHONY
            You really hit a guy with a bottle?

Dignan takes a little notebook out of his pocket.

                         DIGNAN
            Pretty much. He kind of fell into
            me. But wait a second.

Dignan opens the notebook on the table.

                         DIGNAN
            I want you to look at this.

                         ANTHONY
            What is it?

                         DIGNAN
            It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's
            called Hinckley Cold Storage.

                         ANTHONY
            What's Hinckley Cold Storage?

EXT. HINCKLEY COLD STORAGE. DAY

Anthony, Dignan, and Applejack are standing in front of a
massive structure with ladders and towers and huge doors.
Applejack's car is parked behind them. There are trucks
lined up along the loading docks. A big sign says Hinckley
Cold Storage.

                         DIGNAN
            Mr. Henry has an inside source. We
            call him Steve. That's where we get
            our information.

                         ANTHONY
            Who's Mr. Henry?

                         DIGNAN
            You'll meet him this afternoon.
            He's helping us set it up.

                         APPLEJACK
            Did you ever hear of the S. Cooper
            Trust robbery?

                         ANTHONY
                   (shakes his head)
            Uh-uh.

                         APPLEJACK
            S. Cooper Trust,in San Francisco?

                         ANTHONY
            Uh-uh.

                         DIGNAN
            Mr. Henry pulled that job in 1965.
            It's famous. Applejack was the
            wheel man. Did you use this same
            car, Applejack?

                         APPLEJACK
            Hell, no. This is a '72. I was
            driving a '63 Pontiac.
                         ANTHONY
            What exactly is this place? Freezers?

                         DIGNAN
            Right. Freezers. Imported foods.

Anthony stares at Hitckley Cold Storage.

                         APPLEJACK
            Let's go, Abdul-Shabazz.

                         ANTHONY
            Abdul-Shabazz?

                         DIGNAN
            Just a nickname.

EXT. WAREHOUSE. DAY

Anthony, Dignan, and Applejack are standing on the sidewalk
at the front door of an old warehouse. Dignan knocks on the
door, then tries the bell. They all wait.

                         ANTHONY
            What time did he say to be here?

                         DIGNAN
            Right now.

Dignan looks in the window. He tries the door. It's locked.

                         APPLEJACK
            I can knock a man out with a six
            inch punch.

                         ANTHONY
            What do you mean?

                         APPLEJACK
            Feel this.

Anthony puts his hand up. Applejack does a short, hard jab.
Anthony shakes his hand out.

                         ANTHONY
                   (whistles)
            You could give somebody a concussion.

                         DIGNAN
            Let me feel that.

Dignan puts his hand up. Applejack nails it.

                         DIGNAN
                   (grabbing his hand)
            Ow. Shit.

A drop of water hits Dignan on the head. He looks up. More
water falls on him. He gets out of the way. Everyone looks
up. There's a man on the roof. He laughs, hysterically. They
stare up at him.

                         MAN
            How's the weather down there?

                         DIGNAN
                   (pause)
            Mr. Henry?

                         MAN
            Come on in!

                         DIGNAN
            It's locked.

                         MAN
            No, it's not.

Dignan shrugs. He goes over to the door. Mr. Henry pours
some more water on him.

A minute later: a steel garage door opens and the man steps
outside. He is tall, about sixty years old with white hair
clipped short and a trim goatee. He wears black trousers,
black shoes, no shirt, and a string of animal teeth around
his neck. This is MR. HENRY. He puts a towel around Dignan's
shoulders and pats him on the back.

                         MR. HENRY
            Dignan. Good to see you. Good to
            see you Applejack.
                   (looks at Anthony)
            Who are you?

                         DIGNAN
            This is Anthony Adams, Mr. Henry.

                         MR. HENRY
            This is no good.

Mr. Henry stares hard at Dignan. He looks to Anthony. He
looks back to Dignan.

                         MR. HENRY
            This is no good, bringing him here.
            What are you thinking? What the
            shit, man? Are you crazy?

Mr. Henry stares at Dignan. He looks to Anthony.

                         MR. HENRY
            I'm pulling your leg. Abe Henry.

They shake hands. Mr. Henry points to ROWBOAT, a tall, older
black man standing in the doorway. Rowboat wears a white
windbreaker.

                         MR. HENRY
            This is my business manager, Rowboat.

                         ANTHONY
            Nice to meet you.

                         MR. HENRY
            That's a sharp jacket.

                         ANTHONY
            Thanks.

INT. WAREHOUSE. DAY

The second floor of the warehouse is one huge room painted
all white. Mr. Henry and Anthony are playing ping-pong.
Dignan watches. Rowboat-and Applejack are on the far side of
the room playing chess.

                         ANTHONY
            It's hard to get much spin with
            this kind of paddle.

                         MR. HENRY
            It's called a racquet, Anthony, and
            you're holding it wrong. That's
            ghetto play. Hold it like this.

Anthony changes his grip. Mr. Henry serves. The ball clicks
back and forth. They're both solid players. Anthony whips a
shot crosscourt and wins the point.

                         MR. HENRY
            You know, your form is for shit,
            but you've got a hell of a talent.

                         ANTHONY
            Thanks.

Mr. Henry serves. Anthony returns. Mr. Henry suddenly fires
a scorching shot down the line. Anthony watches it click
past him. He looks to Mr. Henry.

                         ANTHONY
            Nice shot.

Mr. Henry smiles. He looks to Dignan.

                         MR. HENRY
            Is he in?

                         DIGNAN
            I don't know. Are you in, Anthony?

Anthony stands there silent. He looks to Applejack and
Rowboat. He looks to Mr. Henry. Then Dignan.

                         ANTHONY
            Yeah, I'm in.

Mr. Henry puts down his paddle. Stares at Anthony. Smiles.

                         MR. HENRY
            OK, kid. Let's go talk about cops
            and robbers.

INT. WAREHOUSE. DAY

The ground floor is crammed with cars. Some have been taken
apart. Some are shiny and perfect. Anthony and Dignan walk
among the cars and junk with Mr. Henry. They've each got
coffee in a styrofoam cup.

                         MR. HENRY
            Every once in a while some cat
            comes to me. He wants to know how I
            made it. How did I become a success?
            The first thing I tell them is:
            follow your instincts. Let your
            instincts guide you. The second
            thing I tell them is, for Christ's
            sake: you got to know your grammar.

                         ANTHONY
            Grammar.

                         DIGNAN
            What do you mean grammar?

                         MR. HENRY
            The basic grammatical rules of
            robbing.

                         ANTHONY
            You mean like techniques?

                         MR. HENRY
                   (nods)
            Technique. That's right. Seventy-
            five percent of your job is crowd
            control. Seventy-five percent. Do
            you believe that?

                         DIGNAN
                   (pause)
            Yes, I do.

EXT. ROOFTOP. DAY

On the roof of the warehouse. They're standing near the
edge, looking out. Mr. Henry is smoking a joint. He's got on
a black beret. Anthony and Dignan are listening to him talk.

                         MR. HENRY
            On the other hand you got to have
            the right equipment. I don't care
            if you're Harry Houdini. You can't
            pick a lock without a hairpin.

Dignan nods.

                         ANTHONY
            I'd like to live in that place.
            Hinckley Cold Storage.

                         MR. HENRY
            Yeah. Convert it into lofts. OK.
            Pop quiz. What's the single most
            important aspect of your job?

                         DIGNAN
            The grammar?

                         MR. HENRY
            Crowd control. Crowd control. Wake
            up, guys.

                         DIGNAN
            Oh, yeah.

                         MR. HENRY
            You're going to need a boxman for
            this one. But that can be arranged.

                         ANTHONY
            You mean a safecracker?

                         MR. HENRY
            Yeah. And I'll tell you who we're
            going to want: Kumar Banijamali.

                         DIGNAN
            Is he good?

                         MR. HENRY
            He's damn good.

INT. KUMAR'S ROOM. DAY

KUMAR is about sixty-five with white hair. He's short and
wears a pale-green button-down shirt, dark trousers, and
sandals. His room is small and has everything he needs in it.
Books. Little TV. Possessions from all over the world.

Kumar sits on his bed. Anthony and Dignan sit in wooden
chairs. Kumar stares out the window. They sit for a long
silence.

                         DIGNAN
            So what do you think of the plan,
            Mr. Kumar?

Kumar shrugs. Pause.

                         DIGNAN
            We'd love to have you on the team.

Kumar nods. He looks at a plant growing by the window.
Silence.

                         ANTHONY
            What is that? An orchid?

Kumar shakes his head. Sighs deeply. Long pause.

Kumar suddenly stands up and unbuttons his shirt. He throws
it on the bed. He undoes his trousers and takes them off.
Anthony looks at Dignan. Kumar takes off his socks, then his
shorts. He is naked. He walks over to his dresser and takes
out a small satchell. He looks around the room. Right at
Anthony. He walks quickly toward him. Anthony gets nervous.
Kumar grabs Anthony's shoulder and lifts him up a little. He
pulls a towel out from underneath Anthony. He puts his hand
on Dignan's shoulder as he walks to the door, into the hall.

                         KUMAR
            Good plan.

He goes out. Anthony and Dignan sit there for a minute.
They're a little disoriented.

                         DIGNAN
            What do you think?

                         ANTHONY
                   (nods)
            He seems pretty good.

INT. BOB'S HOUSE. NIGHT

The foyer of Bob's house. The doorbell is ringing. Bob walks
in wearing a velour robe. He opens the front door. Anthony
and Dignan are standing on the dootstep. Dignan and Bob
shake hands. It's a little awkward.

                         BOB
            Hey, Dignan. How's it going?

                         DIGNAN
            Not bad.

                         BOB
            Come on in. What you been up to?

                         DIGNAN
            Not a whole lot, Bob.

They walk through the house.

                         BOB
            It's too bad about what happened on
            the road.

                         DIGNAN
            Yeah. It is.

                         ANTHONY
            Let's not even talk about it.

                         BOB
            It was stupid.

                         DIGNAN
            Right. It was extremely stupid.

                         BOB
            I don't expect an apology and I
            don't even want one. I just want us
            to --

                         DIGNAN
            I can't fucking believe this guy.
            An apology, Bob?

                         BOB
            Man, I don't want to go into this.

                         ANTHONY
            Yeah. Let's keep it --

                         BOB
            Cause you would of let my brother
            rot in jail.

                         DIGNAN
            You said 48 hours!

                         BOB
            I never agreed to that.

                         DIGNAN
            Bob, you're lying!

                         BOB
            Bullshit.

                         DIGNAN
            All right! Backyard! Right now!

Dignan walks straight to the back door and goes out. He
stands on the deck.

                         DIGNAN
            Let's go, Bob!

Anthony gets up and tries to calm Dignan down.

                         ANTHONY
            Dignan. Take it easy.

                         DIGNAN
            Bob!

Bob is slowly moving toward the back door.

                         BOB
            No, Dignan. This is stupid.

Bob is standing just inside the back door.

                         ANTHONY
            Yeah. Dignan. Look. Let's just --

Dignan grabs Bob's shirt and pulls him out the door.

                         ANTHONY
            Stop, Dignan!

Anthony breaks them up. He stands in front of Bob, shielding
him.

                         ANTHONY
            He doesn't want to fight.

                         DIGNAN
            Get out of the way.

                         ANTHONY
            No, Diqnan. This isn't --

Dignan gets around Anthony and lands a glancing punch.

                         DIGNAN
            Come on!

                         BOB
            I don't want to fight you, Dignan.

                         ANTHONY
            Dignan, we're friends. Take it easy.

Dignan lands another punch. He grabs Bob's shirt and pulls
him around. Then he starts landing punches. One. Two. Then
Bob nails Dignan in the shoulder. They grab onto each other
and start fighting hard. They're about the same strength.
After a couple of seconds Anthony tries to break it up.

                         ANTHONY
            Dignan. Dignan.

All the sudden Dignan stops fighting.

                         DIGNAN
            All right. Stop.

Dignan puts his arms around Bob.

                         DIGNAN
            No fighting.

Dignan turns to Anthony. There's tears in his eyes.

                         DIGNAN
            No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault.

                         ANTHONY
            Easy, Dignan. It's OK.

They all catch their breath for a minute. Dignan hugs Bob
again.

                         DIGNAN
            It wasn't your fault, Bob. You had
            your brother.
                         BOB
            I didn't have any choice.

They stand there another minute.

                         DIGNAN
            I'm sorry, Bob.

                         BOB
            That's OK.

                         ANTHONY
                   (starting to laugh)
            Shit, Dignan.

                         DIGNAN
                   (smiles)
            What the fuck are we doing out here?

                         ANTHONY
            I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.

                         DIGNAN
            I'm sorry, Bob.

                         BOB
            That's OK.

                         DIGNAN
            Look. We want you on the job.

EXT. COUNTRY CLUB. DAY

The restaurant at Bob's country club, People are dressed for
golf and tennis. The waiters wear white jackets. and black
bow ties. The whole crew sits at a big table by the front
window.

                         MR. HENRY
            Let me get this straight. You don't
            play golf and you don't play tennis.
            So why do you belong to a country
            club?

                         BOB
            You got me.

                         MR. HENRY
                   (shakes his head)
            You're a piece of work, Bob.

A black waiter about thirty-five, JACKSON, stops by the table.

                         JACKSON
            How you doing, Bob?

                         BOB
            Hey, Jackson. How's it going?

Jackson refills their water glasses.

                         JACKSON
            You keeping out of trouble?

                         BOB
            I'm trying.

                         JACKSON
                   (looks at others at table)
            This boy's a troublemaker. He used
            to tear this place apart.

Mr. Henry laughs. Bob smiles sheepishly. Jackson stands
there for a minute looking around the room.

                         JACKSON
            Your brother was up here the other
            day. He said you ran away from home.

                         BOB
            He said what?

                         JACKSON
            He said you ran away from home.

                         BOB
            No. I didn't run away. I went out
            of town.

Jackson nods.

                         DIGNAN
            Bob.

Bob looks at Dignan. Dignan's looking across the room.
There's Future Man and his friend CLAY fresh from a round of
golf. They're standing on the other side of the room,
looking across at Bob. They're smiling. Jackson picks up two
empty plates and walks away. Future Man and CLAY walk to
Bob's table.

                         FUTURE MAN
            Fancy seeing you here, Bob.

                         BOB
            Yeah. Hey, Clay.

                         CLAY
            Hi, Bob.

                         FUTURE MAN
                   (smiling)
            So what's shaking?

                         BOB
            Nothing much.

Future Man looks at Anthony and Dignan. His smiles fades.

                         FUTURE MAN
            How's it going.

                         ANTHONY
            Fine, thanks.

Future Man looks at the rest of the crew. His smile comes
back. Mr. Henry smiles.

                         FUTURE MAN
            John Mapplethorpe.
                   (shaking hands with
                   crew across table)
            How are you. Hi.

                         MR. HENRY
            Good to know you, John.

                         BOB
            Jackson says you told him I ran
            away from home.

Clay laughs. Future Man smiles.

                         FUTURE MAN
            I might have mentioned it.

                         BOB
            John, I'm twenty-six years old I
            didn't run away from home.

                         FUTURE MAN
            I know, Bob. You were on a secret
            mission.

                         BOB
            I'd appreciate it if you didn't go
            around telling people lies about me.

                         FUTURE MAN
            Right. I'm sorry.
                   (looks at Clay)
            You've got a reputation to think
            about.

Clay smiles. Bob shakes his head. Mr. Henry stands up.
Everyone looks at him. He's got a cold but calm expression.

                         MR. HENRY
            The world needs dreamers, son.

                         FUTURE MAN
            What?

                         MR. HENRY
            The world needs dreamers. To
            relieve the pain of consciousness.

Future Man nods. Pause. Mr. Henry doesn't sit down.

                         FUTURE MAN
            Well, we'll see you later, Bob.

                         MR. HENRY
            Pleasure to meet you, John.

                         FUTURE MAN
                   (hesitantly)
            Nice to meet you.

Future Man and Clay walk away. Mr. Henry sits down.

                         MR. HENRY
            I hope this doesn't offend you, Bob.
                   (looks closely at Bob)
            Your brother is a cocksucker.

Bob smiles. They all smile.

                         BOB
            No. That doesn't offend me.

EXT. HINCKLEY COLD STORAGE. DAY

Dignan's hidden in some bushes, watching the Hinckley Cold
Storage building with binoculars. Anthony's crouched beside
him taking notes in a notebook.

                         DIGNAN
            OK. Man in blue jeans just left by
            southwest door. He is entering a
            white van. What time is it?

                         ANTHONY
            Eleven fifteen.

                         DIGNAN
            OK. Mark that down.

                         ANTHONY
            I did.

Dignan keeps watching through the binoculars. He suddenly
looks back at Anthony.

                         DIGNAN
            God. Isn't this great? Working on
            the job. Got a wheel man. Got a
            safecracker. Good friends with Mr.
            Henry.

                         ANTHONY
            Yeah. It's pretty good.

                         DIGNAN
            It's like we've finally arrived.

Anthony nods. He's writing something.

                         DIGNAN
            What are you writing?

Anthony shows him a little flip cartoon of a guy pole
vaulting.

INT/EXT. PLANNING SEQUENCE. DAY

We see the team assembled around a table. They're drinking
coffee and looking at pictures, charts, maps, diagrams,
tools. Dignan passes out some walkie talkies.

They test out some smoke cannisters on the roof. Dignan
throws one down. They all run for cover.

Applejack and Dignan drive fast through a slalom course in a
deserted parking lot.

We see Kumar working on a safe. He wears a stethoscope and
listens to the tumblers. He turns the dial. Dignan is timing
him with a stopwatch.

Kumar opens the safe. He looks at Dignan. Dignan nods with a
serious expression on his face.

EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS. DAY

Anthony and Mr. Henry are jogging along railroad tracks in
the warehouse district. Anthony wears a blue T-shirt and
shorts. Mr. Henry looks like a boxer in grey sweats with the
hood up and a crisp white towel wrapped around his neck and
tucked into his sweat top. He's wearing black Chuck Taylors.
They've both got smooth running styles, though every twenty
yards or so Mr. Henry rolls his shoulders and gives a quick
flurry of punches. An older woman rides a bicycle across the
tracks. She's not pretty, but she's got a strong face.
Pioneer stock.

                         MR. HENRY
            Look at that woman. She's what?
            Fifty? Fifty-five? But she hasn't
            let herself go. I appreciate an
            older woman who has a commitment to
            her body.

                         ANTHONY
            So do I.

They watch her ride down the street.

                         MR. HENRY
            Tell me something. What the hell
            kind of name is Dignan?

                         ANTHONY
            I'm not really sure. I think it's
            Irish. Or maybe --

                         MR. HENRY
            I guess what I'm trying to say is
            what the hell kind of person is
            this Dignan?

                         ANTHONY
            What do you mean what kind of
            person? He's a good person.

                         MR. HENRY
            Sure, sure. He's a great person,
            and I'd call bullshit on anybody
            who said differently. But I wonder
            if the kid has the goods
                   (taps his temple)
            up here.
                         ANTHONY
                   (long pause)
            I don't think you're giving him
            enough credit. I know sometimes he
            doesn't think an idea through. He
            gets too excited. But --

                         MR. HENRY
            As far as I can tell he hasn't
            thought his life through. He'd be
            fine cutting my grass or parking my
            car. But business?
                   (looks at Anthony)
            You I can work with. You I could
            groom. Dignan's not going to make it.

Anthony stops running. Mr. Henry stops ahead of him and
looks back, jogging in place. Pause.

                         ANTHONY
            You're wrong about Dignan.

Mr. Henry stops jogging in place.

                         ANTHONY
            And you're wrong if you think, I'd
            turn my back on a friend.

                         MR. HENRY
            Hold it.

Mr. Henry walks to Anthony and puts his hand on his shoulder.
Anthony knocks it off.

                         MR. HENRY
            Anthony. I want.to say one thing to
            you.

Mr. Henry looks Anthony right in the eye.

                         MR. HENRY
            Congratulations. You passed the test.

                         ANTHONY
            What do you mean?

                         MR. HENRY
            The Abe Henry double-cross test.
            You just made a perfect score.

Anthony has to recover.

                         ANTHONY
            That was a test?

                         MR. HENRY
            Take a deep breath.

Anthony takes a deep breath. Mr. Henry massages Anthony's
shoulders. He takes Anthony's head in his arms and does a
quick pull to one side: cracks his neck. Then the other side.

                         MR. HENRY
            How does that feel?

                         ANTHONY
            It feels good.

Anthony rubs his hands on his neck and moves his head around.

                         ANTHONY
            Did Dignan take the test?

                         MR. HENRY
                   (pause)
            Yes, he did.

                         ANTHONY
            How'd he do?

They start jogging again.

                         MR. HENRY
            Well, he agreed 100% that Bob
            should be dropped. And he also
            agreed you were a liability. But he
            felt his talent would make up for
            your weaknesses.

                         ANTHONY
            That sounds like Dignan.

They veer away from the tracks, picking up the pace, and
head into a field toward Mr. Henry's warehouse.

EXT. ROOFTOP. NIGHT

They're having a party at Mr. Henry's warehouse. There are
tables and a BBQ on the roof, with white Christmas lights
strung up and music playing. Anthony, Dignan, Bob, Kumar,
and Mr. Henry are there. Plus a couple of young GIRLS,
eighteen or nineteen years old. Mr. Henry's got a name tag
that says, Hi, my name is Mr. Henry. Everyone's mingling on
the rooftop. Rowboat is at the grill. Applejack comes up the
stairs with a grocery bag under his arm.

                         MR. HENRY
            Woah. There he is. Applejack! What
            it is.

Mr. Henry and Applejack shake hands.

                         APPLEJACK
            Is my car OK out there?

                         MR. HENRY
            I love it. He always wants to know
            if the car's OK. Get a hot dog.

                         APPLEJACK
            I don't eat pork.

                         MR. HENRY
            Super K. Kumar. Come here.

Mr. Henry goes over to Kumar and throws his arm around him.

                         APPLEJACK
            I don't know why the fuck we're
            having a party. The damn job's not
            over yet.

                         DIGNAN
            Well, this isn't really a party per
            se.

                         APPLEJACK
            You don't celebrate til it's over.

                         DIGNAN
            True.

Dignan's solemn for a minute. He takes a bite of a hot dog.

                         APPLEJACK
            What the fuck are you doing?

Dignan hesitates. He takes the hot dog away from his mouth.
He's embarassed. Applejack shakes his head, disgusted. He
walks away.

                         ROWBOAT
            What was that all about?

                         DIGNAN
            Ramedan.

Anthony and Mr. Henry are standing together in a doorway. Mr.
Henry's got a martini.

                         MR. HENRY
            I'll tell you, Anthony. Times like
            this I get philosophical. What does
            it mean? What's it all about? Are
            you afraid to die?

                         ANTHONY
            Me?

                         MR. HENRY
            No, that door over there.

                         ANTHONY
            I don't want to die.

                         MR. HENRY
            Are you afraid?

                         ANTHONY
            Yeah. I mean, I don't think about
            it all the time. But once in awhile
            I kind of go, Woah. Man.

                         MR. HENRY
            Exactly. Woah.

                         ANTHONY
            Death.

                         MR. HENRY
            The fear of death, The pain of
            consciousness.
                   (taking a sip)
            Did you mix this martini?

                         ANTHONY
            No. Bob did.

                         MR. HENRY
            Bob. Bob. That's a palindrome.
                   (laughs uproariously)
            I love palindromes.

                         ANTHONY
            Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry?

                         MR. HENRY
                   (looks right at him)
            Anthony, I'm petrified.

Bob is talking to the other girl.

                         BOB
            Is that sugarless gum you're chewing?

                         GIRL 2
            I'm not chewing gum.

                         BOB
            Would you like a piece?

                         GIRL 2
                   (smiles brightly)
            Sure. Thanks.

Kumar and Applejack are sitting at a table.

                         KUMAR
            If someone could copy my life story.
            If I had someone, man, to just
            write what I talk. I have so many
            stories. Bestseller, man.

                         APPLEJACK
            I've been all over the Goddamn
            country. I've seen things.

                         KUMAR
            I used to go to Vegas and do
            headstands.

                         APPLEJACK
            No kidding.

                         KUMAR
            Easy.

Kumar does a handstand.

INT. WAREHOUSE. NIGHT

Anthony, Dignan, and Bob are sitting at the table in Mr.
Henry's office. Dignan's got plans and diagrams spread out.
There's music playing in the next room and we can hear
people talking outside the door.

                         DIGNAN
            Come on, Bob.

                         BOB
            I know it, man. Hang on.

                         DIGNAN
            Jesus Christ.

                         ANTHONY
            Give him a second.
                         BOB
            Hopscotch. The code name is
            hopscotch.

                         DIGNAN
            Good.

Mr. Henry looks in the door. He's got a glass of wine in one
hand and a bottle and empty glasses in the other.

                         MR. HENRY
            Join the party, fellas.

                         DIGNAN
            We're just going over a few things.

Mr. Henry looks at the plans on the table. He sets down the
three glasses and pours some wine.

                         MR. HENRY
            I'll tell you something, Dignan. It
            is possible to overplan. You don't
            want to turn the crew into robots.
            Right?

Dignan nods seriously.

                         MR. HENRY
            You got to have fun with it.
            There's no point if you're not
            having any fun. Would you like me
            to be there tomorrow?

                         DIGNAN
            Yes.

                         MR. HENRY
                   (immediately)
            Why?

                         DIGNAN
            Well, I think --

                         MR. HENRY
            No, if I go out on this job, then
            it's just another score by Mr.
            Henry. And I don't see it like that.
            This is your job. Your creation. I
            want you to try this.

They all try the wine. Mr. Henry watches their reactions.

                         ANTHONY
            This is good.

                         MR. HENRY
            I want to ask a favor, boys. One
            day, when I'm long gone and all but
            forgotten, make one last toast to
            Abe Henry. And remember me as a
            friend.

They drink.

EXT. ROOFTOP. NIGHT

Back on the roof. Bob and Dignan are sitting at a table with
one of the girls. Applejack is dancing with another. Kumar's
talking to Reudi. Anthony and Mr. Henry are standing at the
edge of the roof, looking out at the city. Mr. Henry's
smoking a joint.

                         MR. HENRY
            Well, that's just it, Anthony. A
            lot of criminals have problems.
            Some of them are alcoholics. Some
            have drug problems. Others dome
            from broken homes. I see a real
            need for healing.

Mr. Henry passes the joint to Anthony. Anthony smokes it.

                         MR. HENRY
            But you're thieves. It's what you
            are.

                         ANTHONY
            Yeah.

                         MR. HENRY
            It's an esoteric journey.

Anthony passes the joint back to Mr. Henry.

                         MR. HENRY
            We're renegades from despair.

                         ANTHONY
                   (nods)
            Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?

                         MR. HENRY
            Absolutely.

                         ANTHONY
            Why'd you want to help us?

                         MR. HENRY
                   (inhales, pause,
                   holding in smoke)
            Because I was like you once. And
            there was no one there to help me.

Mr. Henry exhales the smoke. He hands the joint to Anthony.
Anthony takes a hit. They stare out at the darkness.

INT. BOB'S HOUSE. NIGHT

Anthony and Dignan are sitting in the kitchen. Anthony's got
on a t-shirt and boxers. Dignan's wearing a bathrobe. All
the lights in the house are out except one in the kitchen.
Anthony's drinking a glass of milk. Dignan's got orange juice.

                         DIGNAN
            Next week we'll be drinking piña
            coladas.

                         ANTHONY
                   (nods)
            Hopefully this trip'll go a little
            smoother than the last one.

Dignan nods.

                         ANTHONY
            Or I might end up with a broken nose.

                         DIGNAN
            Did that hurt?

Anthony shrugs. There's a long silence.

                         DIGNAN
            This'll be a good trip.

Anthony nods. Pause. He smiles slightly.

                         ANTHONY
            I'll try not to hold you back
            tomorrow.

                         DIGNAN
            I don't think you will.

                         ANTHONY
            I don't want to be too much of a
            liability.

                         DIGNAN
            Look, you're going to do fine. It's
            OK to be scared.

                         ANTHONY
                   (laughs slightly,
                   shaking his head)
            I don't think I ever said this to
            you. But it meant a lot to me the
            way you were after that Swifty
            stuff happened.

Silence. Dignan's a little embarassed.

                         ANTHONY
            He was a nice guy.

                         DIGNAN
                   (shrugs)
            He was all right.

They both sit there for a minute. Quiet. Anthony sips his
milk.

                         ANTHONY
            Do you like Inez?

                         DIGNAN
            As a person?

                         ANTHONY
            Yeah. As a girl.

                         DIGNAN
            Yes. I do.

                         ANTHONY
            So do I.

Bob comes into the kitchen in his bathrobe looking haggard
yet wired. Anthony and Dignan look at him. He goes to the
refrigerator. He takes out a chocolate cake and a carton of
milk. He pours himself a glass of milk. He goes over to the
table with the cake and sits down. He cuts himself a piece
of cake. He swallows two pills, one at a time, each with a
long drink of milk. The pills are big capsules and he
struggles a little when he swallows.

                         ANTHONY
            You OK, Bob?

                         BOB
                   (snaps)
            No, I'm having a heart attack. Of
            course, I'm OK. What's that supposed
            to mean?

                         ANTHONY
                   (pause)
            Nothing. I was just asking.

                         DIGNAN
            Jesus, Bob.

Bob senses that's he's over-reacted. He backtracks.

                         BOB
            No, I know. I'm just saying. I feel
            fine. You want a piece of cake?

                         ANTHONY
                   (pause)
            Sure.

Bob starts to cut him a piece.

                         DIGNAN
            I'll take one of those, too, please.

EXT. HINCKLEY COLD STORAGE. DAY

Anthony is positioned behind some bushes, across from the
building. He's wearing a black parka. He looks through some
binoculars. Re pulls out his walkie talkie.

                         ANTHONY
            Bird Dog to Scarecrow. Bird Dog to
            Scarecrow.

                         DIGNAN (VO)
            Go ahead, Bird Dog.

                         ANTHONY
            You're all clear.

                         DIGNAN (VO)
            Roger.

                         ANTHONY
                   (pause)
            We all set?

                         DIGNAN (VO)
            Hang on a second.

Anthony waits a second.

We see Dignanr Applejack, and Kumar getting out of the car.

                         DIGNAN
                   (into walkie talkie)
            OK. Let's do it.

Dignan starts to move out. He remembers something. Says back
into his walkie talkie:

                         DIGNAN
            Let's get lucky, Bird Dog.

Dignan, Applejack, and Kumar start across the parking lot.
Dignan's got on a business suit. Applejack has on sunglasses.
Kumar is carrying a leather satchel.

They go in the side door and down a narrow passageway. They
get into the freight elevator and go up. Bob's voice comes
through on Dignan's walkie talkie.

                         BOB (VO)
            Scarecrow?

                         DIGNAN
            Yeah?

We see Bob: standing on the loading dock behind the building.
He's wearing an extremely heavy wool jumpsuit with a hood.

                         BOB
            Everything OK?

                         DIGNAN (VO)
            Yeah. We're in the elevator. How's
            it look back there?

                         BOB
            It looks pretty good. There's
            nobody back here.

                         DIGNAN
            Stand by. Bird Dog?

We see Anthony: still in the bushes.

                         ANTHONY
            Uh-huh?

                         DIGNAN (VO)
            Take your second position.

                         ANTHONY
            OK. Roger.

Anthony gets up and starts out across the parking lot, hands
in his pockets, not too quickly.

Dignan, Kumar, and Applejack get off the elevator.

                         DIGNAN
            OK. Six minutes.

Applejack goes one way down the hall. Dignan and Kumar go
the other. They turn the corner. They go down a wide
passageway.

                         KUMAR
            Where did he go?

                         DIGNAN
            Who? Applejack?

                         KUMAR
            Why did he go that way?
                   (points back down hall)


                         DIGNAN
            He's going to watch the back
            stairwell, remember?
                   (pause)
            Don't worry about it.

Dignan and Kumar come up to a door. Dignan slides a crowbar
out of his jacket. He snaps open the door. They go in. It's
a small office with a desk and a little safe in the corner.
Dignan clears everything off the desk with one quick sweep
of the arm. He puts down the briefcase and opens it up. It's
full of tools. Kumar unzips his satchel and takes out a roll
of tape. He immediately sets to work on the safe. Dignan
steps back out the door and closes it.

                         DIGNAN
                   (into walkie talkie)
            Bird dog? You in position?

We see Anthony on top of a fire escape, about four stories up.

                         ANTHONY
            I'm in position, Scarecrow.

                         DIGNAN (VO)
            Any activity?

                         ANTHONY
            Not at all. The place is totally
            deserted.

                         DIGNAN (VO)
            Good. It's supposed to be.

                         ANTHONY
            I've got a great view up here. I
            can see all the --

                         DIGNAN (VO)
            Stand by, Bird Dog.

We see Dignan standing in the hall, outside the office.

                         DIGNAN
            Jacknife. Come in, Jacknife.
                   (pause)
            Hello? Bob? Are you there?

We hear the sound of an elevator moving.

                         DIGNAN
                   (beat)
            Bob? What the fuck is going on?
            Anthony? Who's in the elevator?

We see Anthony on the fire escape.

                         ANTHONY
            I don't know.

                         DIGNAN (VO)
            Check the fucking elevator. It's
            moving.

Anthony goes in a little door. Down a passageway. Through a
freezer. Into a corridor. Past the freight elevator, which
is open on this floor. Then around a corner to a smaller
elevator as it opens: Bob's inside.

                         ANTHONY
            What are you doing?

                         BOB
            My walkie talkie's busted. 1 can't
            tell what's going on.

                         ANTHONY
            Let me see it.
                   (fiddling with it)
            Did you drop it?

                         BOB
            No.

Dignan's still standing in the hall as Anthony and Bob come
around the corner. Dignan yells at them down the hall.

                         DIGNAN
            What's happening? What's going on?

                         ANTHONY
            It was Bob. His walkie talkie's
            busted.

                         BOB
            I couldn't hear anything.

                         DIGNAN
            Who's watching the door? What the
            fuck are you doing? Get back in
            position.

The elevator starts whirring again.

                         DIGNAN
            Who did that? What the fuck is that?

                         ANTHONY
            It's going back down.

                         DIGNAN
                   (pannicking, into
                   walkie talkie)
            Applejack! What's happening?

                         APPLEJACK (VO)
            What?

                         DIGNAN
            Bob! Get back in position!

For just a second we hear the sound of music playing.
Everyone freezes. FOUR GUYS, two of them in jumpsuits like
Bob's, step out into the corridor. They've got bags from
Jack in the Box. They're drinking drinks and shakes. One of
them is holding a jam box. They stop. Dignan pulls out his
gun.

                         DIGNAN
            Don't move! Get up against the wall!

Anthony and Bob pull out their guns and hold them on the
four guys.

                         DIGNAN
                   (into walkie talkie)
            They're back! Get down here!
                   (not into walkie talkie)
            What are you doing here?

                         GUY IN JUMPSUIT
            We work here.

                         DIGNAN
            Time!

                         ANTHONY
                   (checks watch)
            Two minutes.

Simultaneously: Kumar opens the door. Applejack comes
running down the hall with his gun out.

                         APPLEJACK
            Where'd they come from?

                         ANTHONY
            The front stairs.

                         APPLEJACK
                   (to Bob)
            Where were you?

                         BOB
            My walkie talkie broke.

Applejack reaches in his pocket and pulls out a dark blue
nylon stocking. He pulls it over his head. Dignan, Anthony,
and Bob immediately do the same. Anthony's is red.

Dignan steps into the office with Kumar.

                         DIGNAN
            What's the story?

                         KUMAR
            Can't get it. It won't...
                   (make s gesture)


                         DIGNAN
            What can we do?

Kumar looks at his tools. Moves them around on the desk.

                         DIGNAN
            OK. Fuck it.

He goes back into the hall.

                         DIGNAN
            Let's go. Fuck it.

TWO GUYS with a cart stop at the end of the corridor.

                         ANTHONY
            Freeze!

                         DIGNAN
            Nobody move!

                         ANTHONY
            Get against the wall!

Bob's gun goes off. Everybody looks at him. Dead silence.
Bob looks around like it must have been somebody else's gun
that went off.

                         ANTHONY
            Jesus, Bob.

                         BOB
            I didn't do anything.

Applejack falls to his knees. He drops his gun.

                         ANTHONY
            Applejack? Are you OK?

Applejack clutches his arm and rolls onto his side.

                         DIGNAN
                   (shouting)
            What's wrong with Applejack?

                         BOB
            He's having a heart attack or
            something.

                         DIGNAN
                   (screaming)
            Let's go!

Dignan throws down his smoke cannister. Bob and Anthony
automatically throw down theirs. Smoke instantly fills the
hall.

The hostages stand completely clear of the smoke. They watch
Anthony, Dignan, and Bob rush around blindly in the haze.

                         DIGNAN
            Help me move him.

                         ANTHONY
            Careful. Check his pulse.

Anthony holds all the guys at gunpoint. Dignan and Bob carry
Applejack down the hall, into the elevator.
                         DIGNAN
            Is he breathing?

                         BOB
            I think so.

An alarm starts ringing.

                         DIGNAN
            Jesus Christ.  What the fuck is that?

                         BOB
            I didn't think there was an alarm.

                         DIGNAN
            Take him to the car, Bob.

Dignan runs back down the hall to Anthony.

                         DIGNAN
            Who tripped the alarm?

                         ANTHONY
            It's the fire alarm.  Somebody
            pulled the fire alarm.

                         DIGNAN
            Where's Kumar?

                         ANTHONY
                   (looking around)
            I don't know.

                         DIGNAN
            Jesus Christ, Anthony.  Did you
            lose him?

                         GUY ON FLOOR
            He's in the freezer.

                         DIGNAN
            What?

                         GUY ON FLOOR
            He went in there.

                         ANTHONY
            What for?

The guy on the floor kind of shrugs.  Anthony crosses the
hall. He pulls open one of the big freezer doors. Kumar is
standing there with his bag and the briefcase.  You can see
his breath in the air.

                         ANTHONY
            What are you doing?

                         DIGNAN
            Let's go. Come on.

They go down the hall to the freight elevator.  They start
down.

                         ANTHONY
            What were you doing in there?

Kumar shakes his head and shrugs his shoulders.

EXT. HINCKLEY COLD STORAGE. DAY

They go out the front door, across the parking lot. Kumar's
lagging behind.

                         ANTHONY
            Wait for Kumar.

                         DIGNAN
            Come on, Kumar.

They come up to the car. Anthony tries the door. It's locked.
Bob comes running around the side of the building.

                         BOB
            The elevator broke.

                         DIGNAN
            Where's Applejack?

                         BOB
            He's stuck between two floors.

                         ANTHONY
            You're kidding.

                         DIGNAN
            Applejack's stuck in the elevator?

                         BOB
            Yeah.

                         ANTHONY
            Who's got the car keys?

Everyone looks at everyone else.

                         BOB
            Applejack drove.

                         DIGNAN
                   (pause)
            Run. Run. Let's go.

Bob takes off at a sprint. Kumar follows him.

                         ANTHONY
            Jesus, Dignan.

Anthony pulls off the red stocking and throws it down. He
tries the other doors on the car.

                         ANTHONY
            What the fuck happened to the the
            plan?

Dignan pulls off his stocking. Anthony starts walking fast
across the parking lot. Dignan stands still by the car.
Staring straight ahead.

                         ANTHONY
            Come on.

                         DIGNAN
            I'll see you there.

                         ANTHONY
            What?

                         DIGNAN
            I'll see you there.

                         ANTHONY
            What are you talking about?

                         DIGNAN
            I'll get him.

                         ANTHONY
            There's not enough time.

                         DIGNAN
            Yes, there is. Let's get organized.

Dignan starts toward the building. Anthony moves after him.

                         ANTHONY
            Dignan, it's too late.

                         DIGNAN
            I don't think so.

Dignan and Anthony look at each other for an instant. Dignan
turns and sprints back into the building.

Anthony stands alone in the parking lot.

                                            CUT TO:

a bedroom with big French windows. No furniture.

                                            CUT TO:

a wood-panelled study. Stripped bare.

                                            CUT TO:

an elegant dining room. Cleaned out.

EXT. BOB'S HOUSE. DAY

A GUY in a moving company uniform carries a Louis XIV chair
out the front door of Bob's house, down the path to the
street. Two other MOVERS pass him on the way. They've got a
dolly.

The guy carries the chair into a huge moving van. It's full
of furniture and paintings.

Mr. Henry and Rowboat are standing in the street. Rowboat's
smoking a cigarette, writing on clipboard. Hector stands
behind them in the grass. Mr. Henry takes out two cigars. He
holds one out to Rowboat. Rowboat shakes his head. Mr. Henry
shrugs and lights one for himself.

                         MR. HENRY
            You know, Rowboat. People who smoke
            cigarettes die. People who smoke
            cigars just keep on going.

Rowboat nods, smoking. Mr. Henry looks at Hector. He points.

                         MR. HENRY
            Sit.

Hector sits. Mr. Henry smiles a broad smile. The movers go
buy with a beautiful Moroccan divan.

EXT. HINCKLEY COLD STORAGE. DAY

Dignan comes out the front door pulling Applejack, semi-
conscious, to the car. Dignan loans Applejack against the
door. He checks Applejack's pockets for the keys. He looks
around on the ground.

He hears sirens in the distance. He looks across the parking
lot. Two squad cars screech in off the street.

Dignan takes off into the building.

INT. HINCKLEY COLD STORAGE. DAY

Dignan sprints down the corridor. Races up the stairs. Runs
down hall after hall.

Two COPS appear out of the elevator.

                         COP
            Freeze!

Dignan ducks into a stairwell. He runs down the stairs and
into another corridor. He can hear cops yelling from two
different directions. He crosses a catwalk. Cuts through an
office. Pulls open a door and goes into one of the freezer
rooms.

Cops come yelling down the hallway. Dignan runs through the
freezer room and tries the other door. It's stuck. Three
COPS come inside. Dignan instantly puts his hands up in the
air.

                         COP #1
            Drop the fucking gun!

                         COP #2
            Don't move!

Dignan drops the gun. The cops rush him. They nail him into
the wall. Get him in a headlock, pulling hard.

                         COP #3
            You're caught, buddy.

They pull him into the hallway.

                         COP #1
            Put your hands behind your back.

                         DIGNAN
            I'm not going to do anything.

                         COP #3
                   (squeezing his neck)
            Why'd you try to run, buddy? Don't
            you know what freeze means? Don't
            you speak fucking English?

                         COP #1
            Take it easy.

They put him face down on the floor and cuff him.

                         COP #1
                   (to Dignan)
            Calm down.

They move him down the corridor. Dignan's nose is bleeding.
He looks terrified.

Applejack is sitting propped up against the wall. He's got
an oxygen mask on his face and a team of paramedics and cops
around him. Somebody's taking his blood pressure. Another
one's giving him an IV.

                                            CUT TO:

Anthony running down a sidewalk. He drops his gun in a
trashcan without slowing down. He crosses a bridge and runs
into the the trees.

                                            BLACKOUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. COUNTY JAIL. DAY

There's snow in the air. The prison yard is wide with dry
grass and concrete. It's split up by chain link fences.
Guards sit in the towers.

Dignan's wearing an inmate jumpsuit. Anthony and Bob walk
with him across the yard. They've brought along two bags of
food from a hamburger place.

                         DIGNAN
            I said to the DA, That cop who hit
            me must of given me CRS disease.

                         BOB
            What's that?

                         DIGNAN
            That's just what the DA asked. CRS
            is a disease where you can't
            remember shit.

Dignan smiles.

                         ANTHONY
            Like amnesia.

                         DIGNAN
            Can't remember shit. CRS.

                         BOB
            Oh.

Anthony kind of smiles.

                         DIGNAN
            Tell Mr. Henry I said that.

Anthony nods. Silence. They walk past a bunch of guys
lifting weights on the other side of a fence.

                         DIGNAN
            So is Mr. Henry going to come by
            and see me or anything?

                         ANTHONY
                   (pause)
            I don't think so. I mean. Actually,
            he robbed Bob's house.

                         DIGNAN
            He did?

                         ANTHONY
            Yeah.

                         DIGNAN
            You got to be kidding me.

                         ANTHONY
            I'm not kidding.

                         DIGNAN
                   (pause)
            What'd he get?

                         ANTHONY
            Pretty much everything.

                         DIGNAN
            The grandfather clock?

                         BOB
            He got everything.

Dignan nods. Pause.

                         DIGNAN
            Wow.
                   (pause, looks at Bob)
            Sorry, Bob.

Bob shrugs, looking at the ground. Dignan looks to Anthony.

                         DIGNAN
            You think Applejack knew?

                         ANTHONY
                   (shrugs)
            We haven't heard from Applejack
            since he got out of the hospital.
            His case got dismissed.

Dignan's stunned to hear this.

                         DIGNAN
            Why?

                         ANTHONY
            We're not sure.

                         BOB
            We think Mr. Henry maybe --

                         ANTHONY
            His health isn't very good, you
            know. They take that into account.

Pause. Dignan nods.

                         DIGNAN
            No. That's true.

Long silence.

                         ANTHONY
            Mr. Henry never gave you a test,
            did he?

                         DIGNAN
            What do you mean?

                         ANTHONY
            Nothing.

                                            CUT TO:

a picnic table in the prison yard. There's frost on the
ground. They're eating lunch.

                         DIGNAN
            You're living on a sailboat?

                         ANTHONY
                   (nods)
            It belongs to Bob's uncle.

                         DIGNAN
            How big is it?
                         ANTHONY
            Oh, I'd say about --

                         BOB
            It's in the driveway.

                         ANTHONY
                   (pause)
            Temporarily.

                         DIGNAN
            Where?

                         ANTHONY
            Behind Bob's house.

Long pause.

                         DIGNAN
            Does it float?

                         ANTHONY
            We're not sure yet. It's going to
            need some repairs.

Dignan nods.

                         ANTHONY
            So how is it in there?
                   (pointing at cell block)


                         DIGNAN
                   (shrugs)
            What can I say? It's jail. You
            don't sleep when you want to. You
            don't eat when you want to.

                         BOB
            Do you have your own room?

                         DIGNAN
            We don't have rooms, Bob. We have
            cells.

                         BOB
            Do you have your own cell?

                         DIGNAN
            No. I have a cellmate. His name's
            Carl.

                         ANTHONY
            What's he in for?

                         DIGNAN
            He stole a tractor.

                         BOB
            Do they let you --

                         DIGNAN
            I don't really want to talk about
            it, Bob.

Long pause.

Anthony takes a sip from a milkshake. Dignan unwraps the
foil from a cheeseburger. He takes a bite.

                         DIGNAN
                   (with his mouth full
                   of food)
            This sure beats the shit out of the
            shit they crap out in this joint.

Anthony and Bob laugh. Dignan takes another huge bite.

                         DIGNAN
                   (smiling)
            I might have to have another one of
            these.

                                            CUT TO:

Dignan in handcuffs behind a chain link fence. He's standing
in line with some other inmates.

                         DIGNAN
            Thanks for coming.

Anthony nods. They stand there in silence. The line moves
forward a few steps. Anthony and Bob walk with Dignan on the
other side of the fence. The line stops. Pause.

Dignan leans toward the fence.

                         DIGNAN
            Hey.

He motions for them to come closer to the fence. He whispers:

                         DIGNAN
            I think I may have found a way out
            of here.

                         ANTHONY
                   (pause)
            You're kidding.

                         DIGNAN
            No. I'm not.

                         ANTHONY
            How?

                         DIGNAN
            Shhh. Wait for my instructions.

                         ANTHONY
            Dignan, I --

The line starts moving. Anthony and Bob walk with Dignan on
the other side of the fence.

                         DIGNAN
            When we go through the next gate
            you'll have 30 seconds to take out
            the tower guard.

                         ANTHONY
            What?

                         DIGNAN
            Have the car running at the north-
            west checkpoint. Bob and I'll --

                         ANTHONY
            Dignan, I --

The line starts moving faster.

                         DIGNAN
            Scale the barricade and tunnel
            through no man's land. And Bob.
            Remember:

                         ANTHONY
            Scale the --

                         DIGNAN
            Shield me from the bullets. They
            won't shoot civilians. Ready?

                         BOB
            Hold on --

                         DIGNAN
            Here we go.

                         BOB
            Wait a second --

                         DIGNAN
            Now!

Anthony and Bob look all around in a panic. They look to
Dignan.

Dignan shuffles along with the rest of the inmates. He looks
at Anthony and Bob. He smiles. He shrugs.

                         DIGNAN
            So long.

Bob and Anthony slowly half-smile. They wave to Dignan as
the line of inmates turns away. Anthony looks to Bob. Bob
smiles.

The line of inmates stops about fifty feet away. Dignan
looks back. Anthony looks at him. Dignan's expression has
changed. He wasn't expecting them to see it. His eyes look
cold. Anthony puts his hand on the fence. Dignan turns and
the line of inmates disappears into the cell block.

Anthony stands there in silence.. He lets go of the fence.

He walks with Bob down the long path in the cold air.

                                            FADE OUT.
BOTTLE ROCKET

       screenplay by Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson




EXT. ALLEY. DAY

ANTHONY and DIGNAN walk down an alley behind a convenience
store. Anthony's nineteen. He's got on a red jacket with an
Enco patch. Dignan's twenty. He has a buzz-cut and wears a
short-sleeved terrycloth shirt. He carries a vinyl tennis
bag. It's got a pouch for a racquet but no racquet in it.

                         DIGNAN
            What color hair does he have?

                         ANTHONY
            Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.

                         DIGNAN
            Making Hutch David Soul?

                         ANTHONY
            Right. The blond guy.

                         DIGNAN
            OK. That's wrong.

                         ANTHONY
            Dignan, it's --

                         DIGNAN
            Plus where's Huggie Bear?

                         ANTHONY
            He's not there. Huggie Bear isn't
            in every single episode.

                         DIGNAN
            I think you might of dreamed this
            one, Anthony.

                         ANTHONY
            No. It's a real episode. The killer
            is leading him across the city by
            calling different pay phones.

They climb over a high wooden fence.

EXT. BACKYARD. DAY

They walk through somebody's backyard.

                         DIGNAN
            Why?

                         ANTHONY
            As part of his plan. I don't know
            why.

                         DIGNAN
            See, that's what I'm saying. It has
            the logic of a dream.

                         ANTHONY
            The point is the killer always
            goes, May I speak to Starsky? He
            says his name.

                         DIGNAN
                   (pause)
            What does Starsky say?

                         ANTHONY
            He says. This is he.

                         DIGNAN
            This is he?

                         ANTHONY
            No. This is he.

They climb another fence. There's big house on the other side.

INT. HOUSE. DAY

Anthony and Dignan are inside walking through the foyer.
Anthony goes up the stairway quickly and quietly.

Dignan walks to the master bedroom. Goes in the closet and
grabs a box. Looks inside. Dumps it into his bag.

Anthony goes into a bedroom. Looks in a dresser and takes
out two watches. Digs through some socks and finds some cash.

Dignan goes in the study. Opens a drawer and closes it.
Opens another and lifts out a set of thin leather coin books.

Anthony's in a kid's room. Looking at posters of a football
player and John McEnroe on the walls. He grabs a walkman and
a calculator. Then suddenly stops moving. He crouches down.
Looks at a shelf of dozens of little metal soldiers. They're
in formations with different uniforms.

Dignan is walking down the hallway as Anthony comes down the
stairs. They walk to the door and go out.

INT. DINER. DAY

A twenty-four hour diner. Anthony and Dignan are eating at
the counter.

                         ANTHONY
            Did you see what I meant about the
            window?

                         DIGNAN
            Kind of. Except we've already got
            the keys.

                         ANTHONY
            That's true. But what if they
            change the locks?

                         DIGNAN
            Would they do that?

                         ANTHONY
            Who knows? That's why I filed it
            down.

Dignan nods.

                         ANTHONY
            Now that window can never be locked.
            It's impossible.

                         DIGNAN
            See, your mind is very good with
            the more mechanical details.
            Whereas my strength would be --

A good-looking WOMAN about forty-five years old interrupts
them.

                         WOMAN
            Can I use your Tabasco?

                         ANTHONY
            Sure.

Anthony hands her a bottle of Tabasco off the counter. She
walks away. Down the counter.

                         ANTHONY
            You don't see many women who like
            Tabasco.

They watch her for a minute. Dignan looks away.

                         ANTHONY
            She's really kind of hot.

                         DIGNAN
                   (looks back at her, nods)
            She's an attractive older woman.

EXT. BOB'S HOUSE. DAY

A huge house with a wide lawn. BOB, who's about twenty-six,
wearing black jeans and a V-neck T-shirt, is spraying down a
battered 1972 Mercedes with a garden hose. He's got his
shirt off and a towel around his neck. Dignan has an
expression of intense concentration as he looks at the car.

                         BOB
            Well, what do you think?

                         DIGNAN
            I don't know, Bob. What about one
            of those?

Dignan points to a new BMW and a Lexus in front of the garage.

                         BOB
            I'm not allowed to drive those.

                         DIGNAN
            Not even for emergencies?

                         BOB
                   (a little angry)
            No.

                         DIGNAN
            I thought your parents were in Italy.

                         BOB
            They are.

                         DIGNAN
            So who's going to know?

                         BOB
            My brother.

                         ANTHONY
            Future Man.

                         BOB
            Who?

                         ANTHONY
            Futute Man. You know. Cause he
            looks like he's from the future.

                         DIGNAN
            He looks like he was designed by
            scientists. For desert warfare.

                         BOB
            That never would of --

                         DIGNAN
            Let's cut the bullshit.

Silence. They all look at the car. Pause.

                         ANTHONY
            It's got a V-8, Dignan.

                         DIGNAN
            What do you think the cops have?

INT. BOB'S HOUSE. DAY

They're sitting at the coffee table in Bob's great big
living room. It's got high ceilings and two Persian rugs.
They're eating sandwiches and chips.

                         BOB
            If you're that worried, maybe we
            should just steal one.

                         DIGNAN
            What are you talking about, Bob?

                         BOB
            Can you use a coaster.

Bob slides a coaster under Dignan's glass.

                         ANTHONY
            Did you ever steal a car bdfore?

                         BOB
            Yeah. I've stolen two cars before.
            One Jaguar. And one Trans-Am. With
            T-Tops. That Trans-Am was fun to
            drive.

                         DIGNAN
            You stole a Trans-Am.

                         BOB
            Yes. I did.

                         DIGNAN
            OK, Bob.

                         BOB
            It's true, Dignan.

                         DIGNAN
            Well. What do you want to do? You
            want to steal one or just drive
            your car?

                         BOB
                   (thinks for a minute)
            I'll just drive my car.

INT. DELI. DAY

Anthony's playing pinball at a machine in the back of a
little grocery store. Dignan's watching.

                         DIGNAN
            Anthony, we'll get two hundred for
            the coin collection alone. That's
            less than what it's appraised at.

                         ANTHONY
            But Dignan, do you really know that
            much about rare coins?

                         DIGNAN
            I know about money, Anthony. I know
            the value of money. Plus the
            earrings are worth three times that.

Anthony looks at Dignan. Dignan points at the pinball machine.

                         DIGNAN
            Your ball.

Dignan tries to hit the flipper.

                         ANTHONY
            I told you not to take the earrings.

Anthony keeps looking at Dignan. Dignan doesn't look up from
the machine. Anthony turns and walks away.

                         DIGNAN
            You got another ball.

Dignan watches him go.

                         DIGNAN
            I'm playing your game.

EXT. SIDEWALK. DAY

They're walking fast down the sidewalk.

                         ANTHONY
            The list, Dignan. I know you
            remember the list because you
            signed it. "Things Dignan was not
            supposed to touch."

                         DIGNAN
            Every valuable item in the house
            was on that list.

                         ANTHONY
            That doesn't make any difference. I
            bought those earrings for my mother
            on her birthday. They have a very
            special value for her.

                         DIGNAN
            Yeah, but I can't be sorting
            through that shit in the middle of
            a burglary. There's just not time
            for it.

                         ANTHONY
            Then you shouldn't of gone in
            there, Dignan. Maybe we should of
            robbed your house. Did you ever
            think of that?

Dignan stops walking. Anthony looks back at him. Pause.

                         ANTHONY
            What?

Dignan turns and starts walking the other way.

                         ANTHONY
            Where are you going?

                         DIGNAN
            I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.

                         ANTHONY
            How was I ridiculing you?

                         DIGNAN
            You're making fun of my family. You
            know there's nothing to steal from
            my mom and Craig. You know exactly
            what you're saying.

                         ANTHONY
            That's not what I meant, Dignan.

They both see something. They keep walking. Dignan looks
back down the sidewalk.

                         DIGNAN
            Did you see that?

                         ANTHONY
            Yeah, I saw it.

                         DIGNAN
            I'm lookout.

                         ANTHONY
            Dignan, it's got an alarm.

                         DIGNAN
            I don't think so. Just reach on in.

                         ANTHONY
            That sets it off.

                         DIGNAN
            No, just do it real quick.
                   (starts down the sidewalk)
            I'll meet you down there.

Dignan cuts into an alley. Anthony turns back. Looks at a
parked car. Looks left and right. Walks to the car and
reaches in the half-open window.

An alarm goes off. Anthony unlocks the door and opens it.
Leans inside. Grabs a wallet off the seat.

A MAN standing on the sidewalk watches Anthony get out of
the car. Anthony looks at him, then walks down the sidewalk
not too fast. He turns down an alley and runs.

EXT. ALLEY. DAY

Anthony comes around the corner and meets Dignan beside a
dumpster. The alarm is still ringing in the distance.
Anthony starts looking through the wallet.

                         ANTHONY
            It had an alarm.

                         DIGNAN
            Yeah, I heard that.

                         ANTHONY
                   (counting the money)
            Five, seven, eight dollars.

He looks at Dignan.

                         DIGNAN
                   (taking the wallet)
            Holy shit. What'd I tell you?

                         ANTHONY
            Eight dollars.

                         DIGNAN
            That's not bad.

Anthony keeps looking at Dignan. Dignan smiles. He hands
Anthony a five dollar bill. Anthony looks at it. He takes it.
He puts it in his pocket. Dignan puts out his hand to shake.
Anthony waits a second. He shakes Dignan's hand for just a
second and walks down the alley. Dignan smiles and walks
behind him.

INT. HAMBURGER PLACE. NIGHT

Anthony and Dignan are sitting at a table with Bob.

                         ANTHONY
            What do herbs have to do with it? I
            don't understand the --

                         BOB
            Pot is an herb. It's just like any
            type of gardening.

                         DIGNAN
            How much could you grow?
            Realistically.

                         BOB
            As much as I want. When these
            plants bud I'll probably have about
            six thousand dollars worth of weed.

                         DIGNAN
            Six thousand dollars? Come on, Bob.

                         BOB
            You should take a look. I have an
            entire crop in my backyard.

                         ANTHONY
            In your backyard? How do you
            protect them?

                         BOB
            It's private property. Plus I have
            Hector.

                         ANTHONY
            Hector woudn't do anything.

                         BOB
            But he's got a loud bark. That's
            the most important thing is a loud
            bark.

                         DIGNAN
            If it's that easy why doesn't
            everybody grow them?

                         BOB
            Good question.

Bob looks at Anthony and Dignan. He suddenly gets worried.

                         BOB
            Don't you guys tell anybody about
            my plants.

                         DIGNAN
            You're paranoid, Bob.

                         BOB
            Yeah, but don't tell anybody.

                         ANTHONY
            Could you grow cinnamon?

                         BOB
            I don't know. Sure, I guess.

                         ANTHONY
            You could make your own cinnamon
            toast.

Bob looks at Anthony for a second. He looks at Dignan. Back
at Anthony.

                         BOB
            Are you a fag?

                         LITTLE RICHARD
            You're the faggot.

Bob turns around to see LITTLE RICHARD, short but muscular,
wearing a down vest and a baseball cap.

                         BOB
            Little Richard. I don't believe it.
            They'll let anybody in this place.
            Sit down.

Little Richard sits down.

                         BOB
            Dignan and Anthony, this is Little
            Richard. He's crazy. Totally nuts.

                         LITTLE RICHARD
                   (smiling)
            I don't know about that.

                         BOB
            Little Richard. Trust me. You're
            insane. Jesus, this guy used to
            carry a percussion bomb around in
            his trunk. You do not want a guy
            like that loose on the streets.

                         LITTLE RICHARD
            It seemed like a good idea at the
            time.

                         BOB
            The one and only Little Richard.

                         DIGNAN
            Are you named after THE Little
            Richard?

                         LITTLE RICHARD
                   (stares at Dignan)
            Ha! Ha! Ha! Why don't you stick it
            up your ass. Great group of guys
            you're hanging out with.

Little Richard goes out the door.

                         DIGNAN
            What was that all about?

                         BOB
            I can't believe you said that.

                         DIGNAN
            What did I say?

                         BOB
            I told you he's crazy.

                         ANTHONY
            But he didn't say anything.

                         DIGNAN
            Hang on a second.

Dignan gets up and walks out of the restaurant. Anthony and
Bob look at each other. They start to get up.

EXT. HAMBURGER PLACE. NIGHT

Anthony and Bob go out the door. Dignan is walking over to a
station wagon. Little Richard is getting in.

                         DIGNAN
            Little Richard. Wait a second. Hang
            on. I didn't mean to --

Little Richard opens his door hard into Dignan's legs, then
gets out fast and takes off his shirt. Dignan tries to hit
him but doesn't connect. They grab onto each other and start
knocking around. Another GUY gets out of the station wagon.
Two more GUYS rush out the door of the burger place. Anthony
and Bob stand back, nervous.

                         ANTHONY
            Let them fight.

                         BOB
            Let them fight.

They all watch. Dignan keeps trying to punch Little Richard,
but he's hanging onto him too tight. They keep spinning
around together, moving down the sidewalk.

                         DIGNAN
                   (calling out)
            Anthony.

Anthony looks at the other guys then moves toward Dignan.

                         ANTHONY
            OK. Break it up. Break it up.

Little Richard lets go of Dignan. They separate.

                         DIGNAN
            I separated my shoulder.

Dignan is holding onto his arm. He kind of moans.

                         ANTHONY
            OK. Hang on.

Anthony grabs hold of Dignan's arm. Everybody's watching.

                         DIGNAN
            Just pull straight up.
Anthony pulls up hard on Dignan's arm. Dignan tries not to
yell, then suddenly he's OK and relieved.

                         ANTHONY
            Is it back in?

                         DIGNAN
                   (moving arm slowly)
            Yeah.

                         GUY #1
            OK, man. Let's go.

                         DIGNAN
            No. I'm not fighting anymore.

                         ANTHONY
            His shoulder went out, man. It's
            over.

                         GUY #2
            You guys better get out of here.

Guy #2 pushes Dignan. Anthony turns and pounds him in the
face. Right on the nose. The guy goes crosseyed. He falls
down with his legs all tangled-up in a strange position.

Everyone stands there stunned. Anthony takes a step back. He
looks up. He and Dignan take off. Bob stands there. Frozen.
Everyone looks at him. Bob looks at Little Richard.

                         LITTLE RICHARD
            Bob?

Bob takes off.

INT. CAR. DAY

The next day. They're driving with Bob. Dignan's up front.
He's banged-up from the fight.

                         DIGNAN
            The guy is fucking insane.

                         BOB
            I warned you, Dignan.

                         DIGNAN
            You said it like it was a big joke,
            Bob. Like he's wild.

                         BOB
            No, I was saying crazy like a
            lunatic.

                         DIGNAN
            I know that now. He's a fucking
            psycho.

                         BOB
            Well, don't blame me. I told you.

                         DIGNAN
            I do blame you, Bob. And woah. Look
            at her.

There's a beautiful GIRL on the sidewalk. They drive past her.

                         DIGNAN
            Loop around real fast.

                         ANTHONY
            Just turn right here.

Bob immediately turns and they drive past the girl again.
They don't say anything as they go past her. They all just
look at her. They drive on.

                                            CUT TO:

A minute later. They've looped back. They're looking for the
girl.

                         DIGNAN
            Where'd she go?

                         BOB
            Maybe she turned.

                         ANTHONY
            There she is.

She's on a side street. Bob hits the brakes hard. The girl
looks back at them. They back up a few feet and turn down
the street. They drive slowly toward the girl.

                         ANTHONY
            Bob, don't be so obvious.

The girl keeps looking back at them.

                         DIGNAN
            I think we might of scared her.

                         BOB
            Let's just go.

They come up, beside the girl. She looks right at them,
still walking.

Her expression is angry and also a little scared.

They drive away.

                         DIGNAN
            You blew it, Bob.

INT. COFFEE SHOP. DAY

Anthony, Dignan, and Bob are meeting with TEMPLE. Temple is
in his mid-fifties, short, heavy, completely expressionless
wide face. They listen intently as he briefs them on the
intricacies of firearms.

                         TEMPLE
            A gun is a firearm. A pistol is a
            firearm. But anything you hold in
            your hand is a weapon. A knife. A
            wrench. A ballpoint pen.

                         ANTHONY
            A ballpoiht pen?

                         TEMPLE
            Anyone who tells you a ballpoint
            pen is not a weapon needs intensive
            psychiatric treatment. You can
            stick them in the esophagus. You
            give them a ballpoint tracheotomy.

They nod seriously. Temple laughs.

EXT. FIELD. DAY

They're standing behind Temple's car in the middle of an
open pasture. The trunk is open. Temple's got some guns in
metal cases. They draw targets on pieces of paper. Anthony
draws a man running on his target. They fire a bunch of
different pistols. The last one they shoot's a .44 Magnum.
They buy it.

INT. BOB'S HOUSE. DAY

The TV room. There are two big couches and a nice giant TV.
The doors are open onto the balcony. The .44 is on the
coffee table. Dignan is sitting there with a map and some
diagrams laid out. Anthony and Bob are on either side of him.
Dignan's pointing at a notebook page with the heading
"Escape Route."

                         DIGNAN
            OK. Escape route. The most important
            thing you can have is an escape
            route. Just in case somebody's
            tailing us. Or even chasing us, as
            the case may be --

                         ANTHONY
            You think we're going to be chased?

                         DIGNAN
            That's a good question. No. I don't.
            I'm just being hypocritical here.
            However, I will say --

Bob reaches for the .44.

                         BOB
                   (quietly)
            I'm going to take a look at this.

                         DIGNAN
                   (puts hand on gun)
            Hang on This is important, Bob.
            Anthony and I are responsible for
            the internal situation. The money
            and the people. You're responsible
            for the external situation. The
            streets and the getaway.

                         BOB
                   (nods)
            That's my responsibility.

                         DIGNAN
            That's your domain.

                         BOB
            OK.

Anthony is making a little man out of a scrap of paper.

                         DIGNAN
            Now. One thing we need to discuss
            is timing. Timing is absolutely
            crucial. What are you doing? Anthony!

                         ANTHONY
                   (looks up)
            Nothing. Go ahead.

Bob picks up the gun.

                         BOB
                   (to himself)
            How many bullets can that hold?

Dignan grabs the gun away and sets it down out of Bob's reach.

                         DIGNAN
            Bob.

                         BOB
            I'm paying attention. I just want
            to look at it for a minute.

                         DIGNAN
                   (screaming)
            What's your fucking problem? You're
            a shithead!

                         BOB
            I just want to see how much bullets
            it takes.

Anthony picks up the gun off the table. He clicks the action.

                         DIGNAN
            Anthony, give me the fucking gun!

                         ANTHONY
                   (pulling away)
            No, Dignan. It's not your gun. It's
            all of ours.

                         BOB
                   (quietly)
            I paid for it.

                         DIGNAN
            God DAMMIT.

Dignan stands up, grabbing his papers.

                         DIGNAN
            You two just don't give a shit, do
            you?

Dignan starts out of the room. Anthony stands up.

                         ANTHONY
            Dignan, calm down.

                         DIGNAN
                   (turns back, screaming)
            You're out! I'm not working with
            either one of you!

                         ANTHONY
            Dignan! Stop!

Dignan stops. Looking at Anthony.

                         ANTHONY
            Calm down. Take a deep breath.

                         DIGNAN
                   (pause)
            You're right. You're right.

Dignan sits back down and starts spreading out his papers
again. Freezes. Looks at Bob. Bob's looking at the gun. Bob
looks at Dignan. Bob looks away. Nobody moves.

EXT. DECK. EVENING

Anthony and Dignan have moved outside to the hot tub.
Anthony pets Bob's dog HECTOR. Bob's brother FUTURE MAN
walks up the path from the driveway with his blonde
cheerleader GIRLFRIEND.

                         FUTURE MAN
            What are you guys doing?

                         ANTHONY
            Nothing. We're just --

                         FUTURE MAN
            You seen my brother?

                         DIGNAN
            He's inside.

Future Man goes inside. His girlfriend stands there on the
deck.

                         GIRLFRIEND
                   (smiles)
            Hi.

                         ANTHONY & DIGNAN
            Hi.

She stands there, looking across the yard. Anthony and
Dignan sit there in the hot tub, looking around. We hear
Future Man's loud voice inside:

                         FUTURE MAN
            Goddammit, Bob! Get your shit
            together.

Future Man comes back out. He stops by the hot tub.

                         FUTURE MAN
            What are you guys up to tonight?

                         ANTHONY
            Nothing much.

                         DIGNAN
            Just hanging around.

Future Man walks back out the gate.

                         GIRLFRIEND
            Bye.

She follows Future Man. Anthony and Dignan watch them walk
away. Bob comes back out with some drinks. He looks shaken.

                         DIGNAN
            What'd Future Man want?

Bob shrugs and gets in the hot tub. They sip on their drinks.
Bob's got a Heineken.

                         BOB
            He doesn't get it. Held never
            understand what we're trying to
            accomplish here. It's too dangerous
            for him.

                         DIGNAN
            Well, in reality it's not that
            dangerous, Bob. It's only dangerous
            if you don't know what you're doing.

                         BOB
            Yeah, but what if some nut pulled
            gun on you?

                         ANTHONY
            The only nut with a gun is going to
            be Dignan.

Anthony gets out of the hot tub and dives in the pool.

                         DIGNAN
                   (whispering, very serious)
            You know, Bob, Anthony did kill
            someone. He electrocuted our
            janitor senior year.

                         BOB
            He electrocuted someone?

                         DIGNAN
            It was an accidental. I don't want
            to go into the details. It was just
            one of those senior pranks that
            didn't really go right. I mean,
            obviously, since Swifty's dead.
            That's why Anthony never graduated.

                         BOB
            His name was Swifty?

                         DIGNAN
            Yeah. One of the nicest old guys
            you'd ever know.

                         BOB
            That's too bad.

                         DIGNAN
                   (nods)
            You know, when somebody gets
            electrocuted, their skin starts
            smoking. At least Swifty's did.

INT. CAR. NIGHT

Anthony, Dignan, and Bob are sitting in Bob's car, parked in
the dark. Bob's at the wheel. Anthony and Dignan are in the
back. Anthony has on a dark blue ski cap. Dignan's wearing a
baseball cap with the brim pulled down low. He puts a piece
of adhesive tape across his nose and hands the roll to
Anthony.

                         BOB
            What are you doing?

                         DIGNAN
            I'm putting a piece of tape on my
            nose.

Anthony tapes his nose. They stare out the windshield. The
alarm on Dignan's digital watch goes off.

                         DIGNAN
                   (immediately, dead serious)
            Let's get lucky.

EXT/INT. BOOKSTORE. NIGHT

Anthony and Dignan walk through the shadows in front of a
huge bookstore. The lights are on inside. They watch for a
minute and then go to the front door. Dignan hides behind a
post. Anthony knocks on the glass. An EMPLOYEE appears.

                         ANTHONY
            I left my sweater inside.

The employee shakes his head. He can't hear through the glass.

                         ANTHONY
            Do you have a lost and found?

The employee unlocks the door and opens it an inch.

                         EMPLOYEE
            We're closed.

                         ANTHONY
            I left my sweater in there.

                         EMPLOYEE
            Oh. I see. Come on in.

Anthony goes inside. Dignan comes out from behind the post.

                         EMPLOYEE
            We're closed, sir.

                         DIGNAN
            Where's that guy going?

                         EMPLOYEE
            He left his sweater.

                         DIGNAN
            Well, I left some money in there.

                         EMPLOYEE
            Where?

                         DIGNAN
                   (pulls out the gun)
            In the cash relister. Step away
            from the door.

Dignan goes in. They walk through the store.

                         ANTHONY
            Where's the manager?

                         DIGNAN
            Where's the other stocker?

                         ANTHONY
            There's another stocker, right?

                         DIGNAN
            We know there's another stocker.

                         EMPLOYEE
            Rob?

Dignan points the gun at the employee.

                         DIGNAN
            Where is he? Where is Rob?

                         EMPLOYEE
            I don't know. Maybe in literature.
            That's his section.

                         DIGNAN
            You got that?

                         ANTHONY
            Sure. Literature. The classics.

The MANAGER is locking the door of his office.

                         ANTHONY
            Is that the manager?

                         DIGNAN
                   (to manager)
            Unlock that door.
                   (to Anthony)
            Check the aisles.

Anthony starts walking through the store, checking down each
aisle. He picks up a copy of The Air War on Hitler's Germany
and takes it with him. He goes through literature and sees
ROB in travel, kneeling in front of a low shelf with a
carton of books beside him.

                         ANTHONY
            Rob?

                         ROB
                   (looks up, a little puzzled)
            Uh-huh?

                         ANTHONY
            Why aren't you in literature?

                         ROB
                   (hesitates)
            It's all full up.

Dignan is in the office with the manager and the first
employee. He's pointing at a drawer.

                         DIGNAN
            Open it up.

The manager opens it. It's full of office supplies.

                         DIGNAN
            OK. Open the other. Let's go.

The manager opens the other drawer. It's full of cash.
Dignan looks at the manager. He looks back at the cash.

                         DIGNAN
            Put it in one of those.

Dignan points at some bookstore bags. The manager picks up a
little one and starts to put the money in it.

                         DIGNAN
            A bigger one, you idiot.

                         MANAGER
                   (glares at Dignan)
            Don't call me an idiot, you punk.

                         DIGNAN
            I'm sorry. But that bag's too small.

                                            CUT TO:

Anthony waiting outside the office door. Rob, the first
employee, and the manager are sitting against the wall in
the office. The manager's got an intense, angry look on his
face, staring at Dignan. Dignan hands Anthony five little
bags full of money and starts to close the office door.

                         DIGNAN
            OK, guys. Just...Sit tight.

Dignan closes the door.

INT. CAR. NIGHT

Anthony and Dignan jump into the car.

                         DIGNAN
            Go. Go. Drive slow.

Bob drives. Pretty slow. Anthony and Dignan keep looking
back out the rear window. They're nervous. Nobody says
anything for a block or two.

                         BOB
            What happened?

                         DIGNAN
            Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural.

                         BOB
            This is natural.

                         DIGNAN
                   (looks at speedometer)
            That's good. Keep it at forty.

                         BOB
            Did we get it?

                         DIGNAN
            Be cool, Bob. Be cool.
                   (quickly)
            Make that light.

They keep driving. Breathing hard.

                         ANTHONY
            Holy shit.

                         DIGNAN
            We got it. We got it.

                         BOB
            How much is there?

                         DIGNAN
            Don't count it.

EXT. HAMBURGER PLACE. NIGHT

A picnic table in front of a hamburger place. Dignan is
standing up with his drink in his hand.

                         BOB
            Was Dignan screaming like, Get me a
            bag!

                         DIGNAN
            No. I was calm.

                         ANTHONY
            What about what that guy said?

                         DIGNAN
            Oh, shit. That was scary. In the
            middle of the robbery. The manager
            looks at me. Right in the eye. And
            goes, I'm going to remember you.

                         BOB
            Are you serious?

                         ANTHONY
            Yeah. He said that.

                         DIGNAN
            I swear to God. In a very quiet
            voice.

                         ANTHONY
            Like he meant it.

                         DIGNAN
            Yeah.

                         ANTHONY
            Like he would find Dignan. One day.

                         DIGNAN
            Like I'm going to hunt you down and
            kill you.

Dignan stands there a minute and lets this sink in. Then he
finally sits down and they all eat their burgers.

                         BOB
            You really think he'll remember you?

                         DIGNAN
                   (smiles)
            No. All he'll remember is a guy
            with a piece of tape on his nose.

They laugh smugly.

EXT. 7-11. NIGHT

Anthony, Dignan, and Bob come out of a 7-11. Bob's got a
slurpee. He's carrying the WWII book.

                         BOB
            See you.

                         ANTHONY
            See you, Bob.

                         DIGNAN
            Hang on, Bob.

Dignan goes up to Bob and hugs him. Bob's not smiling.

                         DIGNAN
            That was really good driving.
            Seriously. I mean it.

Bob nods and starts walking away, down the sidewalk.

                         DIGNAN
            We'll see you later, Bob. Good
            driving.

Anthony and Dignan sit on the curb. Anthony's drinking a
milk. Dignan's still watching Bob walk alone down the
sidewalk.

                         DIGNAN
            What's wrong with him?

                         ANTHONY
            What do you think?

                         DIGNAN
            Anthony, he sat in the car and
            watched a 4-11 in progress. He got
            what he deserved.

                         ANTHONY
            He was the driver, Dignan. He did
            what he's supposed to do.

                         DIGNAN
            I didn't realize you were so
            sensitive to Bob's feelings.
            Considering I did the plans, you're
            actually lucky you got --

                         ANTHONY
            Don't even say it, man.

INT. BOB'S HOUSE. DAY

Dignan and Anthony are following Bob through his house. Bob
is playing his electric guitar, not plugged in.

                         DIGNAN
            Bob, will you please listen?

                         BOB
            I don't want to talk about it.

Bob strums more intensely. They're walking through the
kitchen.

                         DIGNAN
            Look, I admit I was wrong for not
            telling you before the robbery that
            your share wouldn't be as equal as
            ours. But the fact remains me and
            Anthony were much more exposed to
            danger.

Bob has now come to the big glass patio doors where Hector
sits outside, looking in. Bob keeps playing as he looks at
Hector.

                         DIGNAN
            I mean, Jesus Christ, Bob. You
            didn't have some vicious lunatic
            screaming, "I'm going to remember
            you!"

                         BOB
                   (smiles slightly,
                   keeps playing)
            That's true. That would give me
            nightmares.

                         DIGNAN
            Bob, I've got nightmares.

Bob stops playing. He looks at Dignan.

                         BOB
            You'll probably have them the rest
            of your life.

                         ANTHONY
            What was that?

Anthony opens the door to the patio.

                         DIGNAN
            What?

They hear breaking glass somewhere as they follow Anthony
onto the patio. A voice yells out.

                         VOICE
            Motherfucker!

                         ANTHONY
            What's going on?

Bob sets down his guitar as they go out of the yard to see
what's happening.

EXT. BOB'S HOUSE. EVENING

Anthony, Dignan, and Bob go around to the front. Bob's
neighbor PHIL runs down the driveway with a wrench in his
hand. Phil is short and heavy, wearing a golf shirt. He's
got a bloody nose.

                         BOB
            Phil. What happened?

                         PHIL
                   (hysterical)
            Motherfucker. I'll kill him.

                         BOB
                   (looks around,
                   suddenly concerned)
            Who?

PHIL'S GIRLFRIEND comes running out the front door.

                         PHIL'S GIRLFRIEND
            I've called the police. Oh, my God,
            Phil.

She reaches to hug him.

                         PHIL
            Don't touch me! I swear to God I'll
            get that guy.

                         PHIL'S GIRLFRIEND
            I know you will, Phil. There was
            nothing you could do. All you had
            was a golf club.

                         ANTHONY
            You're bleeding, man. Sit down.

A couple of NEIGHBORS have come over from across the street.

                         NEIGHBOR
            What happened?

                         PHIL'S GIRLFRIEND
            Some black man beat Phil up.

                         PHIL
            He didn't beat me up. He attacked me.

                         PHIL'S GIRLFRIEND
            He took two hundred dollars.

                         ANTHONY
                   (to Phil)
            Tilt your head back.

Later. It's dark out now. There's a police car parked across
the street and another pulling over, lights rolling. One of
the OFFICERS walks across the yard, shining a flashlight in
the bushes. Dignan is talking with one of the other officers.

                         DIGNAN
            He was probably on drugs.

                         OFFICER
            They usually are.

Two other cops are getting a statement from Phil. Anthony
and Bob are listening. Some neighbors are milling around
talking.

                         PHIL
            As soon as I opened the door I saw
            him. A black guy. Looking through
            my dad's tool box. I wanted to trap
            this guy. So I closed the garage
            door.

                         COP
            And that's when he hit you?

                         PHIL
                   (looking up to sky
                   and concentrating)
            He struck me. I fell down. He took
            my wallet. Then he opened the
            garage door and ran away.

                         COP
            How'd the window break?

                         PHIL
            I hit it with the golf club.

Dignan's still talking to the other cop.

                         DIGNAN
            How long do you have to go?

                         COP
            26 weeks.

                         DIGNAN
            And what does that cover?

                         COP
            Social issues. Crime prevention.

                         DIGNAN
            Hand to hand combat?

Dignan suddenly looks toward Bob's backyard. The cop nods.

                         COP
            Ground defense.

                         DIGNAN
            Did you hear that?

                         OFFICER
            What?

                         DIGNAN
            Shhh.

Anthony's looking up into the treetops.

                         BOB
            What the fuck is Dignan doing with
            that cop? He loves them.

                         ANTHONY
            There's a million places to hide
            around here.

                         BOB
            Oh, yeah. They'll never catch the
            guy.

                         ANTHONY
            I hope not.

                         BOB
            Phil probably provoked him.
                   (looking at Dignan)
            Where's he going?

Dignan and the officer are walking over to the backyard.

                         DIGNAN
            No, it was a rustling sound.

                         BOB'S VOICE
            The dog. Look out for the dog.

                         OFFICER
            Is this dog going to bite?

                         DIGNAN
            No. Shit no.

Dignan jumps the fence. The cop looks over and shines his
flashlight. Dignan's petting Hector. Hector's calm.

                         DIGNAN
            See? I don't know what he's talking
            about.

Bob starts walking across the street.

                         ANTHONY
            Where you going?

                         BOB
            Move.

As Bob walks away he is looking back, past Anthony, toward
the backyard.

                         ANTHONY
            What's wrong?

Anthony turns to look.

In the backyard. Dignan is looking in the bushes.

                         DIGNAN
            He probably went into the next yard.
            Shine the light over here.

Dignan looks across the yard at the officer. The officer is
shining the light on the marijuana plants. He looks at Dignan.

                         DIGNAN
            Those are...

Dignan sprints across the yard and over the gate.

                         OFFICER
            Halt! Sir!

Anthony and Bob are standing in the shadows across the
street. They see Dignan come racing down the driveway. The
officer is yelling behind the gate.

                         OFFICER
            Bill! He's running!

The other officers are running from their cars.

                         DIGNAN
            The prowler! That way!

The officers run past Dignan, toward the back. Anthony and
Bob take off as Dignan runs by. The three of them run full
speed down the street, cutting across yards, between houses.
They throw themselves over fences and scramble through bushes.

                         DIGNAN
            Way to go, Bob!

                         BOB
            I told you they were there.

                         DIGNAN
                   (about to explode)
            So it's my fault?

                         ANTHONY
            Be quiet.

INT. BOB'S CAR. DAY

Bob's at the wheel, Dignan in front, Anthony in the back.
They're driving fast down the interstate, past fields and
farmhouses. Dignan's drawing out a route in felt tip pen on
a Texaco roadmap.

                         DIGNAN
            In all probability nothing would of
            happened. But why take the chance?
            That's why I ran. I mean how many
            plants were even back there? Five?
            Ten?

                         BOB
            There were more than that.

                         ANTHONY
            Why don't you just tell them the
            truth. Those belong to my neighbor
            Phil.

                         BOB
            I don't know. I personally don't
            need that shit in my life right now.

                         ANTHONY
            Nobody does.

                         DIGNAN
            Obviously. That's why we go on the
            road. The thing about cops is they
            have short attention spans.

EXT. GAS STATION. DAY

Dignan fills up the tank and checks the oil. Bob tests the
tire pressure. Anthony does the windows.

                         DIGNAN
            Can I get that credit card from you?

                         ANTHONY
                   (pause)
            I don't like to use that credit
            card, Dignan.

                         DIGNAN
            Why not?

                         ANTHONY
            Because my mom gets the bill.

                         DIGNAN
            She's not going to notice, Anthony.

                         ANTHONY
            I don't want to use it.

                         DIGNAN
                   (pause)
            Well, then cut it in half.

                         ANTHONY
            I keep it for emergencies.

                         DIGNAN
            Anthony, we're on the run. This is
            an emergency. It's only fair that...

Anthony gets in the car. Pause. Dignan reaches into his
pocket and takes out a wad of cash. He counts some. Stands
there a minute. Goes inside to pay.

INT. CAR. DAY

Anthony stretches out across the backseat on pillows,
playing electronic football. Dignan reads Bob's WWII book.
Bob eats a Ding-Dong and smokes a cigarette.

EXT. FIREWORKS STAND. DAY

A fireworks stand on the side of the highway. The car's
pulled over and they're buying roman candles, M-80's, and
Black Cats from a KID wearing a baseball cap way back on his
head.

As they get back on the highway Anthony lights a roman
candle and fires it from the window. Dignan lights an M-80
and throws it out of the car.

EXT. LAKE. DAY

They drive to a big lake. A dog splashes in and swims for a
tennis ball. Anthony does some nice dives. Dignan swings
from a rope out over the water and lets go. Bob sits on a
bench.

EXT. CAR. DAY

Late afternoon. They're driving on the interstate. Anthony's
got a copy of Runner's World magazine.

                         ANTHONY
            Here's mine right here. See?

Anthony lifts up his foot so Dignan can compare his shoe
with the picture.

                         DIGNAN
            See if mine are in there.

                         ANTHONY
                   (looks at Dignan's shoes)
            Dignan, those aren't running shoes.

                         DIGNAN
            Yes, they are.

                         ANTHONY
            Look at the treads on those.

                         DIGNAN
            What about them?

                         ANTHONY
            They obviously weren't designed for
            racing.

                         DIGNAN
            Well, those treads stink. You'd
            blow a knee out racing on those.

                         BOB
            Will you guys shut up? God. It's
            like having two little kids in the
            car.

                         ANTHONY
            OK, Dad.

                         DIGNAN
            Really. OK, Dad. But seriously,
            Anthony. These are fast shoes.

                         ANTHONY
            You've never had a pair of fast
            shoes in your life, Dignan.
                   (to Bob)
            In fifth grade Dignan used to wear
            cowboy boots for P.E.

                         DIGNAN
            That's real cool, Anthony. Yeah, I
            wore boots. My parents wouldn't buy
            me any $200 running shoes like
            yours. I wasn't spoiled.

                         ANTHONY
            Don't call me spoiled, Dignan.

                         DIGNAN
            You were spoiled rotten.

                         BOB
            Enough. Jesus Christ.

EXT. SIDE OF HIGHWAY. DAY

Anthony and Dignan are lined up to race on the side of the
road.

                         ANTHONY
                   (yelling)
            You want to say it, Bob?

Fifty yards away, Bob's sitting on the hood of the car
parked on the shoulder. He's reading a magazine. He shakes
his head without looking up.

                         ANTHONY
            I'll just say it.

                         DIGNAN
            I'll say it.

                         ANTHONY
            OK. Go ahead.

                         DIGNAN
            On your marks...
                   (waits a second, says
                   very fast:)
            Get set go.

They take off. Dignan has the jump, but Anthony pulls past
him. A car blows by going the other way and they keep racing.
Anthony's out in front as they pass Bob sitting on the car.
Bob's watching. Dignan raises his fists into the air.

                         DIGNAN
                   (points at Anthony)
            You owe me fifty bucks.

                         ANTHONY
            Bob?

                         BOB
            Anthony won.

Bob gets in the car.

                         DIGNAN
            Bob wasn't even looking.

EXT/INT. MOTEL. DAY

A Holiday Inn. Bandera, TX. Bob's car is parked in front.
Inside: Dignan, Bob, and Anthony are checking in. There's a
teenage GIRL behind the counter. Dignan pays cash. The girl
hands over the keys. She's looking at Dignan's shirt:

                         GIRL
            Was that shirt made from a towel?

                         DIGNAN
            What?

                         GIRL
                   (seeing his reaction)
            It's just terrycloth, isn't it?

                         DIGNAN
            Yeah. I think so.

EXT. MOTEL. DAY

They're walking along the balcony, looking for their room.
Anthony has on his backpack. Dignan's got his tennis bag.
Bob's got two large suitcases, a carry-on, and a garment bag.

                         ANTHONY
            Look, man. She didn't know anything
            about shirts.

                         DIGNAN
            No, I'm not saying her. I'm just
            saying, I don't know.

                         ANTHONY
            It's a great shirt. Don't worry
            about it.

They find the room and unlock the door.

INT. CAR. NIGHT

Driving in a small town. Bob's behind the wheel. Dignan's in
front. Anthony's in back.

                         DIGNAN
            Armored trucks are very difficult
            to steal, Anthony.

                         ANTHONY
            I know. But once you get inside
            you're home free.

                         DIGNAN
            Right.. Get back to me on that one.
            Once your plan is worth a shit.

                         ANTHONY
            It's not a plan. It's just --

                         DIGNAN
            Actually. If you knew the exact
            route, you could plant explosives
            under a manhole cover and blow it
            up as it went over.

                         ANTHONY
            Yeah, but you wouldn't have the
            truck if you blew it up.

                         DIGNAN
            True.

There's a car stopped in front of them. A couple of girls
are standing beside it, talking to the driver. Bob can't get
around.

                         DIGNAN
            What the fuck is this?

Dignan leans over and holds down the horn for about five
seconds. The guy in the car sticks hi s hand out the window
and shoots the finger at them. Dignan sounds dead serious:

                         DIGNAN
            Ram him, Bob.

Bob waits for a nervous moment. He does two quick honks. The
guy's reverse lights go on.

                         DIGNAN
            Hit him!

Bob hits the gas and slams into the car. He puts his car in
reverse and backs up a couple of feet. He leans forward and
sees the back of the guy's car. It's all smashed up. The guy
gets out of his car, shaken up, and looks at them. His
expression is confused. Bob punches it and flies backwards
down the street. The guy stands beside his car and watches
them.

                         DIGNAN
            Shit, Bob. What the fuck did you do
            that for?

                         BOB
            He wouldn't move.

They go around the corner. Bob shifts into first and goes.

                         BOB
            Is he chasing us?

                         DIGNAN
            I don't know.

                         ANTHONY
            Speed up, Bob.

INT. MOTEL ROOM. NIGHT

They're unlocking the door. They go inside.

                         BOB
            You think he got my license plates?

                         ANTHONY
            He looked too shaken-up.

                         DIGNAN
            I'm sure he did. We'll have to get
            new plates.

                         BOB
            It's registered in my mother's name.

                         DIGNAN
                   (shakes his head)
            What the fuck possessed you?

                         BOB
            You're the one who kept saying ram
            him.

Dignan's walking into the bathroom.

                         DIGNAN
            I meant tap him. As a warning.

Dignan closes the door. Anthony lies down on one of the beds.
Bob just stands there.

INT. MOTEL ROOM. MORNING

The next day. Dignan and Bob are still asleep. Bob's on a
folding bed. Anthony's sitting at the table, reading a
newspaper eating some cereal from one of those little boxes
where you cut open the sides.

EXT. MOTEL POOL. DAY

Ahthony's swimming laps. He stops and hangs onto the side
for a minute. Across the pool he can see a good-looking
Mexican MAID about twenty years old standing beside her cart
looking at him. He waves. She waves and gets back to work.

A little while later. Anthony's sitting in a chair by the
pool, letting the sun dry him off. He's wearing just a
swimsuit. Dignan and Bob are fully dressed, standing beside
him.

                         ANTHONY
            Dignan, I can't get my hair cut.
            That's just not possible, all right?

                         DIGNAN
            Then you're going to have to dye
            it, Anthony. We've got to hide our
            identities. Especially after Bob
            crashed the car.

Bob has no reaction to this.

                         ANTHONY
            No, Dignan. I'm sorry. I can't do
            that.

                         DIGNAN
            Even if it's the difference between
            some trooper recognizing us and
            throwing us in prison or not?

Silence.

                         DIGNAN
            Well, Bob, Samson has decided that
            his hair is more important than our
            safety.
                   (screaming)
            My friend, that is a reckless
            decision! Let's go, Bob.

Dignan starts walking away.

                         DIGNAN
            Bob. Are you coming?

                         BOB
            See you in a little while.

                         ANTHONY
            See you, Bob.

INT. MOTEL ROOM. DAY

Anthony's wearing a bathrobe, sitting on one of the beds.
The maid unlocks the door and looks inside. She sees Anthony
and starts to go back out.

                         ANTHONY
            No, it's OK. Come on in.

She goes in and starts cleaning up. Anthony sits down in one
of the chairs and makes conversation.

                         ANTHONY
            It's hot out, isn't it? Yeah. This
            is a nice little town. So, what, do
            you do all these rooms yourself? Or
            what? I'm Anthony.

He puts out his hand. She shakes it.

                         ANTHONY
            What's your name?

                         MAID
            Inez.

                         ANTHONY
            Inez?

She nods.

                         ANTHONY
            Let me give you a hand with that.

He helps her make the beds.

EXT. MOTEL HALLWAY. DAY

Anthony walks with Inez from room to room, helpinq her clean
up.

                         ANTHONY
            How do you say nineteen?

                         INEZ
            Dies y nueve.

                         ANTHONY
            Right. Yeah. Yo soy dies y nueve.
            How old are you?

INT. MOTEL ROOM. DAY

Inez opens the door to one of the room.. They go in to clean
it.

                         ANTHONY
            Are you ever scared of finding a
            dead body in one of these rooms?

                         INEZ
                   (laughs)
            No.

                         ANTHONY
            It could happen. This is the exact
            kind of place where it happens. But
            I don't want to scare you.

Anthony picks up a magazine off somebody's suitcase. He
flips through it. Inez takes it out of his hands and puts it
back on the suitcase.

INT. BATHROOM. DAY

Inez is putting a new bar of soap in the shower. Anthony
picks up some wet towels off the floor. It's cramped in there.

                         ANTHONY
            People think because they're in a
            hotel they can act like a slob.
            It's bad manners.

Inez takes the towels. She pulls the shower curtain shut.

                         ANTHONY
            Were you born in Mexico?

                         INEZ
            Cuba.

                         ANTHONY
            Oh, really? That's interesting. Do
            you prefer Cuba or the United States?

Inez is trying to get out of the bathroom but Anthony's in
the way.

                         INEZ
            Scuse me.

EXT. MOTEL HALLWAY. DAY

Inez is pushing the cart. Anthony has his hand on the cart.

                         ANTHONY
            These towels are still warm.

He picks one up and holds it to his face.

                         ANTHONY
            I guess from the dryer.

He hands the towel to Inez. She holds it to her face.

                         ANTHONY
            I've never met anybody from Cuba
            before.

Inez says a few sentences of very fast Spanish. Anthony nods.
Inez knocks on the door of a room.

                         INEZ
            Housekeeping.

A WOMAN about thirty-five years old opens the door.

                         WOMAN
            We're just checking out.

The woman goes back into the room. Inez follows her.

INT. MOTEL ROOM. DAY

The woman's packing a bag on the bed. Anthony comes in. The
woman looks at him. 8he's about to say something when
Anthony takes the liner out of the trashcan. The woman's
HUSBAND comes out of the bathroom. Anthony picks up some
stuff off the floor.

                         HUSBAND
            Hi.

                         ANTHONY
            Hi.

Anthony follows Inez into the bathroom. The husband looks at
his wife.

INT. BARBERSHOP. DAY

Diqnan's sitting in the waiting area of a barbershop reading
a newspaper. We can see Bob out the window, talking on a pay
phone. He hangs up and comes inside.

                         DIGNAN
            You can go first, Bob.

                         BOB
            My brother's in jail.

                         DIGNAN
            What are you talking about?

EXT. BARBERSHOP. DAY

They're standing next to the spinning striped pole.

                         BOB
            The weed.

                         DIGNAN
            But it's not his. How can they
            arrest Future Man?

                         BOB
            They said he's a drug dealer.

Bob looks off into the distance. Sickened.

                         DIGNAN
            Those assholes. We got rapes.
            Murders. Violent crimes every
            second. And this is what they come
            up with.
                   (shaking his head)
            They're just fucking him because
            he's from a prominent family.

INT. DINER. DAY

They're sitting at a table, waiting for their order.

                         DIGNAN
            I don't think they can make it
            stick, Bob. I mean, what do they
            actually have on Future Man?

                         BOB
            Well, the marijuana crop is a good
            start.

                         DIGNAN
            That could be anybody's.

                         BOB
            They also found my two beam scale
            in the garage.
                         DIGNAN
            Since when is it a crime to have a
            scale in your house? Everybody has
            a scale.

                         BOB
            The cops say it's a special kind of
            scale drug dealers use in selling
            marijuana.

                         DIGNAN
            So tell them the truth. What do you
            use it for?

                         BOB
                   (pause)
            I was just going to use it to see
            how much I had.

Dignan mulls this over for a minute.

                         DIGNAN
            How long has he been in there?

                         BOB
            I don't know.

                         DIGNAN
            Then how come they haven't set the
            bail yet? That's unconstitutional.

                         BOB
            We'll have to see when we get back.

Dignan looks at Bob for a minute.

                         DIGNAN
            What do you mean get back?

                         BOB
                   (pause)
            Well, obviously, we got to go back.

                         DIGNAN
            Bob, that makes no sense.

                         BOB
            Dignan, he's my brother. I can't
            just leave him there.

                         DIGNAN
            This could be a trap.
                         BOB
            Come on, Dignan.

                         DIGNAN
            Don't "Come on, Dignan" me.

                         BOB
            I'm going back.

                         DIGNAN
                   (louder)
            Not in that car you're not.

                         BOB
            Watch me.

                         DIGNAN
            Good luck, since I got the keys.

Bob glares at Dignan. Dignan shrugs. The waitress brings
over some glasses of water, ice clinking. Nobody says
anything while she sets them down. She walks away.

                         BOB
            Give me the keys, Dignan.

                         DIGNAN
            I can't do that, Bob.

                         BOB
            Dignan. You're going to give me
            those keys or you're going to get
            hurt.

                         DIGNAN
            Don't threaten me, Bob.

                         BOB
            Goddammit, Dignan! It's my car! If
            you don't give me my keys, I swear
            to God --

EXT. STREET. DAY

Dignan drives the car slowly alongside: Bob walking down the
sidewalk, staring straight ahead. Dignan's, got his window
down.

                         DIGNAN
            Look, Bob. I understand your
            loyalty. You're a good person. But
            right now you're not using your
            best judgement.

Bob keeps walking.

                         DIGNAN
            Future Man would not want you to go
            to jail I promise you. Just get in
            the car and we'll talk about it.

No reaction. Bob keeps walking straight ahead.

                         DIGNAN
            Future Man would never go to jail
            for you, I'll tell you that.

                         BOB
            His name's not Future Man, Dignan.

                         DIGNAN
            I know it's not.

                         BOB
            You don't even know his name.

                         DIGNAN
            Yes, I do.

                         BOB
            What is it?

                         DIGNAN
            Just get in the car, Bob.

                         BOB
            What's his name?

                         DIGNAN
            OK, Bob. I don't know his name. You
            know why? Because I don't care.
            He's Future Man. But I care about
            you. And to me it doesn't make
            sense to go back to the scene of a
            crime. Will you get in the car, Bob?
            This is stupid.

Bob stops walking.

                         BOB
            It's not your decision and he's not
            your brother, Dignan.

                         DIGNAN
            That's right. I only have one vote.
            We'll go talk with Anthony and
            figure it out.

Pause. Bob gets into the backseat. Dignan looks back at him
for a minute.

                         DIGNAN
            You're going to ride in the back?

Bob nods and looks out the window.

                         DIGNAN
            Come on, Bob. Get in front.

Bob exhales and gets out. He gets in up front. Dignan looks
at him for a minute.

                         DIGNAN
            You've got a beautiful walk, Bob.

                         BOB
            Let's go.

INT. MOTEL ROOM. NIGHT

Dignan and Bob open the door and go in. Inside: Inez and two
other Hispanic MAIDS are sitting at the table by the window.
One's about seventeen and a little heavy, the other's in her
mid-thitties. There's a bunch of glasses and a bottle of rum
on the table. One of the maids is cutting up a banana. Inez
smiles at Dignan. Dignan looks puzzled.

                         DIGNAN
            Hi. How's it going.

Suddenly there's a loud crunching, grinding sound. Dignan
and Bob are startled. They look around the room. The sound
stops.

Anthony comes out of the bathroom carrying the pitcher from
a blender. It's full to the top with yellow liquid. He sees
Dignan and Bob and stops. Pause.

                         ANTHONY
            I thought you guys went to get your
            hair cut.

                         DIGNAN
            No. We didn't.

Silence.

                         ANTHONY
            We're making banana daqueris.

Anthony holds up the pitcher. Dignan looks at it. Nods. Pause.

                         ANTHONY
            This is Inez. Carmen. Anita.

                         DIGNAN
            Hi.

                         ANTHONY
            Inez, this is --

                         DIGNAN
            Jerry.
                   (pointing to Bob)
            And this is my associate Cornelius.

A strange expression crosses Bob's face.

                         DIGNAN
            May I have a word with you, please?

                         ANTHONY
            Sure.

EXT. MOTEL HALLWAY. NIGHT

Outside the room. Dignan closes the door. There's three
housekeeping carts in the hall.

                         DIGNAN
            What the fuck is going on here?

                         ANTHONY
            What. What's the matter?

                         DIGNAN
            Anthony, we're on the run from the
            law here. Did you tell these people
            your real name?

                         ANTHONY
            No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't
            speak English.

                         DIGNAN
            They don't?

                         ANTHONY
            No. Not really. Inez speaks a little.

                         DIGNAN
            Which one was that?

                         ANTHONY
            On the left.

Dignan cracks open the door and looks inside.

                         ANTHONY
            She's from Cuba.

                         DIGNAN
            No kidding.

                         BOB
            Dignan.

                         DIGNAN
                   (closes the door)
            Anthony. Bad news.

EXT. MOTEL POOL. DAY

They walk around the motel.

                         ANTHONY
            How long are they going to hold him?

                         BOB
            I don't know. I don't know anything.
            Except Phil says they got him. And
            he's in jail.

                         DIGNAN
            He needs to hire an attorney.

                         ANTHONY
            No, no. Look. OK. Let's stay here
            until we find out what's going on.

                         BOB
            Anthony, I --

                         ANTHONY
            And if Future Man doesn't get let
            out of jail in 48 hours, then we go
            back. All right?

                         DIGNAN
            Now that makes sense. We'll hang
            out for a couple of days. Get a
            little R&R. Make sure Future Man's
            OK and then get back on the road.

                         ANTHONY
            As long as he gets out OK.

                         DIGNAN
            Obviously. That's a given.

                         ANTHONY
            Bob?

                         BOB
            What?

                         ANTHONY
            Is that OK?

Pause. Bob looks at Dignan. Looks at Anthony.

                         BOB
                   (shrugs)
            Yeah. I guess so.

They shake hands and start back to the room.

                         DIGNAN
            See, now we've got a plan.

                         ANTHONY
            Don't worry about it, Bob.

INT. MOTEL ROOM. NIGHT

Anthony, Dignan, Inez, Carmen, and Anita are sitting crowded
around the little table by the window in the motel room.
They've got banana daqueris and a bottle of wine. Moonlight
comes through the window. Bob is standing up in front of
them with a banana daqueri in his hand. He's singing a blues
number acapella. He's got a good voice.

INT. MOTEL ROOM. NIGHT

Dignan and Bob are playing slapjack with Carmen and Anita.
Everyone's got their hands ready as  Carmen turns one card
then the next. Bob's having a conversation in fluent Spanish
with them about Las Vegas. He's talking about the rules at
different casinos: Bally's, Caesar's, the Desert Inn.
Dignan's paying close attention to the deck. A jack comes up
and he slams it.

EXT. MOTEL POOL. NIGHT

There's a light in the pool. Anthony and Inez are swimming.
Anthony swims around her with his eyes just above the water.
He goes under and comes up grabbing onto her. She laughs.

                         INEZ
            Does my skin feel soft, Anthony?

                         ANTHONY
                   (passionate)
            God, yes. Like silk.
Inez starts to giggle.

                         ANTHONY
            What?
                   (starts laughing)
            What?

                         INEZ
            Like silk?

                         ANTHONY
            God. That does sound corny.  Oh,
            your skin feels so soft and silky.
            But it really kind of does.

He kisses her.

                         DIGNAN
            No lifeguard on duty. Swim at your
            own risk.

They look up. Dignan's standng at the other side of the pool.
He smiles.

                         DIGNAN
            You know, I did save Anthony from
            drowning once, Inez. Tell her,
            Anthony.

                                            CUT TO:

Dignan sitting with his feet in the pool. Anthony and Inez
are sitting on the steps beside him, in the shallow end.

                         DIGNAN
            See, one day we were playing hot
            box over at my next door neighbor
            Mr. Langston's house and Anthony
            fell in the pool and got knocked
            unconscious. I had to dive in and
            save him.

                         ANTHONY
            This was in fourth grade.

                         DIGNAN
            Mr. Langston performed
            cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR.
            I've never said this before, but
            frankly I thought Anthony was dead.
            The veins in his face were all
            sticking out. His skin was blue. He
            truly did look dead.

                         ANTHONY
            After that my parents never let me
            go to Dignan's again.

                         DIGNAN
            They blamed my family for everything.
            They always said Mr. Langston saved
            Anthony's life.

Dignan stares wistfully across the pool. Anthony looks at
him for a minute.

                         ANTHONY
            But if it wasn't for Dignan I
            probably would of died.

                         DIGNAN
                   (nodding, whisper voice)
            Yes...It's true.

They're all quiet for a minute. Inez hangs onto the side.

INT. MOTEL ROOM. NIGHT

Bob's sitting in the room by himself, close to the TV,
watching a war movie.

EXT. MOTEL. DAY

The next morning. Dignan bursts out the door of the motel
room. He runs across the parking lot.

                         DIGNAN
            Son of a bitch.

Dignan runs back into the room. He comes out with Anthony.

                         DIGNAN
            He's gone. He stole the car.

                         ANTHONY
            Where was it parked?

                         DIGNAN
            Right here.

Anthony looks around the parking lot.

                         DIGNAN
            That coward. Son of a bitch.

                         ANTHONY
            Maybe he just went to the store.

                         DIGNAN
            He took his stuff. He's gone.
                   (pause)
            I should of seen this. I should of
            expected it. Bob doesn't have any
            character.

Anthony puts his hands in his pockets. Looks out at the
highway.

                         ANTHONY
            He went back for his brother.

                         DIGNAN
            We said 48 hours.

                         ANTHONY
            That's a long time to be in jail.

They stand there in the empty parking lot. Anthony goes
inside.

INT. MOTEL ROOM. DAY

In the room. The blinds are pulled. Anthony's sitting at the
end of a bed. Dignan's pacing around the room.

                         DIGNAN
            We'll get him. Don't worry about
            that. We'll go back. We'll find him.
            And we'll blow up his car. Or do
            something. I promise you.

Anthony gets up and walks to the bathroom. He shuts the door.
Dignan follows him over to the sink and sits on the counter.

                         DIGNAN
            I mean, let's face it. Bob was dead
            weight. We're a lot better off
            without him.
                   (pause)
            But who could expect it? Just like
            that. Steals the fucking car. What
            kind of person pulls that --

Anthony opens the door and walks out.

                         ANTHONY
            Bob didn't steal the car. He told
            me he was going. He had to go help
            his brother.

Anthony sits back down on the bed. Dignan's shocked.

                         DIGNAN
            When'd he tell you?

                         ANTHONY
            This morning.

                         DIGNAN
            Where was I?

                         ANTHONY
            You were asleep.

                         DIGNAN
            He told you and you let him do it.

                         ANTHONY
            He told me because he wanted to
            know if I wanted to go.

                         DIGNAN
                   (hesitates)
            If you wanted to go? What were you
            going to do? Just leave me here by
            myself?

                         ANTHONY
            Well, I didn't do it, did I?

                         DIGNAN
            So when you were saying Bob's at
            the store and acting real suprised,
            that was just an act. You were
            just --

                         ANTHONY
            Bob went to help his brother. I
            understand that and I can't help it
            if you don't.

                         DIGNAN
            I understand that if I had a few
            more friends like you and Bob I'd
            be dead.

                         ANTHONY
            If you say so.

INT. DINER. DAY

Anthony and Dignan are sitting at a booth. Anthony's got a
roadmap spread out on the table. There's a long silence.

                         DIGNAN
            If you'd gone with Bob you'd
            probably be in Weatherford by now.
            Of course I'd be here frantically
            worrying thinking you must of got
            kidnapped.

                         ANTHONY
            I didn't realize you had such an
            incredible ability to feel sorry
            for yourself, Dignan.

                         DIGNAN
            Well, the world is a little bit
            colder today.

Anthony sits there thinking for a second, stating into space.
Then he looks back at his map. He draws some lines in two
different colors of felt tip pens.

                         ANTHONY
            You want to look at the map?

Pause. Dignan kind of looks at the map, without leaning
forward. Anthony turns the map more in Dignan's direction.
Dignan leans forward, looking.

                         ANTHONY
            See. Here's where we are.

They look at the map for a minute. Dignan looks out the
window.

                         DIGNAN
            I didn't know he had it in him.
                   (pause)
            I guess you could say the child has
            become the father of the man.

EXT/INT. MOTEL/TOWN. DAY

Anthony runs down the sidewalk, cuts across the street, and
goes around the side of the motel. He pulls off his jacket
as he goes up the stairs. He spots Inez's cart. He walks
over to the room she's cleaning. She's in there making the
bed. Anthony closes the door and grabs her by her belt.
She's laughing and he pushes her onto the bed. He unbuttons
her dress. She jerks a sheet out of the way. It swings in
the air.

Then we see Anthony and Inez walking down the sidewalk. He's
got one arm wrapped tight around her shoulders and she's got
hers around his waist. They're talking while they walk,
going past people in the town.

They watch each other walking reflected in a window.

EXT. MOTEL. EVENING

Dignan is doing the butterfly in the pool. Anthony and Inez
walk over and wait for him at the end of the pool.

                         ANTHONY
            We're going over to this bar if you
            feel like going.

                         DIGNAN
            No. I'm going to swim. I'll see you
            later.

Dignan treads water. Inez looks at Anthony.

                         ANTHONY
            Why don't you come with us.

                         DIGNAN
            OK.

Dignan gets out of the pool.

INT. MEXICAN BAR. NIGHT

Anthony, Dignan, and Inez are drinking beers with limes and
salt. The mood is good and they're getting drunk. Anthony
and Inez dance. Then Dignan and Inez. Mexican-style, stomping
their feet and clapping. There's a scruffy dog in the bar
and he barks at the dancers. Anthony kisses Inez and they
whisper to each other. Dignan orders another beer and moves
over to the pool table. A skinny Mexican MAN puts his arm
around Dignan's shoulder. He's drunk and slurring his words.
So's Dignan.

                         MAN
            Hello, my friend. You in the Army,
            yes?

                         DIGNAN
            No. I just have short hair.

                         MAN
            Is that your chiquita?

                         DIGNAN
            No, my friend knows her.

                         MAN
            She Chicano, yes?

Dignan nods.

                         MAN
            You like Chicanos?

                         DIGNAN
            Sure.

He says something in fast Spanish to the people at his table
and they smile.

                         MAN
            Play pool? For one cerveza.

Dignan nods. The guy racks up the balls. They start shooting.
Dignan makes a hard shot.

                         MAN
                   (smiling)
            You a good pool player.

                         DIGNAN
            Got a little lucky.

                         MAN
            Where's your friend? He go with the
            chiquita?

Dignan looks over to the bar. Anthony and Inez are gone.

                         DIGNAN
            I don't know.

                         MAN
            She is a good looking woman.

Dignan ignores this. They keep playing. Dignan finally makes
the eight ball. The man shakes Dignan's hand and holds on.

                         DIGNAN
            Guess I'll get another Tecate.

                         MAN
            Si. Tecate. You like to fight?

                         DIGNAN
            What?

                         MAN
            Fight. You know.

He pulls Dignan in and with his other hand fakes a hard punch.

                         DIGNAN
            No. Just pool.

                         MAN
            You Hoto?

                         DIGNAN
                   (pulls away)
            Fuck you. You a Hoto.

                         MAN
                   (smiles)
            No. Me no Hoto. Tecate?

                         DIGNAN
            Right.

INT. BATHROOM. NIGHT

The bathroom is very small with one bare light bulb. Dignan
stands at the urinal, muttering to himself.

The door opens and Dignan turns around just in time to see
the Mexican man throw a hard punch. He hits Dignan in the
stomach, punches him in the face. Dignan goes down hard. The
guy kicks him and curses in Spanish.

                         MAN
            Pinche cabrone. Puta madre.

The bartender comes in with a bat in his hand and starts
talking fast and angry in Spanish. The guy gets out.

INT. MOTEL ROOM. NIGHT

Dignan's sitting in bed, watching TV. He's got a fat lip and
a big bruise over his eye. Anthony's sitting in a chair
beside him. Inez brings over a glass of water and some ice
in a washcloth. She gives the ice to Dignan for his eye. She
puts the glass of water on the nightstand where there's some
fast food layed out for Dignan: burger, fries, an apple pie.
Inez goes into the bathroom, closes the door, and turns on
the water. Anthony's sitting there with his hands clasped,
not looking at the TV.

                         ANTHONY
            I can't believe he just jumped you.

                         DIGNAN
            Can you hand me those french fries.

Anthony hands him the fries. Dignan watches the TV.

                         ANTHONY
            I wish I'd been there.

                         DIGNAN
            Would of been nice.

Anthony looks at Dignan.

                         ANTHONY
            Man. I'm sorry. We just went for a
            walk --

                         DIGNAN
            I don't really feel like talking
            about it. The only thing I feel
            like is getting the fuck out of
            this place.

                         ANTHONY
                   (pause)
            We need a car.

For the first time Dignan looks away from the TV, at Anthony.

                         DIGNAN
            I have an idea for that.

                         ANTHONY
            What?

                         DIGNAN
            Inez has a master key to all these
            rooms, doesn't she?
                   (pause)
            Doesn't she?

                         ANTHONY
            I don't think we can do that.

                         DIGNAN
            I know we can. It's real simple. We
            go into a room, grab some car keys
            and --

                         ANTHONY
            What I'm saying is she wouldn't go
            for that.

                         DIGNAN
            She doesn't need to know.

                         ANTHONY
                   (pause)
            I don't know, Dignan. I just --
                         DIGNAN
            Look. I'm ready to get the fuck out
            of here. It's real torture for me
            to be here. Getting the shit kicked
            out of me by Mexicans.

                         ANTHONY
            Shh.

                         DIGNAN
            No one to back me up. Now I have a
            good idea. So unless you come up
            with something better --

                         ANTHONY
            Dignan. I can't do that. All right?
            I just can't.

The bathroom door opens.

                         DIGNAN
            Then you better think of something.

Inez comes back in.

                         INEZ
            How are you, Jerry?

                         DIGNAN
                   (staring at TV)
            I feel great, Inez.

                         ANTHONY
                   (kisses her)
            I'll see you later.

Inez goes outside. She closes the door.

                         ANTHONY
            I don't think we need any keys,
            Dignan. I think I can hotwire a car
            for us.

                         DIGNAN
            You don't know how to hotwire.

                         ANTHONY
            Yes, I do. Bob taught me.

                         DIGNAN
            Bob taught you how to get
            electrocuted.

                         ANTHONY
            No, I'm serious. He made me a
            diagram.

EXT. SIDEWALK. DAY

Dignan's standing on a corner alone. He looks sullen.

EXT. SIDEWALK. DAY

Anthony walks down an alley. He goes past a beat-up
convertible. He stops, hands in his pockets. He looks both
ways.

He cuts back to the car, opens the door, and slips inside.

INT. STOLEN CAR. DAY

Anthony's behind the wheel. He hand signals a turn and pulls
up next to Dignan. Dignan shakes his head as he looks at the
car. He gets in. They drive through the town. The wind's
blowing hard. Anthony smiles at Dignan. Dignan tries not to
smile.

                                            CUT TO:

Dignan sitting in the parked car with the motor running. In
the side mirror he's watching Anthony and Inez. Anthony's
saying goodbye. He walks back to the car and gets in. He
puts it in gear and they drive off.

                         DIGNAN
            What'd you say to Inez?

Anthony shrugs.

                         DIGNAN
            "I'll come back for you. I love
            you, Inez."

Anthony is silent.

                         DIGNAN
            "I'm going to take you away from
            all this windexing and making beds."

Silence. Dignan exhales and looks out the window.

EXT. HIGHWAY. DAY

The car is on the shoulder, raised up on a Jack with the
hood open. Anthony's looking underneath the car. Dignan's
standing in the middle the road with his hands in his
pockets. No cars in sight.

Anthony starts messing around under the hood. He tests some
wires and connections. He steps away from the car.

                         ANTHONY
            Man, I don't know anything about
            cars.

Dignan stares down the road.

                         DIGNAN
            You really know how to pick them.

Anthony walks over to Dignan. He stands beside him for a
minute.

                         ANTHONY
            I think we better go home.

                         DIGNAN
            Don't panic, Anthony.

                         ANTHONY
            I'm not. But there's --

                         DIGNAN
            You can't just run home every time
            things get tough. First of all,
            we've got enough dough to --

                         ANTHONY
            Our money situation is not good.

                         DIGNAN
                   (clapping him on the back)
            You're so spoiled. What is "not
            good" to you? Only a few hundred --

                         ANTHONY
            We've got sixteen dollars.

                         DIGNAN
            That's not correct.

Dignan stares at Anthony.

                         DIGNAN
            Give it to me.

Pause. Anthony reaches into his pocket and pulls out the
money. Dignan takes it. He counts it. He looks at Anthony.

                         DIGNAN
            Sixteen dollars.

                         ANTHONY
            I know.

                         DIGNAN
            Where's the rest?

Dignan stares at Anthony. Pause.

                         ANTHONY
            I had to give some to Inez.

                         DIGNAN
            How much?

                         ANTHONY
            $383.

Dignan frowns slightly. Pause. He screams:

                         DIGNAN
            What!

Pause. Dignan runs at the car and kicks the door as hard as
he can. It makes a big dent. He runs down the shoulder and
grabs a big rock. He runs at the car and smashes the rock
through the windshield. He stands still. He turns to Anthony.
He walks back over to him, yelling.

                         DIGNAN
            You gave $383 to the goddamn
            housekeeper! What the fuck is your
            problem?

                         ANTHONY
            She needed it.

                         DIGNAN
            A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!

                         ANTHONY
            Her name's Inez. Stop calling her
            the housekeeper.

                         DIGNAN
            That's what she is!

                         ANTHONY
            I know that. But --

                         DIGNAN
            You're in love with the fucking
            housekeeper!

                         ANTHONY
            Shut up!

                         DIGNAN
            What are you going to do, get
            married? Have a bunch of little
            idiot janitor brats! And go around
            scrubbing the --

Anthony slaps Dignan hard in the face.

                         ANTHONY
            Stop!
                   (pause)
            Now listen to me.

Dignan punches Anthony is the face. Follows it up with one
after another. Anthony ducks and puts his arms out. He falls
on one knee. Dignan immediately turns and walks to the car.

Anthony stands up. He's got a bloody nose. He stares at
Dignan. Not angry. Just weary.

Dignan pulls his tennis bag out of the car. He shuts the
door and walks down the highway.

Anthony walks to the car and takes out his backpack. He
pulls it tight around his shoulders. He looks down the
highway at Dignan. Then turns and walks the other way, into
the distance.

                                            BLACKOUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. GOLF COURSE. DAY

A cold day on a nice country club course. Anthony watches
Bob hit a hard slide straight into the rough. Bob stands
there in a frozen follow-through. Then he suddenly swings
his club and hums it down the fareway. He starts to walk
back to the golf cart.

                         ANTHONY
            Bob, where you going?

                         BOB
            I'm not playing any more golf.

                         ANTHONY
            Why not?

                         BOB
            Cause I'm not getting any better.
            It's a waste of time.

                         ANTHONY
            You've only been playing for two
            weeks, Bob. It takes a long time to
            learn this game.

                         BOB
            You think I'm improving?

                         ANTHONY
                   (pause)
            Yes. You just got to stick with it.

Bob looks down the fareway. He takes a deep breath and
starts walking toward his club about twenty yards away.

INT. GOLF CART. DAY

In the cart. Bob's driving. There's a brief silence.

                         BOB
            You don't have to talk about it if
            you don't want to.

                         ANTHONY
            No, I don't mind.

                         BOB
            I know it must of been a bad
            experience. But it doesn't sound
            like it was your fault.

                         ANTHONY
            Well, I didn't mean to electrocute
            him. But the whole operation was my
            idea.

MONTAGE: Electronics wizardry. Splicing wires. Buzzing
electrodes. A filament lights up blue. Pliers and clippers
rewire a circuit breaker, short out the P.A. system,
electrify doors and windows. Anthony continues in VOICEOVER.

                         ANTHONY (VO)
            It took six months of research. I
            did all the wiring myself. Switched
            AC to DC. Doubled the voltage.
            Shorted out the generator. The
            whole school was shut down.

                         BOB (VO)
            That's pretty complicated for a
            senior prank.

                         ANTHONY (VO)
            I don't like that word prank, Bob.
            I was trying to do something more
            than a prank.

EXT. SCHOOL. DAY

A large school building. Tall oak trees and benches in the
shade. Green and blue lights blink in the windows. White
flashes and loud jolts of energy dance from room to room.
Mozart plays in the distance.

Students begin to swarm out into the yard.

                         ANTHONY (VO)
            I wanted to create an event.
            Something everyone would remember.
            And at first it worked perfectly.
            The whole school was standing
            around outside. Kids running all
            over the place. Everybody laughing.

EXT. GOLF COURSE. DAY

Anthony and Bob are standing on the seventeenth green.

                         ANTHONY
            Even the school custodian Swifty
            thought it was great. He kept
            laughing and shaking his head the
            whole time he tried to disconnect
            the generator. And then suddenly
                   (snaps his finger)
            total silence except for Swifty
            hanging off the generator with his
            leg stuck to it being electrocuted.

Anthony stares down the fareway.

                         ANTHONY
            Actually he died of a heart attack
            brought on by the shock. He was an
            older guy.

INT. GOLF CART. DAY

Anthony and Bob are driving back to the clubhouse.

                         ANTHONY
            I felt terrible. I'd known Swifty
            since first grade. He was Dignan's
            medicine man for Indian Guides.
            They called each other Rattlesnake
            and Killer Whale. Whenever Dignan
            came to visit me he would act like
            he and Swifty weren't that good of
            friends, but that was just to make
            me feel better. The whole rest of
            the school had turned against me.

EXT. BOB'S HOUSE. DAY

Anthony and Bob are sitting by the pool, drinking beers.
Future Man's swimming laps even though it's cold out.

                         ANTHONY
            At first they were going to charge
            me with manslaughter. That's partly
            why I was in custody so long. Sixty
            days.

                         BOB
            Sixty days?

                         ANTHONY
            Yeah. One minute you're studying
            Great Expectations and the next
            minute you're drawing the Holy Mary
            for some kid who tried to stab his
            girlfriend.

                         BOB
            Why were you drawing the Holy Mary?

                         ANTHONY
            Prison tatoos. I got to be pretty
            good. It's not like drawing on paper.

                                            CUT TO:

Future Man toweling off. He wears a Speedo swimsuit. He
walks over to Bob and Anthony. Anthony's just finishing a
drawing of a leaping jungle cat in black and red ink on
Bob's shoulder.

Future Man stops and looks at them with no feeling.

                         ANTHONY
                   (pause)
            It's a panther.

Pause. Future Man looks at Bob.

                         FUTURE MAN
            How's that 700 bucks coming?

                         BOB
            I'm working on it.

                         FUTURE MAN
            Hard to find it sitting by the pool
            drinking beer and bullshitting.

He walks inside.

                         ANTHONY
            I thought he didn't have to pay
            anything because of the technicality.

                         BOB
            Yeah, but he still has the
            aggravation. Three days sitting in
            a cell.

                         ANTHONY
                   (pause)
            Were you adopted, Bob?

                         BOB
            Why do you say that?

                         ANTHONY
            Well, because you guys don't look
            alike.

                         BOB
            No. I wasn't adopted.

Long pause.

                         ANTHONY
            Was Future Man adopted?

                         BOB
            Jesus Christ! No.

INT. CAR. DAY

Dignan and APPLEJACK are sitting in, a '72 Monte Carlo by
the curb two houses down from Bob's. Applejack is a small
black man with white hair. It's hard to tell exactly how old
he is. Around sixty-five.

                         DIGNAN
            There's a lot of valuable shit in
            there, Applejack. The silver and
            the china. The crystal. And the
            grandfather clock. Goddammit, I bet
            that clock's worth ten grand.

                         APPLEJACK
            Why the fuck do we need to blow up
            the car? It doesn't make any
            goddamn sense.

                         DIGNAN
            Just settling an old score. You
            might say revenge.

                         APPLEJACK
            That sounds like a lot of bullshit
            that'll land us in jail.

                         DIGNAN
            We might have to take that chance.
            Cause I feel pretty strongly about
            this.

                         APPLEJACK
            Is that Buckethead?

Anthony is walking Hector down the driveway.

                         DIGNAN
            Get down.

Anthony does some stretching exercises in the driveway.

                         APPLEJACK
            Is that him?

                         DIGNAN
            Wait a second.

They watch Anthony and Hector start down the street.

                         DIGNAN
            That's Anthony.

                         APPLEJACK
            That's your friend Anthony?

                         DIGNAN
            Yeah.

                         APPLEJACK
            What's he doing here?

                         DIGNAN
            Looks like he's staying with
            Buckethead. That's what I figured.
            He's probably got his own room.
            Let's see where he's going.

Applejack puts the car in gear. They drive slowly.

                         DIGNAN
            Don't get too close.

Anthony looks back.

                         DIGNAN
            Stop. He saw us.

Anthony keeps jogging with Hector.

                         DIGNAN
            Wait. Did he see us?

                         APPLEJACK
            We're going too slow. It looks like
            we're following him.

Anthony goes around a corner, down an alley.

                         DIGNAN
            Speed up.

They pull down to the end of the alley. Anthony and Hector
are racing down the alley.

EXT. ALLEY. DAY

Dignan gets out of the car.

                         DIGNAN
            Anthony!

Anthony looks back. He stops running.

                         DIGNAN
            Wait up.

Dignan jogs down the alley. He stops a few feet away from
Anthony.

                         DIGNAN
            Where you going?

Anthony points down the alley.

                         ANTHONY
            Just walking Hector.

Dignan looks down the alley. He looks at Anthony. Pause.

                         ANTHONY
            When'd you get back?

                         DIGNAN
            Ah. Couple days ago.

Pause.

                         DIGNAN
                   (under his breath)
            You want to shake hands.

Anthony puts his hand out. They shake. Pause. Anthony looks
down the alley.

                         ANTHONY
            Who's in the car?

                         DIGNAN
            That's Applejack. You want to meet
            him?

                         ANTHONY
            Sure.

They walk to the car.

                         DIGNAN
            This is Applejack.

They shake.

                         ANTHONY
            Nice to meet you, Applejack.

                         APPLEJACK
            You're Anthony?

                         ANTHONY
            Yeah.

                         APPLEJACK
            I hear you're a good thief.

Anthony shrugs and smiles. He nods.

EXT. HAMBURGER PLACE. DAY

A hamburger place with no other customers. Anthony, Dignan,
and Applejack are sitting at an outdoor table. It's cold and
their jackets are zipped up tight.

                         APPLEJACK
            I'm just sitting at this bar
            drinking my drink when this fine
            chick walks by. She was a living
            doll. And the big motherfucker who
            came in with her sees me looking,
            when he walks by he steps on my
            foot. Doesn't say shit. Just takes
            a seat with his lady. Well, I
            holler out to him, If I was as big
            as you, ain't no way in the hell
            you'd of stepped on my foot like
            that. He just laughed. He says,
            Little man, take your foot and put
            it in your pocket. I said, No, how
            about I take my foot and I stick it
            up your ass? Man, we went to war
            right there. I hit him so hard I
            knocked his nuts in his watchpocket.
            But this motherfucker wouldn't go
            down. Then all the sudden, out of
            nowhere, Dignan came up behind him
            and smashed a bottle on his head.
            And that big old boy went down.
            That's how I met Dignan. Good cat
            to have on your side. He'll go to
            war with you. He don't give a fuck.

Applelack and Dignan slap hands.

                         DIGNAN
            Applejack would of got him anyway.
            This was just the quicker war.

                         ANTHONY
            You really hit a guy with a bottle?

Dignan takes a little notebook out of his pocket.

                         DIGNAN
            Pretty much. He kind of fell into
            me. But wait a second.

Dignan opens the notebook on the table.

                         DIGNAN
            I want you to look at this.

                         ANTHONY
            What is it?

                         DIGNAN
            It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's
            called Hinckley Cold Storage.

                         ANTHONY
            What's Hinckley Cold Storage?

EXT. HINCKLEY COLD STORAGE. DAY

Anthony, Dignan, and Applejack are standing in front of a
massive structure with ladders and towers and huge doors.
Applejack's car is parked behind them. There are trucks
lined up along the loading docks. A big sign says Hinckley
Cold Storage.

                         DIGNAN
            Mr. Henry has an inside source. We
            call him Steve. That's where we get
            our information.

                         ANTHONY
            Who's Mr. Henry?

                         DIGNAN
            You'll meet him this afternoon.
            He's helping us set it up.

                         APPLEJACK
            Did you ever hear of the S. Cooper
            Trust robbery?

                         ANTHONY
                   (shakes his head)
            Uh-uh.

                         APPLEJACK
            S. Cooper Trust,in San Francisco?

                         ANTHONY
            Uh-uh.

                         DIGNAN
            Mr. Henry pulled that job in 1965.
            It's famous. Applejack was the
            wheel man. Did you use this same
            car, Applejack?

                         APPLEJACK
            Hell, no. This is a '72. I was
            driving a '63 Pontiac.
                         ANTHONY
            What exactly is this place? Freezers?

                         DIGNAN
            Right. Freezers. Imported foods.

Anthony stares at Hitckley Cold Storage.

                         APPLEJACK
            Let's go, Abdul-Shabazz.

                         ANTHONY
            Abdul-Shabazz?

                         DIGNAN
            Just a nickname.

EXT. WAREHOUSE. DAY

Anthony, Dignan, and Applejack are standing on the sidewalk
at the front door of an old warehouse. Dignan knocks on the
door, then tries the bell. They all wait.

                         ANTHONY
            What time did he say to be here?

                         DIGNAN
            Right now.

Dignan looks in the window. He tries the door. It's locked.

                         APPLEJACK
            I can knock a man out with a six
            inch punch.

                         ANTHONY
            What do you mean?

                         APPLEJACK
            Feel this.

Anthony puts his hand up. Applejack does a short, hard jab.
Anthony shakes his hand out.

                         ANTHONY
                   (whistles)
            You could give somebody a concussion.

                         DIGNAN
            Let me feel that.

Dignan puts his hand up. Applejack nails it.

                         DIGNAN
                   (grabbing his hand)
            Ow. Shit.

A drop of water hits Dignan on the head. He looks up. More
water falls on him. He gets out of the way. Everyone looks
up. There's a man on the roof. He laughs, hysterically. They
stare up at him.

                         MAN
            How's the weather down there?

                         DIGNAN
                   (pause)
            Mr. Henry?

                         MAN
            Come on in!

                         DIGNAN
            It's locked.

                         MAN
            No, it's not.

Dignan shrugs. He goes over to the door. Mr. Henry pours
some more water on him.

A minute later: a steel garage door opens and the man steps
outside. He is tall, about sixty years old with white hair
clipped short and a trim goatee. He wears black trousers,
black shoes, no shirt, and a string of animal teeth around
his neck. This is MR. HENRY. He puts a towel around Dignan's
shoulders and pats him on the back.

                         MR. HENRY
            Dignan. Good to see you. Good to
            see you Applejack.
                   (looks at Anthony)
            Who are you?

                         DIGNAN
            This is Anthony Adams, Mr. Henry.

                         MR. HENRY
            This is no good.

Mr. Henry stares hard at Dignan. He looks to Anthony. He
looks back to Dignan.

                         MR. HENRY
            This is no good, bringing him here.
            What are you thinking? What the
            shit, man? Are you crazy?

Mr. Henry stares at Dignan. He looks to Anthony.

                         MR. HENRY
            I'm pulling your leg. Abe Henry.

They shake hands. Mr. Henry points to ROWBOAT, a tall, older
black man standing in the doorway. Rowboat wears a white
windbreaker.

                         MR. HENRY
            This is my business manager, Rowboat.

                         ANTHONY
            Nice to meet you.

                         MR. HENRY
            That's a sharp jacket.

                         ANTHONY
            Thanks.

INT. WAREHOUSE. DAY

The second floor of the warehouse is one huge room painted
all white. Mr. Henry and Anthony are playing ping-pong.
Dignan watches. Rowboat-and Applejack are on the far side of
the room playing chess.

                         ANTHONY
            It's hard to get much spin with
            this kind of paddle.

                         MR. HENRY
            It's called a racquet, Anthony, and
            you're holding it wrong. That's
            ghetto play. Hold it like this.

Anthony changes his grip. Mr. Henry serves. The ball clicks
back and forth. They're both solid players. Anthony whips a
shot crosscourt and wins the point.

                         MR. HENRY
            You know, your form is for shit,
            but you've got a hell of a talent.

                         ANTHONY
            Thanks.

Mr. Henry serves. Anthony returns. Mr. Henry suddenly fires
a scorching shot down the line. Anthony watches it click
past him. He looks to Mr. Henry.

                         ANTHONY
            Nice shot.

Mr. Henry smiles. He looks to Dignan.

                         MR. HENRY
            Is he in?

                         DIGNAN
            I don't know. Are you in, Anthony?

Anthony stands there silent. He looks to Applejack and
Rowboat. He looks to Mr. Henry. Then Dignan.

                         ANTHONY
            Yeah, I'm in.

Mr. Henry puts down his paddle. Stares at Anthony. Smiles.

                         MR. HENRY
            OK, kid. Let's go talk about cops
            and robbers.

INT. WAREHOUSE. DAY

The ground floor is crammed with cars. Some have been taken
apart. Some are shiny and perfect. Anthony and Dignan walk
among the cars and junk with Mr. Henry. They've each got
coffee in a styrofoam cup.

                         MR. HENRY
            Every once in a while some cat
            comes to me. He wants to know how I
            made it. How did I become a success?
            The first thing I tell them is:
            follow your instincts. Let your
            instincts guide you. The second
            thing I tell them is, for Christ's
            sake: you got to know your grammar.

                         ANTHONY
            Grammar.

                         DIGNAN
            What do you mean grammar?

                         MR. HENRY
            The basic grammatical rules of
            robbing.

                         ANTHONY
            You mean like techniques?

                         MR. HENRY
                   (nods)
            Technique. That's right. Seventy-
            five percent of your job is crowd
            control. Seventy-five percent. Do
            you believe that?

                         DIGNAN
                   (pause)
            Yes, I do.

EXT. ROOFTOP. DAY

On the roof of the warehouse. They're standing near the
edge, looking out. Mr. Henry is smoking a joint. He's got on
a black beret. Anthony and Dignan are listening to him talk.

                         MR. HENRY
            On the other hand you got to have
            the right equipment. I don't care
            if you're Harry Houdini. You can't
            pick a lock without a hairpin.

Dignan nods.

                         ANTHONY
            I'd like to live in that place.
            Hinckley Cold Storage.

                         MR. HENRY
            Yeah. Convert it into lofts. OK.
            Pop quiz. What's the single most
            important aspect of your job?

                         DIGNAN
            The grammar?

                         MR. HENRY
            Crowd control. Crowd control. Wake
            up, guys.

                         DIGNAN
            Oh, yeah.

                         MR. HENRY
            You're going to need a boxman for
            this one. But that can be arranged.

                         ANTHONY
            You mean a safecracker?

                         MR. HENRY
            Yeah. And I'll tell you who we're
            going to want: Kumar Banijamali.

                         DIGNAN
            Is he good?

                         MR. HENRY
            He's damn good.

INT. KUMAR'S ROOM. DAY

KUMAR is about sixty-five with white hair. He's short and
wears a pale-green button-down shirt, dark trousers, and
sandals. His room is small and has everything he needs in it.
Books. Little TV. Possessions from all over the world.

Kumar sits on his bed. Anthony and Dignan sit in wooden
chairs. Kumar stares out the window. They sit for a long
silence.

                         DIGNAN
            So what do you think of the plan,
            Mr. Kumar?

Kumar shrugs. Pause.

                         DIGNAN
            We'd love to have you on the team.

Kumar nods. He looks at a plant growing by the window.
Silence.

                         ANTHONY
            What is that? An orchid?

Kumar shakes his head. Sighs deeply. Long pause.

Kumar suddenly stands up and unbuttons his shirt. He throws
it on the bed. He undoes his trousers and takes them off.
Anthony looks at Dignan. Kumar takes off his socks, then his
shorts. He is naked. He walks over to his dresser and takes
out a small satchell. He looks around the room. Right at
Anthony. He walks quickly toward him. Anthony gets nervous.
Kumar grabs Anthony's shoulder and lifts him up a little. He
pulls a towel out from underneath Anthony. He puts his hand
on Dignan's shoulder as he walks to the door, into the hall.

                         KUMAR
            Good plan.

He goes out. Anthony and Dignan sit there for a minute.
They're a little disoriented.

                         DIGNAN
            What do you think?

                         ANTHONY
                   (nods)
            He seems pretty good.

INT. BOB'S HOUSE. NIGHT

The foyer of Bob's house. The doorbell is ringing. Bob walks
in wearing a velour robe. He opens the front door. Anthony
and Dignan are standing on the dootstep. Dignan and Bob
shake hands. It's a little awkward.

                         BOB
            Hey, Dignan. How's it going?

                         DIGNAN
            Not bad.

                         BOB
            Come on in. What you been up to?

                         DIGNAN
            Not a whole lot, Bob.

They walk through the house.

                         BOB
            It's too bad about what happened on
            the road.

                         DIGNAN
            Yeah. It is.

                         ANTHONY
            Let's not even talk about it.

                         BOB
            It was stupid.

                         DIGNAN
            Right. It was extremely stupid.

                         BOB
            I don't expect an apology and I
            don't even want one. I just want us
            to --

                         DIGNAN
            I can't fucking believe this guy.
            An apology, Bob?

                         BOB
            Man, I don't want to go into this.

                         ANTHONY
            Yeah. Let's keep it --

                         BOB
            Cause you would of let my brother
            rot in jail.

                         DIGNAN
            You said 48 hours!

                         BOB
            I never agreed to that.

                         DIGNAN
            Bob, you're lying!

                         BOB
            Bullshit.

                         DIGNAN
            All right! Backyard! Right now!

Dignan walks straight to the back door and goes out. He
stands on the deck.

                         DIGNAN
            Let's go, Bob!

Anthony gets up and tries to calm Dignan down.

                         ANTHONY
            Dignan. Take it easy.

                         DIGNAN
            Bob!

Bob is slowly moving toward the back door.

                         BOB
            No, Dignan. This is stupid.

Bob is standing just inside the back door.

                         ANTHONY
            Yeah. Dignan. Look. Let's just --

Dignan grabs Bob's shirt and pulls him out the door.

                         ANTHONY
            Stop, Dignan!

Anthony breaks them up. He stands in front of Bob, shielding
him.

                         ANTHONY
            He doesn't want to fight.

                         DIGNAN
            Get out of the way.

                         ANTHONY
            No, Diqnan. This isn't --

Dignan gets around Anthony and lands a glancing punch.

                         DIGNAN
            Come on!

                         BOB
            I don't want to fight you, Dignan.

                         ANTHONY
            Dignan, we're friends. Take it easy.

Dignan lands another punch. He grabs Bob's shirt and pulls
him around. Then he starts landing punches. One. Two. Then
Bob nails Dignan in the shoulder. They grab onto each other
and start fighting hard. They're about the same strength.
After a couple of seconds Anthony tries to break it up.

                         ANTHONY
            Dignan. Dignan.

All the sudden Dignan stops fighting.

                         DIGNAN
            All right. Stop.

Dignan puts his arms around Bob.

                         DIGNAN
            No fighting.

Dignan turns to Anthony. There's tears in his eyes.

                         DIGNAN
            No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault.

                         ANTHONY
            Easy, Dignan. It's OK.

They all catch their breath for a minute. Dignan hugs Bob
again.

                         DIGNAN
            It wasn't your fault, Bob. You had
            your brother.
                         BOB
            I didn't have any choice.

They stand there another minute.

                         DIGNAN
            I'm sorry, Bob.

                         BOB
            That's OK.

                         ANTHONY
                   (starting to laugh)
            Shit, Dignan.

                         DIGNAN
                   (smiles)
            What the fuck are we doing out here?

                         ANTHONY
            I don't know, Dignan. You went crazy.

                         DIGNAN
            I'm sorry, Bob.

                         BOB
            That's OK.

                         DIGNAN
            Look. We want you on the job.

EXT. COUNTRY CLUB. DAY

The restaurant at Bob's country club, People are dressed for
golf and tennis. The waiters wear white jackets. and black
bow ties. The whole crew sits at a big table by the front
window.

                         MR. HENRY
            Let me get this straight. You don't
            play golf and you don't play tennis.
            So why do you belong to a country
            club?

                         BOB
            You got me.

                         MR. HENRY
                   (shakes his head)
            You're a piece of work, Bob.

A black waiter about thirty-five, JACKSON, stops by the table.

                         JACKSON
            How you doing, Bob?

                         BOB
            Hey, Jackson. How's it going?

Jackson refills their water glasses.

                         JACKSON
            You keeping out of trouble?

                         BOB
            I'm trying.

                         JACKSON
                   (looks at others at table)
            This boy's a troublemaker. He used
            to tear this place apart.

Mr. Henry laughs. Bob smiles sheepishly. Jackson stands
there for a minute looking around the room.

                         JACKSON
            Your brother was up here the other
            day. He said you ran away from home.

                         BOB
            He said what?

                         JACKSON
            He said you ran away from home.

                         BOB
            No. I didn't run away. I went out
            of town.

Jackson nods.

                         DIGNAN
            Bob.

Bob looks at Dignan. Dignan's looking across the room.
There's Future Man and his friend CLAY fresh from a round of
golf. They're standing on the other side of the room,
looking across at Bob. They're smiling. Jackson picks up two
empty plates and walks away. Future Man and CLAY walk to
Bob's table.

                         FUTURE MAN
            Fancy seeing you here, Bob.

                         BOB
            Yeah. Hey, Clay.

                         CLAY
            Hi, Bob.

                         FUTURE MAN
                   (smiling)
            So what's shaking?

                         BOB
            Nothing much.

Future Man looks at Anthony and Dignan. His smiles fades.

                         FUTURE MAN
            How's it going.

                         ANTHONY
            Fine, thanks.

Future Man looks at the rest of the crew. His smile comes
back. Mr. Henry smiles.

                         FUTURE MAN
            John Mapplethorpe.
                   (shaking hands with
                   crew across table)
            How are you. Hi.

                         MR. HENRY
            Good to know you, John.

                         BOB
            Jackson says you told him I ran
            away from home.

Clay laughs. Future Man smiles.

                         FUTURE MAN
            I might have mentioned it.

                         BOB
            John, I'm twenty-six years old I
            didn't run away from home.

                         FUTURE MAN
            I know, Bob. You were on a secret
            mission.

                         BOB
            I'd appreciate it if you didn't go
            around telling people lies about me.

                         FUTURE MAN
            Right. I'm sorry.
                   (looks at Clay)
            You've got a reputation to think
            about.

Clay smiles. Bob shakes his head. Mr. Henry stands up.
Everyone looks at him. He's got a cold but calm expression.

                         MR. HENRY
            The world needs dreamers, son.

                         FUTURE MAN
            What?

                         MR. HENRY
            The world needs dreamers. To
            relieve the pain of consciousness.

Future Man nods. Pause. Mr. Henry doesn't sit down.

                         FUTURE MAN
            Well, we'll see you later, Bob.

                         MR. HENRY
            Pleasure to meet you, John.

                         FUTURE MAN
                   (hesitantly)
            Nice to meet you.

Future Man and Clay walk away. Mr. Henry sits down.

                         MR. HENRY
            I hope this doesn't offend you, Bob.
                   (looks closely at Bob)
            Your brother is a cocksucker.

Bob smiles. They all smile.

                         BOB
            No. That doesn't offend me.

EXT. HINCKLEY COLD STORAGE. DAY

Dignan's hidden in some bushes, watching the Hinckley Cold
Storage building with binoculars. Anthony's crouched beside
him taking notes in a notebook.

                         DIGNAN
            OK. Man in blue jeans just left by
            southwest door. He is entering a
            white van. What time is it?

                         ANTHONY
            Eleven fifteen.

                         DIGNAN
            OK. Mark that down.

                         ANTHONY
            I did.

Dignan keeps watching through the binoculars. He suddenly
looks back at Anthony.

                         DIGNAN
            God. Isn't this great? Working on
            the job. Got a wheel man. Got a
            safecracker. Good friends with Mr.
            Henry.

                         ANTHONY
            Yeah. It's pretty good.

                         DIGNAN
            It's like we've finally arrived.

Anthony nods. He's writing something.

                         DIGNAN
            What are you writing?

Anthony shows him a little flip cartoon of a guy pole
vaulting.

INT/EXT. PLANNING SEQUENCE. DAY

We see the team assembled around a table. They're drinking
coffee and looking at pictures, charts, maps, diagrams,
tools. Dignan passes out some walkie talkies.

They test out some smoke cannisters on the roof. Dignan
throws one down. They all run for cover.

Applejack and Dignan drive fast through a slalom course in a
deserted parking lot.

We see Kumar working on a safe. He wears a stethoscope and
listens to the tumblers. He turns the dial. Dignan is timing
him with a stopwatch.

Kumar opens the safe. He looks at Dignan. Dignan nods with a
serious expression on his face.

EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS. DAY

Anthony and Mr. Henry are jogging along railroad tracks in
the warehouse district. Anthony wears a blue T-shirt and
shorts. Mr. Henry looks like a boxer in grey sweats with the
hood up and a crisp white towel wrapped around his neck and
tucked into his sweat top. He's wearing black Chuck Taylors.
They've both got smooth running styles, though every twenty
yards or so Mr. Henry rolls his shoulders and gives a quick
flurry of punches. An older woman rides a bicycle across the
tracks. She's not pretty, but she's got a strong face.
Pioneer stock.

                         MR. HENRY
            Look at that woman. She's what?
            Fifty? Fifty-five? But she hasn't
            let herself go. I appreciate an
            older woman who has a commitment to
            her body.

                         ANTHONY
            So do I.

They watch her ride down the street.

                         MR. HENRY
            Tell me something. What the hell
            kind of name is Dignan?

                         ANTHONY
            I'm not really sure. I think it's
            Irish. Or maybe --

                         MR. HENRY
            I guess what I'm trying to say is
            what the hell kind of person is
            this Dignan?

                         ANTHONY
            What do you mean what kind of
            person? He's a good person.

                         MR. HENRY
            Sure, sure. He's a great person,
            and I'd call bullshit on anybody
            who said differently. But I wonder
            if the kid has the goods
                   (taps his temple)
            up here.
                         ANTHONY
                   (long pause)
            I don't think you're giving him
            enough credit. I know sometimes he
            doesn't think an idea through. He
            gets too excited. But --

                         MR. HENRY
            As far as I can tell he hasn't
            thought his life through. He'd be
            fine cutting my grass or parking my
            car. But business?
                   (looks at Anthony)
            You I can work with. You I could
            groom. Dignan's not going to make it.

Anthony stops running. Mr. Henry stops ahead of him and
looks back, jogging in place. Pause.

                         ANTHONY
            You're wrong about Dignan.

Mr. Henry stops jogging in place.

                         ANTHONY
            And you're wrong if you think, I'd
            turn my back on a friend.

                         MR. HENRY
            Hold it.

Mr. Henry walks to Anthony and puts his hand on his shoulder.
Anthony knocks it off.

                         MR. HENRY
            Anthony. I want.to say one thing to
            you.

Mr. Henry looks Anthony right in the eye.

                         MR. HENRY
            Congratulations. You passed the test.

                         ANTHONY
            What do you mean?

                         MR. HENRY
            The Abe Henry double-cross test.
            You just made a perfect score.

Anthony has to recover.

                         ANTHONY
            That was a test?

                         MR. HENRY
            Take a deep breath.

Anthony takes a deep breath. Mr. Henry massages Anthony's
shoulders. He takes Anthony's head in his arms and does a
quick pull to one side: cracks his neck. Then the other side.

                         MR. HENRY
            How does that feel?

                         ANTHONY
            It feels good.

Anthony rubs his hands on his neck and moves his head around.

                         ANTHONY
            Did Dignan take the test?

                         MR. HENRY
                   (pause)
            Yes, he did.

                         ANTHONY
            How'd he do?

They start jogging again.

                         MR. HENRY
            Well, he agreed 100% that Bob
            should be dropped. And he also
            agreed you were a liability. But he
            felt his talent would make up for
            your weaknesses.

                         ANTHONY
            That sounds like Dignan.

They veer away from the tracks, picking up the pace, and
head into a field toward Mr. Henry's warehouse.

EXT. ROOFTOP. NIGHT

They're having a party at Mr. Henry's warehouse. There are
tables and a BBQ on the roof, with white Christmas lights
strung up and music playing. Anthony, Dignan, Bob, Kumar,
and Mr. Henry are there. Plus a couple of young GIRLS,
eighteen or nineteen years old. Mr. Henry's got a name tag
that says, Hi, my name is Mr. Henry. Everyone's mingling on
the rooftop. Rowboat is at the grill. Applejack comes up the
stairs with a grocery bag under his arm.

                         MR. HENRY
            Woah. There he is. Applejack! What
            it is.

Mr. Henry and Applejack shake hands.

                         APPLEJACK
            Is my car OK out there?

                         MR. HENRY
            I love it. He always wants to know
            if the car's OK. Get a hot dog.

                         APPLEJACK
            I don't eat pork.

                         MR. HENRY
            Super K. Kumar. Come here.

Mr. Henry goes over to Kumar and throws his arm around him.

                         APPLEJACK
            I don't know why the fuck we're
            having a party. The damn job's not
            over yet.

                         DIGNAN
            Well, this isn't really a party per
            se.

                         APPLEJACK
            You don't celebrate til it's over.

                         DIGNAN
            True.

Dignan's solemn for a minute. He takes a bite of a hot dog.

                         APPLEJACK
            What the fuck are you doing?

Dignan hesitates. He takes the hot dog away from his mouth.
He's embarassed. Applejack shakes his head, disgusted. He
walks away.

                         ROWBOAT
            What was that all about?

                         DIGNAN
            Ramedan.

Anthony and Mr. Henry are standing together in a doorway. Mr.
Henry's got a martini.

                         MR. HENRY
            I'll tell you, Anthony. Times like
            this I get philosophical. What does
            it mean? What's it all about? Are
            you afraid to die?

                         ANTHONY
            Me?

                         MR. HENRY
            No, that door over there.

                         ANTHONY
            I don't want to die.

                         MR. HENRY
            Are you afraid?

                         ANTHONY
            Yeah. I mean, I don't think about
            it all the time. But once in awhile
            I kind of go, Woah. Man.

                         MR. HENRY
            Exactly. Woah.

                         ANTHONY
            Death.

                         MR. HENRY
            The fear of death, The pain of
            consciousness.
                   (taking a sip)
            Did you mix this martini?

                         ANTHONY
            No. Bob did.

                         MR. HENRY
            Bob. Bob. That's a palindrome.
                   (laughs uproariously)
            I love palindromes.

                         ANTHONY
            Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry?

                         MR. HENRY
                   (looks right at him)
            Anthony, I'm petrified.

Bob is talking to the other girl.

                         BOB
            Is that sugarless gum you're chewing?

                         GIRL 2
            I'm not chewing gum.

                         BOB
            Would you like a piece?

                         GIRL 2
                   (smiles brightly)
            Sure. Thanks.

Kumar and Applejack are sitting at a table.

                         KUMAR
            If someone could copy my life story.
            If I had someone, man, to just
            write what I talk. I have so many
            stories. Bestseller, man.

                         APPLEJACK
            I've been all over the Goddamn
            country. I've seen things.

                         KUMAR
            I used to go to Vegas and do
            headstands.

                         APPLEJACK
            No kidding.

                         KUMAR
            Easy.

Kumar does a handstand.

INT. WAREHOUSE. NIGHT

Anthony, Dignan, and Bob are sitting at the table in Mr.
Henry's office. Dignan's got plans and diagrams spread out.
There's music playing in the next room and we can hear
people talking outside the door.

                         DIGNAN
            Come on, Bob.

                         BOB
            I know it, man. Hang on.

                         DIGNAN
            Jesus Christ.

                         ANTHONY
            Give him a second.
                         BOB
            Hopscotch. The code name is
            hopscotch.

                         DIGNAN
            Good.

Mr. Henry looks in the door. He's got a glass of wine in one
hand and a bottle and empty glasses in the other.

                         MR. HENRY
            Join the party, fellas.

                         DIGNAN
            We're just going over a few things.

Mr. Henry looks at the plans on the table. He sets down the
three glasses and pours some wine.

                         MR. HENRY
            I'll tell you something, Dignan. It
            is possible to overplan. You don't
            want to turn the crew into robots.
            Right?

Dignan nods seriously.

                         MR. HENRY
            You got to have fun with it.
            There's no point if you're not
            having any fun. Would you like me
            to be there tomorrow?

                         DIGNAN
            Yes.

                         MR. HENRY
                   (immediately)
            Why?

                         DIGNAN
            Well, I think --

                         MR. HENRY
            No, if I go out on this job, then
            it's just another score by Mr.
            Henry. And I don't see it like that.
            This is your job. Your creation. I
            want you to try this.

They all try the wine. Mr. Henry watches their reactions.

                         ANTHONY
            This is good.

                         MR. HENRY
            I want to ask a favor, boys. One
            day, when I'm long gone and all but
            forgotten, make one last toast to
            Abe Henry. And remember me as a
            friend.

They drink.

EXT. ROOFTOP. NIGHT

Back on the roof. Bob and Dignan are sitting at a table with
one of the girls. Applejack is dancing with another. Kumar's
talking to Reudi. Anthony and Mr. Henry are standing at the
edge of the roof, looking out at the city. Mr. Henry's
smoking a joint.

                         MR. HENRY
            Well, that's just it, Anthony. A
            lot of criminals have problems.
            Some of them are alcoholics. Some
            have drug problems. Others dome
            from broken homes. I see a real
            need for healing.

Mr. Henry passes the joint to Anthony. Anthony smokes it.

                         MR. HENRY
            But you're thieves. It's what you
            are.

                         ANTHONY
            Yeah.

                         MR. HENRY
            It's an esoteric journey.

Anthony passes the joint back to Mr. Henry.

                         MR. HENRY
            We're renegades from despair.

                         ANTHONY
                   (nods)
            Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?

                         MR. HENRY
            Absolutely.

                         ANTHONY
            Why'd you want to help us?

                         MR. HENRY
                   (inhales, pause,
                   holding in smoke)
            Because I was like you once. And
            there was no one there to help me.

Mr. Henry exhales the smoke. He hands the joint to Anthony.
Anthony takes a hit. They stare out at the darkness.

INT. BOB'S HOUSE. NIGHT

Anthony and Dignan are sitting in the kitchen. Anthony's got
on a t-shirt and boxers. Dignan's wearing a bathrobe. All
the lights in the house are out except one in the kitchen.
Anthony's drinking a glass of milk. Dignan's got orange juice.

                         DIGNAN
            Next week we'll be drinking piña
            coladas.

                         ANTHONY
                   (nods)
            Hopefully this trip'll go a little
            smoother than the last one.

Dignan nods.

                         ANTHONY
            Or I might end up with a broken nose.

                         DIGNAN
            Did that hurt?

Anthony shrugs. There's a long silence.

                         DIGNAN
            This'll be a good trip.

Anthony nods. Pause. He smiles slightly.

                         ANTHONY
            I'll try not to hold you back
            tomorrow.

                         DIGNAN
            I don't think you will.

                         ANTHONY
            I don't want to be too much of a
            liability.

                         DIGNAN
            Look, you're going to do fine. It's
            OK to be scared.

                         ANTHONY
                   (laughs slightly,
                   shaking his head)
            I don't think I ever said this to
            you. But it meant a lot to me the
            way you were after that Swifty
            stuff happened.

Silence. Dignan's a little embarassed.

                         ANTHONY
            He was a nice guy.

                         DIGNAN
                   (shrugs)
            He was all right.

They both sit there for a minute. Quiet. Anthony sips his
milk.

                         ANTHONY
            Do you like Inez?

                         DIGNAN
            As a person?

                         ANTHONY
            Yeah. As a girl.

                         DIGNAN
            Yes. I do.

                         ANTHONY
            So do I.

Bob comes into the kitchen in his bathrobe looking haggard
yet wired. Anthony and Dignan look at him. He goes to the
refrigerator. He takes out a chocolate cake and a carton of
milk. He pours himself a glass of milk. He goes over to the
table with the cake and sits down. He cuts himself a piece
of cake. He swallows two pills, one at a time, each with a
long drink of milk. The pills are big capsules and he
struggles a little when he swallows.

                         ANTHONY
            You OK, Bob?

                         BOB
                   (snaps)
            No, I'm having a heart attack. Of
            course, I'm OK. What's that supposed
            to mean?

                         ANTHONY
                   (pause)
            Nothing. I was just asking.

                         DIGNAN
            Jesus, Bob.

Bob senses that's he's over-reacted. He backtracks.

                         BOB
            No, I know. I'm just saying. I feel
            fine. You want a piece of cake?

                         ANTHONY
                   (pause)
            Sure.

Bob starts to cut him a piece.

                         DIGNAN
            I'll take one of those, too, please.

EXT. HINCKLEY COLD STORAGE. DAY

Anthony is positioned behind some bushes, across from the
building. He's wearing a black parka. He looks through some
binoculars. Re pulls out his walkie talkie.

                         ANTHONY
            Bird Dog to Scarecrow. Bird Dog to
            Scarecrow.

                         DIGNAN (VO)
            Go ahead, Bird Dog.

                         ANTHONY
            You're all clear.

                         DIGNAN (VO)
            Roger.

                         ANTHONY
                   (pause)
            We all set?

                         DIGNAN (VO)
            Hang on a second.

Anthony waits a second.

We see Dignanr Applejack, and Kumar getting out of the car.

                         DIGNAN
                   (into walkie talkie)
            OK. Let's do it.

Dignan starts to move out. He remembers something. Says back
into his walkie talkie:

                         DIGNAN
            Let's get lucky, Bird Dog.

Dignan, Applejack, and Kumar start across the parking lot.
Dignan's got on a business suit. Applejack has on sunglasses.
Kumar is carrying a leather satchel.

They go in the side door and down a narrow passageway. They
get into the freight elevator and go up. Bob's voice comes
through on Dignan's walkie talkie.

                         BOB (VO)
            Scarecrow?

                         DIGNAN
            Yeah?

We see Bob: standing on the loading dock behind the building.
He's wearing an extremely heavy wool jumpsuit with a hood.

                         BOB
            Everything OK?

                         DIGNAN (VO)
            Yeah. We're in the elevator. How's
            it look back there?

                         BOB
            It looks pretty good. There's
            nobody back here.

                         DIGNAN
            Stand by. Bird Dog?

We see Anthony: still in the bushes.

                         ANTHONY
            Uh-huh?

                         DIGNAN (VO)
            Take your second position.

                         ANTHONY
            OK. Roger.

Anthony gets up and starts out across the parking lot, hands
in his pockets, not too quickly.

Dignan, Kumar, and Applejack get off the elevator.

                         DIGNAN
            OK. Six minutes.

Applejack goes one way down the hall. Dignan and Kumar go
the other. They turn the corner. They go down a wide
passageway.

                         KUMAR
            Where did he go?

                         DIGNAN
            Who? Applejack?

                         KUMAR
            Why did he go that way?
                   (points back down hall)


                         DIGNAN
            He's going to watch the back
            stairwell, remember?
                   (pause)
            Don't worry about it.

Dignan and Kumar come up to a door. Dignan slides a crowbar
out of his jacket. He snaps open the door. They go in. It's
a small office with a desk and a little safe in the corner.
Dignan clears everything off the desk with one quick sweep
of the arm. He puts down the briefcase and opens it up. It's
full of tools. Kumar unzips his satchel and takes out a roll
of tape. He immediately sets to work on the safe. Dignan
steps back out the door and closes it.

                         DIGNAN
                   (into walkie talkie)
            Bird dog? You in position?

We see Anthony on top of a fire escape, about four stories up.

                         ANTHONY
            I'm in position, Scarecrow.

                         DIGNAN (VO)
            Any activity?

                         ANTHONY
            Not at all. The place is totally
            deserted.

                         DIGNAN (VO)
            Good. It's supposed to be.

                         ANTHONY
            I've got a great view up here. I
            can see all the --

                         DIGNAN (VO)
            Stand by, Bird Dog.

We see Dignan standing in the hall, outside the office.

                         DIGNAN
            Jacknife. Come in, Jacknife.
                   (pause)
            Hello? Bob? Are you there?

We hear the sound of an elevator moving.

                         DIGNAN
                   (beat)
            Bob? What the fuck is going on?
            Anthony? Who's in the elevator?

We see Anthony on the fire escape.

                         ANTHONY
            I don't know.

                         DIGNAN (VO)
            Check the fucking elevator. It's
            moving.

Anthony goes in a little door. Down a passageway. Through a
freezer. Into a corridor. Past the freight elevator, which
is open on this floor. Then around a corner to a smaller
elevator as it opens: Bob's inside.

                         ANTHONY
            What are you doing?

                         BOB
            My walkie talkie's busted. 1 can't
            tell what's going on.

                         ANTHONY
            Let me see it.
                   (fiddling with it)
            Did you drop it?

                         BOB
            No.

Dignan's still standing in the hall as Anthony and Bob come
around the corner. Dignan yells at them down the hall.

                         DIGNAN
            What's happening? What's going on?

                         ANTHONY
            It was Bob. His walkie talkie's
            busted.

                         BOB
            I couldn't hear anything.

                         DIGNAN
            Who's watching the door? What the
            fuck are you doing? Get back in
            position.

The elevator starts whirring again.

                         DIGNAN
            Who did that? What the fuck is that?

                         ANTHONY
            It's going back down.

                         DIGNAN
                   (pannicking, into
                   walkie talkie)
            Applejack! What's happening?

                         APPLEJACK (VO)
            What?

                         DIGNAN
            Bob! Get back in position!

For just a second we hear the sound of music playing.
Everyone freezes. FOUR GUYS, two of them in jumpsuits like
Bob's, step out into the corridor. They've got bags from
Jack in the Box. They're drinking drinks and shakes. One of
them is holding a jam box. They stop. Dignan pulls out his
gun.

                         DIGNAN
            Don't move! Get up against the wall!

Anthony and Bob pull out their guns and hold them on the
four guys.

                         DIGNAN
                   (into walkie talkie)
            They're back! Get down here!
                   (not into walkie talkie)
            What are you doing here?

                         GUY IN JUMPSUIT
            We work here.

                         DIGNAN
            Time!

                         ANTHONY
                   (checks watch)
            Two minutes.

Simultaneously: Kumar opens the door. Applejack comes
running down the hall with his gun out.

                         APPLEJACK
            Where'd they come from?

                         ANTHONY
            The front stairs.

                         APPLEJACK
                   (to Bob)
            Where were you?

                         BOB
            My walkie talkie broke.

Applejack reaches in his pocket and pulls out a dark blue
nylon stocking. He pulls it over his head. Dignan, Anthony,
and Bob immediately do the same. Anthony's is red.

Dignan steps into the office with Kumar.

                         DIGNAN
            What's the story?

                         KUMAR
            Can't get it. It won't...
                   (make s gesture)


                         DIGNAN
            What can we do?

Kumar looks at his tools. Moves them around on the desk.

                         DIGNAN
            OK. Fuck it.

He goes back into the hall.

                         DIGNAN
            Let's go. Fuck it.

TWO GUYS with a cart stop at the end of the corridor.

                         ANTHONY
            Freeze!

                         DIGNAN
            Nobody move!

                         ANTHONY
            Get against the wall!

Bob's gun goes off. Everybody looks at him. Dead silence.
Bob looks around like it must have been somebody else's gun
that went off.

                         ANTHONY
            Jesus, Bob.

                         BOB
            I didn't do anything.

Applejack falls to his knees. He drops his gun.

                         ANTHONY
            Applejack? Are you OK?

Applejack clutches his arm and rolls onto his side.

                         DIGNAN
                   (shouting)
            What's wrong with Applejack?

                         BOB
            He's having a heart attack or
            something.

                         DIGNAN
                   (screaming)
            Let's go!

Dignan throws down his smoke cannister. Bob and Anthony
automatically throw down theirs. Smoke instantly fills the
hall.

The hostages stand completely clear of the smoke. They watch
Anthony, Dignan, and Bob rush around blindly in the haze.

                         DIGNAN
            Help me move him.

                         ANTHONY
            Careful. Check his pulse.

Anthony holds all the guys at gunpoint. Dignan and Bob carry
Applejack down the hall, into the elevator.
                         DIGNAN
            Is he breathing?

                         BOB
            I think so.

An alarm starts ringing.

                         DIGNAN
            Jesus Christ.  What the fuck is that?

                         BOB
            I didn't think there was an alarm.

                         DIGNAN
            Take him to the car, Bob.

Dignan runs back down the hall to Anthony.

                         DIGNAN
            Who tripped the alarm?

                         ANTHONY
            It's the fire alarm.  Somebody
            pulled the fire alarm.

                         DIGNAN
            Where's Kumar?

                         ANTHONY
                   (looking around)
            I don't know.

                         DIGNAN
            Jesus Christ, Anthony.  Did you
            lose him?

                         GUY ON FLOOR
            He's in the freezer.

                         DIGNAN
            What?

                         GUY ON FLOOR
            He went in there.

                         ANTHONY
            What for?

The guy on the floor kind of shrugs.  Anthony crosses the
hall. He pulls open one of the big freezer doors. Kumar is
standing there with his bag and the briefcase.  You can see
his breath in the air.

                         ANTHONY
            What are you doing?

                         DIGNAN
            Let's go. Come on.

They go down the hall to the freight elevator.  They start
down.

                         ANTHONY
            What were you doing in there?

Kumar shakes his head and shrugs his shoulders.

EXT. HINCKLEY COLD STORAGE. DAY

They go out the front door, across the parking lot. Kumar's
lagging behind.

                         ANTHONY
            Wait for Kumar.

                         DIGNAN
            Come on, Kumar.

They come up to the car. Anthony tries the door. It's locked.
Bob comes running around the side of the building.

                         BOB
            The elevator broke.

                         DIGNAN
            Where's Applejack?

                         BOB
            He's stuck between two floors.

                         ANTHONY
            You're kidding.

                         DIGNAN
            Applejack's stuck in the elevator?

                         BOB
            Yeah.

                         ANTHONY
            Who's got the car keys?

Everyone looks at everyone else.

                         BOB
            Applejack drove.

                         DIGNAN
                   (pause)
            Run. Run. Let's go.

Bob takes off at a sprint. Kumar follows him.

                         ANTHONY
            Jesus, Dignan.

Anthony pulls off the red stocking and throws it down. He
tries the other doors on the car.

                         ANTHONY
            What the fuck happened to the the
            plan?

Dignan pulls off his stocking. Anthony starts walking fast
across the parking lot. Dignan stands still by the car.
Staring straight ahead.

                         ANTHONY
            Come on.

                         DIGNAN
            I'll see you there.

                         ANTHONY
            What?

                         DIGNAN
            I'll see you there.

                         ANTHONY
            What are you talking about?

                         DIGNAN
            I'll get him.

                         ANTHONY
            There's not enough time.

                         DIGNAN
            Yes, there is. Let's get organized.

Dignan starts toward the building. Anthony moves after him.

                         ANTHONY
            Dignan, it's too late.

                         DIGNAN
            I don't think so.

Dignan and Anthony look at each other for an instant. Dignan
turns and sprints back into the building.

Anthony stands alone in the parking lot.

                                            CUT TO:

a bedroom with big French windows. No furniture.

                                            CUT TO:

a wood-panelled study. Stripped bare.

                                            CUT TO:

an elegant dining room. Cleaned out.

EXT. BOB'S HOUSE. DAY

A GUY in a moving company uniform carries a Louis XIV chair
out the front door of Bob's house, down the path to the
street. Two other MOVERS pass him on the way. They've got a
dolly.

The guy carries the chair into a huge moving van. It's full
of furniture and paintings.

Mr. Henry and Rowboat are standing in the street. Rowboat's
smoking a cigarette, writing on clipboard. Hector stands
behind them in the grass. Mr. Henry takes out two cigars. He
holds one out to Rowboat. Rowboat shakes his head. Mr. Henry
shrugs and lights one for himself.

                         MR. HENRY
            You know, Rowboat. People who smoke
            cigarettes die. People who smoke
            cigars just keep on going.

Rowboat nods, smoking. Mr. Henry looks at Hector. He points.

                         MR. HENRY
            Sit.

Hector sits. Mr. Henry smiles a broad smile. The movers go
buy with a beautiful Moroccan divan.

EXT. HINCKLEY COLD STORAGE. DAY

Dignan comes out the front door pulling Applejack, semi-
conscious, to the car. Dignan loans Applejack against the
door. He checks Applejack's pockets for the keys. He looks
around on the ground.

He hears sirens in the distance. He looks across the parking
lot. Two squad cars screech in off the street.

Dignan takes off into the building.

INT. HINCKLEY COLD STORAGE. DAY

Dignan sprints down the corridor. Races up the stairs. Runs
down hall after hall.

Two COPS appear out of the elevator.

                         COP
            Freeze!

Dignan ducks into a stairwell. He runs down the stairs and
into another corridor. He can hear cops yelling from two
different directions. He crosses a catwalk. Cuts through an
office. Pulls open a door and goes into one of the freezer
rooms.

Cops come yelling down the hallway. Dignan runs through the
freezer room and tries the other door. It's stuck. Three
COPS come inside. Dignan instantly puts his hands up in the
air.

                         COP #1
            Drop the fucking gun!

                         COP #2
            Don't move!

Dignan drops the gun. The cops rush him. They nail him into
the wall. Get him in a headlock, pulling hard.

                         COP #3
            You're caught, buddy.

They pull him into the hallway.

                         COP #1
            Put your hands behind your back.

                         DIGNAN
            I'm not going to do anything.

                         COP #3
                   (squeezing his neck)
            Why'd you try to run, buddy? Don't
            you know what freeze means? Don't
            you speak fucking English?

                         COP #1
            Take it easy.

They put him face down on the floor and cuff him.

                         COP #1
                   (to Dignan)
            Calm down.

They move him down the corridor. Dignan's nose is bleeding.
He looks terrified.

Applejack is sitting propped up against the wall. He's got
an oxygen mask on his face and a team of paramedics and cops
around him. Somebody's taking his blood pressure. Another
one's giving him an IV.

                                            CUT TO:

Anthony running down a sidewalk. He drops his gun in a
trashcan without slowing down. He crosses a bridge and runs
into the the trees.

                                            BLACKOUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. COUNTY JAIL. DAY

There's snow in the air. The prison yard is wide with dry
grass and concrete. It's split up by chain link fences.
Guards sit in the towers.

Dignan's wearing an inmate jumpsuit. Anthony and Bob walk
with him across the yard. They've brought along two bags of
food from a hamburger place.

                         DIGNAN
            I said to the DA, That cop who hit
            me must of given me CRS disease.

                         BOB
            What's that?

                         DIGNAN
            That's just what the DA asked. CRS
            is a disease where you can't
            remember shit.

Dignan smiles.

                         ANTHONY
            Like amnesia.

                         DIGNAN
            Can't remember shit. CRS.

                         BOB
            Oh.

Anthony kind of smiles.

                         DIGNAN
            Tell Mr. Henry I said that.

Anthony nods. Silence. They walk past a bunch of guys
lifting weights on the other side of a fence.

                         DIGNAN
            So is Mr. Henry going to come by
            and see me or anything?

                         ANTHONY
                   (pause)
            I don't think so. I mean. Actually,
            he robbed Bob's house.

                         DIGNAN
            He did?

                         ANTHONY
            Yeah.

                         DIGNAN
            You got to be kidding me.

                         ANTHONY
            I'm not kidding.

                         DIGNAN
                   (pause)
            What'd he get?

                         ANTHONY
            Pretty much everything.

                         DIGNAN
            The grandfather clock?

                         BOB
            He got everything.

Dignan nods. Pause.

                         DIGNAN
            Wow.
                   (pause, looks at Bob)
            Sorry, Bob.

Bob shrugs, looking at the ground. Dignan looks to Anthony.

                         DIGNAN
            You think Applejack knew?

                         ANTHONY
                   (shrugs)
            We haven't heard from Applejack
            since he got out of the hospital.
            His case got dismissed.

Dignan's stunned to hear this.

                         DIGNAN
            Why?

                         ANTHONY
            We're not sure.

                         BOB
            We think Mr. Henry maybe --

                         ANTHONY
            His health isn't very good, you
            know. They take that into account.

Pause. Dignan nods.

                         DIGNAN
            No. That's true.

Long silence.

                         ANTHONY
            Mr. Henry never gave you a test,
            did he?

                         DIGNAN
            What do you mean?

                         ANTHONY
            Nothing.

                                            CUT TO:

a picnic table in the prison yard. There's frost on the
ground. They're eating lunch.

                         DIGNAN
            You're living on a sailboat?

                         ANTHONY
                   (nods)
            It belongs to Bob's uncle.

                         DIGNAN
            How big is it?
                         ANTHONY
            Oh, I'd say about --

                         BOB
            It's in the driveway.

                         ANTHONY
                   (pause)
            Temporarily.

                         DIGNAN
            Where?

                         ANTHONY
            Behind Bob's house.

Long pause.

                         DIGNAN
            Does it float?

                         ANTHONY
            We're not sure yet. It's going to
            need some repairs.

Dignan nods.

                         ANTHONY
            So how is it in there?
                   (pointing at cell block)


                         DIGNAN
                   (shrugs)
            What can I say? It's jail. You
            don't sleep when you want to. You
            don't eat when you want to.

                         BOB
            Do you have your own room?

                         DIGNAN
            We don't have rooms, Bob. We have
            cells.

                         BOB
            Do you have your own cell?

                         DIGNAN
            No. I have a cellmate. His name's
            Carl.

                         ANTHONY
            What's he in for?

                         DIGNAN
            He stole a tractor.

                         BOB
            Do they let you --

                         DIGNAN
            I don't really want to talk about
            it, Bob.

Long pause.

Anthony takes a sip from a milkshake. Dignan unwraps the
foil from a cheeseburger. He takes a bite.

                         DIGNAN
                   (with his mouth full
                   of food)
            This sure beats the shit out of the
            shit they crap out in this joint.

Anthony and Bob laugh. Dignan takes another huge bite.

                         DIGNAN
                   (smiling)
            I might have to have another one of
            these.

                                            CUT TO:

Dignan in handcuffs behind a chain link fence. He's standing
in line with some other inmates.

                         DIGNAN
            Thanks for coming.

Anthony nods. They stand there in silence. The line moves
forward a few steps. Anthony and Bob walk with Dignan on the
other side of the fence. The line stops. Pause.

Dignan leans toward the fence.

                         DIGNAN
            Hey.

He motions for them to come closer to the fence. He whispers:

                         DIGNAN
            I think I may have found a way out
            of here.

                         ANTHONY
                   (pause)
            You're kidding.

                         DIGNAN
            No. I'm not.

                         ANTHONY
            How?

                         DIGNAN
            Shhh. Wait for my instructions.

                         ANTHONY
            Dignan, I --

The line starts moving. Anthony and Bob walk with Dignan on
the other side of the fence.

                         DIGNAN
            When we go through the next gate
            you'll have 30 seconds to take out
            the tower guard.

                         ANTHONY
            What?

                         DIGNAN
            Have the car running at the north-
            west checkpoint. Bob and I'll --

                         ANTHONY
            Dignan, I --

The line starts moving faster.

                         DIGNAN
            Scale the barricade and tunnel
            through no man's land. And Bob.
            Remember:

                         ANTHONY
            Scale the --

                         DIGNAN
            Shield me from the bullets. They
            won't shoot civilians. Ready?

                         BOB
            Hold on --

                         DIGNAN
            Here we go.

                         BOB
            Wait a second --

                         DIGNAN
            Now!

Anthony and Bob look all around in a panic. They look to
Dignan.

Dignan shuffles along with the rest of the inmates. He looks
at Anthony and Bob. He smiles. He shrugs.

                         DIGNAN
            So long.

Bob and Anthony slowly half-smile. They wave to Dignan as
the line of inmates turns away. Anthony looks to Bob. Bob
smiles.

The line of inmates stops about fifty feet away. Dignan
looks back. Anthony looks at him. Dignan's expression has
changed. He wasn't expecting them to see it. His eyes look
cold. Anthony puts his hand on the fence. Dignan turns and
the line of inmates disappears into the cell block.

Anthony stands there in silence.. He lets go of the fence.

He walks with Bob down the long path in the cold air.

                                            FADE OUT.

                                   Larry & Andy Wachowski



               FADE IN:

               Inside a closet.

               It is a large closet with double doors, a crisp line of light 
               cutting down through the center of the darkness.

               As we begin to descend, voices echo in our head.

                                     VIOLET (V.O.)
                         I had this image of you, inside of 
                         me, like a part of me.

               We move past a shelf filled with hatboxes and handbags.  It 
               is a woman's closet.

                                     CORKY (V.O.)
                         You planned this whole thing, didn't 
                         you?

                                     CAESAR (V.O.)
                         Where's the fucking money?

               We glide over the tightly packed hangers, close enough to 
               feel the different fabrics and descend past the dresses to 
               the racks of high heels.

                                     VIOLET (V.O.)
                         We make our own choices, we pay our 
                         own prices.

                                     CAESAR (V.O.)
                         All part of the business.

                                     VIOLET (V.O.)
                         All part of the business.

                                     CORKY (V.O.)
                         What choice?

               We slide along the delicate taper of a stiletto heel and 
               reach the bottom of the closet, where we find a pair of black 
               Dr. Martens boots that are tied together with a white rope.

                                     VIOLET (V.O.)
                         I want out.

               We move up the boots and we see it is a woman who is bound, 
               lying motionless on the floor of the closet, the rope coiling 
               tightly around her wrists.

               The crack at the bottom of the door lights her face.  She is 
               gagged and unconscious, a trickle of blood running down her 
               forehead.  Her name is CORKY.

                                     VIOLET (V.O.)
                         Like a part of me.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT.  ELEVATOR - DAY

               Leaning against the back of the elevator is Corky, a very 
               butch-looking woman with short hair and a black leather 
               jacket.  She is a lesbian and wants people to know it.

               As the doors begin to slide shut, a woman yells.

                                     WOMAN
                         Wait!  Hold the elevator.

               Corky pushes the "open" button.  A couple steps into the 
               elevator.  His name is CAESAR, a middle-aged Italian, wearing 
               an expensive suit and sunglasses.

               She is VIOLET; a piece of sexual candy that would melt in 
               your mouth.

               She hears it again, a guttural sound.

                                     CORKY
                         Thanks again for this opportunity, 
                         Mr. Bianchinni.  Goodbye.

               She hangs up the phone and walks toward the wall.

               As she gets closer, we hear a bed rocking, tapping against 
               the wall.

               The man's breathing grows more and more labored until finally 
               it swells --

                                                           DISSOLVING INTO:

               INT.  BATHROOM - MORNING

               The whining motor of a high-powered drain-rod.

               The spiral cable whips wildly, spiraling deeper into the tub 
               drain, black goo splattering everywhere.

               The machine is so loud Corky almost cannot hear someone 
               pounding on the apartment door.

               Killing the motor, she stands and goes to the door.

               Behind the door is Violet, wearing jeans, a white T-shirt 
               and cowboy boots.

                                     VIOLET
                         Hi.  My name is Violet.  We sort of 
                         met in the elevator --

                                     CORKY
                         Yeah, sure.  I'm Corky.

                                     VIOLET
                         I heard you working in here and I 
                         just wondered if you'd like a cup of 
                         coffee?

               She is holding two cups of coffee: one black, one with cream.

                                     CORKY
                         Sure.  Come on in.  Give me a minute.

               Violet steps inside as Corky goes back to the bathroom to 
               wash off the drain dreck.

                                     VIOLET
                         What happened to Rajeev?

               Corky calls from the bathroom, scrubbing her hands vigorously.

                                     CORKY
                         Who?

                                     VIOLET
                         Rajeev, the man who usually works on 
                         the building.

                                     CORKY
                         Oh, he went home to India, but as 
                         far as I know he'll be back.

               She wipes her hands on her overalls, returning to the main 
               room.

                                     VIOLET
                         So this is temporary for you?

                                     CORKY
                         Pretty much.  One day at a time.

               Violet hands her the cup of black coffee.

                                     VIOLET
                         I guessed you were straight black.

                                     CORKY
                         Good guess.

               They both sip from the piping hot mugs.

                                     CORKY
                         Mmmm ...  thanks, I needed this.

                                     VIOLET
                         My pleasure ...  but to be honest, I 
                         did have a slightly ulterior motive 
                         here.  I was wondering if I could 
                         ask a small favor?

                                     CORKY
                         A favor?

                                     VIOLET
                         Yeah, see, I'm kind of a night person, 
                         so I was wondering if it wasn't a 
                         terrible inconvenience if you could 
                         wait a bit before using power tools.

                                     CORKY
                         Oh, I'm sorry --

                                     VIOLET
                         No, it isn't your fault.  The walls 
                         here are just so thin.

                                     CORKY
                         Are they really?

                                     VIOLET
                         Yes, it really causes problems.  
                         Sometimes it's like you're in the 
                         same room.  But if it's too much 
                         trouble, I understand ...

                                     CORKY
                         No, no trouble.  There's other work 
                         to do.

                                     VIOLET
                         You're doing everything yourself?

                                     CORKY
                         Yeah.

                                     VIOLET
                         That is so amazing.  I'm in awe of 
                         people who can fix things.  My dad 
                         was like that.  We never had anything 
                         new.  Whenever something broke he 
                         would open it up, tinker with it and 
                         it would work.  His hands were magic.

               She looks at Corky's hands cupped around the mug.

                                     VIOLET
                         Yeah ...  I bet your car is twenty 
                         years old.

               Corky smiles.

                                     CORKY
                         Truck.

                                     VIOLET
                         Truck.  Of course.

                                     CORKY
                         '63 Chevy.

                                     VIOLET
                         I knew it.

               VIOLET SIPS

                                     VIOLET
                         So, how do you know the owner, Mr. 
                         Bianchinni?

                                     CORKY
                         I don't, really.  I was referred to 
                         him.

                                     VIOLET
                         Oh, really.

               Corky suddenly feels she has revealed something.

                                     CORKY
                         Do you know him?

                                     VIOLET
                         No, but Caesar does.  He likes him.  
                         Says he's a good Italian.

                                     CORKY
                         Caesar is your husband?

                                     VIOLET
                         Oh no, no.  I'm not the marrying 
                         kind.

               Smiling, she says nothing else.

                                     VIOLET
                         I should be going.  You can drop the 
                         cup off anytime.

                                     CORKY
                         Thanks.

                                     VIOLET
                         My pleasure.

               CORKY watches her leave.

               EXT.  THE WATERING HOLE - NIGHT

               A dirty bar hidden away on a dark street, its cracked, moon-
               white sign the only evidence it exists.

               Corky's truck swings into a space in front of a couple of 
               large motorcycles.  She flips her collar and heads for the 
               door.

               INT.  THE WATERING HOLE - NIGHT

               The smell of leather and cigarette smoke fills Corky's nose 
               as she crosses to the bar.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Well, well ...

               Corky sits as the fat bartender waddles over.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Been awhile, Cork.

                                     CORKY
                         Five years, two months, sixteen days.  
                         How you doing, Sue?

               Corky puts a cigarette in her mouth and lights it.

                                     SUE
                         Like shit.  Now that we're all caught 
                         up, how about a drink?

               Sue opens the refrigerator and pulls out two Old Styles.

                                     CORKY
                         Thanks.

               They click the bottles together and drink.

                                     SUE
                         You got a job yet?

                                     CORKY
                         Yeah.  Some plumbing, painting and 
                         shit.

               Sue laughs.

                                     SUE
                         I mean a J-O-B.  A real job.

                                     CORKY
                         Not for me, Sue.  I'm straight and 
                         narrow.  I'm just here to get laid 
                         or drunk and hopefully both.

               Corky gets off the stool.

                                     CORKY
                         Thanks for the beer.

               Looking around, she sees a woman alone at one of the back 
               tables.  Through the smoky din, she bears a slight resemblance 
               to Violet.

               The woman is dressed all in black, including a leather jacket.

               Smiling, Corky slides into the chair beside her.  There is 
               no one smoother.

                                     CORKY
                         Hi.

                                     WOMAN
                         Hello.

                                     CORKY
                         You know ...  that outfit would look 
                         great on my bedroom floor.

               The woman smiles just as someone taps Corky on the shoulder.

               She turns and is face-to-face with a large bull of a woman 
               in a heavy leather Chicago Police jacket.  She is more wide 
               than fat.

                                     WOMAN COP
                         Hey, Jesse.  What's happening here?

                                     CORKY
                         Nothing ...  yet.

                                     WOMAN COP
                         Who's this?

               Her coat opens as she puts her hands on her hips.  A service 
               revolver is clipped to her belt.

               She squints at Corky, her head nodding in recognition.

                                     WOMAN COP
                         Wait, I know you.

                                     CORKY
                         I don't think so.

                                     WOMAN COP
                         I didn't know you were out.

               Corky smiles at the woman in black.

                                     CORKY
                         When you get tired of Cagney and 
                         Lacey, come find me.

               She heads for the exit.

               EXT.  CITY STREET - NIGHT 

               The neighborhood would be politely described as "rough." 
               Corky's truck does not stand out parked alone on the littered 
               street.

               INT.  CORKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               It is a hole but it is home.

               Corky is lying on her futon staring up at the ceiling, a 
               beer resting on her stomach; a folk singer quietly croons 
               from the radio.

               We see the ceiling, a circle of light hovering over the small 
               desk lamp.  We move in on the spot, which slowly fills up 
               the screen until there is nothing but the white light.

               Suddenly a wet paint roller loaded with white paint cuts a 
               swath across the ceiling.

               MATCH CUT TO:

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - DAY  

               Corky is painting the ceiling.  The folk ballad has become 
               an angry Riot Grrrl anthem.

               She is working hard, the roller sucking back and forth.  
               Sweat covers her face.

               Dropping the roller down, she reloads it in the tray when 
               the phone rings.  She stops and answers it.

                                     CORKY
                         Hello?  Oh, hi, Mr. Bianchinni ...  
                         yes, everything is going fine.  I 
                         got the tub drain all cleaned out.

               She listens for a moment.

                                     CORKY
                         What apartment?

               She glances at the main wall.

                                     CORKY
                         All right, all right, I guess I could 
                         take a look.  Yeah, you're welcome, 
                         goodbye.

               She hangs up and looks again at the wall, feeling...  curious.

               INT.  HALL - NIGHT

               Corky knocks and after a moment Violet opens the door.  She 
               seems surprised.

                                     VIOLET
                         Oh no.  Shit.  I didn't know he would 
                         call you.  God, you must think |I'm 
                         a total nuisance.

                                     CORKY
                         Not exactly.

                                     VIOLET
                         I'm sorry, I usually would call 
                         Rajeev, but I didn't know what to do 
                         so I called Mr. Bianchinni.

                                     CORKY
                         He said you lost something.

                                     VIOLET
                         Yeah, come on in.

               She steps back and Corky walks inside.

               INT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Violet leads her through the apartment.  It is expensively 
               furnished with very masculine tastes; a lot of gray and black 
               leather.

                                     VIOLET
                         I was doing some dishes and just as 
                         I pulled the stopper my earring fell 
                         in.

               Corky looks at her blankly.

                                     VIOLET
                         It's one of my favorites.  That's 
                         why I got upset.  I know it probably 
                         seems ridiculous to you.

               An eyebrow goes up.

                                     VIOLET
                         I'm sorry, look, forget it.  I 
                         shouldn't have called...

                                     CORKY
                         I told Bianchinni I would take a 
                         look.  Is it that sink?

               Violet nods.

               She opens the sink cabinet and pulls out a pair of channel 
               locks from her back pocket.  The teeth of the channel locks 
               open and bite onto the pressure nut.

                                     CORKY
                         Do you have a pot or a bucket?

                                     VIOLET
                         Sure.

               She hands one down to her.  Corky slides it under the curved 
               pipe.

               As she works, Corky feels herself staring at Violet, at the 
               hem of her dress curving tightly around her thighs.

               Water begins to trickle into the pan.

               The nut slides loose and Corky tips the trap.  Water splashes 
               into the pan with a soft metal "tink."

                                     VIOLET
                         Did you find it?

               Corky fishes into gray water and pulls out the earring.

               Violet screams, a huge smile on her face, half-falling as 
               she tries to hug Corky.

                                     VIOLET
                         I can't believe it!  You did it!

               Corky leans back under and replaces the trap.

                                     VIOLET
                         Thank you so much.  You have to let 
                         me pay you something --

                                     CORKY
                         No.  Mr. Bianchinni asked me to do 
                         it.  I did it.

               Corky checks the drain by running the water.

                                     VIOLET
                         If you won't take money, how about a 
                         drink?  It's getting late.  You can't 
                         work all night.

               Corky eyes her for a moment.

                                     CORKY
                         Okay, one drink.

                                     VIOLET
                         What do you want?

                                     CORKY
                         A beer?

                                     VIOLET
                         A beer.  Of course.

               She smiles and turns to the bar.

                                     VIOLET
                         Sit down.

               Corky sits on the black leather couch and Violet returns 
               with two bottles of Heineken.  Corky sneers.

                                     VIOLET
                         Thanks again.

               They clink the bottles and swig.

                                     VIOLET
                         You seem uncomfortable.  Do I make 
                         you nervous, Corky?

                                     CORKY
                         No.

               She looks at Violet, then takes another long pull on the 
               bottle.

                                     VIOLET
                         Thirsty, maybe.

               Violet smiles, her eyes again talking for her.

                                     CORKY
                         Curious, maybe.

                                     VIOLET
                         Curious?  That's funny, I'm feeling 
                         a bit curious myself right now.

               Violet notices the tattoo on Corky's arm.

                                     VIOLET
                         That's a great tattoo.

               She reaches over and touches it.

                                     VIOLET
                         Beautiful labrys.

               Corky is a bit suprised that she knows what it is.  She nods, 
               rubbing it as if trying to hide it.

                                     VIOLET
                         Are you surprised that I know what 
                         it is?

                                     CORKY
                         Maybe.

                                     VIOLET
                         I have a tattoo, would you like to 
                         see it?

               She moves closer, sliding over the leather cushions as she 
               opens the front of her dress.

                                     VIOLET
                         A woman in upstate New York did it 
                         for me.

               She is not wearing a bra.

                                     VIOLET
                         Here.  Do you like it?

               Set against the soft white skin of her breast is a bright 
               green-stemmed violet.

                                     VIOLET
                         It took her all day to do it.  She 
                         promised me it wouldn't hurt, but it 
                         was sore for a long time after.  I 
                         couldn't even touch it.

               Corky looks up from Violet's breast to her dark eyes.

                                     VIOLET
                         But now I love the way it feels.

               She runs her fingers softly over the slightly scarred skin.

                                     VIOLET
                         Here, touch it.

               Corky feels the blood pounding in her ears as Violet takes 
               her hand and places it on her breast.

                                     CORKY
                         What are you doing?

               Violet looks at her.

                                     VIOLET
                         Isn't it obvious?  I'm trying to 
                         seduce you.

                                     CORKY
                         Why?

                                     VIOLET
                         Because I want to.  I've wanted to 
                         since I first saw you in the elevator.

               Corky watches her, trying to figure her out even as her thumb 
               presses into Violet's nipple.

               Inhaling sharply, Violet closes her eyes; she can feel Corky 
               staring at her.

                                     VIOLET
                         You don't believe me.  But I can 
                         prove it to you.

               She takes Corky's wrist and begins pulling her hand down her 
               body.

                                     VIOLET
                         You can't believe me because of what 
                         you see ...

               She forces Corky's hand between her legs, up under her dress.

                                     VIOLET
                         But you can believe what you feel.

               Violet opens her eyes, a wanton smile on her lips.

                                     VIOLET
                         You see ...  I've been thinking about 
                         you all day.

               Corky's forearm flexes and Violet moans.

               With both hands, Violet takes hold of Corky's forearm.

                                     CORKY
                         You planned this whole thing?

               Violet's head swims; she is unable to breathe.

                                     CORKY
                         You dropped that earring down the 
                         drain on purpose, didn't you?

                                     VIOLET
                         If I say yes, will you take your 
                         hand away?

                                     CORKY
                         No.

                                     VIOLET
                         ...  yes.

               Now it is Corky who smiles.

               Violet shivers, her thighs rubbing, her hips thrusting against 
               Corky's hand.

                                     VIOLET
                         Please, Corky ...  please ...

               Her eyes barely open.

                                     VIOLET
                         ...  kiss me.

               In a single motion, Corky takes hold of the back of her neck 
               and covers Violet's open mouth with her own.

               With her hand still stuffed between Violet's legs, Corky 
               lays her back onto the couch as the kiss becomes more --

               More desperate, more hungry until --

               We hear the front door unlock and open.

                                     CAESAR
                         Violet?

               Violet's eyes pop open and she pushes Corky back.

                                     CAESAR
                         Violet, you home?

               They scramble to compose themselves.

                                     VIOLET
                         Yeah.  In here, C.

               He comes around the corner and in the dim light sees the two 
               figures sitting close on the couch.

                                     CAESAR
                         What's this?

               He mistakes Corky for a man.

                                     CAESAR
                         What the fuck is this?

               Violet stands as Caesar barrels toward the couch.

                                     VIOLET
                         I didn't expect --

                                     CAESAR
                         What the fuck is going on?

               Corky stands and turns, Caesar suddenly realizing that she 
               is a woman.

                                     CAESAR
                         Oh, shit ...

                                     VIOLET
                         Caesar, this is Corky.  Corky, Caesar.

                                     CAESAR
                         I'm sorry, Christ, I thought ...  
                         it's fucking dark in here.

               He reaches to the wall for the lights.

                                     VIOLET
                         She is working for Bianchinni.

               Caesar extends his hand.

                                     CAESAR
                         Oh, right, right.  Don mentioned 
                         that to me.  Hi, welcome to the 
                         family.

               Corky shakes his hand.

                                     CAESAR
                         You're helping Rajeev?

                                     CORKY
                         No.  Rajeev's in India.

                                     VIOLET
                         She's doing the work herself.

                                     CAESAR
                         No shit.  Bianchinni hired you?  You 
                         know he's a good friend of mine.  
                         |Family, really.

                                     CORKY
                         That's what Violet said.

               He looks at her as if he knows something.

                                     CAESAR
                         So, you just got out?

                                     VIOLET
                         Jesus, Caesar!

                                     CAESAR
                         What?  It ain't no big fuckin' deal.  
                         I know who Don hires.  Did you know 
                         he did time himself?

               Corky shakes her head.

                                     CAESAR
                         Thirteen fucking years.  See, there 
                         ain't no secrets here.

               Corky doesn't like this man.

                                     CAESAR
                         How many'd you do?

                                     CORKY
                         Five.

               He whistles.

                                     CAESAR
                         Not bad.  What for?

                                     VIOLET
                         That's none of your goddamn business, 
                         Caesar.

                                     CAESAR
                         You're right.  You don't have to 
                         tell me, if you don't want to.  I 
                         just hope you understand you're among 
                         good people here.

               He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a thick fold of 
               money and peels several hundreds.  Corky stares at it.

                                     CAESAR
                         Come on, come on.  if you understand 
                         what I'm talking about you're going 
                         to take the money.  if you don't, 
                         I'm going to have to worry about 
                         you.

               Corky takes it.  Caesar smiles.

                                     CAESAR
                         Good.  I hate to worry.  I got ulcers.

                                     CORKY
                         I should be going.

                                     CAESAR
                         What?  How about a drink?

                                     CORKY
                         My brushes, I have to clean my 
                         brushes.  Thanks, though.

                                     CAESAR
                         Another time.

                                     CORKY
                         Sure.

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT 

               Close on the paintbrush, Corky's fingers pushing through and 
               separating the black bristles under the running water.

               When the brush is clean, she flicks it dry and resets the 
               edge.

               She goes to the sink to wash her hands when she stops, 
               noticing her left hand.

               It is the hand that was between Violet's legs.

               She is about to smell her finger when she sees herself in 
               the mirror.

                                     CORKY
                         What are you doing?

               She drops her hand.

                                     CORKY
                         What am I doing?  I'm fucking up, 
                         that's what I'm doing.

               She scrubs her hands clean.

               EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT 

               It is late, the area burnished with amber street light.  
               Corky walks from the building to her truck.

               She climbs inside and slides the key into the ignition, when 
               suddenly the passenger door opens and --

               Violet gets in.  Stunned, Corky stares at her.

                                     VIOLET
                         I had to see you.

                                     CORKY
                         Look, I don't think this is a good 
                         idea.

                                     VIOLET
                         I wanted to apologize.

                                     CORKY
                         Don't apologize, please.  I can't 
                         stand women who apologize for wanting 
                         sex.

               Violet smiles.

                                     VIOLET
                         I'm not apologizing for what I did --

               She slides across the seat.

                                     VIOLET
                         I'm apologizing for what I didn't 
                         do.

               She kisses Corky, and if Corky is trying to resist, we can't 
               tell.

               The windshield is beginning to steam when Violet, panting, 
               breaks the kiss.

                                     VIOLET
                         Do you have a bed somewhere?

               Unable to speak, Corky reaches over and starts the engine.

               INT.  CORKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               The sex.

               There is nothing flower-scented or out-of-focus about it.

               It is sweaty, slippery, body-grinding, bed-squeaking lesbian 
               sex --

               Pungent and potent --

               And when it is over, neither woman can move.

               Finally, Corky's eyes flutter open.

                                     CORKY
                         I can see again.

               Violet smiles.

               Slowly, Corky gets up and goes to the fridge.  She grabs a 
               beer and presses it to her sweating forebead.

               After a moment, she lowers it, gently pressing the cold can 
               elsewhere.  Eyes closed, she lets out a long "Ahh."

               Violet hears the sizzle-pop of the beer as Corky returns to 
               the bed.

               She holds the beer to Violet's lips and tilts the can, 
               watching Violet's throat as she drinks.

               Violet's eyes open.

                                     VIOLET
                         ...  I needed that.

                                     CORKY
                         Tell me about it.

               Corky hands her the beer as Violet sits up a bit.

                                     CORKY
                         Caesar's Mafia, isn't he?

                                     VIOLET
                         You have to ask?

                                     CORKY
                         No.

                                     VIOLET
                         Funny, nobody calls it that anymore.  
                         Caesar calls it "The |Business."

                                     CORKY
                         How did you meet him?

                                     VIOLET
                         They took over a club I was working 
                         at.  Caesar started managing it.

                                     CORKY
                         He's a launderer?

                                     VIOLET
                         Basically.

                                     CORKY
                         How long have you been with him?

                                     VIOLET
                         Almost five years.

                                     CORKY
                         Five years is a long time.

                                     VIOLET
                         Yes, it is.

               Corky stares at her beer.  She knows what Violet is thinking.

                                     CORKY
                         The redistribution of wealth.

                                     VIOLET
                         What?

                                     CORKY
                         Isn't that what you wanted to know?  
                         What I did time for?

                                     VIOLET
                         The redistribution of wealth?

                                     CORKY
                         That's what I tell someone when I'm 
                         trying to get them in my bed.

                                     VIOLET
                         I'm already in your bed.

                                     CORKY
                         My cellmate would say she did her 
                         time for getting caught.  She was 
                         always more honest than me.

               Corky sips her beer.

                                     CORKY
                         I started stealing when I was little.  
                         We were piss-poor, which is not an 
                         excuse, just a fact.

               It isn't like her to talk about this, especially with someone 
               she just met.

                                     CORKY
                         The first time I remember so vividly.  
                         A bunch of us kids were at Waxman's 
                         Drugstore, when Mr. Waxman, who was 
                         a mean old prick, always worrying 
                         about us robbing him, dropped a roll 
                         of quarters.

               We can almost hear the coins tinkling on the tile floor.

                                     CORKY
                         I can still hear that sound, those 
                         quarters, because right then something 
                         clicked inside of me.  Some instinct 
                         took over and as everyone, including 
                         Waxman, dove down, I reached up and 
                         emptied the cash register.

               Violet smiles.  She likes this woman.

                                     CORKY
                         I gave most of the money to my mom.  
                         I told her I found it at the 
                         trainyard.  She was so happy she 
                         cried, calling me her lucky charm.  
                         Fifteen years later, I guess my luck 
                         ran out.

               Sbe swallows that with beer.

                                     CORKY
                         Sometimes I tell myself that I didn't 
                         have a choice, that stealing was 
                         surviving.  Usually I can admit that's 
                         bullshit.  I did it because it was a 
                         way out.  It was easy and I was good 
                         at it, real good.

               She glances at Violet.

                                     CORKY
                         I don't usually talk this much.  I 
                         guess I have been rehabilitated.

               Violet laughs.

                                     VIOLET
                         You didn't have to tell me if you 
                         didn't want to.

                                     CORKY
                         I guess I wanted to.

                                     VIOLET
                         I'm glad you did.

                                     CORKY
                         So am I.

               EXT. PARKING LOT DAY 

               Corky gets out of her truck carrying her tools.  Grinning 
               like someone who has been well-laid, she whistles off to 
               work.

               EXT. LOBBY - DAY 

               Between the main doors she sees a man.  His name is SHELLY 
               and he is an overdressed accountant.

               He is very nervous, talking to someone through the intercom.

                                     SHELLY
                         I know he's gone.  Please.  I have 
                         to talk to you.

               Fiddling with her keys, Corky recognizes the voice that 
               answers him.

                                     VIOLET (V.O.)
                         What do you want, Shelly?

               Shelly glances over his shoulder at Corky, answering in a 
               hushed voice.

               SHELLY

               I have to leave.  Tonight.

               For a moment the intercom is silent.  Then the door buzzes 
               and Shelly pushes inside.  Corky follows him to the elevator.

               INT.  ELEVATOR - DAY

               Corky glares at Shelly and begins pumping the trigger of her 
               circular saw.

               Shelly hides behind his sunglasses, watching the elevator 
               numbers go up.  The doors open and he scurries out.

               INT.  HALL - DAY

               She watches him enter Caesar's apartment, her smile now 
               completely gone.

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - DAY

               It is later.  Through the wall we listen to the same sound 
               as before of two people making love.  We drop down and find 
               Corky's brush, still wet with paint, abandoned in her tray.

               INT.  BEDROOM - DAY

               Her face glistening with sweat, Violet climaxes, letting the 
               orgasm spread through her like melting butter.

                                     VIOLET
                         I had this image of you, inside of 
                         me ...

               She flattens her palms against the soft cradle of her pelvis.

                                     VIOLET
                         Like a part of me ...

               As she opens her eyes, we see that her lover is Corky.  Violet 
               watches as she gets off the bed and begins to get dressed.

                                     VIOLET
                         You are so beautiful.

               Corky does not answer as she yanks her pants on.  Violet 
               sits up.  She can feel that something is wrong.

                                     VIOLET
                         What's wrong?

                                     CORKY
                         Nothing.

               Violet pulls the sheet around her.

                                     VIOLET
                         Yes there is.  I felt it this morning 
                         when I brought you the coffee.

                                     CORKY
                         Shit, here we go.

                                     VIOLET
                         You didn't want to see me, did you?

                                     CORKY
                         If there is one thing I can't stand 
                         about sleeping with women, it's all 
                         the fucking mind reading.

                                     VIOLET
                         What are you afraid of?

                                     CORKY
                         I'm not afraid of anything.

                                     VIOLET
                         I don't understand - ?

                                     CORKY
                         I know!  You can't understand, because 
                         we're different, Violet.  We're 
                         different.

                                     VIOLET
                         We're not that different, Corky.

                                     CORKY
                         How can you sit in that bed and say 
                         that?

                                     VIOLET
                         Because it's the truth.

                                     CORKY
                         Let me guess.  This is where you 
                         tell me that what matters is on the 
                         inside.  That inside you, there is a 
                         little dyke just like me?

                                     VIOLET
                         Oh no, she's nothing like you.  She's 
                         a lot smarter than you.

                                     CORKY
                         Is that what her daddy tells her?

                                     VIOLET
                         I know what I am.  I don't need to 
                         have it tattooed on my shoulder.

                                     CORKY
                         What are you saying?  That you don't 
                         have sex with men?

                                     VIOLET
                         I don't.

                                     CORKY
                         For Christ's sake, Violet!  I heard 
                         you!  Thin walls, remember?

                                     VIOLET
                         What you heard wasn't sex.

                                     CORKY
                         What the fuck was it?

                                     VIOLET
                         All my life, everyone has been telling 
                         me that when I have sex, I'm not 
                         really having sex.  Not real sex.  
                         But they're wrong.  I know what is 
                         and isn't sex and what you heard was 
                         definitely not sex.

                                     CORKY
                         What was it then?

                                     VIOLET
                         Work.

               That knocks Corky back.

                                     VIOLET
                         You made certain choices in your 
                         life that you paid for.  You said 
                         you made them because you were good 
                         at something and it was easy.  Do 
                         you think you're the only one that's 
                         good at something?

               Violet stare pins Corky to the wall.

                                     VIOLET
                         We make our own choices and we pay 
                         our own prices.  I think we're more 
                         alike than you want to admit.

                                     CORKY
                         What about that guy this morning?

                                     VIOLET
                         You mean Shelly?

                                     CORKY
                         Don't tell me, you're a workaholic.

                                     VIOLET
                         No.  Shelly knows what I am.  He saw 
                         me in a bar with another woman.

                                     CORKY
                         I suppose he just wants to watch.

               That's all Violet can take.

                                     VIOLET
                         Fuck it!  I think you better leave.

                                     CORKY
                         I think so, too.

               Violet turns away.

                                     VIOLET
                         Try not to steal anything on the way 
                         out.

               That stings but Corky walks out without looking back.

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT

               It is dark now.  Corky is standing above the paint tray that 
               has skinned over.  She picks up the brush.  It is dry with 
               paint.

                                     CORKY
                         Shit.

               She throws the brush across the room.

               EXT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

               A green-and-white street sign juts in the foreground of 
               Caesar's upscale apartment building.

               The sign reads: "FRANKLIN STREET."

               EXT.  PARKING LOT - DAY

               The rusty Chevy glides to a stop in a parking space near the 
               service entrance.  In its payload is a boxed bathroom vanity 
               and sink.

               Corky climbs out of the cab and into the back, unhooking the 
               bungee cords that hold down the boxes.

               She looks up as a black Lincoln Town Car screeches into a 
               spot not far from her truck.  THREE SERIOUS-LOOKING MEN get 
               out, leading a fourth, Shelly.

               He is the only one who seems to notice Corky.

               They enter the building, the door closing behind them.

               INT.  BATHROOM - DAY

               Corky's legs jut out from the old wicker vanity as she 
               finishes detaching its anchors and pipe work.

               She stands, giving it a yank and pulling it away from the 
               wall, when voices begin to filter in from the next-door 
               apartment.

               She listens - a rising string of warbling sobs drowned out 
               by an angry voice.

                                     ANGRY VOICE
                         Shut the fuck up!  You piece of shit!

               We hear a scream.

                                     ANGRY VOICE
                         You're going to tell us!  You're 
                         going to fuckin' tell us!  just a 
                         matter of fuckin' time!

               Each sentence is punctuated with grunts and thuds.

                                     ANGRY VOICE
                         Where is it?  Where the fuck is it?!

               We begin to close in on Corky as she listens to each thud, 
               watching something that disturbs her.

                                     ANGRY VOICE
                         You shit!  You piece of shit!

               With each thud the water in the toilet shimmers like a struck 
               cymbal.  As we move closer, the sound swells until --

                                                              MATCH CUT TO:

               INT.  CAESAR'S BATHROOM DAY

               Where blood splatters the toilet, heavy drops hitting the 
               water and spreading like inverted mushroom clouds.

                                     ANGRY VOICE
                         Did that hurt?  News flash, fucko: 
                         I'm just getting started.

               The angry voice belongs to JOHNNIE MARZZONE.  Shelly is 
               kneeling in front of the toilet, hands tied behind his back 
               with electrical wire.

               Johnnie Marzzone is a flashy young man in Armani slacks, 
               silk shirt and silver-tipped cowboy boots.  His tie is tucked 
               in, as if torture were a fine-dining experience.

               Caesar and two other men are crammed in the small bathroom.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         You got nerve trying to fuck us!  
                         Nobody fucks me!  Nobody fucks my 
                         father!  Nobody!  Nobody!

               Shelly screams as Jobnnie repeatedly rams his face into the 
               toilet.

                                     CAESAR
                         Whoa, whoa.  Come on, he's making 
                         too much noise.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         You hear that, bitch?  Be quiet!

                                     CAESAR
                         Here, put this in his mouth.

               Caesar hands a towel to Johnnie, who stuffs it into Shelly's 
               mouth.

               INT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - DAY

               Like Corky, Violet can hear the beating.  She is trying to 
               block it out but cannot.

               Standing at the bar, she runs the blender, grinding ice cubes, 
               trying to drown out the sounds of the bathroom.

               The bathroom door opens.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         Prick!  I can go all night!  All 
                         night!

               Caesar steps out, shutting the door, masking the sounds behind 
               him.  Violet moves toward him.

                                     VIOLET
                         Caesar, I'm leaving.

                                     CAESAR
                         What?  Oh, come on, I didn't use one 
                         of the good towels.

               The door opens again as someone else steps out.

                                     VIOLET
                         Caesar, I'm serious.  This is too 
                         much.  I have to get out of here.

                                     CAESAR
                         Why?  'Cause you know him?

               She nods.

                                     CAESAR
                         You women are so fucking sensitive.

               He takes hold of her.

                                     CAESAR
                         But I don't want you to go.  I like 
                         you here.  You know this isn't easy 
                         for me, either.

               He embraces her.  Over his shoulder she sees MICKEY MALNANO 
               in the hallway, staring at her.

               He is an older man, hair graying, built like a fireplug.  
               Sinewy mass strains at his Brooks Brothers suit.

                                     CAESAR
                         Now why don't you go watch some TV 
                         or something?

                                     MICKEY
                         Are you okay, Violet?

                                     CAESAR
                         Mickey, why is Johnnie here?  You 
                         know how I feel about that fucking 
                         psycho.

               Mickey continues to stare at Violet, who looks up at him 
               with her big doe eyes.

                                     MICKEY
                         Caesar, didn't I tell you to get 
                         something?

                                     CAESAR
                         Sure, Mickey.  Sure.

               He goes to the kitchen.

               Mickey moves closer to Violet, lifting her chin the way a 
               father would do to his little girl.

                                     MICKEY
                         You shouldn't have to see this.  Why 
                         don't you get out of here?  Go for a 
                         walk.

                                     VIOLET
                         Caesar wants me to stay.

                                     MICKEY
                         Don't worry about Caesar.  I'll handle 
                         Caesar.  You just get out of here, 
                         okay?

               She smiles.

                                     VIOLET
                         Thanks, Mickey.

               Caesar returns from the kitchen.  He is holding a pair of 
               tin snips.  Mickey takes them.

                                     MICKEY
                         Thanks, C.  Now let's end this thing.

               Violet watches them return to the bathroom.

               INT.  BATHROOM - DAY

               Mickey takes off his coat and hands it to a large man named 
               LOU.  He slaps Johnnie on the back.

                                     MICKEY
                         Hey, Johnnie, ease up, okay.

               Johnnie hits Shelly once more.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         Prick.

               Johnnie checks his hair in the mirror, carefully.  Then he 
               begins putting on the rings he had removed for the beating.

               Mickey kneels down next to Shelly's ear and motions to Lou, 
               who lifts Shelly's bound arms.

                                     MICKEY
                         Shelly, I'm going to ask you ten 
                         times.  You understand?  Ten times.

               Mickey grabs Shelly's pinky finger, putting it between the 
               metal blades.

                                     MICKEY
                         One.  Where is our money?

               Shelly whimpers, red-faced and sobbing.  There is a sick 
               crunch and Shelly howls into his gag as his pinky finger 
               bounces to the floor amid the expensive leather footwear.

                                     CAESAR
                         Aw ...  Christ.

               We hear Caesar retrieve a tissue and his hand enters the 
               frame, scooping up the pinky.

               He plunks the severed finger into the toilet and it sinks to 
               the bottom.

               Caesar drops the toilet seat down and flushes.

               INT.  BATHROOM - EMPTY APARTMENT - DAY

               Corky can't stand it anymore.  She throws her tools down, 
               leaves the bathroom and finds --

               Violet waiting in the main room.  Both women stand apart in 
               silence.

               Violet seems on the verge of saying something but doesn't 
               know how to start.  Her lip begins to quiver; her eyes search 
               the room, returning to Corky each time.

               The violence in the next room can still be heard.

                                     CORKY
                         Violet?  Are you all right?

               Almost unnoticeably, Violet shakes her bead.  Corky puts her 
               arm around her.

                                     CORKY
                         Come on.  Let's go.

               INT.  BAR - DAY

               It is the kind of bar businessmen drink at in the afternoon.  
               Dark wood and padded leather.

               The bartender, joking with a cluster of men, does not notice 
               Corky as she moves up to the bar.

                                     CORKY
                         Excuse me.

               The bartender glances over.

                                     CORKY
                         Draft beer and a TNT.

               Corky eyes the men, who stare into their drinks.

               The bartender says nothing as he puts the drinks in front of 
               her.

               Corky heads for her table, ignoring the whispers and snickers.

               Corky and Violet, the only women in the room, sit close 
               together at a far corner table.

               Violet's voice is hushed.

                                     VIOLET
                         Shelly was skimming from the business.  
                         He came to see me yesterday because 
                         he was afraid Caesar figured it out.  
                         He wanted to run but he wanted me to 
                         come with him.

                                     CORKY
                         Even though he knew about you?

                                     VIOLET
                         Yes.

                                     CORKY
                         He was in love with you, right?

                                     VIOLET
                         That's what he told himself.  But it 
                         wasn't even about me, it was about 
                         Caesar.  He wanted what Caesar had.  
                         That's how they are.  I understand 
                         them.

               She glances around the room; a man at the bar smiles at her.

                                     VIOLET
                         For Shelly, taking the money was a 
                         way to take from Caesar.  He could 
                         have run at any time, but he didn't 
                         because he didn't want out.

                                     CORKY
                         Sounds like he wanted to get caught.

                                     VIOLET
                         Maybe he did.  He would brag to me 
                         all the time.  He was never afraid 
                         of Caesar because he didn't know 
                         him.  Not like I do.

               Two men sit down near them, laughing.

                                     VIOLET
                         Caesar lives for these moments.  He 
                         tells me it's just the business, but 
                         I know it's more than that.  He likes 
                         it.  The violence.  I'll catch him 
                         in the bathroom mirror touching his 
                         scars.  He says they remind him who 
                         he his.  They're all like that.  
                         Except maybe Mickey.

                                     CORKY
                         Mickey?

                                     VIOLET
                         He's the part of the business that 
                         the rest of them pretend to be.  
                         |But Mickey doesn't like it like 
                         they do.  I suppose that's why he's 
                         good at it.

               Violet stares at her glass, at the melting ice.

                                     VIOLET
                         I used to be able to block it out.  
                         I would tell myself that I wasn't 
                         really there so nothing really 
                         mattered.  But I can't do it anymore.

               She downs the last of her drink.

                                     VIOLET
                         I've been making the same mistake 
                         Shelly made.  But now I know what |I 
                         want.

               She turns to Corky.

                                     VIOLET
                         I want out.  I want a new life.  I 
                         see what I've been waiting for, but 
                         I need you, Corky.

                                     CORKY
                         For what?

                                     VIOLET
                         You made a choice once.  Do you think 
                         you would make that same choice again?

                                     CORKY
                         What choice?

                                     VIOLET
                         If those quarters fell to the floor, 
                         would you still reach up to that 
                         cash register?

               Corky stares at her, knowing where this is going.  She glances 
               around the crowded bar.

                                     CORKY
                         Not here.

               EXT.  ALLEY - NIGHT

               Corky's truck sits in a gravel parking lot.

               INT.  CORKY'S TRUCK - DAY

               Through the back window of the truck, Violet and Corky are 
               silhouettes against the street light.

                                     VIOLET
                         Caesar is going to get the money and 
                         bring --

                                     CORKY
                         How much money?

                                     VIOLET
                         Shelly said it was over two million 
                         dollars.

               Corky quietly swallows that pill.  It begins to rain.

                                     VIOLET
                         Caesar will bring it to the apartment 
                         to count and go through |Shelly's 
                         books to figure out how he did it.

                                     CORKY
                         Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Do 
                         you have any idea what you are saying?  
                         You are asking me to help you fuck 
                         the mob.

               Violet nods.

                                     CORKY
                         These people are serious, Violet.  
                         If you want to know how serious, ask 
                         Shelly.  They're worse than any cop 
                         because they have lots of money and 
                         no rules.  You fuck them, you've got 
                         to do it right.

                                     VIOLET
                         That's why I need your help.  You 
                         said you were good.

                                     CORKY
                         I am, but ...

               She knows Violet is challenging her.

                                     CORKY
                         All right, let's say for the moment 
                         that I believe everything you are 
                         saying.

                                     VIOLET
                         You think I'm lying?

                                     CORKY
                         I didn't say that, but since you 
                         did, let's say that you are.  It 
                         would have been easy to set Shelly 
                         up.  You could have got him killed 
                         knowing that Caesar would bring the 
                         money to the apartment.

               Violet stares, her face poker-blank.

                                     CORKY
                         All you would need to keep yourself 
                         clean would be someone unconnected, 
                         someone like me.

                                     VIOLET
                         Is that what you think?

                                     CORKY
                         I'm just making a point.  You have 
                         no idea what you're asking.  How 
                         much trust two people need to do 
                         something like this.

               She moves closer to Violet, the sound of the rain beating 
               against the metal cab.

                                     CORKY
                         For me, stealing is a lot like sex.  
                         Two people that want the same thing 
                         sit in a room and they talk, they 
                         start to plan and it's like flirting, 
                         a kind of foreplay, because the more 
                         they talk about it, the wetter they 
                         get.

               She stops.

                                     CORKY
                         The difference is, I can have sex 
                         with someone I just met, someone I 
                         hardly know, but to steal I need to 
                         know someone like I know myself.

                                     VIOLET
                         Do you think you know me like that?

                                     CORKY
                         I think ...

               They are close enough to kiss.

                                     CORKY
                         We're going to find out.

               Corky pulls back.

                                     CORKY
                         But first, I want to see this money.

               INT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Violet springs from the couch as the front door crashes open, 
               Caesar charging in.  He is doubled over, clutching something 
               to his stomach.

               He rushes to the kitchen, dumping a bloody bundle into the 
               double sink.  There is blood everywhere, smeared up and down 
               Caesar's front.

                                     VIOLET
                         Oh my God ...

               Violet takes a step toward him, unsure of what has happened.

                                     CAESAR
                         Don't worry.  It ain't mine.

               He pulls a bottle of whiskey and a glass from the cupboard.

                                     VIOLET
                         Caesar, what happened?

                                     CAESAR
                         It was unbelievable!  Un-fucking-
                         believable!

               He pours himeslf a shot, belting it back.

                                     CAESAR
                         Goddammit, look at this shirt!  It's 
                         ruined!

               He begins unbuttoning the bloody shirt.

                                     CAESAR
                         It started when Shelly took us to 
                         the money.  I tell you, Mickey Malnato 
                         knows his shit, he does.  Shelly 
                         takes us right there.

               He throws down another shot.

                                     CAESAR
                         So Shelly's down on his knees and 
                         he's pulling out this bag of money 
                         from a safe in the floor and I'm 
                         staring at it like "holy fuck!" I 
                         mean, look at it --

               He tears open the bloody bag, wet money bricks spilling out.

                                     CAESAR
                         And all I can think is how the fuck 
                         did he do this when - Bang!  Johnnie 
                         caps him.  Blood sprays everywhere, 
                         all over the money.  We've no idea 
                         if this is even all of it.

               Caesar is exasperated.

                                     CAESAR
                         And right then I go through the roof 
                         and - Boom!  I belt the dumb fuck as 
                         hard as I can.  I didn't care whose 
                         son he was, I just wanted to hit him 
                         again.  Knock some sense into that 
                         dumb son of a bitch.

               He looks at the pile of bloody money.

                                     CAESAR
                         Just look at this mess I got to deal 
                         with.

                                     VIOLET
                         What are you going to do with it?

                                     CAESAR
                         I told them to run it through the 
                         cycles.  But I guess Gino has plans 
                         for it because he's coming here 
                         tomorrow night to pick this shit up.

               Searching through a sink cabinet, he can't find what he needs.

                                     CAESAR
                         Where the hell's the laundry 
                         detergent?

                                     VIOLET
                         Ummm ...  in the linen closet.

               Caesar walks down the ball to the bathroom.  Violet's eyes 
               do not move from the pile of money.

               Corky seems to come from nowhere.  She whispers.

                                     CORKY
                         Come to my place in the morning.  
                         Early, okay?

               Violet nods.

               INT.  CLOSET - NIGHT

               Corky's hands twitch, and then flex against the ropes that 
               bind them.

               A reflex echoes through her body, muscles spasm and limbs 
               jerk against their bonds.

               As if in a dream, she struggles, trying to get free, fighting 
               toward the edge of consciousness until --

               She seems to succumb, slipping back into stillness.

               We move toward her face, her closed eyes as we again hear 
               the voices in her head.

                                     VIOLET (V.O.)
                         You're having second thoughts.

               INT.  CORKY'S APARTMENT - DAY

               Violet is on the bed, Corky at the window.

                                     CORKY
                         ...  no.

               She turns to Violet.

                                     CORKY
                         You said he washed the money?

                                     VIOLET
                         Yeah.

                                     CORKY
                         Then what?  Exactly.

                                     VIOLET
                         He hung it up.

                                     CORKY
                         What?

                                     VIOLET
                         To let it dry.

               She begins to focus on the memory.

                                     VIOLET
                         It was unreal ...

               Moving in on her face.

                                                              MATCH CUT TO:

               Benjamin Franklin's face on a hundred-dollar bill.

               INT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Franklin's face rotates as we pull back, seeing rows of bills 
               carefully paper-clipped to lines of string.

                                     VIOLET (V.O.)
                         Hundreds, paper-clipped everywhere 
                         like leaves.

               Eyes filled with green, Violet turns inside the laundry lines 
               of money until she sees Caesar.

               Wearing his undershirt, he is across the room standing at 
               the ironing board, ironing every single bill.

               He seems to have one eye on her, one eye on his work.

                                     VIOLET (V.O.)
                         Then one by one, he ironed all of 
                         it.

               He sprays starch across several bills and presses the steaming 
               iron to them.

                                     CORKY (V.O.)
                         Did he sleep?

               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Violet is in bed, unable to sleep, listening to the machine-
               shuffle of Caesar's bill counter.

                                     VIOLET (V.O.)
                         No.  But neither did I.

               We move past her, floating toward the wall.

                                     VIOLET (V.O.)
                         All night long I listened to that 
                         sound.

               INT.  OFFICE - NIGHT

               We drift across Caesar's desk, past bricks of bound bills, 
               as Caesar folds the paper tape around another stack.

                                     CORKY (V.O.)
                         What sound?

               He hits the counter again and we hear the sound, now very 
               loud as hundreds blur by, fluttering beneath us.

                                     VIOLET (V.O.)
                         The sound of money.

               The sound rolls into thunder --

               INT.  CORKY'S APARTMENT - DAY

               That seems to shake the apartment.

                                     CORKY
                         And where is it now?

                                     VIOLET
                         In his office.  I saw it this morning.

               INT.  OFFICE - DAY

               Violet cautiously enters the office with a cup of coffee.

               Working furiously at the computer, Caesar jumps when he sees 
               her, bloodshot eyes animal-wide.

               He checks his watch as she sets the coffee in front of him.

                                     VIOLET
                         I need to go to the store.

               He nods automatically, back in his work, as she sees the 
               briefcase filled with perfect rows of hundreds.

                                     VIOLET (V.O.)
                         It's in a case, on his desk.

                                     CORKY (V.O.)
                         Does the case lock?

               We see the open top with its silver flip-over locks.

               INT.  CORKY'S APARTMENT - DAY

               Violet is trying to remember.

                                     VIOLET
                         Yes.

                                     CORKY
                         Good.

               Corky begins to pace, ordering the information in her head.

                                     CORKY
                         All right, now, tell me about Johnnie.

                                     VIOLET
                         Johnnie?

                                     CORKY
                         It sounded like he and Caesar don't 
                         like each other.

                                     VIOLET
                         Like each other?  They hate each 
                         other.

                                     CORKY
                         Why?

                                     VIOLET
                         It started way before I was around.  
                         I think basically it's because he 
                         thinks Johnnie is a complete idiot.  
                         But Johnnie runs Chicago because 
                         Gino is his father.

                                     CORKY
                         Who is Gino?

               Violet suddenly feels that she has made a mistake.

                                     VIOLET
                         Gino Marzzone.

                                     CORKY
                         Marzzone?  As in Angelo Marzzone, 
                         head of the Marzzone family?

                                     VIOLET
                         That's his brother.

                                     CORKY
                         ...  shit.

               Corky covers her mouth.

                                     CORKY
                         Gino Marzzone is coming tonight to 
                         pick up the money?

                                     VIOLET
                         Yeah.

                                     CORKY
                         And Johnnie is his son, that's Johnnie 
                         Marzzone?

                                     VIOLET
                         Yeah.

                                     CORKY
                         Sweet Jesus.

               Eyes wide, she paces, pulling at her lip, mumbling.

               Suddenly she freezes as it clicks into place.  She looks at 
               Violet.

                                     CORKY
                         It's perfect.

               She's pacing again.

                                     CORKY
                         Gino Marzzone is coming to your 
                         apartment.  It's a big deal, isn't 
                         it?  That means Caesar will be ready.  
                         He doesn't want to look like an idiot.  
                         Gino has been there before?

                                     VIOLET
                         Yeah, twice.

                                     CORKY
                         What happened?

                                     VIOLET
                         Not much, really.  Caesar was nervous, 
                         kept cleaning the apartment.  |The 
                         first time, he picked out the dress 
                         he wanted me to wear.

               Something occurs to Corky.

                                     CORKY
                         Does Johnnie hit on you?

                                     VIOLET
                         Johnnie hits on anything in high 
                         heels.

                                     CORKY
                         Has Caesar ever seen him?

                                     VIOLET
                         He does it right in front of him.

                                     CORKY
                         It's getting better and better.  
                         Keep going.

                                     VIOLET
                         Gino doesn't know English, or at 
                         least he pretends he doesn't, so he 
                         doesn't talk much.  He gets right to 
                         the point.  Both times they talked 
                         for about five minutes, had one drink 
                         and then they left.

                                     CORKY
                         What did Gino drink?

                                     VIOLET
                         Scotch, Glenlivet.  I remember that 
                         Caesar made a huge deal about it.

               Corky smiles, the wheels rolling.

                                     CORKY
                         All right ...

               She turns from the window and gets onto the bed.

                                     CORKY
                         I have an idea to make this work.

               INT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - DAY

               Violet is getting dressed, lining her lips with lip-pencil.

                                     CORKY (V.O.)
                         You'll go back and get ready, take 
                         your time, make it real.

               As she works on her face, we see the room behind her and the 
               discarded dresses scattered about.

                                     CORKY (V.O.)
                         The more attractive you are, the 
                         more believable it will be.

               INT.  CORKY'S APARTMENT - DAY

               Corky breaks her thought-train.

                                     CORKY
                         What time did you say they would be 
                         there?

                                     VIOLET
                         The plane is in at seven, so I'd say 
                         about eight.

                                     CORKY
                         Any bodyguards?

                                     VIOLET
                         Gino travels with a big man named 
                         Roy.  Caesar calls him the driver.

                                     CORKY
                         Fine.

               INT.  OFFICE - DAY

               Caesar again checks his watch.

                                     CORKY (V.O.)
                         At some point Caesar is going to 
                         quit.  I'd guess sometime around 
                         six, making sure he's got time to 
                         get ready.

               The watch reads 6:10.  Caesar rubs his eyes, his temples.

               INT.  LIVING ROOM - DAY

               Violet is at the bar in a sexy dress and high heels.

                                     CAESAR
                         Un-fucking-believable, what this guy 
                         did.  Shelly is one smart-ass 
                         mothefucker, I mean, he was one smart-
                         ass motherfucker.

               He laughs as Violet smiles, handing him an enormous drink.

                                     CORKY (V.O.)
                         As soon as he is done, you'll be 
                         right there to put a big drink in 
                         his hand.

               He takes the drink.

                                     CORKY (V.O.)
                         We want him to come down, to relax, 
                         feel in control again.

                                     VIOLET
                         Poor boy, has to work so hard.

               She gives him a woman's sympathy pout; he knows what it, 
               loves it anyway.

               Smiling, he slides his hand down over her ass.

                                     CAESAR
                         You look good enough to eat.

               She smiles and waits for the kiss she knows is coming.

               INT.  CORKY'S APARTMENT - DAY

               Both women are starting to feel it, to believe it.

                                     VIOLET
                         Where will you be?

                                     CORKY
                         Waiting in the apartment next door.

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT

               Corky sits on the floor of the dark apartment.  She has taken 
               off her boots, which are beside her.

                                     VIOLET (V.O.)
                         Waiting for what?

               Through the wall we can hear the shower.

                                     CORKY (V.O.)
                         For the shower.  That will be our 
                         signal.

               Corky opens a thin box filled with needle-thin lock picks.

               She selects several and slips them into her multi-pierced 
               ears like earrings.

                                     CORKY (V.O.)
                         When he's done with his shower, you 
                         will go to the bar.

               INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT

               In slow motion, Caesar drops the shower plunger and water 
               chokes from the faucet.

               INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Behind the bar, Violet pulls out the bottle of Glenlivet.

                                     CORKY (V.O.)
                         You'll get out the Scotch that Gino 
                         drinks.

               Violet steps out from the bar, her eyes on the bedroom, when 
               the bottle slips from her hands.

               We watch it slowly fall --

                                     CORKY (V.O.)
                         And as you do, the bottle will slip 
                         from your hands.  -- and shatter 
                         against the hardwood floor.

                                     CORKY (V.O.)
                         An accident.

                                     VIOLET
                         Shit!  Oh shit!

               Caesar yells from the bathroom.

                                     CAESAR (V.O.)
                         What happened?!

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Hearing Caesar, Corky gets up, moving quietly toward the 
               door.

                                     CAESAR (V.O.)
                         V!  What the fuck was it?!  Violet?

               INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Caesar enters, a towel wrapped around him, hair still 
               dripping.

                                     CAESAR
                         V, what?  You can't hear me?

               Violet looks terribly upset as she begins to clean up.

                                     VIOLET
                         Caesar, it slipped ...  I was trying 
                         to get ready ...

               Caesar realizing what happened.

                                     CAESAR
                         Oh, fucking Christ ...  You gotta be 
                         kidding me!

               He rushes at her.

                                     CAESAR
                         Fuck!  Fuck!  How did you ...  Awwww 
                         goddammit!

                                     VIOLET
                         I'm sorry.  It was an accident.

               She stands up.

                                     VIOLET
                         Don't worry, I'll get some more.

                                     CAESAR
                         There's no time.

                                     VIOLET
                         Don't be silly, Caesar.  It'll take 
                         five minutes.

               She turns him back toward the bedroom.

                                     VIOLET
                         I'll clean this up and be back before 
                         you're even dressed.

               INT.  HALL - NIGHT

               Violet opens her door, stepping into the hall where Corky is 
               waiting.

                                     CORKY (V.O.)
                         When you open the door, I'll be there.

               They pass each other in silence, Violet stepping out as Corky 
               slips in.

                                     VIOLET (V.O.)
                         What if he sees you?

                                     CORKY (V.O.)
                         He won't.

               INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT

               Caesar is working intensely on his fingernails.  We glide 
               over a set of gleaming metal manicure tools.  We see his 
               hand as he delicately applies a coat of clear polish to a 
               nail.

               Through the open door, we see Corky moving almost casually 
               across the living room.

               INT.  CORKY'S APARTMENT - DAY

               Corky is looking for something.

                                     VIOLET
                         You can't know for certain that he 
                         won't see you.

                                     CORKY
                         Trust me, Violet.

               She finds a black duffel bag from one of her tool buckets.

                                     VIOLET
                         I'm just asking, what if?

                                     CORKY
                         If he does ...

               Corky slips her hand in between the mattress and box spring, 
               pulling out a gun.

                                     CORKY
                         Then I won't have a choice, will I?

               She tosses the gun on the bed.

               INT.  OFFICE - NIGHT

               The black case is lying on the desk, locked shut.  Corky 
               moves around the desk, dropping down behind it.

                                     CORKY (V.O.)
                         When I'm inside, I will get the money.

               From her earlobe, she chooses the right pick, sliding out 
               the silver tool.

               It takes only a second and the first lock pops open.

               She is working on the other lock when the door is pushed 
               open and Caesar walks in.

               Corky drops down, grasping for her gun --

               As Caesar, wearing only underwear, enters.  He blows on the 
               drying polish on his fingernails before delicately selecting 
               a suit from his closet.

               The gun ready, Corky, pressed against the desk, waits until 
               he leaves.

               She lets her breath out, then pops the second lock, unzips 
               the black duffel bag and quickly empties the case, filling 
               the bag with fat money bricks.

                                     CORKY (V.O.)
                         I'm going to need something ...

               Finished, she zips up the bag and looks about.

                                     CORKY (V.O.)
                         ...  to fill the case.

               Sbe sees a stack of newspapers hidden near the desk.

                                     CORKY (V.O.)
                         Yeah, you should hide it near the 
                         desk before you leave.

               She fills the case, then closes it.

                                     CORKY (V.O.)
                         At that point --

               She thumbs the locks shut and they snap, unnaturally loud, 
               into place.

               INT.  CORKY'S APARTMENT - DAY

               They are both on the bed.

                                     CORKY
                         There is no going back.

                                     VIOLET
                         When I get the Scotch, how do I know 
                         you won't take off?

                                     CORKY
                         The same way I'll know that you went 
                         to Scotch.  Trust.

               Their faces are close, eyes still trying to read each other.

                                     VIOLET
                         I still don't see how I'm going to 
                         get clean with the money in the 
                         apartment.  Everyone will think I 
                         did it.

                                     CORKY
                         Not Caesar.

                                     VIOLET
                         Why?

                                     CORKY
                         Because of what you are going to 
                         tell him.  You have to make it as 
                         real as you can.  The moment you 
                         open the door with the Scotch in 
                         your hand, you will be covered, and 
                         that moment is the most important 
                         moment in the plan.

               INT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               The door bursts open.  Violet enters quickly, carrying a 
               bottle in a thin brown bag.

                                     CORKY (V.O.)
                         If it's real enough, he'll believe 
                         it, because deep down he'll want to.

                                     VIOLET
                         C!  Shit, I'm sorry!

               Caesar wanders out, tightening his tie.  She looks at her 
               watch.

                                     VIOLET
                         They were early.

                                     CAESAR
                         What are you talking about?

                                     VIOLET
                         They just left, didn't they?

                                     CAESAR
                         What are you, drunk?

               He smiles, grabbing the bottle from her.

                                     VIOLET
                         You mean they weren't up here?

                                     CAESAR
                         No!  They're still on their way.

                                     VIOLET
                         That doesn't make any sense.

                                     CAESAR
                         Why?

                                     VIOLET
                         Because I just saw Johnnie downstairs.

               Caesar turns.

                                     CAESAR
                         What?

                                     VIOLET
                         I was getting out of the car when I 
                         saw him in the Mercedes.

                                     CAESAR
                         It couldn't have been.

                                     VIOLET
                         It was him.  I'm positive.

                                     CAESAR
                         It's impossible!

                                     VIOLET
                         Caesar, I know Johnnie.  It was him.  
                         I screamed when I saw him.  I couldn't 
                         believe I missed them.  I knew you 
                         were going to be upset so I thought 
                         I'd apologize and give Gino the 
                         Scotch.  I honked a couple of times 
                         but he didn't stop.

               She watches him, her words caving in around him.

                                     CAESAR
                         But Gino's plane doesn't get in for 
                         another half-hour.

               Violet thinks.

                                     VIOLET
                         Actually, I didn't see Gino in the 
                         car.

               His eyes dart.  His forehead beads with sweat.  He turns 
               toward the office.

               INT.  CORKY'S APARTMENT - DAY

               Violet is staring at Corky's mouth.

                                     CORKY
                         If Caesar hates Johnnie like you 
                         say, then the second he opens the 
                         case he'll know, in his gut, that 
                         Johnnie just fucked him.  He'll 
                         realize that he has no choice.  He 
                         can't touch Gino or Johnnie.  There's 
                         only one way out.

               She pauses.

                                     CORKY
                         He'll have to run.

                                     VIOLET
                         If he runs, everyone will assume he 
                         took the money.

                                     CORKY
                         You'll be clean and we'll be rich.

               INT.  OFFICE - NIGHT

               Caesar stands over the desk, afraid to open the case.

               INT.  CORKY'S APARTMENT - DAY

                                     VIOLET
                         Jesus, that's beautiful.

                                     CORKY
                         Thank you.

                                     VIOLET
                         If you're this goddamn smart, how 
                         did you ever get caught?

                                     CORKY
                         Every job like this has moments where 
                         things don't go so well and everyone 
                         starts thinking about their own ass.  
                         It's in those moments that everything 
                         comes together or falls apart.

               She looks dead at Violet.

                                     CORKY
                         I had a partner and she fucked me.

                                     VIOLET
                         I won't.

                                     CORKY
                         I think we're going to find out.

               INT.  OFFICE - NIGHT

               The key turns and the locks pop.  When Caesar sees the 
               newspaper, the whole world begins to spin.

                                     VIOLET
                         Caesar?

               His chest collapses onto itself while his hands ball into 
               fists.

                                     CAESAR
                         No no no no ...

               She moves around the side of the desk and sees the newspaper.

                                     VIOLET
                         Oh God ...

               He slams the case shut, his head hanging down.

               After a moment he looks at her, like a little boy about to 
               cry.

                                     CAESAR
                         ...  I've been set up.

               He seems ready to scream but can't say anything.

                                     VIOLET
                         Johnnie?

               The name is like water hitting hot oil.

                                     CAESAR
                         That fuck!  That rat-fuck!  Little 
                         shit rat-fuck!

               He starts punching the desk, each blow harder than the last.

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Corky can hear him pounding.  She looks down and smiles.  
               Between her legs is the open bag stuffed with money.

               INT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Caesar is choking on his own rage.

                                     VIOLET
                         Why?  Why would Johnnie do this?

                                     CAESAR
                         Jesus Christ, Violet!  Open your 
                         fucking eyes!  Johnnie hates me like 
                         I hate him!

               He starts to pound his fists against his own head.

                                     CAESAR
                         I hate that little fuck!  I hate 
                         him!  I hate him!  I should've done 
                         him!

                         But you know he did it.

                         So what?!  So fucking what?  Use 
                         your head, Violet.  The money is 
                         gone.  Gino is coming here to get 
                         it.  You think he's going to believe 
                         me if I tell him his piss-hole son 
                         stole it!  Is that what you think?  
                         I don't.  You know what I think?  I 
                         think I'm a dead man.  I'm one in 
                         the brain.  That's what I think!

                                     VIOLET
                         Caesar, what are we going to do?

               He grabs hold of his chair, using it to support himself

                                     CAESAR
                         I know what he wants me to do.  He 
                         wants me out of here.  He wants me 
                         to run.

               She watches him, his body rocking against the chair.

                                     CAESAR
                         If I run, then everyone will think I 
                         took the money and he walks away 
                         with two million clean.

               The words squeeze out like tears.

                                     CAESAR
                         God, I can see him right now driving 
                         to get Gino.  I can hear him laughing, 
                         fucking laughing, laughing at me.

               He swings the swivel chair over his head and smashes it down 
               on the desk.  Again and again.

                                     CAESAR
                         Laughing at me!  Laughing at me!

               The chair falls and he stands alone, covering his face to 
               hide his tears.

                                     VIOLET
                         C ...

               She goes to hold him.

                                     CAESAR
                         Don't touch me!

               He backs into the corner of the room.

                                     CAESAR
                         Just leave me alone!  I got to think!

               Violet watches him trying to wipe the tears and sweat from 
               his face.

                                     CAESAR
                         Got to think this through ...

                         leave me the fuck alone!  Please!  
                         Leave!  Now!

                                     VIOLET
                         All right, Caesar.

               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Violet enters, closing the door quietly behind her.  She 
               looks at the wall, then goes to the bed and picks up the 
               phone.

               As she dials, we move along the phone cord, following it 
               down to the jack in the wall.

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT

               We move out from another jack, following a different cord.

               Corky is sitting with her back to the wall.  The black phone 
               beside her barely rings once before she answers.

               She waits, saying nothing.

                                     VIOLET (V.O.)
                         It's me.

                                     CORKY
                         What happened?

               INT.  BEDROOM NIGHT

               Violet whispers, her hand cupped over the mouthpiece.

                                     VIOLET
                         He totally freaked.  I've never seen 
                         him like this.  He's out of his 
                         fucking mind.

                                     CORKY (V.O.)
                         That's okay, as long as he believes 
                         it was Johnnie.

                                     VIOLET
                         Believes it!  Jesus, it's driving 
                         him crazy.  He wants to kill him.  I 
                         don't know, Corky, I don't know what 
                         he is going to do.  I'm getting 
                         nervous, really nervous.

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT

                                     CORKY
                         It's all right, Violet.  It's working.  
                         All we got to do is wait him out and 
                         see what he does.

                                     VIOLET (V.O.)
                         What if he doesn't run?

                                     CORKY
                         That means he probably will kill 
                         Johnnie.

                                     VIOLET (V.O.)
                         Oh, Christ, I got to get out of here!

                                     CORKY
                         Listen, if he doesn't run, all you 
                         have to do is break down, go to your 
                         bedroom and pack some things, start 
                         crying, saying you love him but you 
                         can't do it.  You're sorry but you 
                         have to leave and just walk out.

               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

                                     VIOLET
                         okay, all right.

                                     CORKY (V.O.)
                         We're almost there, Violet.  just 
                         hang on.

               Violet hears him.

                                     VIOLET
                         He's coming ...

               She hangs up quickly just as Caesar bursts in.

                                     CAESAR
                         I got it!  I know what I got to do!  
                         I got to get the money.

                                     VIOLET
                         The money?  The money's gone.

                                     CAESAR
                         No.  Johnnie's got it.  All I got to 
                         do is get it back.

                                     VIOLET
                         But it could be anywhere.

                                     CAESAR
                         He didn't have that much time.  He 
                         had to pick up Gino.  I bet you he's 
                         got it with him.  I bet it's in the 
                         car.

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Corky presses against the wall, trying to hear.

               INT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Caesar is pacing.

                                     CAESAR
                         He didn't see you, did he?

                                     VIOLET
                         No.

                                     CAESAR
                         See, right now he doesn't know that 
                         I know, that's why he put the paper 
                         in the case.  He wants me to hand 
                         the case to Gino.  Then there is no 
                         doubt it was me.  Gino will put a 
                         bullet in me himself.  But it ain't 
                         going to happen.  I won't let it!  
                         Johnnie ain't going to fuck me!  Not 
                         like this!  No way!

                                     VIOLET
                         This is insane!

               She throws open her closet.

                                     CAESAR
                         What are you doing?

               She grabs a suitcase from under the bed.

                                     VIOLET
                         I'm leaving!  This is crazy!  I don't 
                         want to be involved.  I don't want 
                         anything to do with this shit!

               She starts yanking the dresses from the closet.

                                     CAESAR
                         You can't leave.

                                     VIOLET
                         The hell I can't!

                                     CAESAR
                         I need you ...

                                     VIOLET
                         Bullshit!  You don't need me!  You've 
                         never needed me!  I can't help you!  
                         Understand?!  I have to get out.

                                     CAESAR
                         Violet, I won't let you leave.

               She turns and sees that he is holding a gun.

                                     CAESAR
                         If you're not with me, Violet, then 
                         I have to assume you're against me.

                                     VIOLET
                         Caesar, this is crazy.

                                     CAESAR
                         Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.  Maybe 
                         you dropped the Scotch by accident.  
                         Maybe you didn't.

               Now it is her turn to feel the world spin.

                                     CAESAR
                         It would have been so easy to let 
                         him in as you went out.

                                     VIOLET
                         You don't, you can't believe that 
                         ...

                                     CAESAR
                         I've seen the way he looks at you.  
                         He's always wanted you.  Maybe two 
                         million dollars finally bought you.

               She slaps him hard.  He stares at her.

                                     CAESAR
                         I'm sorry, Violet, but it has to be 
                         this way.

               He moves past her, picks up the dresses and returns them to 
               the closet.

                                     CAESAR
                         I hope you understand.  I want to 
                         trust you, I want to believe you, 
                         but I don't have any other choice.

               He shuts the closet.

               INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 

               Caesar is at the bar, drinking the Scotch.  The gun in front 
               of him.  Across the room, Violet sits, staring holes through 
               him.

               They wait in silence.

                                     CAESAR
                         You sure you don't want a drink?

               Violet says nothing.

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT

               In the dark, Corky sits, her face, her posture very similar 
               to Violet's.

               She is concentrating, her mind somewhere else, when the door 
               buzzer sounds.

               She turns her head and hears Caesar faintly answering the 
               intercom.

               Corky stands just as --

               INT. CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 

               Violet stands.

               Caesar faces her for a moment, then shoves the gun into his 
               belt behind his back.

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Corky watches through the door peep as three men pass by.

               INT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               There is a knock and Caesar opens the door.

               GINO MARZZONE is an old Italian whose face is a mask of 
               irritated indifference.

               ROY, his enormous driver, is behind him.

               Caesar smiles, greeting them in Italian with open arms.

               Johnnie is the last inside.  He has tape over his broken 
               nose.  He smiles and hugs Caesar.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         You shouldn't have hit me.

                                     CAESAR
                         You want to get into this now?

                                     JOHNNIE
                         No, no, Caesar.  Not now.

               He smiles again, patting him on the shoulder, then throwing 
               a fake punch.

               Caesar sees Gino with his bright Italian smile, flattering 
               Violet, kissing her.

                                     GINO
                         Hey, Caesar!  You take care of this 
                         girl, or I find out!

                                     JOHNNIE
                         You are as radiant as ever, Violet.

               As he bends to kiss her hand, she sees Caesar watching them.

                                     CAESAR
                         Glenlivet, right, Gino?

                                     JOHNNIE
                         I'll have whatever Violet's drinking.

                                     VIOLET
                         I'm not drinking.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         Then neither will I.

               This makes Violet very uncomfortable.

                                     VIOLET
                         No, I'll have a Tanqueray and tonic.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         Caesar, make that two TNTs.

               Caesar's hand shakes as he pours Gino's Scotch.

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT 

               Pacing in her socks, Corky tries to think through several 
               possible situations.  She stops, staring at the bag of money.

               The idea of its sitting out in the open suddenly bothers 
               her.

               INT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Caesar hands Violet and Johnnie a drink.  He stares at her.  
               She stares back.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         Salud, eh.  Roy, Violet, Pop, Caesar.

               Caesar watches Johnnie, suspecting everything he does.

               Johnnie reaches into his pocket and takes out a cellular 
               phone.

                                     GINO
                         No, Johnnie.  No goddamned phones.  
                         Not now.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         Pop?

                                     GINO
                         Caesar, come here.  Sit.  We talk 
                         now.  You too, Johnnie.

               Each man sits on either side of Gino.

                                     GINO
                         Caesar, look at me.  Johnnie tell me 
                         what happened.  Caesar, you gotta do 
                         me a favor, a personal favor.  For 
                         me, eh?  You gotta start respecting 
                         Johnnie the way you respect me.  You 
                         understand?  Good.

               Caesar sees Johnnie smiling at him, but when Gino turns, the 
               smile disappears.

                                     GINO
                         And you, Johnnie.  You gonna stop 
                         acting stupid.  You gotta earn this 
                         respect that Caesar's gonna give.  
                         You understand?  Good.  Done.  Now, 
                         where's my money?

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Corky drops a hefty bag, knotted tight, into an open five-
               gallon bucket of paint.

               As she picks up a paint stick, we see a second bag beside 
               another bucket.

               She pushes the first bag down until it disappears, enveloped 
               by the milk-white liquid.

               INT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Caesar puts the briefcase onto the coffee table.

               Gino looks up at Caesar, very serious, with his hand on the 
               case.

                                     GINO
                         We know how this was done, eh?

                                     CAESAR
                         Yeah, I know.

               He looks dead at Johnnie.

                                     GINO
                         It won't happen again, eh?

               Caesar shakes his head.

                                     GINO
                         Good.

               Gino throws down the last of the Scotch.

                                     GINO
                         Done.  We go now.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         Jesus Christ, Pop.  You got two hours 
                         until your plane leaves.

               Gino checks his watch, shouting in Italian.  Johnnie shouts 
               back until Gino throws up his hands, refusing to listen.

                                     GINO
                         Caesar!

               He gestures to his empty glass, then folds his arms, leaning 
               back.  Caesar gets the bottle.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         So Caesar, what did it total out at?

                                     CAESAR
                         Two point one seventy-six.

               Johnnie whistles as Caesar pours Gino another Scotch.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         Unbelievable.  Can you believe that, 
                         Violet?

                                     GINO
                         Hey, Johnnie ...

               In Italian tells him to shut up.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         Come on, Pop, all I want to know is 
                         one thing.  Just one thing after he 
                         made such a big deal out of it.  I 
                         bet it wasn't a big deal.  Was it, 
                         Caesar?

                                     CAESAR
                         What's that, Johnnie?

                                     JOHNNIE
                         The money I bet it was nothing to 
                         get it clean, after you made such a 
                         fucking big deal ...

                                     GINO
                         Johnnie, what did I say?

                                     JOHNNIE
                         Pop, this is important to me.  It's 
                         a simple question.  if he would just 
                         answer the question, that's the end 
                         of it.

                                     CAESAR
                         Where is this going, Johnnie?

                                     JOHNNIE
                         Just admit it, Caesar.

                                     CAESAR
                         Admit what?

                                     JOHNNIE
                         That you overreacted.  That you lost 
                         it.  Not me.  It was your mistake.

               Caesar sees it so clearly now.

                                     CAESAR
                         All right, Johnnie, you want to play 
                         it this way, I can play it this way.  
                         You want to know who made a mistake, 
                         why don't you open the case.

                                     VIOLET
                         Caesar ...

                                     CAESAR
                         Shut up, Violet!  This is between me 
                         and Johnnie.

               He pushes the case toward him.

                                     CAESAR
                         You want to do this now, let's do 
                         it.  Open the case.  Open the fucking 
                         case.

               Johnnie stares at him, feeling that something is very wrong.

                                     CAESAR
                         That's right, I know.  I fucking 
                         know.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         Know what?

                                     CAESAR
                         Open the case!

                                     JOHNNIE
                         All right!  Where's the key?

                                     CAESAR
                         You don't need a key.

               He tries but it's locked.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         How the fuck can I open it?

                                     CAESAR
                         The same way you did before.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         What are you talking about?

               Caesar smiles and tosses the key onto the table.

                                     CAESAR
                         There you go, Johnnie.

               He reaches for the key.  Caesar stands up and gives Violet 
               his drink.

                                     CAESAR
                         Get me another.

               He can see the fear on her face as she goes to the bar.

               Time drips.

               The key turns.  One lock pops.

               Then the other.

               Tbe case opens like a scream and Johnnie sees the newspaper.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         What the ...

               Before anybody can move, Caesar whips around with his gun.

               Roy jumps off his stool, his drink crashing to the floor.

                                     CAESAR
                         Don't!  Don't fucking move!

               Nobody can believe what is happening.

                                     GINO
                         Caesar?  What is this?

                                     CAESAR
                         Ask Johnnie!  Ask your rat-fuck son!

                                     JOHNNIE
                         What the fuck?

               Caesar levels the gun.

                                     CAESAR
                         You don't think I'll do it, do you?

                                     JOHNNIE
                         I think you're fucking crazy!

                                     CAESAR
                         Where is it?

                                     JOHNNIE
                         Where's what?

                                     CAESAR
                         The money!

                                     JOHNNIE
                         Caesar, I don't know what you're 
                         thinking here, but if you don't put 
                         down that gun --

               He stands up.

                                     CAESAR
                         Sit down!

               He does.

                                     GINO
                         Caesar!

                                     CAESAR
                         Gino, your son stole this money to 
                         set me up and I can prove it.  Violet!

               She doesn't know what to say.

                                     CAESAR
                         Tell them!  Tell them!

                                     VIOLET
                         For Christ's sake, Johnnie, do what 
                         he says.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         This isn't happening ...

               Boom!  Caesar blows a hole in the couch right between 
               Johnnie's legs.  Johnnie screams.

                                     CAESAR
                         The next one blows off your dick.

                                     JOHNNIE
                         You're a dead man!  A fucking dead 
                         man!

                                     CAESAR
                         Where is it?

                                     GINO
                         Enough!

               Gino jumps up.

                                     CAESAR
                         No, Gino!

                                     GINO
                         You aim a gun at me?!  Do you know 
                         who I am?!  I am Gino Marzzone.  You 
                         understand?

               He starts walking toward Caesar.  Roy moves around for a 
               good angle.

                                     CAESAR
                         Sit down, Gino!

                                     GINO
                         No, Caesar, gimme the gun.

                                     CAESAR
                         Stay away!

               He backs up as Gino walks straight to him.

                                     GINO
                         We're family, Caesar.

                                     CAESAR
                         No!

                                     GINO
                         Gimme the gun.

                                     CAESAR
                         I can't.  I can't.

                                     GINO
                         Give it to me.

               He reaches up and takes bold of the barrel.  Caesar looks 
               resigned as he shuts his eyes.

                                     GINO
                         Good man.

               Close on Gino's hand holding the gun barrel as --

               Caesar fires.

               From behind the gun we watch Gino's grip yanked free, time 
               melting away as he falls, blood bubbling from his chest, his 
               eyes wide in disbelief.

               His body hits the floor and the room erupts.

               Roy dives, drawing his gun as Caesar continues to fire, 
               pumping the trigger.

               Violet drops behind the bar as Jobnnie screams, falling 
               towards his father.

               Blood spurts from Roy as two bullets hit, his gun clattering 
               and sliding across the floor.

               Johnnie lunges at Caesar as Caesar turns and fires, hitting 
               Johnnie everywhere; blood and meat spray and speckle 
               everything around him.

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT

               The gun continues to fire as Corky clutches the phone, 
               whispering.

                                     CORKY
                         This is an emergency!

               INT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Crunched down behind the bar, Violet listens to the only 
               sound, repeating in the unnatural quiet:

               Click.  Click.

               Click.

               Rising, she peers over the edge of the bar.

               Caesar is standing in the aftermath.  His gun is still aimed 
               at Johnnie as he pulls the trigger over and over.

               The bodies are still, blood silently pooling around them.

               Blinking the sweat from his eyes, Caesar sees Violet.

                                     CAESAR
                         I had to do it, Violet.  You saw it.  
                         I had no choice.  It was Johnnie.  
                         That lying fuck.  He made me do it.

               He looks down at Jobnnie, hate rising like bile.

                                     CAESAR
                         You lying rat-fuck.  You think you 
                         can set me up?  Is that what you 
                         think?  You stupid fuck.

               Kicking the body, be causes a series of sickening wet noises.

                                     CAESAR
                         I'm a dead man?  I'm a dead man?  
                         Guess again, fuck-face.  Who's dead?  
                         Who's the dead lying rat-fuck?  Take 
                         another guess, take another fucking 
                         guess!

               He stops, panting, unable to catch his breath.  Violet is 
               afraid to even look at him.

               Blood creeps along the edge of the floorboards.

               Caesar tries to clear his head, mopping the sweat from his 
               face.  He bends down and starts searching Johnnie's pockets.

               He finds his keys.

                                     VIOLET
                         What are you doing?

               Lost in thought, he goes to Gino.  Throwing open the coat, 
               he sees the airplane ticket.  There is a bullet hole in it.

               He checks the times and then his watch.

                                     CAESAR
                         ...  maybe three hours.

                                     VIOLET
                         Caesar, what are you going to do?

                                     CAESAR
                         What do you think we're going to do?  
                         We have to find the money.

                                     VIOLET
                         What?

                                     CAESAR
                         Once we have the money, then none of 
                         this ever happened.

                                     VIOLET
                         Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone.

                                     CAESAR
                         No I didn't.  Not if his body 
                         disappears and not if the money is 
                         still here.  Then they never showed 
                         up.

                                     VIOLET
                         What happened to them?

                                     CAESAR
                         I don't know.  We may never know, 
                         but I'm going to guess it was a job, 
                         maybe the Karpoli family.

               He smiles.

                                     CAESAR
                         All part of the business.

               He picks up Roy's gun and stuffs it in his belt.

                                     CAESAR
                         We just got to find the money.  Once 
                         we do, everything is going to be all 
                         right.

               In the distance, the wail of a police siren can be heard.

               EXT.  PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               Through the window they see a squad car, lights blaring, 
               roll up in front of the building.

               INT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

                                     VIOLET
                         Oh, no.

               He turns back to the carnage.

                                     CAESAR
                         Fuck.

                                     VIOLET
                         Caesar, what are we going to do?

                                     CAESAR
                         They're just cops.  Stall them as 
                         long as you can.

               Caesar flies into action.

               Grunting, he hauls Gino's body up, drags it to the bathroom 
               and throws it into the tub.  He returns for Johnnie's body.

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Standing near the bathroom, Corky hears the metal echo of 
               the tub.  Looking at her tub, she imagines what he is doing.

               Through the wall, she hears the door buzzer.

               INT. CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               The buzzer sounds again as Violet sees him lift Roy's body.

                                     CAESAR
                         Answer it!

               He heads back to the bathroom, dropping Roy onto the other 
               two.

               The three bloody bodies fill the tub.

               We see Johnnie's arm hanging over the edge as Caesar snaps 
               the shower curtain around, hiding them.

                                     VIOLET
                         Hello?

                                     COP #1 (V.O.)
                         This is the police, ma'am.

               She cuts them off using the intercom.

                                     VIOLET
                         The police?

               Over her shoulder she sees Caesar moving the furniture, 
               clearing the area around the heavy bloodstains.

                                     COP #1 (V.O.)
                         We had a report of gunfire, so if 
                         you could --

                                     VIOLET
                         Gunfire?  Is this a joke?

               Violet sees Caesar hurry to his office.

                                     COP #1 (V.O.)
                         No joke, ma'am.  Please open the 
                         door.

                                     VIOLET
                         How do I know you are cops?

               INT.  OFFICE - NIGHT

               Caesar seizes the beautiful oriental rug in his office and 
               yanks it up, overturning furniture.  Dragging it out, he 
               slams the door behind him.

               INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Violet looks at Caesar, who is working with the calm, single-
               minded focus of a machine.

                                     COP #1 (V.O.)
                         Ma'am, you have to open the door.

                                     VIOLET
                         All right.

               She buzzes them in as Caesar throws the rug like someone 
               making a bed, letting it fall to the floor and cover most of 
               the blood.

               INT.  LOBBY - NIGHT

               The cops are waiting for the elevator.  After a moment, the 
               door slides open.

               INT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Violet moves away from the intercom as Caesar begins arranging 
               the furniture on the rug.

                                     CAESAR
                         Get me a wet towel.

               His words push her to the bathroom.

               INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT

               Stuffing a towel into the sink, she turns on the water.  She 
               does not even look at the shower curtain.

               INT.  HALL - NIGHT

               The elevator opens and the cops step out.

               INT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Caesar grabs the television remote, hits "on" and jacks the 
               volume until it is obviously loud.

               Violet returns and he snatches the towel from her.

               INT.  HALL

               As the two cops walk down the hall, they hear the television.  
               They look at each other, already knowing what happened.

               INT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Like a maniac, Caesar wipes at any blood still visible until 
               there is a knock on the door.  He grabs Violet by the arm.

                                     CAESAR
                         If you're thinking about doing 
                         something stupid, remember I just 
                         killed Gino Marzzone.  You understand 
                         what that means?

               She nods.

                                     VIOLET
                         They're just cops.

               There is another knock, much louder.

               Violet goes to the door as Caesar rips off his blood-soaked 
               jacket and shirt.

               He drops down behind the bar Leaving the chain on, Violet 
               opens the door.  Tbe cops smile.

                                     COP #1
                         See?  We're for real.

                                     VIOLET
                         I'm sorry, it's just you hear stories.

                                     COP #1
                         You did the right thing.

               Crouching, Caesar wipes vigorously at the blood on his hands 
               and face.

               Violet opens the door.

               Caesar crams the bloody wad under the bar sink.

               Just as the cops enter the living room, Caesar stands, looking 
               comfortable in no shirt, with ice cubes in his hands.

                                     CAESAR
                         Hey, hey, Chicago's finest.

               He plunks the ice into a glass and walks from behind the bar

                                     CAESAR
                         How's it going tonight, fellas?

                                     COP #1
                         Pretty good, sir.

               Caesar turns his head.

                                     CAESAR
                         Huh?  I'm sorry, I can only hear in 
                         this ear.

               Tbe cops look at each other again.

               Wiping his wet hand on his pants, Caesar shakes hands with 
               each of them.

                                     CAESAR
                         I'm Caesar and this here is my Violet.

               They smile at Violet as Caesar puts his arm around her.

                                     CAESAR
                         Violet said something about gunshots?

               Violet sees the gun wedged in the back of his belt.

                                     COP #2
                         Yes, sir, a neighbor in the building 
                         called in.

                                     COP #1
                         I think we know what happened.

                                     COP #2
                         It was probably just the television.

                                     CAESAR
                         The television?

               He looks at Violet.

                                     CAESAR
                         Honey, why didn't you say something?  
                         Turn it off.

               Violet walks across the rug and turns off the TV.

                                     CAESAR
                         Fuck, this happened before.  It's 
                         this shitty ear.  Born with it.  The 
                         batteries wore out in my aid.  I'm 
                         sorry.

                                     COP #1
                         It's all right, sir.

                                     COP #2
                         No big deal.

                                     CAESAR
                         Hey, can I get you guys a beer?

                                     COP #1
                         Not on duty, sorry.

                                     CAESAR
                         Oh, right.

                                     COP #2
                         But, uh, would you mind if I used 
                         your bathroom?

               Caesar's face tightens.

                                     CAESAR
                         Yeah, why not?  It's right there.

                                     COP #2
                         Thanks.

               He heads for the john.

               Violet watches Caesar back up to the bar, moving behind it.

                                     CAESAR
                         I'm going to make myself a drink, if 
                         that's okay?

                                     COP #1
                         Go right ahead, sir.

               INT.  BATHROOM NIGHT

               Cop #2 enters, walking right past the shower curtain.  We 
               hear his sigh as he starts to piss.

               INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Cop #1 walks onto the rug, looking around, turning to Violet.

                                     COP #1
                         This is a beautiful place.

                                     VIOLET
                         ...  thank you.

               She stares at his shoes on the rug.

               Watching everything, Caesar takes a sip of his drink.  He 
               slips his gun out and holds it at his side.

               INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT

               There is a bulge in the shower curtain where we imagine 
               Johnnie's arm is hanging.

               Slowly we slide down to the bottom edge of the plastic 
               curtain, where a drip of blood forms and --

               Plips into a small red spot on the white tile floor.

               INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Close on the heel of the cop's black shoe, where we can almost 
               see the blood seeping up through the oriental rug.

                                     COP #1
                         Is this a condo?

               Violet nods.

               Everyone turns when Cop #2 busts out of the bathroom.

                                     COP #2
                         Okay, let's roll.

               Cop #1 walks across the rug to the hardwood floor.  He turns 
               to Caesar.

                                     COP #1
                         Try to keep the extra batteries for 
                         your aid around.

                                     CAESAR
                         Good idea.

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Corky hears the cop say goodbye to Violet.  The door closes.  
               She isn't sure what she should do.

               Over her shoulder, she notes the bucket of paint.  She lets 
               the cops leave.

               INT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Caesar puts on a new shirt, the gun stuffed in his pants.

                                     CAESAR
                         Let's go.

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Corky rises at the sound of Caesar's door closing.

               We track her along the wall to the foyer as she follows the 
               faint sounds of Caesar and Violet's footsteps.

               INT.  HALL - NIGHT

               As they pass by, Violet looks up to the door of the empty 
               apartment, straight at the peephole.

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT Corky is pressed against the door, eye 
               at the peephole.

               She sees that Violet is afraid as the two women seem to speak 
               to each other with their eyes.

                                     CORKY
                         ...  shit.

               EXT.  PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               Caesar is on his knees, searching under the seats of Johnnie's 
               Mercedes.  Unable to find the money, he is ready to snap.

               From the main doors, Corky slips out of the building.  Hiding 
               behind a column, she sees Violet and Caesar across the lot.

               Corky moves behind the parked cars, the gun squeezed in her 
               hand.

               Violet edges away, on the verge of running, looking toward 
               the busy street.

               Standing, Caesar pounds on the car.

                                     CAESAR
                         Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!

                                     VIOLET
                         Caesar, someone could see us out 
                         here.

               Ignoring her, be tries to think.

                                     CAESAR
                         Get in.

               Still too far from them to do anytbing, Corky sees Caesar 
               slam the trunk.

                                     CAESAR
                         Get in!  It's got to be at his house.  
                         That's the only other place it could 
                         be.

               Violet looks around the lot, looking for some way out.

                                     CAESAR
                         Violet!  Now!

               Corky can only watch as Violet gets in and the car rips away.

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Alone, Corky stands over the bucket of paint.  She kicks it 
               with her boot-toe.

                                     CORKY
                         Two million dollars, Cork ...  Two 
                         million dollars ...

               She sighs, wondering how long she can make herself wait.

               EXT.  JOHNNIE'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

               The BMW is parked in front.

               INT.JOHNNIE'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

               Close on Caesar, as he rakes his sweaty hair back, his face 
               knotted in torment.

                                     CAESAR
                         Okay, I come in ...

               He turns as if he just came in through the front door.

               We see Johnnie's home has been laid to waste.  The furniture 
               is broken, cushions split open, pictures shattered, holes 
               punched in the drywall -- even the carpeting has been torn 
               up.

               Caesar doesn't look much better.

                                     CAESAR
                         I've got the money ...

               Huddled in a corner, Violet watches him.

                                     CAESAR
                         I can't wait to see the look on 
                         Caesar's face when he finds out.

               Caesar moves from the front door, trying to get into Johnnie's 
               head.

                                     CAESAR
                         Now I don't have much time ...

               He takes a couple of steps into the room.

                                     CAESAR
                         Got to put it someplace safe ...

               He looks at a closet.  It's gutted, searched 10 times already.

                                     CAESAR
                         ...  put it ...

               A couple more uneasy steps and he looks at a large over-turned 
               rolltop desk.

                                     CAESAR
                         ...  got it ...

               He starts looking around the room as if he is seeing for the 
               first time that it is destroyed.  He is near the breaking 
               point.

                                     VIOLET
                         C?

               His voice cracks.  There is nowhere else to look.

                                     CAESAR
                         Where did I put it?

               He explodes.  A terra cotta lamp sails across the room.

                                     CAESAR
                         Where's my fucking money?!  Fucking 
                         cocksuckers!  Where the fuck is it?!

               He smashes his forehead into the wall, denting the drywall.

                                     CAESAR
                         Ow.

               He holds his head, sinking to the ground.

                                     VIOLET
                         C?

               She sits next to him, putting a hand lightly on his shoulder.

                                     VIOLET
                         It's not here, Caesar.

                                     CAESAR
                         Where, then?

                                     VIOLET
                         I don't know.  it could be anywhere.  
                         We don't even know if he was alone.  
                         Please, Caesar, we don't have much 
                         time.  Let's get out of here.

               He knows what he has to do.  Digging through the debris, he 
               finds the phone.

                                     VIOLET
                         What are you doing?

                                     CAESAR
                         We're going to need some time.

                                     VIOLET
                         Who are you going to call?

               Already dialing, he does not answer

                                     VIOLET
                         Caesar?

               Ceaar takes a deep breath, mustering composure.

                                     MICKEY (V.O.)
                         Yeah?

                                     CAESAR
                         Hey, Mickey.

                                     VIOLET
                         Oh, God.

                                     MICKEY (V.O.)
                         Caesar?  What the fuck time is it?

                                     CAESAR
                         Mick, I know it's late, but there is 
                         a problem.  They haven't shown up 
                         yet.

                                     MICKEY (V.O.)
                         What?  They ain't there?

                                     CAESAR
                         No.  I don't know where they are.  I 
                         even called over at Johnnie's, but 
                         no answer.

                                     MICKEY (V.O.)
                         Okay.  Let me call around.  I'll see 
                         what I can do.  Don't go anywhere, 
                         okay?

                                     CAESAR
                         Okay, sure, Mick.

                                     MICKEY (V.O.)
                         Caesar, you still got the money?

               Caesar looks at Violet.

                                     CAESAR
                         Yeah, Mick.  I've got the money.  
                         I'm staring right at it.

                                     MICKEY (V.O.)
                         Good.  Sit tight.  I'll call you.

               He hangs up.

               INT. CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 

               Caesar drags himself in.  Violet closes the door behind them.

               Caesar moves into the room where it happened.  He is dizzy 
               and confused and does not want to be here.

               Violet turns him around.

                                     VIOLET
                         I'll start packing.  You know what 
                         you have to do.

               She turns him toward the bathroom.  He nods.

                                     CAESAR
                         I can use Johnnie's car, dump it in 
                         Lake Michigan ...  I need plastic 
                         bags ...  tape and rope ...

                                     VIOLET
                         Just hurry.

               Nodding, he heads for the kitchen.

               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Violet enters and goes straight for the phone.  She looks at 
               the blank wall as she dials.

                                     VIOLET
                         Please, Corky ...

               The phone rings.

               When Corky answers, Violet almost collapses with relief.

                                     VIOLET
                         Oh, thank God.

                                     CORKY
                         I'm still here.

                                     VIOLET
                         I was so afraid you ...

                                     CORKY
                         You don't quit on me, Violet, and I 
                         won't quit on you.

               INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT

               A box of Hefty bags tucked under his arm, a coil of 
               clothesline in his hand, Caesar searches through several 
               cabinets.

               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Violet glances at the door.

                                     VIOLET
                         Corky, it worked!  He's going to 
                         run.  He needs to take care of the 
                         bodies to buy himself time, but as 
                         soon as he leaves, it's over.

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Corky falls against the wall.

                                     VIOLET (V.O.)
                         just a little longer and it's ours.

               INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT

               Mumbling to himself, Caesar walks out of the kitchen, heading 
               for the bedroom.

               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Violet reaches out and touches the wall, as if she were 
               touching Corky.

                                     VIOLET
                         Corky, I have to tell you something 
                         ...

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Corky turns to the wall.

                                     CORKY
                         I know, Violet.  I know.

               Her fingers gently touch the wall as we travel up and over, 
               where we see they are actually touching the wall in the exact 
               same place.

                                     CORKY
                         It's why I'm still here.

               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Suddenly, Violet hears Caesar.

                                     CAESAR (V.O.)
                         Violet?

               As he opens the door, she slams down the phone.

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT

               The line cuts off.

               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Fear and panic paralyze Violet as Caesar drops everything, 
               grabbing for his gun.

                                     CAESAR
                         Who was that?

               He levels the gun at her.

                                     CAESAR
                         Who the fuck was that?

               She stands and be rushes at her, grabbing her by the throat.

                                     CAESAR
                         Was that Mickey?  Did you call Mickey?  
                         Did you?!

               She shakes her head and he throws her on the bed.  The gun 
               aimed at her, he picks up the phone and --

               Hits the redial.

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Unsure of what happened, Corky hears the phone ring and 
               answers it on reflex.

               Listening, she waits.

               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Caesar listens, waiting as long as he can.

                                     CAESAR
                         Mickey?  Is that you?

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Corky hangs up, jumping away from the wall.

               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Caesar hits the redial again.

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Panicking, Corkydoesn't answer it, but as it rings very loud 
               in the empty apartment, she realizes her mistake.

               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Turning slowly toward the wall, Caesar hears the phone ringing 
               in the empty apartment.

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Corky rips the plug out of the wall.

               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

               The line goes dead.

                                     CAESAR
                         Who is that?  Who is over there?!  
                         Tell me!

               She tries to get away, but he grabs her and slaps her to the 
               ground.

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT

               Corky hears Violet scream and that does it.  Gun in hand, 
               she flies at the door.

               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

               The door to the empty apartment slams shut and Caesar, hearing 
               it, starts to run --

               But Violet reaches out, catching his ankle, sending him 
               crashing to the dresser.

                                     VIOLET
                         Run!  Just run!

               INT HALL - NIGHT

               The door to Caesar's apartment is locked.  Corky falls to 
               one knee, whipping two lock picks from her earlobe.

               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Caesar raises the gun to pistol-whip Violet and she screams.

               INT.  HALL - NIGHT

               Working the lock, Corky hears Violet's scream cut off.

               She feels the tumblers click, and rotates the cylinder.

               A shadow stirs under the crack of the door as she hears 
               something that sounds like footsteps.  Corky freezes.

               Corky presses down low against the door beneath the peephole.

               She can almost feel Caesar beyond the door, but grits her 
               teeth and turns the doorknob.

               INT.  APARTMENT - NIGHT

               The door cracks open and Corky slips in, gun-first.  As she 
               moves into the room, we see Caesar behind her.

               He puts his gun to her head.

                                     CAESAR
                         Drop the fucking gun or die!

               Corky hesitates.

                                     CAESAR
                         Drop it!

               She does.

                                     CAESAR
                         Turn around.

               Rising from her crouch, she turns and he recognizes her.

                                     CAESAR
                         You!?  Holy fucking Christ!  You 
                         gotta be kidding me!

               He starts to laugh when she strikes --

               Knocking the gun, she punches him, slamming him back against 
               the door as --

               She twists, diving, grabbing her gun, just as --

               He steps and kicks her full in the face.

               INT.  CLOSET - NIGHT

               Still unconscious, Corky's head jerks, reacting to the kick.  
               We see the dried blood caked to her check where his kick 
               split the skin.  She is again swimming toward consciousness.

               We hear water splash, her face flinching as we move closer, 
               the sounds and voices echoing.

                                     CESAR (V.O.)
                         Wake up!  Come on, you fucking dyke!

               We hear Caesar slapping her.

                                     CAESAR (V.O.)
                         Wake up!

               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Corky's face is dripping with water as her eyes slowly blink 
               open.

               Coming into focus is Caesar, standing over her with an empty 
               glass in one hand.

                                     CAESAR
                         Good.

               Except for the gag, she is bound as we have seen her bound 
               in the closet.

               Caesar yanks out his gun and puts it to her head.

                                     CAESAR
                         I know everything now so I don't 
                         want to hear any "I don't know" 
                         bullshit, you understand?

               She sees Violet on the bed, also bound hand and foot.

                                     CAESAR
                         God, I should have seen this coming!  
                         The second I met you, I knew it.  
                         Everyone knows your kind can't be 
                         trusted!  Fucking queers make me 
                         sick.

               The gun digs into her cheek.

                                     CAESAR
                         But you tried to fuck the wrong guy.  
                         And I swear to you that I'm going to 
                         kill you for it.

               He thumbs back the hammer.

                                     CAESAR
                         Where is the money?

                                     VIOLET
                         Don't tell him --

                                     CAESAR
                         Shut up, Violet!

                                     VIOLET
                         He can't kill you --

               He aims the gun at Violet.

                                     CAESAR
                         Violet!

                                     VIOLET
                         Not until he has the money!

               He fires and she jumps as the bullet punches through the 
               wall behind her.

               His point made, he puts the gun back to Corky's head.

                                     CAESAR
                         Now, where the fuck is my money?

                                     CORKY
                         Lick me.

                                     CAESAR
                         Where is it?

                                     CORKY
                         Either pull the trigger or get that 
                         thing out of my face.

               Blood temperature rising again, Caesar pulls the gun back 
               and slaps her with it.

                                     CAESAR
                         Stupid cunt!

                                     VIOLET
                         Caesar, stop acting like an asshole 
                         and think --

                                     CAESAR
                         Don't try to tell me what to do.

                                     VIOLET
                         You need the money just like we do.

                                     CAESAR
                         Shut up, Violet.

                                     VIOLET
                         Let us go and we'll make a deal.

               He rushes at her, grabbing a fistful of her hair.

                                     CAESAR
                         Shut the fuck up!

               He looks at Corky.

                                     CAESAR
                         What did you do to her?!  This isn't 
                         my Violet!

               He looks at her as if unable to recognize her

                                     CAESAR
                         What did she do to you?

                                     VIOLET
                         Everything you couldn't.

               He shoves her down.

                                     CAESAR
                         You ungrateful bitch!  You had nothing 
                         before I met you.  You were nothing!

               He stomps around the room.

                                     CAESAR
                         Who gave you this place?  This 
                         apartment?

               He throws open the closet.

                                     CAESAR
                         Who gave us all of this?  I did!  I 
                         gave you everything!  I gave you 
                         this life!  I made you, Violet.  I 
                         saved you.

               He seems to believe what he is saying.

                                     CAESAR
                         I saved you.

                                     VIOLET
                         Ha!  What a load of crap.  Look at 
                         yourself, Caesar.  You're a thug.  
                         |You launder money for the mob.  You 
                         rent women like you rented this 
                         apartment.

               He doesn't want to hear this.

                                     VIOLET
                         Saved me?  You don't even know me.  
                         You used me, Caesar, just like I 
                         used you.  All part of the business.

                                     CAESAR
                         You betrayed me!

                                     VIOLET
                         You murdered Gino!

                                     CAESAR
                         I had to.  You made me.

                                     VIOLET
                         Bullshit, you killed him.  Not me.  
                         You did it because you couldn't stand 
                         the thought of Johnnie fucking you.

                                     CAESAR
                         Shut up!

               He slaps her.

                                     CAESAR
                         Okay, you want business, I'll give 
                         you the fucking business.

               He leans closer.  

                                     CAESAR
                         I'm going to make you beg just like 
                         Shelly did.  Just like Shelly!

               He storms out of the room.

               Corky looks up at Violet.

                                     VIOLET
                         I'm sorry, Corky ...

                                     CORKY
                         Don't be sorry.  Help me.

               She pulls at the ropes as Violet slides off the bed.

               INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT

               Caesar throws open the broom closet and grabs the clippers 
               that Mickey used to cut off Shelly's finger.

               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

               The two women are back-to-back, fingers working at each 
               other's knots when Caesar bursts into the room.

                                     CAESAR
                         Oh, no no no.

               Grabbing Corky by the boots, he drags her and flips her so 
               that she can now see Violet.

               He drops down onto Violet putting the clippers in front of 
               her face.

                                     CAESAR
                         Hey, Violet, you remember these?

               Her eyes widen with terror.  She starts to scream when he 
               stuffs a towel in her mouth.

               Laying against Violet, he turns to Corky.

                                     CAESAR
                         I'm going to start with her so you'll 
                         get a good idea what's coming.

               He takes hold of Violet's pinky finger, stretching it out.

                                     CAESAR
                         I'm going to ask you where the money 
                         is.  Every time you don't give me an 
                         answer, I'm going to cut off one 
                         finger.

                                     CORKY
                         No.

                                     CAESAR
                         When I reach ten, then I'll start 
                         with you.

               He puts the finger between the blades.

                                     CAESAR
                         Where is the money?

               Corky sees Violet thrashing helplessly.  She has no choice.  
               Her mouth opens as --

               The door buzzer rings.

               Caesar is distracted, trying to think who it could be.

                                     CAESAR
                         ...  Mickey.

               He sees the phone, where he dropped it, lying off the hook.

               The door buzzer rings again, more insistently.  Corky sees 
               him momentarily unnerved.

               He looks back at her.

                                     CAESAR
                         I said where --

               He starts to cut and Corky screams --

                                     CORKY
                         No!  I'll tell you!

               He stops, the door buzzing continuously.

                                     CORKY
                         It's over there in the empty 
                         apartment.

               As she speaks, the sound of the door buzzer changes.

                                     CORKY
                         I put it inside one of the paint 
                         drums.

               He is not looking at her; listening, he realizes that Mickey 
               is buzzing the other apartments.

               CAESAR stands as the buzzing stops.  He pulls out his gun 
               and aims it at Corky.

                                     CAESAR
                         I promised I would kill you.

               He cocks it.

                                     CORKY
                         You can't kill me yet.

                                     CAESAR
                         Why?

                                     CORKY
                         I could be lying.

               His hand start to shake with ftustration.  He is beginning 
               to hate this woman more than he ever hated Johnnie.

               Taking a deep breath, he eases back the hammer.

                                     CAESAR
                         You're going to wish to God you hadn't 
                         done that.

               He kicks her again, snapping her head back.

               After he leaves, Violet looks over and sees Corky lying 
               unconscious.

               INT.  HALL - NIGHT

               Caesar tries to open the door to the empty apartment but it 
               is locked.

                                     CAESAR
                         Fuck.

               At the end of the hall, the elevator "dings." Just as the 
               door opens, Caesar jumps back into his apartment.

               INT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

                                     CAESAR
                         Son of a bitch ...

               His mind a racing blur, he locks the door and runs back to 
               the bedroom.

               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

               With another towel, he gags Corky and drags her into the 
               closet.  In her pocket, he finds the key.

               He closes the doors, then hangs up the phone.

               Grunting, he hauls Violet up over his shoulder --

               When there is a knock on the door.

               INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Carrying Violet, he hurries to the kitchen, where he throws 
               Corky's gun into the freezer.  Mickey is banging on the door 
               as Caesar heads for the bathroom.

               INT.  BATHROOM

               Dropping Violet onto the floor, he reaches behind the curtain 
               and turns on the shower.

                                     CAESAR
                         Mickey will get in.  I know he will.

               We hear the water hitting the bodies while Caesar starts 
               tearing off his clothes.

                                     CAESAR
                         Violet.  I can kill you right now if 
                         that's what you want.  If you want 
                         to live, then you have to help me.  
                         I need you to make Mickey believe 
                         that everything is normal.

               He picks up his gun.

                                     CAESAR
                         Tell me, do you want to live?

               She stares hard at him and his gun, then nods.

                                     CAESAR
                         Good girl.

               INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               We move toward the door as the lock clicks open.

               INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT

               Violet's hands are untied.  She pulls off the gag and the 
               ropes at her feet.

               Naked, Caesar sticks his head under the shower spray, wetting 
               everything.

               INT.  LIVING ROOM

               Still dripping, Caesar walks into the room, a towel wrapped 
               around his waist, another towel in his hand.

               Mickey and Lou are standing in the middle of the room.

               Caesar jumps.

                                     CAESAR
                         Jesus Christ!

               Caesar holds his chest, laying it on a bit thick.

                                     CAESAR
                         Holy fuck, Mickey!  You scared the 
                         shit outta me.

               He sees they both are holding their guns.

                                     CAESAR
                         What is this?  what are you two doing, 
                         sneaking in here with your peckers 
                         in your hands?  You gonna do me, 
                         Mick?  Is that it?

               Mickey smiles, putting his gun away.

                                     MICKEY
                         No, Cease.  There was no answer.

                                     CAESAR
                         I thought I heard someone knocking.

                                     MICKEY
                         I was buzzing, I was knocking, but I 
                         guess you couldn't hear me on account 
                         of being in the shower.

                                     CAESAR
                         Yeah, it was Violet's idea.  I was 
                         so wound up about Gino, she was trying 
                         to help me relax.

                                     MICKEY
                         That Violet is one nice lady.  Wish 
                         someone would help me relax.

                                     CAESAR
                         Shit, Mick, come on in, let me get 
                         you a drink.  Sit down, Lou.

               Behind the bar, he sets down the towel be was holding and we 
               see the gun hidden inside it.

               INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT

               Violet watches through a sliver of open door, her mind already 
               working.

               INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Caesar is making the drinks.

                                     MICKEY
                         We was worried about you, Cease.

                                     CAESAR
                         Me?  Why?

                                     MICKEY
                         We went over to Johnnie's place just 
                         to check it out and it was busted 
                         up, Bad.

               Caesar hands him a drink.

                                     MICKEY
                         I started thinking maybe it's about 
                         the money so I call you, but all I 
                         get is the busy signal.  I figure 
                         the phone is off the hook, that's 
                         why I come rushing over here.

                                     CAESAR
                         Oh Christ, the phone ...  That was a 
                         fucking stupid thing to do, wasn't 
                         it?

                                     MICKEY
                         Hey, if Violet was helping me relax, 
                         I'd probably do the same thing.

               Mickey smiles as he sips his drink.

               INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT

               Violet stands and goes to the shower curtain.  She reaches 
               in and turns off the water.  Steadying herself, she pulls 
               back the curtain, exposing the wet, bloody bodies.

               INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Mickey is looking at the furniture.

                                     MICKEY
                         Cease, can I ask you something?

                                     CAESAR
                         Yeah.

                                     MICKEY
                         Why'd you move all the furniture 
                         around?

               The knot in Caesar's stomach tightens.

                                     MICKEY
                         Let me guess.  That was Violet's 
                         idea, too.

               He laughs, and Lou laughs with him.

                                     CAESAR
                         Actually, yeah, she was nervous about 
                         Gino coming, wanted everything to 
                         look right.  You know women, Mick.

                                     MICKEY
                         Sure, Cease.  They make us do stupid 
                         things, don't they.

               Caesar smiles feebly.

               INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT

               Violet has pulled up Johnnie's body and is digging through 
               his coat pockets, searching for something.

               INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Mickey sees the briefcase still on the coffee table.

                                     MICKEY
                         Is that the money?

                                     CAESAR
                         Yeah, that's it.

               Caesar puts his hand inside the towel as Mickey walks across 
               the rug.

                                     MICKEY
                         That fucking Shelly.  I gotta hand 
                         it to the guy, but Jesus, if I were 
                         him I would have bailed a long time 
                         ago.  I mean, how much money does a 
                         man need?

               Talking to Lou, be picks up the case and walks back, somehwo 
               moving right between the wet spots.

                                     MICKEY
                         I remember I was just staring at all 
                         this goddamn money, Shelly down on 
                         his knees, and the next thing I know, 
                         Johnnie just blows his head off.

               He slaps the case up onto the bar.

                                     MICKEY
                         What a fucking mess.  Johnnie's 
                         laughing his ass off and that's when 
                         Caesar lost it and - Boom.  He 
                         coldcocked him.  Fucking coldcocks 
                         Johnnie Marzzone.

               He thumbs the latches but the case is still locked.

                                     MICKEY
                         Hey, Caesar, where's the key?

                                     CAESAR
                         The key, yeah, the key's in my pants 
                         in the bathroom.

                                     MICKEY
                         Fuck it, I don't need the key.

               Caesar takes the smallest breath.

                                     MICKEY
                         I didn't need a key to get in here, 
                         did I?

               He pulls out a lock-pick and starts working the lock.  The 
               muscles in Caesar's forearm bulge as he tightly squeezes his 
               gun.

               He is slipping toward that same desperate choice.  He is 
               going to attack when --

               Across the room, the phone rings.

               Everyone looks at it.

                                     MICKEY
                         Who the hell could that be?

               The phone is near the couch.  Caesar doesn't want to let go 
               of the gun.

               The phone continues to ring.

                                     MICKEY
                         You gonna answer it?

               INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT

               Violet has Johnnie's cellular phone.

               Watching through the cracked door, Violet sees Caesar cross 
               to answer the phone.

                                     CESAR (V.O.)
                         Hello?

                                     VIOLET
                         Hello, Caesar.  This is Gino.

               Caesar looks toward the bathroom.

                                     CAESAR (V.O.)
                         What?

                                     VIOLET
                         You're blowing your only chance.  
                         Act like I'm Gino.

               INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Caesar's eyes light up.

                         Holy shit, I don't believe it!  We've 
                         been going crazy over here, Gino!

                                     VIOLET (V.O.)
                         Good boy.

               Mickey jumps up.

                                     CAESAR
                         It's Gino!  It's Gino!

                                     MICKEY
                         Where in the hell is he?

               INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT

                                     VIOLET
                         We were in a car accident --

                                     CAESAR (V.O.)
                         They were in a car accident.

                                     VIOLET
                         But everybody is all right.

               INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

                                     CAESAR
                         They're all fine.  Just bruises and 
                         shit.

                                     VIOLET (V.O.)
                         Now you listen to me, asshole, I 
                         know your gun is behind the bar ...

                                     MICKEY
                         Un-fucking-believable.  I called 
                         those highway patrol dumb fucks.

                                     CAESAR
                         Ssh!  I can't hear Gino!

                                     VIOLET (V.O.)
                         We make a deal or I come out and 
                         hand this phone to Mickey.

                                     CAESAR
                         I'm listening.

               INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT

               Violet has her robe over her dress, wrapping her hair in a 
               towel, making sure the bruise on her forehead is hidden.

                                     VIOLET
                         I want what's mine, half the money.  
                         We get rid of Mickey, no one else 
                         dies.  No one.  Say yes, I understand.

                                     CAESAR (V.O.)
                         Yes, I understand.

                                     VIOLET
                         Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the 
                         Kennedy, in the waiting room, but 
                         stay on the phone until I come out.

                                     CAESAR (V.O.)
                         Sure, Gino, sure.

               INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Out of the corner of his eye, he watches Violet come out of 
               the bathroom.

                                     CAESAR
                         St.  Mary's off the Kennedy, sure.  
                         Okay, Gino.

               Mickey sees Violet.

                                     VIOLET
                         Mickey?  What are you doing here?

                                     MICKEY
                         Violet, it's Gino and Johnnie.  They 
                         were in a car accident.

                                     VIOLET
                         Oh my God.  Was anyone hurt?

                                     MICKEY
                         I think everything is okay.

               Caesar hangs up.

                                     CAESAR
                         They're at St.  Mary's in the waiting 
                         room.

               Mick is already on the way.

                                     MICKEY
                         I can't fit them all in my car so 
                         give me your keys.  You drive my 
                         car, Lou.

               Caesar sees Violet walking toward the kitchen.

                                     CAESAR
                         Sure, Mickey, sure.  Violet!

               She stops, looking straight at the freezer.

                                     CAESAR
                         Go grab my car keys from my pants in 
                         the bathroom.

               She turns to him.

                                     CAESAR
                         Please, help us out, Mickey wants to 
                         get going.

               She turns to the bathroom.

                                     MICKEY
                         They might want to go straight to 
                         the airport and back to Miami, so I 
                         better take this.

               He grabs the briefcase.

                                     MICKEY
                         You got the key?

                                     CAESAR
                         Oh yeah.  Violet!

               INT.  CLOSET - NIGHT

               Where Corky remains bound, still unconscious.  We hear the 
               name echo in her head.

                                     CAESAR (V.O.)
                         Violet!

               Suddenly, her eyes blink open.

                                     CAESAR (V.O.)
                         Violet!

               Her eyes blink again as she tries to focus.

               INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Violet hands Mickey the keys for the car and the case.

                                     MICKEY
                         Thanks, V.

               He kisses her on the cheek.

                                     CAESAR
                         Call me as soon as you get him.

                                     MICKEY
                         Leave your phone on the hook.

               Mickey and Lou leave.  Violet is staring at Caesar, standing 
               near the door.

               In his right hand he is holding the other towel.  He smiles.

                                     CAESAR
                         Now that's teamwork.

                                     VIOLET
                         I should have let him kill you.

                                     CAESAR
                         You know he would have done you, 
                         too.

                                     VIOLET
                         I knew I couldn't trust you.

               He drops the towel, raising the gun.

                                     CAESAR
                         I said I'd let you live and I will.

               He smiles again.

                                     CAESAR
                         Maybe.

               INT.  CLOSET - NIGHT

               Corky is wide awake, thrashing-mad, biting her gag, struggling 
               to get free.

               INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Caesar pulls his pants on.

                                     CAESAR
                         Time to find out if the dyke was 
                         stupid enough to lie.

               Caesar drags Violet througb the front door.

               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

               The closet doors burst open as Corky fights her way out.

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Caesar sees the buckets of paint.

               He rips the lid from the nearest and kicks it over.  Paint 
               spills out across the floor.

               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Suddenly Corky stops; something has caught her eye.  We drop 
               down, focusing on what she is staring at --

               The clippers.

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT

               He kicks over the second bucket and the bag tumbles out with 
               the rushing flow of paint.

                                     CAESAR
                         Yes!

               He turns to Violet, who is already running out the door.

                                     CAESAR
                         No!

               INT.  HALL - NIGHT

               Violet turns down the hall, bare feet beating against the 
               floor.

               Caesar slices out of the room behind her.

                                     CAESAR
                         Violet!

               He aims the gun as she hurls her self into the emergency 
               door.

                                     CAESAR
                         Fuck!

               INT.  STAIRWELL - NIGHT

               She flies, hands on the rail, spiraling down each flight as 
               he charges after her.

                                     CAESAR
                         Goddammit, Violet!  Stop!  Now!

               INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Straining, Corky's fingers curl around the handle of the 
               clippers.

               INT.  LOBBY - NIGHT

               Violet smashes through the door, but instead of turning to 
               the main doors, she runs straight for the elevators.

               She pounds the button and waits.

                                     VIOLET
                         Come on.  Come on, please.

               She hears Caesar coming just as the elevator opens.

               Caesar crashes out of the stair door, running toward the 
               exit.  When he doesn't see Violet, he turns to the sound of 
               the elevator --

               And catches a glimpse of her as the doors close.

                                     CAESAR
                         Oh, you bitch.  You fucking bitch.

               Taking a really deep breath, he throws open the door to the 
               stairs.

               INT.  ELEVATOR - NIGHT

               Violet takes Johnnie's cellular phone from the robe pocket 
               and dials a number.

               Mickey answers on the car phone.

                                     VIOLET
                         Mickey!  Oh God, Mickey!

                                     MICKEY (V.O.)
                         Violet?

               Whispering, she acts terrified.

                                     VIOLET
                         He made me help him, Mickey, God, I 
                         was so afraid.  It was Caesar, all 
                         Caesar.  You have to help me.  He's 
                         coming - Oh God!

               She hangs up, eyes blazing.

               INT.  STAIRWELL - NIGHT

               Sweat pouring off him, Caesar climbs the stairs.

               INT.  HALL - NIGHT

               The elevator opens, Violet bolts out.  She runs down the 
               hall, past the empty apartment, back to her door.

                                     VIOLET
                         Corky?

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT

               She rushes to the bedroom, where she finds the coils of cut 
               rope.

                                     VIOLET
                         Corky!

               She looks at the wall separating the apartment.

               INT.  HALL - NIGHT

               Caesar half-falls out of the stair door, drenched with sweat.

               INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT

               Gun ready, Caesar throws open the door.

               Spread out like a pond of milk is the spilled paint, but --

               The money is gone.

               Leading away from the white pool are boot prints and the 
               drip trail of the plastic bag.

               The tracks lead to the bathroom.

               Caesar kicks open the bathroom door and finds the bag of 
               money next to Corky's empty boots.

               Over his shoulder we see Corky already swinging a massive 
               pipe wrench.

               At the last second he is able to duck, falling to the ground 
               as --

               The doorjamb splinters with a terrible metal crunch.

               Before he can recover and shoot, she brings the wrench down 
               on his arm.

               He screams as the gun hits the floor.

               She kicks it, sending it skidding, hydroplaning across the 
               paint pool to the other side, leaving a jet trail of white 
               swirls and spirals on the wood floor.

               They fight, Corky raining blows onto his back and flailing 
               arm until --

               He catches her foot, flipping her as he clambers up.

               Scrambling across the paint, slipping, crawling for the gun 
               when --

               Violet bursts in, pointing the gun from the freezer.

                                     VIOLET
                         Stop!

               Caesar, on hands and knees, looks at her, then at his gun 
               still out of reach.

                                     VIOLET
                         It's over, Caesar.  I called Mickey.  
                         He's on his way.

               Violet stands for long time, the gun trained carefully on 
               him as he rises from the floor.

               Panting, Caesar watches her like a mad dog.

                                     VIOLET
                         Get out of here, Caesar.  If you 
                         want to live you had better start 
                         running.

               He smiles.

                                     CAESAR
                         All these years and you still don't 
                         know me, Violet.

               She glances down and sees the paint-covered gun.

                                     CAESAR
                         But I know you.

               He turns to the gun.

                                     VIOLET
                         Caesar, don't.

                                     CAESAR
                         What are you going to do, V?  Shoot 
                         me?  Kill me in cold blood?  I don't 
                         think so.  I'll tell you why.  If 
                         you had it in you to pull that 
                         trigger, you would have done it a 
                         long time ago.  If I was you, I would 
                         have killed me the minute I brought 
                         the money home.  But you didn't and 
                         I know why, because you don't want 
                         to kill me.  Do you, V?  Do you?  
                         No, I know you don't.

                                     VIOLET
                         Caesar, you don't know shit.

               Violet fires --

               The bullet hits Caesar in the shoulder, knocking him off 
               balance.  Another doubles him over as blood speckles the 
               pool of paint.

               She empties the gun into him.  His body arcs back, falling, 
               splashing into the paint.

               Caesar's blood bubbles out bright red against the glistening 
               white.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - DAY

               It is empty and clean.  In the bedroom, only a few hangers 
               are left dangling in the open closet.

               EXT.  PARKING LOT - DAY

               Mickey is standing with Violet, next to his Lincoln Town 
               Car.

                                     VIOLET
                         I will never understand it, Mickey.  
                         You didn't even call the police.

                                     MICKEY
                         I told you, the family doesn't want 
                         the police around.  We want to take 
                         care of it ourselves and we will.  
                         I'll find him.  I swear I will.

                                     VIOLET
                         I know you will.

                                     MICKEY
                         Sure you're going to be okay?  I 
                         mean, if you're having second 
                         thoughts, my offer still stands.

                                     VIOLET
                         Thanks, Mickey, but I need to get 
                         out, you know?  Get away from all of 
                         this.

               Mickey nods.

                                     VIOLET
                         But thanks.  Thanks for everything.

               She hugs him and he kisses her.  Then he gets in his car.  
               Violet watches him drive away and knows that she is free.

               EXT.  CORKY'S APARTMENT

               Corky sitting on stoop, patient, like a rock.

               She looks up as she hears high heels, and smiles at --

               Violet standing there, new outfit.

               Corky stands in front of her.

                                     CORKY
                         Hey.

                                     VIOLET
                         Hey.

                                     CORKY
                         How'd it go?

                                     VIOLET
                         I'm here, aren't I?

               Corky nods.

                                     CORKY
                         I guess we should get out of here.

               Violet nods.

               Corky digs out alarm keys, aims, fires.  Violet turns, looks.

               New truck.

               Violet turns to Corky, eyebrow cocked.

                                     CORKY
                         Thought we might need a getaway car.

               Smiles, they get in.

               INT.  TRUCK

               Corky admires truck.

                                     CORKY
                         You know what the difference is 
                         between us, Violet?

                                     VIOLET
                         No.

                                     CORKY
                         ...  Me neither.

               Lean for kiss, as dolly in.

          EXT JERSEY CITY- DAY
          
          Dec 21st. Clear sky, snow on the ground. Cold as fuck. With
          the sounds of laughter and music, we MOVE IN ON:
          
          
          INT NEWSPAPER OFFICE- DAY
          
          An office Xmas party in progress, not a pretty sight: tipsy
          receptionists laugh and spill drinks on the rug, red-faced
          reporters loosen their belts and burp cocktail weiners...
          
          MOVING QUICKLY THROUGH THE PARTY TO AN OPEN OFFICE DOOR.
          Arriving just in time for the door to SLAM in our face.
          
          
          INT OFFICE- DAY
          
          A woman stomps back over to her desk and picks up her pen.
          MEET CASSIDY DALEY (dirty blond, striking, manic energy). Ink-
          stained fingers, notepads in every pocket: Cass doesn't have
          time for office parties, she's working.
          
          Her door cracks open and STEWART (almost as good looking as
          he thinks he is) appears, holding a Kahlua bottle.
          
                              CASS
                    I'm working, Stewart.
          
                              STEWART
                    Come on, take a break. (enticing)
                    I've got Kahlua...
          
          Cass picks up a stapler and LAUNCHES it at Stewart's head.
          Stewart DUCKS OUT just in time. The phone rings. Answering:
          
                              CASS
                    Cassidy Daley. Talk to me.
          
                              JIMMY (O.S.)
                    It's Jimmy. Tell me you love me.
          
                              CASS
                    Depends on what you got.
          
                              JIMMY (O.S.)
                    I've got a confirmed place and
                    time.
          
          Cass is on her feet, excited.
          
                              CASS
                    I love you! So, when? Where?
          
                                                                   2.
          
          
                              JIMMY (O.S.)
                    You think I'm gonna say this shit
                    over the phone? I could get killed.
                    Just meet me at the usual place.
                    Oh, and Cass? This one's gonna cost
                    an extra hundred.
          
          CLICK. He hangs up. Cass drops the phone, grabs her stuff.
          
          
          INT NEWSPAPER OFFICE- DAY
          
          Cass races for the elevator, Stewart hot on her heels:
          
                              STEWART
                    Where ya going?
          
                              CASS
                    Hooters. I go there for the hot
                    wings.
          
                              STEWART
                    Please. Nobody goes there for the
                    hot wings. You got a tip.
          
                              CASS
                    You got a hundred bucks on you?
          
          Stewart considers this, then hands her 5 20's.
          
                              STEWART
                    Now are you gonna let me in on it?
          
                               CASS
                    Sorry. No can do. I have to protect
                    my source.
          
                              STEWART
                    You know what? We need to talk
                    about our relationship.
          
                              CASS
                    We don't have a relationship. We
                    made out 3 years ago in the copy
                    room. I was drunk. I was broken-
                    hearted. I would have made out with
                    the xerox machine.
          
                              STEWART
                    Yes, but you made out with me.
          
                              CASS
                    I have to go.
          
                                                                   3.
          
          
          She exits. He shouts after her:
          
                              STEWART
                    I want in on that story!

          Cass driving like a maniac, doing the one thing she loves:
          TRACKING A STORY...
          
          
          EXT DUNKING DONUTS PARKING LOT- DAY
          
          MOVING IN ON- A BEAT-UP HONDA CIVIC (JIMMY'S CAR) IN THE BACK
          CORNER OF THE LOT...
          
          INT JIMMY'S CAR- DAY
          
          JIMMY (20's, goatee, Mets baseball hat, nervous) sits in his
          car, rolling a cigarette while he waits for Cass.
          
          Jimmy puts the cigarette in his mouth and pulls out a
          lighter. Just as he flips the lighter open, HIS FRONT
          WINDSHIELD EXPLODES. A MAN HOLDING A TIRE IRON (MAHLER,
          heavyset, crew-cut, rarely speaks, all business) reaches
          through the broken window, AND DRAGS JIMMY OUT OF THE CAR...
          
          
          EXT DUNKING DONUTS PARKING LOT- DAY
          
          Cass drives into the lot and pulls up next to Jimmy's car.
          
                              CASS
                    Hey, Jimmy, I...
          
          She realizes he is not in the car. THEN SHE SEES THE BROKEN
          GLASS ALL OVER THE DRIVER'S SEAT.
          
                                 CASS
                    Jimmy?
          
          SCREECHING TIRES behind her. Cass glances up and sees JIMMY'S
          BASEBALL HAT IN THE BACK WINDOW OF A GREY CHEVY. The Chevy is
          racing out into traffic. Cass throws her car into reverse...
          
          
          INT CASS' CAR- DAY
          
          Cass tries to follow the grey Chevy, but GETS STUCK AT A RED
          LIGHT. Shit. She looks around, decides fuck it, and HITS THE
          GAS. Her car leaps into the intersection. SIRENS.
          
                                                                   4.
          
          
          Cass looks into her rearview mirror: A PATROL CAR IS RIGHT
          BEHIND HER, signalling for her to pull over. Up ahead, the
          Chevy is getting away.
          
          Cass debates: pull over? Or follow the story? No contest. SHE
          SLAMS ON THE GAS AND HER CAR SURGES OUT OF FRAME...
          
          
          EXT STREET- DAY
          
          Cass' car SPEEDS down the street, A COP CAR IN CLOSE
          PURSUIT...
          
          
          INT CASS' CAR- DAY
          
          Cass is losing sight of the Chevy. She races around traffic
          and is suddenly HEADED STRAIGHT FOR THE SIDE OF A MOVING VAN.
          She panics, WRENCHING the wheel to the right...
          
          
          EXT STREET- DAY
          
          CASS' CAR JUMPS THE CURB, CROSSES A LAWN, AND SKIDS TO A HALT
          ON THE FRONT STEPS OF A CHURCH. THE COP CAR RACES UP AND
          BLOCKS HER IN.
          
          
          EXT CHURCH- MOMENTS LATER
          
          Cass is out of her car now, arguing with a cop who has her by
          the arm:
          
                              CASS
                    Let go of me, I'm a reporter, I'm
                    warning you...
          
          The cop pulls her towards his squad car. Cass leans over and
          SINKS HER TEETH INTO THE COP'S HAND. The cop screams.
          
          FREEZE FRAME.
          
          CHIRON: "24 HOURS LATER"
          
          CLOSE ON- A NEWSPAPER COLUMN WITH CASS' PHOTO: windswept
          hair, head tilted coyly, smile that says "I'm on top of the
          world. Beneath the photo, the byline: "CASSIDY DALEY".
          
          Someone whistles "We Wish You a Merry Xmas" as a MARKER
          improves on the photo: MOUSTACHE, BUCK-TEETH, PIMPLES. Then a
          MATCH enters frame, and SETS THE PHOTO ON FIRE.

                                                                     5.
          
          
          PULL BACK TO REVEAL:
          
          INT CRYSTAL'S BAR/JERSEY CITY- LATE AFTERNOON
          
          Holding the flaming photo, MEET MILO: rumpled shirt, messy
          hair, looks like he slept on the floor. The bartender
          (CRYSTAL, 50's, Eastern European) scowls at him:
          
                              CRYSTAL
                    What did I say about the fires?
          
                              MILO
                    You said "please set fires in my
                    bar". Wait, no, that's not right.
                    "Please don't set fires in my bar".
                    (off her look) Ok, jeez, you try to
                    get in the holiday spirit...
          
          He drops the flaming photo to the floor, pours his drink on
          it, then GRINDS IT TO PIECES WITH HIS SHOE.
          
                              CRYSTAL
                    Shouldn't you be working?
          
                              MILO
                    That's the beauty of my job,
                    Crystal. Tracking down idiots is
                    something you can do pretty much
                    anywhere. See, there's one...
          
          He points to A DRUNK DRAPED OVER THE JUKEBOX, MOURNFULLY
          SINGING ALONG TO CHRISTINA AQUILLERA'S "I AM BEAUTIFUL".
          
                              MILO
                    And there's another one...
          
          Pointing to A WOMAN TRYING TO RIP A PAY PHONE FROM THE WALL.
          
                              MILO
                    And there's...
          
          Glances at the TV, which is showing LIVE FOOTAGE OF AN XMAS
          PARADE. Looks closer, recognizes someone, groans:
          
                              MILO
                    I don't believe it. That idiot. (to
                    Crystal) Save my seat.
          
          Tosses back his drink and SPLITS.
          
                                                                      6.
          
          
          EXT CRYSTAL'S BAR- LATE AFTERNOON
          
          Milo climbs into a Cadillac: dents, patches of rust, cracked
          windshield, bumper askew.
          
          RACK TO: half a block away, A DARK SEDAN IDLES AT THE CURB.
          
          
          INT DARK SEDAN- LATE AFTERNOON
          
          The man behind the wheel (DWIGHT, large, babyfaced, Metallica
          t-shirt) eats a hoagie as he watches Milo get into his car.
          
                              DWIGHT
                    There you are, you dipshit.
          
          He takes a last bite then tosses the sandwich and pulls away
          from the curb, tailing the Cadillac.
          
          
          EXT JERSEY CITY- LATE AFTERNOON
          
          MOVE IN ON- the parade we just saw on TV. Baton twirlers in
          Santa Hats. Men dressed like reindeer, pulling a sleigh. A
          boys choir singing "Joy to the World", the kids dressed like
          orphans that escaped a Broadway musical.
          
          A beautiful scene, if you like that sort of thing.
          
          RACK TO- the Cadillac, half a block away, cruising sideways
          into a spot just beneath a "TEMPORARY TOW-AWAY" sign. MILO
          climbs out of the car. Shoves his way through the crowd to
          the curb, cracking open a can of Pabst.
          
          Milo does not like this sort of thing. He scans the crowd
          impatiently.
          
          Meanwhile, THE CAR THAT WAS FOLLOWING HIM parks half a block
          away. DWIGHT emerges and heads for:
          
          MILO, who has just found what he's looking for. The reindeer
          are passing him and he makes eye contact with RUDOLPH, who
          does a double-take.
          
                              MILO
                    Yeah, you. Rudolph. Come here, you
                    fucking ding-dong.
          
          Milo takes a step towards Rudolph and DWIGHT APPEARS IN
          MILO'S PATH, BLOCKING HIM.
          
                              DWIGHT
                    We have to stop meeting this way.
          
                                                                      7.
          
          
                              MILO
                    Not now, Dwight.
          
                              DWIGHT
                    You owe my boss money.
          
                              MILO
                        (LAUGHING)
                    Hey, I owe everybody money.
          
          Suddenly, DWIGHT PUNCHES MILO IN THE GUT. Milo doubles-up,
          gasping, then BRINGS HIS HEAD UP QUICK, CATCHING DWIGHT ON
          THE CHIN. Dwight goes flying sideways and MEETS A POLICE
          BARRIER FACE-FIRST. Ouch.
          
          The barrier tips over, knocking over the one next to it. THE
          REST GO LIKE DOMINOS. Milo turns to see that RUDOLPH HAS
          DISAPPEARED. Then he catches sight of the ANTLERS, working
          their way through the crowd. Milo lunges after him and
          Rudolph drags other reindeer with him as he tries to avoid
          Milo. THE SLEIGH FLIPS. Santa tumbles from the sled. PACKAGES
          RAIN DOWN ON REINDEER LIKE SHRAPNEL.
          
          All of a sudden, IT'S THE XMAS FROM HELL: BLOODY REINDEER
          STUMBLING AROUND, SANTA UNCONSCIOUS IN THE GUTTER, KIDS
          SCREAMING, PARENTS PANICKING. Meanwhile, MILO IS GAINING ON
          RUDOLPH, who picks up one of the packages and throws it. IT
          CRACKS MILO IN THE HEAD. Just what Milo has been waiting for:
          
                              MILO
                        (BEAMING)
                    I am so happy you did that.
          
          Milo TACKLES RUDOLPH TO THE GROUND. Around them, people
          scream and scatter. One boy bursts into tears:
          
                              BOY
                    That man is killing Rudolph!
          
          SIRENS. Uh-oh. Cops SWARM the scene, surrounding Milo and
          Rudolph, GUNS DRAWN. The LEAD COP (GELMAN, short, over-
          zealous) steps forward:
          
                              GELMAN
                    Release the reindeer!
          
          Release the reindeer? Milo looks around. He's got 8 or so
          guns pointed his way and Rudolph gasping at his feet. MILO
          STARTS TO LAUGH. Gelman bristles:
          
                              GELMAN
                    Hands behind your head, asshole!
          
                                                                     8.
          
          
                              MILO
                    Take it easy, skippy, I'm just
                    doing my job.
          
          Milo flashes his ID. Gelman inspects it, rolls his eyes.
          
                              GELMAN
                    Bounty hunter. Figures. Why don't
                    you get a real job?
          
                              MILO
                    So I can be like you patrol boys
                    and sit around all day with my
                    thumb up my ass?
          
          Gelman turns bright red.
          
                              GELMAN
                    What did you just say?
          
          Suddenly, a sergeant (BOBBY, late 30's, obnoxious but
          likeable, Milo's ex-partner) marches onto the scene, takes
          one look at Milo and laughs.
          
                              BOBBY
                    Milo Boyd. I shoulda known.
          
                              GELMAN
                    Sarg, you know this asshole?
          
                              BOBBY
                    Yeah. I know this asshole. Guy used
                    to be one of us.
          
          RACK TO- DWIGHT, NOSE BLEEDING, MELTING BACK INTO SHADOW...
          
          
          EXT STREET- MOMENTS LATER
          
          Milo drags Rudolph through the crowd towards his car. Bobby
          follows, shaking his head, bemused expression on his face.
          
                              BOBBY
                    Look, Milo, I know this is a tough
                    time of year for you...
          
                              MILO
                    This isn't a tough time of year for
                    me. It's Christmas. Who doesn't
                    love Christmas?
          
                              BOBBY
                    ...and I try to be sensitive to
                    your situation...
          
                                                                    9.
          
          
                              MILO
                    What situation? Being a man who
                    works his own hours and has his
                    freedom and lives the high life?
          
                              BOBBY
                    ...because I realize you're
                    unhappy.
          
                              MILO
                    Unhappy? Are you kidding me, Bob?
                    Look at me: I'm the happiest man
                    alive.
          
          Just then, they come to where Milo left his car. IT'S GONE.
          Bobby squints at the huge "TOW-AWAY" sign:
          
                              BOBBY
                    That sign is pretty hard to see.
          
          And with that, Milo loses it:
          
                              MILO
                    AAAHHH!
          
          He rips the sign off the pole. Stomps on it. Kicks it. Tries
          to shred it with his teeth. Hmm. He doesn't really seem like
          the happiest man alive. Rudolph, to Bobby:
          
                              RUDOLPH
                    Take me to jail. Please?
          
          
          INT BOBBY'S CAR- EARLY EVENING
          
          Bobby's car is decorated with photos of his many children,
          all of whom look exactly like him, even the girls, poor kids.
          
          Milo's in front by Bobby, Rudolph's handcuffed in the back.
          
                              BOBBY
                    Ok, I got one for ya: why doesn't
                    Santa have any children? Cause he
                    only comes once a year and when he
                    does, it's down a chimney.
          
          Rudolph snickers. Milo does not. Bobby glances at Milo.
          
                              BOBBY
                    So. Have you talked to her lately?
          
                              MILO
                    Talked to who?
          
                                                                  10.

                    you think?
          
                              MILO
                    I haven't talked to her in three
                    years, why would I talk to her now?
          
                              BOBBY
                    Well, for one thing, so you can
                    stop taking out your rage on
                    innocent bystanders.
          
                              RUDOLPH
                        (piping up from the back)
                    Talk to her, man. For real.
          
          Milo reaches back, gags Rudolph with his own scarf.
          
                              BOBBY
                    Do what you want. But this kind of
                    shit will eat a hole in your
                    intestines, you don't deal with it.
          
          
          EXT POLICE STATION/JERSEY CITY- EARLY EVENING
          
          They pull up. Milo exits the car, pulls Rudolph from the
          back. Bobby leans out.
          
                              BOBBY
                    Hey, why don't you come by the
                    precinct tomorrow for our Xmas
                    bash?
          
                              MILO
                    I'm not invited. I'm not a cop
                    anymore, remember?
          
                              BOBBY
                    Fuck that, I'm inviting you.
          
                              MILO
                    I don't know, Bob. I'm sorta busy.
          
                              BOBBY
                    That's what I'm worried about.
                    (sighing) Just...take it easy, Ok?
          
          Bobby really seems worried, but Milo waves him off. Bobby
          drives over, parks by other cop cars. Gets out, mingles with
          some cops. Laughter, inside jokes. Milo watches from afar.
          
                                                                   11.

                    You should go to that party, man.
                    Seriously. You need it.
          
                              MILO
                    Do I look like I need advice from a
                    grown man in antlers?
          
          Milo gags Rudolph and drags him into the station.
          
          FADE TO BLACK. OVER BLACK:
          
                              VOICE
                    Milo. Hey. Princess...
          
          INT SID'S BAIL BONDS/JERSEY CITY- MORNING
          
          Hazy pieces: a tilting clock on the wall. A battered metal
          desk. Filing cabinets, spitting up papers. A man, SID (wound
          sorta tight, Milo's best friend) peers down at us:
          
                              SID
                    You're drooling on my sofa.
          
          Milo unsticks his face from the leather couch, wobbles
          upright. Are the walls throbbing, or is it just him?
          
                              SID
                    You do have an apartment, don't
                    you? With a bed of some kind?
          
          Milo grunts. Sid hands him a coffee.
          
                              SID
                    Heard you shut down 5th Street
                    yesterday. Gave every kid in the
                    county the gift of nightmares.
          
                              MILO
                    Hey, I'm a giving kind of guy.
                    Anyway, what do you care? I brought
                    your guy in, right?
          
          Milo holds out his hand, palm up. Sid COUNTS MONEY INTO HIS
          PALM.
          
          
          EXT SID'S BAIL BONDS/JERSEY CITY- MORNING
          
          Swearing under his breath, Sid is trying to stuff a Xmas tree
          into the back of a station wagon. At least half of the tree
          is hanging out of the back. Milo drinks a beer and watches.
          
                                                                 12.
          
          
                              SID
                    You gonna give me a hand, or just
                    stand there killing your liver?
          
                              MILO
                    Is that a trick question?
          
          Sid glares at him. Milo sighs, puts down his beer, and grabs
          part of the tree.
          
                              SID
                    So I told her, fine, I'd handle
                    Xmas this year. I mean, what's to
                    handle? You buy a tree, some gifts,
                    cook a ham, hang some lights. An
                    idiot could do it.
          
                              MILO
                    Well, we'll soon find out.
          
          Sid checks him out.
          
                              SID
                    You have plans for the holiday?
          
                                 MILO
                    The usual.
          
                              SID
                    Gonna drink some cheap whiskey and
                    put your fist through a wall?
          
                                 MILO
                    Jealous?
          
          The tree is definitely not going to fit. They let it go, and
          Sid pulls out a small hand saw.
          
                              SID
                    Then forget it.
          
                              MILO
                    Forget what?
          
                              SID
                    I've got an open bond, but your
                    thing sounds like more fun. I'll
                    give it to Doug instead.
          
          Sid starts hacking away at the tree.
          
                                                                 13.
          
          
                              MILO
                    Whoa. Hold up, Heidi. What the
                    fuck. I want the job, I'm in the
                    hole.
          
                              SID
                    You're always in the hole.
          
                              MILO
                    What's your point?
          
                              SID
                        (SIGHING)
                    The truth is, I'm not sure you're
                    the right person for this job. It
                    could be a total disaster. On the
                    other hand, when one friend sees
                    another friend stagnating in his
                    own filth, he has to do something,
                    right?
          
                              MILO
                    Hey. I just woke up. I was gonna
                    shower.
          
          Sid drops the saw. With one final shove, the tree is in.
          Phew. Sid slams the back shut.
          
                              SID
                    Ok. But remember: you asked for it.
          
          He reaches into his pocket and extracts A FOLDED PIECE OF
          PAPER. Hands it to Milo. Milo unfolds it, gives it a quick
          look. A second look. A third.
          
          TIME STOPS. THE WHOLE STREET GOES SILENT.
          
                              MILO
                    No.
          
                              SID
                    Yes.
          
                              MILO
                    No.
          
                              SID
                    Yes.
          
                              MILO
                    No.
          
                              SID
                    Are we done yet?
          
                                                          14.
          
          
                              MILO
                    Is this a joke? Because if it is,
                    I'm gonna have to kill you.
          
                              SID
                    It's not a joke.
          
                              MILO
                    She got arrested? And then she
                    jumped bail?
          
                              SID
                    Apparently the whole thing started
                    with some reckless driving, and
                    ended with her assaulting a police
                    officer.
          
          Milo gives him a questioning look.
          
                              SID
                        (EXPLAINING)
                    She bit him.
          
          Milo snorts.
          
                              MILO
                    Yeah. That sounds like her.
                    But here's my question: why the
                    hell did you post her bail?
          
                              SID
                    Hey, I know she dumped you...
          
                              MILO
                    Whoa. She did not "dump me".
          
                              SID
                        (QUICKLY)
                    Ok, whatever, I...
          
                              MILO
                    No, not "whatever". I dumped her.
          
                              SID
                    The point is, I'm aware you guys
                    have issues, but I'm running a
                    business here. A person needs bail,
                    I don't have time to check with you
                    first.
          
                              MILO
                    Well, had you checked with me
                    first, you wouldn't be out of a
                    bond right now.
          
                                                                   15.
          
          
                              SID
                    I'm not out of a bond if you go
                    pick her up. It's five grand to
                    bring her back by 9am, Xmas day.
          
                              MILO
                        (SLOWLY)
                    You're telling me it's five grand
                    to go pick up my ex-wife and bring
                    her to jail. (beat) On Xmas.
          
                              SID
                    You're a good listener.
          
          Milo takes a deep, calming breath. Then he EXPLODES into
          whoops and hollers. He throws himself into a snow bank and
          thrashes around. He does a Fred Astaire around a lamp post.
          
                              SID
                    I take it you're interested.
          
          Milo grabs Sid and pulls him into a crushing bear hug.
          
                              MILO
                    I love you! You're the best friend
                    a guy could ever have!
          
                              SID
                    Ok, take it easy...
          
          TERESA (mid 40's, overly made-up, popping gum) pokes her head
          out the front door:
          
                              TERESA
                    Sid, you got a DUI on line one.
                    (off their looks) What's going on?
          
          Milo drops Sid, grabs Teresa, and gives HER A LONG, INTENSE
          KISS. He releases her. She stumbles back a bit.
          
                              TERESA
                    Ok. (beat) Can I have my gum back?
          
                              MILO
                    Right. Sorry.
          
          He reaches into his mouth, extracts her gum and hands it to
          her. She retreats back inside. Milo beams at Sid.
          
                              MILO
                    You know what this is, don't you?
                    Karma! Payback! You know how they
                    say "What goes around comes
                    around"? Turns out it's true!

                    "Rachel", but that's a lie.
          
          Sid shakes his head.
          
                              SID
                    I can't believe you guys broke up
                    over a stupid article.
          
                              MILO
                    We didn't break up over a stupid
                    article. We broke up because she is
                    a cheating, manipulative liar.
          
                              SID
                    Are you sure you can handle this?
          
                              MILO
                    Why wouldn't I be able to handle
                    this?
          
                              SID
                    Let's face it: you're not exactly
                    rational around her. I mean, if I
                    was a cop working a case and some
                    reporter came snooping around, I'd
                    say "no comment". Not "no comment,
                    but care for a cocktail"? And then
                    a month later, running off to some
                    love shack called "Caveman's Cabin"
                    and tying the knot? Who does that?
          
                              MILO
                    That's not even close to what
                    happened. For one thing, it was
                    called "Cupid's Cabin". And for
                    another, that was before I knew how
                    conniving she was. Now I know. So
                    all I have to do is track her down,
                    cuff her up, and bring her in.
                    (checking his watch) And I've got,
                    what, two days? Shit, man. Easy as
                    pie.

          room, giving us glimpses of a major illegal bookie operation:
          TV screens everywhere, a huge blackboard posting odds, men on
          computers, several heavily armed private security guards...

                     I know where his bimbo wife takes
                     her yoga classes, I know where his
                     idiot son shoplifts after school,
                     so he can pay me my money or...

                     What the hell happened to you?
          
          REVEAL DWIGHT, the guy who tried to collect from Milo,
          SPORTING TWO BLACK EYES AND A BROKEN NOSE.

                     Yeah? Did you get the money?
          
          He did not. Lorraine scowls. "LUCK BE A LADY" KICKS IN:

          INT MILO'S APT- DAY
          
          A freshly showered and shaved Milo packs for the job, singing
          at the top of his lungs:
          
                                                                    18.

                    Luck be a lady...
          
          He puts an empty duffle on the bed and starts filling it:
          MACE, PEPPER SPRAY, TASER GUN, HANDCUFFS...
          
                              MILO
                    Toooo....NIIIIIGHT!
          
          He stares at his collection and smiles:
          
                              MILO
                        (to his weapons)
                    I told you this day would come.
          
          Milo zips up the bag.
          
          
          EXT MILO'S APT- DAY
          
          Milo tosses the duffle in the backseat. He pulls out the job
          sheet and inspects it. CASS' CELL PHONE NUMBER IS LISTED.
          Pulls out his cell phone, then hesitates. He glances around
          and sees a PAY PHONE ACROSS THE WAY.
          
          Pockets his cell phone and crosses to the pay phone.
          
          
          EXT STREET- DAY
          
          CASS, expensive leather jacket, boots, dark glasses, trying
          to be incognito. Hurrying towards her car when she sees SOME
          COPS EXIT A DINER up ahead. She slips into a doorway, waiting
          for them to pass, when her phone rings.
          
          She checks it ("PAY PHONE") and answers:
          
                                CASS
                    Jimmy?
          
          SPLIT-SCREEN
          
          Nope, NOT JIMMY. Milo doesn't speak. Cass listens for a
          moment. She can hear breathing. What the fuck? An evil grin
          crosses Milo's face. Cass goes pale.
          
          Milo takes a step forward. Cass takes a step back. Milo
          LUNGES and CASS DROPS HER PHONE AND BOLTS OUT OF FRAME.

          Sid shuts his door, then speaks into his phone, low:
          
                              SID
                    Yeah. He took the job. But if this
                    thing goes bad, I'm blaming you.
          
          He hangs up.
          
          
          EXT STREET- DAY
          
          Milo sips from a coffee cup and watches:
          
          MILO'S POV- THE FRONT DOOR OF A FANCY BROWNSTONE. A woman
          with a toy poodle emerges from the building, struggling with
          the heavy door..
          
          
          EXT BROWNSTONE- DAY
          
          Milo appears next to the woman and holds the door for her:
          
                              MILO
                    Nice dog. Very compact.
          
          The woman exits and Milo enters.

          Milo stops in front of 303, and knocks on the door.
          
                                 MILO

          No answer. Milo glances around, then works the lock...
          
          
          INT APARTMENT/LIVING-ROOM- CONTINUOUS
          
          Milo slips inside, pulling the door shut behind him. It's
          dark and quiet. He glides through the room, scoping it out.
          The place is huge, white rug and couch, flat screen TV.
          
          And lining the bookshelves are FRAMED ARTICLES, AWARDS,
          PHOTOS OF CASS WITH VARIOUS PUBLIC FIGURES: the home of a
          successful and dedicated journalist.
          
                                                                    20.
          
          
          Milo is halfway across the room when he realizes he has left
          a set of MUDDY PRINTS across the formerly pristine white rug.
          
                              MILO
                    Whoops.
          
          
          EXT APARTMENT/BACK DOOR- DAY
          
          Cass enters frame. Nervous looks all around as she tries the
          knob. Surprise: THE DOOR SWINGS OPEN. She hesitates.
          
          
          INT APARTMENT/LIVING-ROOM- DAY
          
          NOW THERE ARE FOOTPRINTS CRISS-CROSSING THE FLOOR, RUNNING UP
          OVER THE COUCH, ETC. Looks like Milo had a little field day
          here. He is taking a closer look at the shelves: no photos of
          a boyfriend, family, pets: IT'S ALL WORK.
          
          He picks up one of the framed articles with the headline
          "LOCAL REPORTER WINS AWARD FOR BREAKING UP 13TH STREET DRUG
          RING". There's a photo of CASS SHAKING HANDS WITH THE AN
          IMPORTANT-LOOKING OFFICIAL.
          
          Milo's face clouds over.
          
          
          INT APARTMENT/KITCHEN- SIMULTANEOUS
          
          Cass slips inside and the door swings shut behind her with a
          soft CLICK.
          
          
          INT APARTMENT/LIVING-ROOM- DAY
          
          Milo's head whips around. SOMEONE'S IN THE KITCHEN. Big grin
          as he replaces the frame and draws his gun. A couple careful
          steps across the room and a floorboard CREAKS.
          
          
          INT APARTMENT/KITCHEN- SIMULTANEOUS
          
          Cass startles. SOMEONE'S IN THE LIVING-ROOM. Grabs a heavy
          saucepan off the stove. Grips it like a weapon, soft-foots it
          towards the hallway...
          
          
          INT APARTMENT/LIVING-ROOM- DAY
          
          Milo reaches the hallway entrance. Positions himself up
          against the wall, waiting...
          
                                                                    21.

          INT APARTMENT/LIVING-ROOM- DAY
          
          Milo holds his breath. A SHADOWY FIGURE STEPS INTO THE ROOM.
          Milo puts his gun to their head:
          
                              MILO
                    `Allo, love.

          THE PAN CONNECTS SOLIDLY WITH A CAT. Cat goes flying, bounces
          off wall, lands on the coffee table, fangs bared.
          
                              CASS
                    Whoops.

                    Ok, the truth is she asked me to
                    pick up her dry-cleaning...

                    and I want it back.
          
          Milo considers this.

                    The thing is, Stu, she'll make you
                    think she's interested in you, when
                    really all she's interested in is
                    the case you're working on, because
                    she wants to launch her big hot-
                    shot career.

                    Wait a second: you're Milo. She

                    hates her. Just so that's clear.

          comes up "CAESAR'S CASINO". Milo smiles.

                    She got to tour the White House?
          
          Now he really wants to take Cass to jail.
          
                              MILO
                    Tell me where she is, Lois.
          
                              LOIS
                    Oh, who knows. She was running
                    around like a chicken with its head
                    cut off, said she was on the
                    biggest story of her career. Said
                    she was going somewhere to think.
          
          Milo thinks this over, then a grin breaks out on his face.
          
          
          EXT CAESAR'S CASINO PARKING LOT- AFTERNOON
          
          Stewart has finally found a parking space, and is exiting his
          car when he sees Milo come out and jump into the Cadillac.
          
                              STEWART
                    Dammit.
          
          Stewart hurries back into his car.
          
          
          EXT ATLANTIC CITY RACETRACK- AFTERNOON
          
          Stands mobbed with people, horses galloping down the track,
          dust rising in their wake. MOVING IN ON...
          
          
          EXT STANDS- AFTERNOON
          
          Surrounded by people cheering, CASS IS HARD AT WORK. Notebook
          open, phone to ear, lap holding the plain envelope, ripped
          open, contents exposed: A PIECE OF PAPER THAT SAYS: "ATLANTIC
          CITY. XMAS EVE. SPARROW."
          
          She has underlined "Sparrow" and made a list: "Person's name?
          Company? Hotel? Casino?"
          
                                                                   31.
          
          
                              CASS
                        (into phone)
                    No one with that name? What about a
                    casino? Nothing? Thanks.
          
          She clicks over to an incoming call, "PRIVATE CALLER":
          
                              CASS
                    Jimmy?
          
          
          SPLIT-SCREEN:
          
          STEWART, at the mobbed track entrance, lost and frustrated:
          
                              STEWART
                    No, who's Jimmy?
          
                              CASS
                    Look, Stewart, I'm busy.
          
                              STEWART
                    Ok. (casually) Where are you, by
                    the way? I mean, exactly.
          
                              CASS
                    I'm in Miami, if you must know. I'm
                    on the beach building a sand castle
                    and drinking from a coconut...
          
          Someone taps her shoulder. She glances up and sees: MILO,
          SITTING RIGHT NEXT TO HER, GRINNING. She slowly closes her
          phone, not bothering to say goodbye.
          
                              MILO
                    Hello, Cass.
          
                              CASS
                    Hello, Milo.
          
          A MILLION DIFFERENT EMOTIONS CROSS CASS' FACE. Surprise,
          anger, anxiousness. All the mixed emotions you have when you
          suddenly run into THE MAN WHO BROKE YOUR HEART.
          
                              MILO
                    Fancy meeting you here.
          
                              CASS
                    Yeah. Fancy that.
          
          Strange, charged moment as they look at each other. Then they
          have a casual contest:
          
                                                               32.
          
          
                              MILO
                    How are you?
          
                                 CASS
                    Fine. You?
          
                              MILO
                    Swell. Nice day.
          
                                 CASS
                    Bright.
          
                                 MILO
                    Brisk.
          
                                 CASS
                    Crisp.
          
                              MILO
                    Invigorating.
          
                              CASS
                        (can't hold out anymore)
                    What are you doing here?
          
          Milo smirks.
          
                              MILO
                    "Building a sand castle, drinking
                    from a coconut". Man, once a liar,
                    always a liar.
          
          Cass immediately stands.
          
                              CASS
                    You know what? I don't have time
                    for this, I'm working.
          
          She grabs her stuff. Milo blocks her with his leg.
          
                              MILO
                    Working? Hey, me too.
          
                              CASS
                    Congratulations. Move your leg.
          
          Milo doesn't budge. Spelling it out for her:
          
                              MILO
                    What I do is, I track down
                    criminals. People who jumped bail.
                    Idiots who decided to go on the run
                    after biting police officers. I
                    find them, and I take them to jail.
          
                                                                  33.
          
          
          Cass stares at him, eyes wide:
          
                              CASS
                    Now, hold on just a second, Milo...
          
                              MILO
                    Tell you what: I'll give you more
                    than a second. I'll give you 10.
                    For old times sake.
          
          Milo moves his leg, kicks back, starts to count.
          
                              MILO
                    10...9...8...
          
          Cass stares at him, her jaw working, trying to decide what to
          do. Then, all of a sudden, she BOLTS. Milo smiles. THE
          LOUDSPEAKERS ANNOUNCE: "AND THEY'RE OFF!"
          
          
          EXT RACETRACK PARKING LOT- AFTERNOON
          
          Cass jumps into her car and turns the key. NOTHING. She tries
          again, then hears soft laughter. MILO IS SEVERAL YARDS AWAY,
          HER BATTERY IN HIS HAND.
          
                              MILO
                    Strike one.
          
          Cass leaps from the car and runs.
          
          
          INT STADIUM- AFTERNOON
          
          Cass runs for the elevator. It opens and people exit,
          REVEALING MILO:
          
                              MILO
                    Strike two.
          
          Cass turns heel and bolts.
          
          
          EXT STADIUM- AFTERNOON
          
          Cass races out, flagging a taxi. Milo pulls up:
          
                              MILO
                    Strike three. Get in.
          
                              CASS
                    I'm not going to jail, Milo.
          
                                                                     34.
          
          
                              MILO
                    I beg to differ.
          
          She heads for the cabs. Milo exits his car, GUN IN HAND.
          
                              CASS
                    Oh please. Like you're gonna shoot
                    me.
          
                              MILO
                    Nope. (loudly) I'm gonna shoot a
                    cab driver.
          
          Head whip around in his direction. THEN EVERY CAB IN THE
          PLACE GOES OFF-DUTY. Cass stomps her foot, furious.
          
                              CASS
                    Chicken shits.
          
          Cass marches back over to Milo.
          
                              CASS
                    Ok, look: let's talk about this.
          
                               MILO
                    Ok.
          
          With that, Milo sweeps her up into his arms. AND THEY FIND
          THEMSELVES FACE TO FACE. BREATHING ON EACH OTHER. THEIR LIPS
          INCHES APART.
          
          Cass stares at Milo. Is he gonna kiss her? Again, she feels
          weird. Confused.
          
                              CASS
                        (UNCOMFORTABLE)
                    Listen, Milo, I'm not sure we
                    should...
          
          Suddenly, MILO DUMPS HER IN THE TRUNK OF HIS CAR.
          
                              CASS
                    Hey, wait a minute!
          
          He smiles at her, waves, then SLAMS down the lid.
          
          CUT TO BLACK. Well, now she knows exactly how she feels:
          FURIOUS:
          
                               CASS (O.S.)
                    Bastard.

          And immediately: A PHONE RINGS.
          
                              CASS (O.S.)
                    Great. Perfect timing.
          
          A match is struck, illuminating the trunk as Cass scrambles
          for her phone. Trying to sound professional:
          
                              CASS
                    Cassidy Daley.

          CLOSE ON- JIMMY, head tilted back, tense smile on his face.
          PULL BACK a little to reveal the GUN MAHLER IS HOLDING UNDER
          HIS CHIN.
          
                              JIMMY
                    It's me. Jimmy.
          
                              CASS
                        (exhaling with relief)
                    Shit, Jimmy, I thought you were
                    dead.
          
                              JIMMY
                    Don't be silly. (hurrying on)
                    Listen: you didn't happen to go to
                    my place and find that envelope I
                    left, did you?
          
                              CASS
                    I did, but I don't really get it,
                    what's "Sparrow"?
          
                              JIMMY
                    It doesn't matter. Did you tell
                    anyone else about this story?
          
                              CASS
                    Are you kidding? You think I want
                    to share a story like this?
          
                              JIMMY
                    Ok. Good. Cause the truth is, there
                    is no story. I made the whole thing
                    up. So you should just drop it...
          
                              CASS
                    Uh-uh, no way are you backing out
                    on me now, Jimmy. This story is way
                    too good...
          
                                                                 36.

                        (QUICKLY)
                    Where are you?
          
                              CASS
                    I'm at the Atlantic City Boardwalk.
                    Actually, I'm in the trunk of my ex-
                    husband's car. Long story. More
                    importantly, where are you?
          
                                 JIMMY
                    I'm...
          
          CLICK. MAHLER DISCONNECTS THE PHONE.
          
          ON CASS- she stares at her phone. Uh-oh:
          
                              CASS
                    Jimmy? Hello?
          
          Suddenly, MUSIC KICKS IN and we hear MILO SINGING AT THE TOP
          OF HIS LUNGS:
          
                              MILO (O.S.)
                    Deck the halls with boughs of

          INT CADILLAC- AFTERNOON
          
          Now Milo really is the happiest man alive. He pulls out his
          cell phone, dials:
          
          SPLIT-SCREEN:
          
          Teresa removes her gum, sticks it on her mouse-pad, answers:
          
                              TERESA
                    Sid's Bail Bonds.
          
                              MILO
                    Guess who's in my trunk?
          
                              TERESA
                    Is that some sort of perverted
                    innuendo? Who is this?
          
                              MILO
                    Aw, come on, Teresa, you know it's
                    me. Put Sid on.
          
                                                                 37.

                    Sid's busy shopping. (snorts) He
                    thinks he can handle Xmas.
          
                              MILO
                    Ok, just tell him I got her and
                    I'll be back in 2 hours. I want a
                    bonus for bringing her in so quick.
          
                              TERESA
                    Yeah? I want a bonus for getting
                    through the holidays without
                    stabbing anyone with a fork.
          
                              MILO
                    Don't be such a pessimist. You
                    still have time.
          
          His phone beeps. IT'S CASS CALLING FROM THE TRUNK.
          
                              MILO
                    Gotta go. I got another call.
          
          He clicks over.
          
                              MILO
                    Tina's Thai massage! Where every
                    ending is a happy one!
          
          SPLIT-SCREEN:
          
          Cass rolls her eyes.
          
                               CASS
                    You're disgusting. Let me out of
                    the trunk.
          
                              MILO
                    Hmm. Nope. By the way, your
                    boyfriend Stewart's been following
                    me. Unfortunately, I had to ditch
                    him at the track.
          
                              CASS
                    Why is Stewart..? (realizing) And
                    wait: who said he's my boyfriend?
          
                              MILO
                    Aw, don't be embarrassed. These
                    things happen. You were drunk when
                    you guys hooked up, right?
          
          Cass turns bright red. She was drunk when they hooked up.
          Changing tactics, she tries to flatter him:
          
                                                                  38.
          
          
                              CASS
                    You know what, Milo? I shouldn't
                    have run from you like that. I
                    was...I don't know. You caught me
                    off-guard. The truth is, I'm kind
                    of in some trouble and I could
                    really use your help.
          
                              MILO
                    Bad news for you, then. I wouldn't
                    help you if you were the very last
                    baby sea turtle in the world,
                    dragging its tiny weak body across
                    the burning hot sand while sea
                    gulls circled overhead. I'd just
                    pull up a chair, sip a pina colada,
                    and let nature take its course.
          
          Long beat. Suddenly, CASS STARTS TO SOB. LOUD, HYSTERICAL
          SOBS. Milo listens for a moment, out of a purely clinical
          interest, then:
          
                              MILO
                    Hey, I used to be a sucker, but no
                    more. You can cry til the cows come
                    home, for all I care.
          
          Cass instantly stops crying and slams her phone shut.
          
          CUT TO BLACK. Then, the sound of a trunk opening, and WE ARE
          INSIDE A CAR TRUNK, LOOKING UP AT: MAHLER.
          
          
          EXT TRUMP CASINO PARKING LOT- AFTERNOON
          
          Mahler reaches into his trunk and REMOVES HIS HANDGUN. Checks
          the cartridge, pockets the gun. Slams the trunk shut.
          
          He climbs into his front seat, and as he pulls out of the
          lot, we see CASS' NEWSPAPER PHOTO THAT HAS BEEN RIPPED FROM
          THE PAPER, on the passenger seat.
          
          
          INT CADILLAC- AFTERNOON
          
          Milo drives along happily humming when, suddenly, A SMALL
          TRAIL OF SMOKE drifts over his shoulder. What the hell...? He
          glances into the rearview mirror and:
          
          SMOKE IS POURING OUT OF THE TRUNK!
          
                              MILO
                    Holy shit! (calling out) Hey, um,
                    Cass? (no response) Cassidy?
          
                                                                  39.
          
          
          Still nothing. Milo jerks the car to the right, and SLAMS on
          the brakes.
          
          
          EXT CADILLAC- AFTERNOON
          
          The car screeches to a halt on the embankment. Milo leaps out
          of the driver's door and races to back, fumbling with his
          keys. SMOKE CONTINUES TO POUR OUT OF THE TRUNK.
          
                              MILO
                    It's Ok, hang on, I'm coming...
          
          Gets the key in, pops the lid and sees: CASS, HANDKERCHIEF
          OVER HER NOSE, PACK OF FLAMING MATCHES IN HAND. Cass tosses
          the matches and handkerchief, AND PUNCHES MILO IN THE BALLS.
          
          Milo groans and crumbles to the ground. Cass jumps out of the
          trunk and stands over him:
          
                              CASS
                    You know something, Milo? You're
                    one of the most gullible...
          
          BAM, Milo grabs her ankle and JERKS and Cass hits the ground.
          Next thing you know, IT'S WWF TIME, THE TWO OF THEM ROLLING
          IN THE DIRT.
          
          Milo gets her pinned, but Cass grabs his ear and TWISTS:
          
                                 MILO
                    AAAAHHH...
          
          He pulls her arm behind her back...
          
                              CASS
                    Ow ow ow...
          
          ...and she jerks her head back, SMACKING him in the nose.
          
                              MILO
                    Son of a...
          
          He gets her in a BEAR HUG...
          
                                 CASS
                    AAGH...
          
          ...and she BITES him.
          
                                 MILO
                    OW...
          
                                                                  40.
          
          
          Finally, he has her on her back, TRAPPED. He gets his face
          right over hers and STARTS TO LET A GLOB OF SALIVA FALL FROM
          HIS MOUTH TOWARDS HER FACE.
          
                              CASS
                    NOOOO! Uncle, uncle, uncle!
          
          Milo collapses onto the ground next to her, laughing. She
          looks at him and she starts laughing too.
          
                              CASS
                    Dirty fighter.
          
                              MILO
                    Me? I'm the dirty fighter?
          
          They both laugh harder. Then Milo stands and offers her a
          hand. She takes it, and he helps her up. Awkward pause as
          they look at each other.
          
                               CASS
                    Should we...I don't know...hug, or
                    something?
          
                              MILO
                    Sure. What the hell.
          
          He opens his arms. She moves closer. They hug. Milo feels her
          hands moving towards the gun in his belt. He smirks. CLICK.
          HE SNAPS SOME HANDCUFFS ONTO HER WRISTS.
          
                              CASS
                    Hey. I had to try, right?
          
                              MILO
                    Get in the car.
          
          
          INT CADILLAC- AFTERNOON
          
          They are driving along, both a little dishevelled, ONE OF
          CASS' HANDS CUFFED TO THE PASSENGER DOOR. They pass casinos
          as they head out of Atlantic City.
          
                              CASS
                    Your windshield's cracked.
          
                              MILO
                    Thanks, Captain Obvious.
          
          Cass turns to inspect him more closely.
          
                                                                  41.
          
          
                               CASS
                    And you look like shit, Milo. What
                    have you been doing, sleeping on
                    the floor?
          
          Milo has been sleeping on the floor.
          
                              MILO
                    I enjoy sleeping on the floor.
                    Matter of fact, I love sleeping on
                    the floor. I love everything about
                    my life. Great job, good friends,
                    hot girlfriend...
          
                              CASS
                    You have a girlfriend?
          
                              MILO
                        (he does not)
                    Yes I do.
          
          Cass is skeptical:
          
                              CASS
                    Really? What's her name?
          
                              MILO
                        (the first name that pops
                         into his head:)
                    Teresa. Rocking hot body. Likes to
                    cook pasta for me and perform strip-
                    teases.
          
                              CASS
                    Wow. Is she missing a chromosome?
          
                              MILO
                    Oh, she has all her chromosomes,
                    believe you me.
          
          Cass thinks this over, then counters:
          
                              CASS
                    Well, my life is great, too.
          
                              MILO
                    I can tell. You and Stewart make a
                    great couple, by the way. You and
                    me made a terrible couple. But you
                    two? Like peas in a pod.
          
          About to deny that she and Stewart are a couple, it occurs to
          Cass: Milo seems a little JEALOUS. She jumps on this:
          
                                                                  42.
          
          
                              CASS
                    You know what I like about Stewart?
          
                              MILO
                    I can't imagine.
          
                              CASS
                    He's not you.
          
                              MILO
                    Not even on his best day.
          
                              CASS
                    Or his worst.
          
                              MILO
                    I'll bet he has a lot of those.
          
                              CASS
                    Still betting, huh?
          
                              MILO
                    You can't win if you don't play.
          
                              CASS
                    Or, in your case, even if you do.
          
          He shoots her a sharp look. She stares back, waiting.
          
                              MILO
                    I win all the time.
          
                              CASS
                    Really? I hadn't noticed.
          
          Ok. That is definitely a challenge.
          
                              MILO
                    You know what? Seeing as how I'm
                    about to come into five grand...
          
          Milo makes a SUDDEN TURN OFF THE HIGHWAY and pulls into the
          parking lot of BALLY'S CASINO.
          
                               MILO
                    I think I'll do a little betting
                    right now.
          
                              CASS
                    Don't you have to take me back?
          
                              MILO
                    Please. I have two days. A monkey
                    could get you back in two days.
          
                                                                 43.
          
          
          Again: famous last words. Milo exits the car. Cass smiles to
          herself. This is obviously what she hoped would happen. She
          glances around, spots THE DUFFLE in the back seat. PEEKING
          OUT OF THE TOP OF THE DUFFLE IS THE TASER GUN. Hmm...
          
          
          EXT CADILLAC- AFTERNOON
          
          Milo opens her door.
          
                              CASS
                    Aren't you afraid I'll get away?
          
                                 MILO
                    Nope.
          
          He uncuffs her from the door, CUFFS HER TO HIS OWN WRIST.
          
          
          EXT HIGHWAY- AFTERNOON
          
          Stewart is heading back to the city, cursing his bad luck,
          when he happens to glance over and see MILO AND CASS HEADING
          INTO BALLY'S CASINO.
          
                              STEWART
                    Damn, I'm good!
          
          He makes a quick turn off the highway and into the Bally's
          parking lot.
          
          
          INT BALLY'S CASINO- AFTERNOON
          
          The clerk at the chips cage recognizes Milo as he and Cass
          APPROACH:
          
                              CLERK
                    Merry Xmas, Mr Boyd!
          
          Behind the clerk, a FEMALE CLERK perks up at this name...
          
                              CLERK
                    What a nice surprise! Let's hope
                    your luck is better today.
          
          Milo glances at Cass.
          
                              MILO
                        (QUICKLY)
                    Sure, if there's such a thing as
                    better than great, which is how my
                    luck has been lately. Great.
          
                                                                  44.
          
          
                              CLERK
                        (AWKWARD)
                    Oh. Yes sir. Of course. My mistake.
          
          While the clerk is counting out chips, WE NOTICE BEHIND HIM
          THE FEMALE CLERK PICKING UP THE PHONE...
          
          
          INT WAREHOUSE- LATE AFTERNOON
          
          Lorraine on the phone, listening intently. Then she hangs up,
          grinning.
          
                              LORRAINE
                    The idiot just showed up at
                    Bally's.
          
                               DWIGHT
                        (QUICKLY)
                    I'm on it.
          
                              LORRAINE
                    Uh-uh. Not you. (calling out) RAY.
          
          RAY appears next to her.
          
                              LORRAINE
                    Go get this asshole.
          
          Ray cracks his knuckles, smirks at Dwight, and exits.
          
          
          INT BALLY'S BLACKJACK TABLE- LATE AFTERNOON
          
          Milo sits at a blackjack table, pulling Cass into a seat next
          to him.
          
                              MILO
                    Prepare to observe the master.
          
          He bets while Cass sits next to him, scheming:
          
                              CASS
                    Ok, how about this:
          
          She uses her free hand to pull out her wallet:
          
                              CASS
                    If I give you all the cash in my
                    wallet, will you let me go?
          
                              MILO
                    Hmm. Lemme see...
          
                                                                 45.
          
          
          He takes the cash from her and thinks for a moment.
          
                              MILO
                    Nope. Guess not.
          
          Milo adds her cash to his bet on the table.
          
                              MILO
                        (to the dealer)
                    Hit me.
          
                              CASS
                    I'd really like to.
          
          The dealer deals the cards.
          
                              DEALER
                    Dealer wins.
          
                              CASS
                    Nice going, master.
          
          Milo quickly lays out some more money. A WAITRESS (smells
          like an ashtray) appears:
          
                              WAITRESS
                    And for the couple over here?
          
                              MILO
                        (QUICKLY)
                    We're not a couple.
          
                              CASS
                        (just as quick)
                    Why would you think we were a
                    couple?
          
                              MILO
                    We used to be together. Back when I
                    was young and foolish.
          
                              CASS
                    And I was confused.
          
                              MILO
                    And I was slumming.
          
                              CASS
                    And I was drunk.
          
          The waitress looks back and forth between them.
          
                                                                 46.
          
          
                              WAITRESS
                        (BORED)
                    Great story. I have to get back to
                    work now.
          
                              MILO
                    Wait. Champagne! I'm celebrating.
          
          The waitress rolls her eyes and leaves. Milo turns to see he
          has lost more money.
          
                              MILO
                        (under his breath)
                    Son of a bitch.
          
          Ok. Cass has had enough of this. She leans closer:
          
                              CASS
                    Look, Milo, the truth is...my Mom
                    is in the hospital.
          
          Milo perks up.
          
                              MILO
                    Oh? Old Lois not feeling up to par?
          
                              CASS
                    She might be really sick. That's
                    why I had to jump bail.
          
                              MILO
                        (overly sincere)
                    Taking care of her, huh? Putting
                    aside your career for a loved one?
                    Golly, that's so you.
          
          "Golly"? Cass stares at him, realizing:
          
                              CASS
                    You've already been to see her.
          
                              MILO
                    Impressive. No wonder you got all
                    those awards. So lemme guess: the
                    real reason you jumped bail is
                    cause you're on a story.
          
          Cass narrows her eyes:
          
                              CASS
                    Stewart. Stewart told you.
          
                                                                 47.
          
          
                              MILO
                        (CAUGHT)
                    I would have figured it out on my
                    own, trust me.
          
                              CASS
                    I wouldn't trust you if you were
                    the last man alive.
          
                              MILO
                    You think about that much? Me being
                    the last man alive? Am I naked in
                    this fantasy?
          
          Cass takes a deep breath. This is getting her nowhere. But
          she is clearly hesitant to give him the real story.
          
                              CASS
                    Ok, you're right. I'm on a story.
                    A very important story. It just so
                    happens that I'm possibly about to
                    uncover a whole ring of dirty cops.
          
          Milo snorts.
          
                                CASS
                    What?
          
                              MILO
                    Please. Isn't the whole "dirty cop"
                    thing kind of old? Maybe you should
                    do a story about something people
                    are interested in. Like internet
                    porn. Or lesbians.
          
                              CASS
                    I'm serious, Milo. This is gonna be
                    big. And here's what I'm willing to
                    do (magnanimous): I'm willing to
                    credit you in the article.
          
                              MILO
                    Oh, sure, like you credited me in
                    the 13th Street Article?
          
          Cass stares at him.
          
                              CASS
                    Why on earth would I have credited
                    you? I worked my ass off for that
                    story.
          
                              MILO
                    That's one way of putting it.
          
                                                                48.
          
          
                              CASS
                    What's that supposed to mean?
          
                              MILO
                    Forget it. I don't want to be in
                    your article. In fact, I would
                    rather eat a bowl of broken glass
                    than have my name in any way
                    associated with one of your lousy
                    articles...
          
                              CASS
                    Fine. Forget I mentioned it.
          
                              MILO
                    I already have.
          
                              CASS
                    I mean, you're not a cop anymore,
                    right? What do you care if people
                    were murdered?
          
                              MILO
                    Please. Nobody was murdered.
          
                              CASS
                    Just my source.
          
                              MILO
                        (SUSPICIOUS)
                    Oh yeah? How? Bullet to the back of
                    the head?
          
                              CASS
                    Well...
          
                              MILO
                    Dumped in a reservoir?
          
                              CASS
                        (FLUSTERED)
                    I don't know.
          
                              MILO
                    Car accident?
          
                              CASS
                    Ok, ok, maybe he wasn't murdered
                    yet. But I wouldn't be surprised
                    if...
          
          Milo breaks out into loud guffaws. Cass is furious.

                              CASS
                    Maybe this whole thing sounds like
                    no big deal to you...
          
                              MILO
                    You know what it sounds like? It
                    sounds like you're going to jail.
          
          Cass can't believe this.
          
                              CASS
                    Milo, listen, you have to believe
                    me, come on, you know me...
          
                              MILO
                        (getting red)
                    Exactly! I do know you. Which means
                    I know you are a deceptive, cold-
                    hearted bitch who is going to jail
                    where she belongs.
          
          Wow. That was pretty harsh. Cass looks at him, stunned. They
          stare at each other in silence.
          
          The waitress arrives with the drinks:
          
                              WAITRESS
                    Champagne. So. What are we
                    celebrating?
          
                              CASS
                        (GRIMLY)
                    I have to use the bathroom.
          
                              WAITRESS
                    Alrightee, then. Cheers.
          
          
          EXT BALLY'S CASINO PARKING LOT- LATE AFTERNOON
          
          Stewart taps his steering wheel restlessly, watching the door
          of the casino for signs of Cass and Milo. Waiting in this
          parking lot is boring. Finally, he exits his car. Sidles over
          to Milo's car. Checks the door handle.
          
          IT'S UNLOCKED. Stewart glances around, then climbs in.
          
          
          INT BALLY'S CASINO BATHROOM- LATE AFTERNOON
          
          Cass enters and Milo follows:
          
                              CASS
                    Can I have some privacy, please?
          
                                                                  50.
          
          
          Milo checks the room. Looks like there is no escape from
          here. He UNCUFFS HER, but then:
          
                              MILO
                    I'm gonna have to frisk you.
          
                              CASS
                    Get it over with, then.
          
          Milo checks her pockets. Her ankles. Her legs. He goes behind
          her and checks her shoulders. Her back. He reaches around and
          checks her belly.
          
                              MILO
                    You gain a little weight?
          
                              CASS
                        (snapping back)
                    You lose a little hair?
          
          Milo reaches higher and:
          
                              CASS
                    Yeah. Right. I'm hiding a weapon in
                    my breasts.
          
          Milo backs off, turning red.
          
                              MILO
                    Make it quick.
          
          He exits. As soon as he is gone, CASS PULLS MILO'S TASER GUN
          FROM HER CLEAVAGE.

          Stewart is rummaging around inside Milo's car when he looks
          up and sees: RAY, standing there, smiling at him.
          
                              STEWART
                    Shit, man, you startled me. (beat)
                    Can I help you?
          
                              RAY
                    Night-night.
          
          Suddenly, Ray GRABS STEWART'S HEAD AND SMASHES IT INTO THE
          STEERING WHEEL, KNOCKING HIM OUT COLD.
          
          
          EXT CASINO BATHROOM- LATE AFTERNOON
          
          Milo checks his watch, then raps on the door.
          
                                                                    51.

          Cass squints at the taser gun, trying to read the tiny
          instruction label on the side:

                    "Put open end in direct contact

                              MILO (O.S.)
                    Hello? Ok, that's long enough, I'm
                    coming in...
          
          He comes in and SHE JAMS THE TASER GUN INTO HIS NECK AND HITS
          THE BUTTON. HE SCREAMS AND HITS THE FLOOR. SHE SCREAMS, DROPS
          THE TASER GUN, AND FLEES.
          
          
          EXT CASINO- LATE AFTERNOON

                               CASS
                    Sorry...
          
          ...and keeps going. She hurries to the curb and tries to flag
          down a ride.
          
          RACK TO- SEVERAL YARDS AWAY, THE PERSON SHE BUMPED INTO IS
          STARING AFTER HER. IT'S MAHLER. Mahler compares her to the
          newspaper photo he is holding. Yup: THAT'S HER.
          
          Cass glances around, keeping an eye out for Milo, and SPOTS
          MAHLER STARING AT HER. Suddenly, he starts heading towards
          her. Cass backs up slightly, nervous. WHO IS THAT GUY?
          
                              VOICE
                    Need a lift?
          
          Cass looks around. A trucker has pulled up next to her.
          Relieved, she quickly climbs on board.
          
          RACK TO- MAHLER, WATCHING THE TRUCK PULL AWAY. He doesn't
          seem worried. He turns and heads for his car.
          
          
          INT TRUCK- LATE AFTERNOON
          
          Cass is fixing her hair, pulling herself together.

                              CASS
                    He says we made a terrible couple.
                    Which is true. I know that. I'm the
                    one who thought that first. I'm the
                    one who came up with that. The fact
                    is, I don't want to be with someone
                    who can't admit he was wrong.
          
                              DRIVER
                    So you're available.
          
          Cass looks at him. He smiles coyly.
          
                              CASS
                    Available for what?

                    I hope you don't think you're
                    telling me something that interests
                    me.

                    You know what I want for Xmas?
          
          The driver mouths something at her we can't see. Cass leans
          over and SMACKS HIM AS HARD AS SHE CAN.

          The truck SCREECHES to a halt by the side of the road. Cass
          gets booted out the passenger door. The door is slammed shut
          behind her. Cass gives the guy the finger as he drives off.
          
          She turns to see a car headed her way. She starts flagging it
          down. But wait... Yup, IT'S MILO. Shit. She looks around, but
          where's she gonna go? Meanwhile, as Milo nears, HE SEEMS TO
          BE SPEEDING UP. Cass stares. He keeps coming, an evil look on
          his face. IT LOOKS LIKE HE IS GOING TO RUN HER OVER.
          
          She turns and STARTS TO RUN.

          Cass runs into a field. Milo drives off the road and follows.
          He gets her cornered by a pen. He looks triumphant. She
          scowls. Then she throws open the pen, REVEALING A HUGE BULL.
          Now she looks triumphant. He scowls.
          
          CUT TO- BULL RAMS INTO MILO'S CAR, SLAMMING MILO'S FACE INTO
          THE STEERING WHEEL. CASS LAUGHS. THE BULL TURNS AND NOTICES
          CASS FOR THE FIRST TIME.
          
          CUT TO- BULL CHASES CASS. MILO LAUGHS. CASS RUNS FOR THE CAR.
          MILO LOCKS THE DOORS.

                    Open the door, you son of a bitch!
          
          Finally, Milo opens it. She DIVES INTO THE CAR AND SLAMS THE
          DOOR just before the BULL RAMS INTO THE SIDE OF THE CAR.
          
          Cass and Milo watch, stunned, as the bull looks at them for a
          moment, THEN TOPPLES OVER, UNCONSCIOUS. Milo and Cass hear a
          strange sound, and look over to see A SMALL HERD OF BULLS,
          GETTING READY TO CHARGE.

                              CASS
                        (deep breath)
                    Ok. Fine. But can we just put aside
                    our differences for two seconds?
                    Because back at the casino, I think
                    I saw someone following me.
          
                              MILO
                    Sure that wasn't me?
          
                              CASS
                    I don't think so. This guy was
                    lacking your trademark smell of
                    booze and KFC.
          
                              MILO
                    Ha ha.
          
          Milo surreptitiously sniffs himself.
          
                              CASS
                    Anywho. If these dirty cops have my
                    source hostage somewhere...
          
          Milo starts to laugh. Cass flushes:
          
                              CASS
                    What's so funny?
          
                                                                  56.
          
          
                              MILO
                    You think dirty cops are trying to
                    kill you? Look, I know you think
                    you're hot shit and everything, but
                    I'm pretty sure the only one around
                    here who might want to kill you is
                    me.
          
          Cass SEES A DARK CHEVY in the rearview mirror, gets a look at
          the driver and goes pale.
          
                              CASS
                    Oh no.
          
                              MILO
                    What?
          
                              CASS
                    Behind us. It's him. The guy I saw
                    back at the casino.
          
          Milo glances into the mirror, checking the guy out.
          
                              MILO
                    Yeah? He doesn't look like a cop to
                    me.
          
                              CASS
                        (freaking out)
                    Speed up!
          
                              MILO
                    Would you just calm down for a
                    second and...
          
                              CASS
                    NO!!
          
          Cass kicks a leg over and SLAMS HER FOOT ONTO THE GAS. The
          car LEAPS forward...
          
                              MILO
                    Jesus christ...
          
          Milo tries to push her foot off the gas while they wrestle
          for the wheel. THE CAR DOES A CRAZY ZIG-ZAG BACK AND FORTH...
          
                              MILO
                    LISTEN, YOU MANIAC...
          
                              CASS
                    MILO...
          
                                                                   57.
          
          
                              MILO
                    ...LET GO...
          
                              CASS
                    MILO...
          
                              MILO
                    ...NO ONE IS TRYING TO KILL YOU...
          
                              CASS
                    MILO!!!
          
          She points past him. Milo turns to see MAHLER DRIVING BESIDE
          THEM, GUN POINTED AT MILO'S HEAD.
          
                              MILO
                    SHIT!!!
          
          They both duck as Mahler starts firing. GLASS SHATTERS ALL
          AROUND THEM. MILO PULLS OUT HIS GUN and STARTS FIRING BACK...
          
          
          EXT HIGHWAY- EARLY EVENING
          
          BOTH CARS VEER WILDLY FROM LANE TO LANE AS MILO AND MAHLER
          FIRE AT EACH OTHER...
          
          CLOSE ON- THE CADILLAC'S REAR TIRE, AS IT GOES FLAT FROM A
          BULLET...
          
          
          INT CADILLAC- EARLY EVENING
          
          MILO GRIPS THE WHEEL AS THE CAR STARTS TO DRAG AND LOSE
          GROUND. Cass is hunched over in the passenger seat, excited
          and frightened at the same time.
          
          Mahler pulls alongside them again and Milo WRENCHES the wheel
          to the left, SLAMMING THE CADILLAC INTO MAHLER'S CAR.
          Mahler's car goes skidding across the road, hits a ditch and
          FLIPS ONTO ITS SIDE.
          
          
          EXT HIGHWAY- EARLY EVENING
          
          The cadillac SPEEDS away, leaving Mahler's car behind.
          
          
          EXT HIGHWAY- EARLY EVENING
          
          The Cadillac is parked on the shoulder, Milo changing the
          tire, Cass standing by the passenger door, still handcuffed,
          EXCITED:
          
                                                                  58.
          
          
                              CASS
                    I told you they were trying to kill
                    me!
          
                              MILO
                    Yeah, well, no one's killing you
                    until I get you to jail.
          
          Cass whips her head around to look at him:
          
                              CASS
                    You're still taking me to jail? But
                    it's the cops who are after me.
          
                              MILO
                    First of all: that guy was not a
                    cop. Second of all, we just left
                    him unconscious in a ditch. You'll
                    be fine.
          
                              CASS
                    But...this is important! This is my
                    job!
          
                               MILO
                    And this...(pointing between them)
                    is my job.
          
                              CASS
                    Milo, you don't understand what's
                    going on!
          
          Milo rolls his eyes and straightens up.
          
                              MILO
                    I'll lay it out for you: some loser
                    with a minor sheet calls you up and
                    says, hey, I've got a big story for
                    you, you interested? It'll only
                    cost you a couple hundred bucks,
                    and I'll tip you onto some criminal
                    activity, it's your chance to
                    expose some bad guys and write the
                    story of your life. Then the moron
                    gets himself caught, he's probably
                    in cold storage somewhere, and now
                    you think the bad guys are after
                    you. (beat) See? I get it. I just
                    don't care.
          
          Milo finishes with the tire, throws the jack in the back, and
          heads back around to the driver's seat.
          
                                                                 59.
          
          
          Cass watches him closely, getting an idea. She reaches into
          her pocket and pulls out the paper from Jimmy.
          
                               CASS
                         (CASUALLY)
                    If only I knew exactly when and
                    where this deal was going down.
                    Course, if I can't figure out that
                    part, then you definitely can't
                    figure out that part, because we
                    both know I'm much smarter than
                    you.
          
          Milo flinches, then forces a laugh.
          
                              MILO
                    Please. My brain can dance circles
                    around your brain.
          
                              CASS
                    I don't even know what that means.
          
                              MILO
                    Case closed.
          
                              CASS
                        (SHRUGGING)
                    Fine. Guess we'll never know.
          
          Milo hesitates. Then decides: fuck it. He strides around the
          car and SNATCHES the paper from her hand. He reads:
          
                              MILO
                    "Atlantic City. Xmas Eve. Sparrow."
                    What's "Sparrow"?
          
                              CASS
                    I knew you couldn't figure it out.
          
                              MILO
                        (QUICKLY)
                    It's a business.
          
                                CASS
                    No.
          
                                MILO
                    Casino.
          
                                CASS
                    Nope.
          
                                MILO
                    Stripper?
          
                                                                 60.
          
          
                              CASS
                    I don't think so. What kind of
                    strip bars have you been going to,
                    anyway?
          
          Milo stares at the paper, wracking his brain. Cass sighs
          loudly and SNATCHES the paper back.
          
                              CASS
                    Oh, well, forget it, I knew you
                    couldn't do it.
          
                              MILO
                    Please. I could crack that story
                    and still get you to jail on time.
          
                                 CASS
                    Oh yeah?
          
          Cass stares him in the eye and says the magic words:
          
                                 CASS
                    Wanna bet?
          
          Milo stares at her. She stares back. Long beat. Milo's face
          is red. He clenches his fists. He unclenches them. Fuck. He
          thrusts out his hand:
          
                                 MILO
                    You're on.
          
          They shake.
          
                              MILO
                    I have to make a call.
          
          He starts to walk away.
          
                              CASS
                    Hey. Aren't you going to uncuff me?
          
                              MILO
                    Why? You going somewhere?
          
                                 CASS
                    Um...no.
          
                              MILO
                    Then you don't need to be uncuffed.
          
                                                                  61.
          
          
          INT CADILLAC- MOMENTS LATER
          
          Cass sits in the passenger seat and watches in the rearview
          mirror while Milo paces behind the car, on the phone.
          
                              CASS
                        (to herself)
                    Asshole.
          
          
          EXT CADILLAC- EARLY EVENING
          
          Milo is talking to Sid:
          
                              MILO
                    So there's just gonna be a little
                    delay...
          
          SPLIT-SCREEN:
          
          INT MALL- EARLY EVENING
          
          Sid's at the mall. On Dec 23rd. With all the other desperate,
          last-minute shoppers. In other words, HE'S IN HELL.
          
                              SID
                    I don't get it. Why are you helping
                    her?
          
                              MILO
                    But that's the beauty of it, Sid,
                    I'm not helping her, she only
                    thinks I'm helping her.
          
                              SID
                    Yeah? If you're not helping her,
                    what are you doing?
          
          Milo notices Cass watching him and turns his back slightly.

                        (to herself)

                    I'll tell you what I'm doing: I'm
                    gonna crack this case first, and
                    I'm gonna take all the credit. Who
                    knows, maybe I'll even get my job
                    back....

                    You are so full of shit. You don't
                    want your job back. You just want
                    to prove you're smarter than she
                    is.

                        (instantly heated)
                    I am smarter than she is. I would
                    have cracked that 13th Street case
                    way before she did if she hadn't...

                    ever occur to you that a normal
                    couple wouldn't compete the way you
                    guys do in the first place?
          
          Sid spots what he is looking for. So does another last-minute
          shopper. They both reach for the toy.
          
                              MILO
                    This from the man currently trying
                    to prove to his wife he can handle

          Sid WRENCHES the toy from the other shopper.

                    Stealing evidence from property
                    rooms. Then destroying it, for the
                    right price.
          
          Milo stares.
          
                              CASS
                    What?
          
                              MILO
                    Nothing. It's just...it's a good
                    idea. If it weren't, you know.
                    Wrong. (continuing) So. Your plan
                    is to catch them red-handed before
                    they can destroy the evidence, then
                    write an expose for the paper and
                    win yourself another big award.
          
                              CASS
                    Something like that.

                    Or the place where the evidence is
                    stashed. Or a code word of some
                    kind. But the guy who knows has
                    gone missing, and you think the
                    dirty cops got a hold of him.

          and smiles.

          A tow truck is pulling up, towing Mahler's car. The tow truck
          driver turns to Mahler, who is in the passenger seat:
          
                              TOW TRUCK DRIVER
                    The garage is closed for the night.

          Mahler thinks this over, then SMACKS THE DRIVER ACROSS THE
          FACE WITH THE BUTT OF HIS GUN. The driver crumples in his
          seat.
          
                                 MAHLER
                    Guess not.
          
          Mahler leans across him, opens the driver's side door, and
          BOOTS him out of the cab.

                    I used to be a cop. Let's face it:
                    I'm naturally gonna be one step
                    ahead of you.

                    You weren't last time.
          
          Milo whips his head around:

                    What did you say?

                    Ok, here's what I think we should
                    do: I'll go up first, Jimmy knows
                    me, so if anything's wrong I'm sure
                    he'll give me a sign...
          
                              MILO
                    Excellent plan. Oh, except you're
                    staying in the car.
          
          Milo exits the car.

          But he is already headed for the casino entrance. He waves at
          her and disappears inside.

          Hawaiian shirt is coming towards him and HE AND MILO
          COLLIDE...

          heads down the hall. Another elevator DINGS behind him.
          
          Milo continues down the hall. Suddenly, he STOPS and looks
          behind him. No one is there.
          
                                                                    67.
          
          
          He turns another corner and FINDS 2504. There is a "DO NOT
          DISTURB" sign on the door. HE GOES PAST IT AND TAPS LIGHTLY
          ON 2505.

          No answer. He glances down the hall and sees a slight
          movement. SOMEONE IS WATCHING HIM. He moves away from the
          door, continues down the hall, THEN SLIPS INTO THE ICE
          MACHINE ROOM...
          
          
          INT ICE MACHINE ROOM- CONTINUOUS
          
          Milo hits the light switch off and waits just inside the
          door. Someone steps in, and MILO GRABS THEM AND THROWS THEM
          AGAINST THE WALL. The person SCREAMS. Milo slaps a hand
          across the person's mouth and switches on the light. And
          finds himself face to face with:

          He looks at the handcuff dangling from her wrist, STILL
          ATTACHED TO THE CAR DOOR ARM REST.

                    you're paying for that.

                    Oh, ok. Here's a nickle.
          
          Suddenly, Milo goes still. THERE IS A CREAKING SOUND as
          someone creeps down the hall. Milo puts a finger to Cass'
          lips.
          
          Then he peeks out the door.
          
          MILO'S POV- THE CLEANING CART BEING SLOWLY WHEELED DOWN THE
          HALL BY THE MAID. The maid stops by a room and enters.
          
                                                                  68.

          Milo passes the maid's cart, glancing at her ROOM RECORD
          SHEET, then continues on to room 2505. He uses the CARD HE
          SWIPED on the door. Of course, IT DOESN'T WORK.
          
                               MILO
                        (LOUD)
                    Godammit. Son of a bitch.
          
          The maid peeks out into the hall.
          
                              MILO
                        (to Cass)
                    This is like the third card they've
                    given me...
          
                              CASS
                        (playing along)
                    Take it easy, honey...
          
                              MILO
                    Don't tell me to take it easy, now
                    we have to go all the way
                    downstairs again...
          
          Cass looks pleadingly at the maid.
          
                              MAID
                    What's the name?
          
                              MILO
                    Davenport. Room 2505.
          
          The maid checks her chart, then crosses the hall and USES HER
          PASS KEY TO OPEN THE DOOR.
          
                              MILO
                    You're an angel.
          
          Milo and Cass go inside.
          
          
          INT ROOM 2505- EVENING
          
          Milo closes the door carefully behind them, then tiptoes
          across the room to the connecting door, Cass close on his
          heels. All is silent.
          
                                                                    69.
          
          
                              CASS
                        (WHISPERING)
                    Wait a second: where's my gun?
          
                               MILO
                        (SAME)
                    I don't know. Where is your gun?
          
                              CASS
                    I don't have one.
          
                              MILO
                    Then you've answered your own
                    question.
          
          Milo tiptoes closer to the door. Cass pulls on his sleeve.
          
                              CASS
                    Come on, give me something. You've
                    got, like, a million weapons in the
                    jacket.
          
          She reaches for his jacket, and Milo pulls away.
          
                              MILO
                    Hey. These are not toys. You can't
                    just give them to someone and have
                    them know how to use them.
          
                              CASS
                    I seem to remember doing just fine
                    with your taser gun.
          
          They are at the door. Milo puts a finger to his lips and
          tries the doorknob: LOCKED. He is about to work the lock when
          THEY HEAR SCREAMS COMING FROM THE LOCKED ROOM.
          
          No time to do this quietly. MILO TAKES A STEP BACK, THEN
          KICKS THE DOOR IN...
          
          
          INT HALLWAY- EVENING
          
          Halfway down the hallway, THE MAID HEARS THE DOOR BEING
          KICKED IN. Nervous, she backs away, headed for the
          elevators...
          
          
          INT ROOM 2504- CONTINUOUS
          
          Milo QUICKLY ENTERS THE ROOM, GUN RAISED. THE SCREAMING IS
          COMING FROM THE TV. Milo clicks it off and checks the room.
          The place appears to be deserted. He crosses to the bathroom
          and peers in: EMPTY.
          
                                                                 70.
          
          
          Meanwhile, Cass has cautiously entered the room and sees
          spots on the rug:
          
                              CASS
                    Oh, god, is that blood?
          
                              MILO
                    Hey. Columbo. Wait by the door.
          
                              CASS
                    I'm just trying to...
          
                              MILO
                    This could be a crime scene. There
                    are clues all over this room that
                    only a trained eye can find. And as
                    I seem to recall, you were the one
                    who was unable to figure this out
                    by herself.
          
          Oooh. Cass grits her teeth.
          
                              CASS
                        (under her breath)
                    He is unbelievable.
          
                              MILO
                    Who are you talking to, your
                    imaginary friend Leslie?
          
                              CASS
                        (BLUSHING)
                    Hey. Lots of kids have imaginary
                    friends, despite what my mother
                    believes.
          
                              MILO
                    Whatever. You wait by the door. And
                    I'll handle this.
          
                              CASS
                        (PISSED)
                    Fine.
          
          She moves back to the door. As she does, she notices a
          matchbook on the floor: IT'S A GREEN MATCHBOOK WITH A BLACK
          SILHOUETTE OF A HORSE.
          
                              CASS
                    So you're saying you don't want my
                    help.
          
                              MILO
                    I'm saying I don't need your help.
          
                                                                 71.
          
          
                                CASS
                          (SHRUGGING)
                    Ok.
          
          As he turns away, SHE SLIPS THE MATCHBOOK INTO HER PURSE.
          Milo catches this movement out of the corner of his eye and
          glances back:
          
                              MILO
                    What was that?
          
                              CASS
                        (INNOCENTLY)
                    What was what?
          
                              MILO
                    Did you find something?
          
                              CASS
                    How could I find anything? I'm not
                    the detective.
          
                              MILO
                    Lemme see your purse...
          
          Milo takes a step closer to her, but:
          
                                VOICE
                    FREEZE!
          
          Cass and Milo turn to see A HOTEL SECURITY GUARD IN THE
          DOORWAY, EXCITEDLY POINTING HIS GUN AT THEM. Milo rolls his
          eyes.
          
                              GUARD
                    Hotel security! Stay where you are!
          
                              MILO
                    Ok, Ok, no problem. You're probably
                    gonna want this.
          
          Milo holds up HIS GUN.
          
                              GUARD
                        (PANICKED)
                    DROP THE WEAPON, NOW!
          
                              MILO
                    Take it easy. I'm just gonna unload
                    it.
          
          Milo drops the cartridge, then TOSSES THE GUN RIGHT AT THE
          GUARD'S FACE.
          
                                                                   72.
          
          
          The guard instinctively raises his hands and Milo CHARGES
          him, tackling him to the ground, then handcuffing him to the
          table.
          
          Milo GRABS Cass hand and races from the room.
          
          
          INT HALLWAY- EVENING
          
          Cass and Milo run up to the elevators. ALL CARS ARE RISING:
          BACK-UP IS ON THE WAY. Milo hits the fire alarm and pulls
          Cass into the stairwell...
          
          
          INT STAIRWELL- EVENING
          
          Milo and Cass are almost to the bottom, WHEN SECURITY APPEARS
          IN THE STAIRWELL BENEATH THEM. Milo looks up. SECURITY IS
          COMING FROM ABOVE, AS WELL. Shit. Milo cracks the stairwell
          window and peers out: THEY ARE 4 STORIES UP.
          
                              MILO
                    You're gonna have to jump.
          
                                 CASS
                    I can't.
          
          Milo considers this, then picks her up and TOSSES HER OUT THE
          WINDOW.
          
          
          EXT TRUMP CASINO- EVENING
          
          Cass screams as she falls. Milo falls next to her. They fall
          and fall and BOOSH: THEY LAND IN A SNOW BANK AND TUMBLE TO
          THE GROUND.
          
          Seconds later, they are on their feet, RUNNING FOR THE CAR.
          
                              BOBBY (O.S.)
                    Ok, so some guy you're looking for
                    has disappeared. You want me to put
                    out an all-points on him?
          
          
          INT CADILLAC- EVENING
          
          Milo and Cass are speeding away from the Trump Casino.
          
                              MILO
                        (into phone)
                    The thing is, Bob: Cass thinks
                    dirty cops might be involved.
          
                                                                 73.

          INT POLICE STATION- EVENING
          
          Bobby is in his office. His door opens onto the squad room,
          busy with police activity. Bobby sits up straighter in his
          chair.
          
                              BOBBY
                    Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're with
                    Cassidy? Shit, Milo, you know when
                    you're around her your brain turns
                    to mush.
          
                              MILO
                    Yeah, well, that doesn't change the
                    fact that someone took a couple
                    shots at us.
          
          Beat.
          
                              BOBBY
                    You get a plate number?
          
                              MILO
                    Happened too quick. But it was a
                    dark 4-door Chevy, blue or grey,
                    New Jersey plates, and the car was
                    wrecked, I know that.
          
          Bobby thinks this over.
          
                              BOBBY
                    Ok. Lemme look into it. See what I
                    can find. Just hold tight, Ok?
          
          Milo checks his watch.
          
                              MILO
                    Ok. But we're kinda on a clock
                    here.
          
                              BOBBY
                    Milo, don't fuck around with this.
                    If there are dirty cops in the
                    house, we all have a problem. So do
                    me a favor: get off the strip, find
                    somewhere to lie low and wait for
                    my call.
          
                                                                   74.
          
          
          EXT BACK OF TRUMP CASINO- EVENING
          
          The scene has calmed down a little. A DARK SEDAN appears and
          RAY AND DWIGHT exit the car, looking like a an ugly,
          dangerous Odd Couple.
          
          An employee slips out the back door and hands Ray a PHOTO
          FROM SECURITY OF MILO AND CASS IN THE CASINO PARKING LOT.
          Dwight snatches the photo from Ray.
          
                              DWIGHT
                    Yeah, that's him.
          
                              RAY
                    Who's the chick?
          
                              DWIGHT
                    Who gives a fuck? Anyway, they
                    can't be far.
          
          It's true. They aren't too far. They are:
          
          
          EXT OFF ROUTE 9- EVENING
          
          A LUXURIOUS, ROMANTIC B&B. Xmas lights winking on the trees,
          "Come All Ye Faithful" gently wafting out the oak front door.
          
          CHIRON: "9:00 PM. ROUTE 9 SOUTH. 36 HOURS TO GO."
          
          The whole scene looks beautiful, peaceful, romantic...

                    Ok. Kill me now.
          
          PULL BACK TO REVEAL MILO AND CASS, parked in front. REVEAL
          THE SIGN NEXT TO THEM: "WELCOME TO CUPID'S CABIN". Yup. The
          place Milo and Cass ran off to and got married 3 years ago.
          
                              MILO
                    I'm sorry, it's the only place I
                    know off the strip.
          
                              CASS
                    I'm not going in. What if they
                    remember us?
          
                              MILO
                    They won't remember us. Why would
                    they remember us? Just...try to act
                    normal.
          
                                                                    75.
          
          
          INT LUXURY B&B- EVENING
          
          A small, family-run, luxury bed and breakfast. The kind of
          place that prides itself on its service. DAWN (long, graying
          hair, glasses, moccasins) greets them with a smile:
          
                              DAWN
                    Can I help you? (realizing) Wait,
                    it can't be...
          
          She looks behind her at a bulletin board. At photos of all
          the happy couples who have passed through her. And finds: A
          PHOTO OF MILO AND CASS, ARMS AROUND EACH OTHER, DRINKING
          CHAMPAGNE, CASS SHOWING OFF AN ENGAGEMENT RING.
          
                              DAWN
                        (to the back room)
                    Edmund, come quick!
          
          A balding man in flannel comes out, takes one look, and
          clasps both hands to his chest.
          
                              EDMUND
                    Be still my beating heart.
          
                              MILO
                        (LOW)
                    Looks like they remember us.
          
                                 CASS
                        (SAME)
                    Ya think?
          
                              EDMUND
                    What a lovely surprise. It's been,
                    what, 3 years?
          
          Milo and Cass both try to downplay:
          
                                 MILO
                    Has it?
          
                              CASS
                    I don't really remember...
          
                              DAWN
                        (REALIZING)
                    And you came back! To celebrate
                    your anniversary!
          
                              CASS
                    Oh, no. No, no...
          
                                                                  76.
          
          
                              EDMUND
                    What an honor for us!
          
                              CASS
                    Actually, we're not...
          
                               DAWN
                    You know what? In light of this
                    special special occasion: it's on
                    the house!
          
          Before Cass can protest more, MILO GRABS HER ARM.
          
                              MILO
                    Honey? Can I talk to you?
          
          He pulls her slightly aside.
          
                              MILO
                        (LOW)
                    You have any money?
          
                               CASS
                        (SAME)
                    No, as you recall, I gave you all
                    my money at the blackjack table...
                    (realizing) You blew all the money!
          
                              MILO
                    Hey! I would have won it back if
                    someone hadn't tasered me in the
                    bathroom!
          
                              CASS
                    So. Use a credit card.
          
                              MILO
                    Mine's max'd. Lemme have yours.
          
                              CASS
                    Mine's max'd too. (off his look)
                    What, I like to shop.
          
          They give each other a horrified look as they both realize
          what this means. Then they turn back to the couple, put their
          arms around each other, and smile:
          
                              MILO/CASS
                    It's our third anniversary!
          
                              DAWN/EDMUND
                    Congratulations!
          
                                                                  77.
          
          
                                 MILO/CASS
                    Thanks!
          
          Milo and Cass snuggle closer. He surreptitiously squeezes her
          ass. She surreptitiously STOMPS on his foot.
          
          
          INT LUXURY B&B DINING-ROOM- EVENING
          
          Full of couples in love. Young couples, old couples, gay
          couples, straight couples. Even a dog couple snuggled up by
          the fire.
          
          And then there's Milo and Cass, bruised and dishevelled,
          being served an elaborate romantic meal. They smile
          uncomfortably as Edmund arrives with a tray of oysters:
          
                              EDMUND
                    To begin: a little aphrodisiac!
          
          He gives them both a broad wink.
          
                                 MILO
                           (GRIMLY)
                    Wow.
          
                                 CASS
                        (SAME)
                    Great.
          
                              EDMUND
                    So tell me: how have you managed to
                    keep the romance alive all this
                    time?
          
                              MILO
                    Well, I'll tell you, Edmund.
                    The secret to our success is that
                    the little woman here knows her
                    place. She cleans for me, cooks for
                    me, and every night when I come
                    home she gets down on her knees and
                    massages my feet.
          
          He beams at Cass. Cass grins through her teeth.
          
                              CASS
                    Yes, Edmund, it's true. I massage
                    his feet to help him feel like a
                    man. It's important, especially
                    when your husband has such a teeny
                    tiny...
          
          Just then, Dawn hustles over, interrupting:
          
                                                                 78.

                    How is everything? Is it like that
                    magical night 3 years ago?
          
                              CASS
                    Uh-huh.
          
                              MILO
                    Yup. You betcha.
          
                              DAWN
                    This calls for a toast!
          
          She raises a glass, tapping it with a spoon. Milo and Cass
          both groan under their breath.
          
                              DAWN
                        (to the room)
                    May I have your attention please?
                    Edmund and I would like to share
                    with you the most romantic moment
                    we have ever seen. It was three
                    years ago today, in this very
                    restaurant, when this lovely young
                    man here, right in the middle of
                    the meal, threw down his napkin,
                    got down on one knee, and said
                    marry me, right now, right this
                    second, I want to go to sleep
                    tonight knowing you're my wife!
          
                              EDMUND
                        (jumping in)
                    And she said yes, with tears in her
                    eyes and a tremble in her hand,
                    let's get married, and they ran out
                    to the all night chapel and came
                    back an hour later, man and wife!
          
          The whole restaurant starts clapping. Milo turns to Edmund:
          
                              MILO
                    Can I get a whiskey?
          
                              CASS
                    Make that two.

          Milo and Cass stumble down the hall, laughing hysterically,
          falling down drunk.
          
                                                                  79.
          
          
                              MILO
                    After we broke up, I was so mad at
                    you, I told everyone I know you
                    have herpes.
          
                               CASS
                    I told everyone you flunked out of
                    3rd grade.
          
                               MILO
                    I told everyone you have a
                    moustache.
          
                              CASS
                    I told everyone you like to wear my
                    panties.
          
                              MILO
                    Hey!
          
          This one is obviously true. Both laugh harder.
          
          
          INT LUXURY B&B HONEYMOON SUITE- NIGHT
          
          Milo and Cass stagger in, blinking hazily at their new
          surroundings. A heart-shaped bed. Champagne. A bubble bath. A
          fireplace. The works. Like Cupid threw up in here.
          
          The laughter slowly fades. Long beat. Then:
          
                              CASS
                    Wow. This would be really awkward
                    if we still had feelings for each
                    other. Which we don't...
          
                              MILO
                    That's right. Luckily, we're
                    different people now. We don't feel
                    the way we used to.
          
                              CASS
                    Right. We've moved on.
          
                              MILO
                    We have no feelings about each
                    other whatsoever.

                    Just two people who used to know

                       Feels fantastic.
          
                                 MILO
                       A platonic relationship. Working
                       together.
          
                                 CASS

                       Trusting each other.
          
          Which reminds them: THEY DON'T TRUST EACH OTHER. Awkward
          pause. Then:

          As soon as Milo hears the water, HE HURRIES OVER TO THE BED
          WHERE CASS LEFT HER PURSE. HE STARTS DIGGING THROUGH IT.

          Cass is seated on the toilet lid, HUNCHED OVER HER PHONE:

                           (LOW)
                       Hey. It's me.

                                 CASS
                       No. You're not gonna believe this,
                       but: I'm at Cupid's Cabin with

          Milo is looking through Cass' purse. HE KNOWS SHE WAS HIDING
          SOMETHING FROM HIM AT THE CASINO. While searching through her
          wallet, he suddenly stumbles across A WEDDING PHOTO OF
          HIMSELF AND CASS.
          
          Huh. He glances at the bathroom door. She carries their
          wedding photo around?
          
          
          INT LUXURY B&B BATHROOM- NIGHT
          
          Cass listens while Mom rants:

                              MOM
                    I mean, I just don't get it, you're
                    in this romantic place, you have a
                    perfect opportunity to win him
                    back...
          
                              CASS
                    Why should I have to win him back?
                    He should have to win me back! And
                    who says I want him back, anyway?
          
                              MOM
                    I have never understood this
                    competitive streak of yours...
          
                              CASS
                        (losing her patience)
                    Look, the reason I called: I
                    remember you worked at this one
                    place where they had these bright
                    green matches with, like, this
                    silhouette of a horse on them?
          
                              MOM
                        (immediately defensive)
                    That was a long time ago! And all I
                    did was serve drinks...
          
                              CASS
                    I just need to know the name of the
                    place.
          
                              MOM
                    Charley's. And Ok, I admit, maybe I
                    did a little dancing, but how often
                    do you make 200 an hour in tips?
          
                              CASS
                    I gotta go.
          
                              MOM
                    I want grandkids!
          
          Cass hangs up. She sits for a moment, staring at her phone.
          Is her mother right? Is she making a mistake right now? She
          looks around the bathroom. Candles, flowers, thick robes.
          
          A bottle of champagne chilling by the heart-shaped tub. She
          slowly stands and checks herself out in the mirror, brushing
          back her hair with her hands.
          
          Suddenly, on impulse, she grabs the bottle of champagne and
          two glasses. WHAT THE HELL, WHY NOT?
          
                                                                    83.
          
          
          They're here, maybe they should seize the moment. She peeks
          out the bathroom door and sees...

          INT BATHROOM- NIGHT
          
          Cass is disappointed and vindicated all at once. She puts the
          champagne back.
          
                              CASS
                        (to herself)

          Milo hears the water go off. HE POCKETS THE MATCHES, tosses
          the purse away and lies on the bed, striking a casual pose.
          
          Cass emerges.
          
                              MILO
                    Good shower?
          
                                CASS
                    The best.
          
                                MILO
                    Great.
          
                              CASS
                    You know what's great? Trusting
                    each other.
          
                                MILO
                    I agree.
          
          He holds up the handcuffs:

          SNOW IS FALLING OUTSIDE. PAN FROM THE WINDOW, ACROSS THE ROOM
          TO THE BED, ACROSS A SNORING MILO TO CASS, EYES CLOSED, HAND
          CUFFED TO THE HEADBOARD.
          
          Suddenly, CASS' EYES SNAP OPEN. She sits up a little and
          glances over at MILO'S NIGHT TABLE WHERE HE LEFT THE KEYS AND
          GUN IN PLAIN VIEW. She smiles...
          
          
          INT LUXURY B&B SUITE- TEN MINUTES LATER
          
          Cass is doing a slow, careful, ACROBATIC CLIMB ACROSS MILO'S
          BODY in an attempt to reach the gun without waking Milo up.
          She puts a hand on the headboard. She is lifting her knee
          over him, when he stirs.
          
          She freezes, waiting for him to settle. It's like playing
          Twister, only if the person you're playing with finds out,
          HE'S GOING TO KILL YOU.
          
          She manages to get herself STRADDLING HIM, arms stretched,
          THE GUN ALMOST WITHIN REACH, when:
          
                                 MILO
                    Excuse me.
          
          Cass FREEZES.
          
                              MILO
                    What are you doing?
          
          She looks down. Milo is watching her, wide awake. Hmm. This
          is going to be a tough one to explain.
          
                                 CASS
                    Um...
          
                              MILO
                    Are you trying to seduce me?

                        (SWALLOWING)
                    Yes. Yes I am.
          
          She tries to reach for the gun while they talk.
          
                              MILO
                        (INNOCENTLY)
                    I didn't know you were still so
                    attracted to me. I mean, I remember
                    how you used to like to greet me at
                    the door in nothing but a...

                              CASS
                        (INTERRUPTING)
                    Yes, it's true, I'm still attracted
                    to you.
          
          Her hand is groping around blindly, where the fuck is it? She
          stretches more, bringing her face even closer to Milo's.
          
                               MILO
                    Really? Wow. That's great news. You
                    know what would be really sexy
                    right now?
          
          Uh-oh.

                              MILO
                    No. If you talked dirty to me.
          
          The gun seems to be getting father away. THEIR LIPS ARE
          ALMOST TOUCHING NOW...

                    Um...I can't stop thinking about
                    you.
          
                              MILO
                    Really? What part of me?
          
                              CASS
                    Just...all of you.
          
                              MILO
                    Be specific.
          
          Cass blushes fiercely. If she didn't want that gun so bad...
          
                              MILO
                        (HELPFULLY)

                    Or...something lower like...
          
          He reaches down and WHIPS OUT:
          
                                                                 86.

                    My gun?
          
          THE GUN IS IN HIS HAND. That's why she couldn't reach it. HE
          KNEW WHAT SHE WAS UP TO THIS WHOLE TIME. She flips off him
          and back onto her side. Milo sits up, flipping on the lights.
          
                              MILO
                    I knew I couldn't trust you!

                    When were you gonna tell me you
                    have no intention of helping me
                    with my story?

                    You're right. I'm not helping you.
                    This is my story now. This time I
                    get to come out on top! Karma,

                    Oh my god, would you get over it
                    already! So I cracked the case
                    before you did, it was 3 years ago,
                    it happened, stop being such a baby
                    and move on!
          
                               MILO
                    Oh I'm moving on. You know how I'm
                    moving on? By cracking this case
                    before you, then taking you in so
                    you can spend this Xmas in jail,
                    all alone.
          
          He rolls over, turning his back to her. Cass stares at the
          ceiling, fuming.

          Jimmy, tied to a chair, watches nervously as MAHLER TAKES
          EVIDENCE BOXES THAT ARE STACKED ALONG THE WALLS AND MOVES
          THEM ONTO A MOVER'S DOLLY.
          
                              JIMMY
                    So this is your place, huh? Nice.
                    Cozy. Probably more fun to sit
                    where you can actually see the
                    dancers, but...
          
          Mahler has all the boxes loaded up. He grabs a rag and
          approaches Jimmy.
          
                              JIMMY
                    Oh. Hey, listen, no need for that,
                    I swear I'll be as quiet as a
                    mouse.
          
          Mahler gags him, THEN PUNCHES HIM IN THE FACE. JIMMY SLUMPS
          OVER.
          
                              MAHLER
                    I know you will.
          
          Mahler grabs the dolly, flicks off the lights, and EXITS OUT

                    No, you idiot, it means she hasn't
                    cleaned out her wallet in 3 years.
                    I'm pretty sure I'm still carrying

                              CASS
                    Nothing. I had her add mayo to your
                    burger. I remember you like that.
          
          Milo glances at Dawn and she nods in confirmation.

                    Oh. (surprised) Thanks.
          
          Milo takes a bite from his burger and considers Cass.
          
                              MILO
                    Ok, look: I know you're probably
                    upset that you're not gonna get the
                    story. But a person can't win every
                    time, right?
          
                              CASS
                    Depends on the person.

                    referring to is you, I agree: you
                    can't win every time.

          SLOWLY SLIDES OFF HIS CHAIR ONTO THE FLOOR. Cass calmly
          reaches across the table, taking his keys and unhandcuffing
          herself.
          
          Car keys in hand, she bends down to whisper in his ear:

          Next to an ambulance, Milo is unconscious on a stretcher. An
          EMT prepares a HUGE SYRINGE, picks a spot on Milo's chest,
          then PLUNGES THE NEEDLE INTO IT.
          
                                                                  91.

                    kill me.
          
          The EMT exchanges a look with the ambulance driver, then
          helps Milo off the stretcher.

                    Sure. Charley's, on the boardwalk.
                    And just FYI: when they say "don't
                    touch" the dancers, they mean with
                    with any part of your body, not
                    just your hands.
          
          The EMT folds the stretcher, loads it into the ambulance, and
          THEY DRIVE AWAY, leaving Milo in the parking lot.

          LIKE SOMEONE TRYING TO CALL OUT THROUGH A GAG. She looks
          around. There is a window higher up on the wall. Cass drags a
          trash can beneath the window, stacks another one on top of
          it, and cautiously climbs up.
          
          The window is locked and she can't see through it. Hmm. Fuck
          it. She takes her purse and SMASHES a pane of glass.

          The top of a head appears, then a face: IT'S CASS.
          
          Relieved, Jimmy starts gesturing excitedly for her to come
          in. Cass climbs in, drops to the floor, hurries over to Jimmy
          and ungags him.

                    I have a better question...
          
          Cass looks in the rearview mirror. SHIT: DWIGHT AND RAY ARE
          IN THE BACKSEAT, POINTING GUNS AT THE BACK OF THEIR HEADS.
          
                              DWIGHT
                    Where the fuck is Milo?
          
          Jimmy almost bursts into tears.
          
                              JIMMY
                    You know what? I think I'll get a
                    real job. Work at Kinko's. Or
                    Burger King. That doesn't sound so
                    bad anymore...
          
                              RAY
                        (INTERRUPTING)
                    Hey. Who the fuck are you?
          
                              JIMMY
                    Nobody.
          
                              RAY
                    Right. So what the fuck are you
                    doing in this car?
          
          Jimmy glances back at them. Do they mean he can just...?
          
                              DWIGHT
                        (spelling it out)
                    Run, you jackass.
          
          Jimmy gives Cass a quick look ("sorry"), then exits the car
          and TAKES OFF RUNNING DOWN THE BOARDWALK. CASS CAN'T BELIEVE
          IT. She drops her forehead into the steering wheel in
          despair.

          Milo is driving along in a stolen Volvo, cables hanging under
          the steering wheel from where he hot-wired it. He is just
          coming up on the boardwalk when his phone rings.

                    What kind of asshole runs up a

                    That's not what I told you to say.
          
          Ray grabs the phone away from her. Into phone:

                    Oh, she's my girlfriend alright.
                    But fair is fair: you guys can keep
                    her.

                    I think he hung up.

          glances around: CASS MUST BE AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE.
          
          His phone rings again.

                    Look, Milo, I don't think you
                    understand: we're gonna hurt her.
          
          Milo hears MUSIC COMING FROM DWIGHT'S END. DANCE MUSIC.
          SLEAZY MUSIC. UNMISTAKABLY STRIP-CLUB MUSIC.
          
          He heads for CHARLEY'S. Into phone:

                    Oh, I understand, alright, and I
                    don't blame ya. I want to hurt her
                    all the time.
          
          Cass grabs the phone from Dwight. Into phone:

          Milo slips inside and scans the room. HE SEES CASS IN A BOOTH
          ACROSS THE ROOM WITH DWIGHT AND RAY. Into phone:
          
                              MILO
                    Ok. Fine. Say you were wrong.
          
          Cass hesitates. Into phone:
          
                                CASS
                    For what?
          
                              MILO
                    For what? For poisoning me with

                    Say you were wrong.

                              MILO
                    Ok. Now. Admit that the only reason
                    you were able to crack that case
                    three years ago was because you
                    looked through my files.

                    stop shifting in your seat like
                    that and just tell them you have to
                    use the bathroom.
          
          Cass sits up straighter. Wait a second, he's here?
          
                              MILO
                    Don't look around. Just do it.

          Cass enters. Milo is behind the door. He SLAMS the door
          closed after she is in, and blocks her escape.
          
                              MILO
                    You know what my mistake was? I
                    never should have let you out of
                    the trunk. I'm fine, by the way.
                    The doctor said I may have been
                    technically dead for a few seconds,
                    but I'm fine now.
          
          Cass is not impressed. She stares at him coldly.
          
                              CASS
                    So that's what you really think?
                    That I stole information from you?
          
                              MILO
                    It's not what I think, it's what I
                    know. How else did you beat me?
          
                              CASS
                        (as though to a 5 yr old)
                    Did it ever occur to you that I
                    just might be good at my job?
          
          Milo stares at her. Huh. It actually didn't occur to him...
          
                              CASS
                    That's what I thought. You know
                    what, Milo? You're an even bigger
                    asshole than I previously
                    suspected, and you deserve
                    everything that's happened to you.
                    (beat) And everything that's about
                    to happen to you.
          
          "About to happen"? Milo is just starting to realize...
          
                              MILO
                    You wouldn't...
          
                              CASS
                        (SCREAMING)
                    MILO BOYD IS IN HERE!

          Son of a bitch. The bathroom door SHOOTS open and DWIGHT AND
          RAY ENTER. They back Milo into a corner. Cass smiles at Milo,
          waves, and exits.

          Cass comes flying out of the club and runs right into:
          MAHLER. HE TAKES ONE LOOKS AT HER AND PUSHES HER BACK INSIDE.
          
          
          INT BATHROOM- AFTERNOON
          
          Dwight and Ray are frisking Milo, taking away his array of

                    Wow. You always carry this much
                    gear?
          
                              MILO
                    Only during the holidays.
          
          
          INT CHARLEY'S- CONTINUOUS
          
          Milo is pushed out of the bathroom, and comes face to face
          with CASS. MAHLER APPEARS FROM BEHIND HER, TAKES ONE LOOK AT
          MILO AND POINTS HIS GUN AT MILO'S HEAD.
          
                              MAHLER
                    Remember me?
          
                              DWIGHT
                    What the fuck?
          
          Dwight steps forward from behind Milo, AND POINTS HIS GUN AT
          MAHLER. MAHLER REACTS, SHIFTING THE GUN TO DWIGHT. RAY STEPS
          UP, GUN POINTED AT MAHLER.
          
          Momentary stand-off. Stuck between the bad guys, MILO AND
          CASS GIVE EACH OTHER EVIL LOOKS.
          
          A half-naked dancer appears:

                    Lapdance?
          
          Everyone looks at her. She is just realizing...

                    Maybe I should come back later...

          STOMPING ON MAHLER'S FOOT, CAUSING HIM TO LOOSEN HIS HOLD ON
          HER, MILO SLAMMING HIS ELBOW BACK ONTO RAY'S ABDOMEN.
          
          RAY'S GUN GOES OFF AS CASS AND MILO BOTH HIT THE FLOOR.
          MAHLER REACTS, FIRING AT RAY. DWIGHT FIRES AT MAHLER...
          
          TOTAL PANDEMONIUM. Girls screaming, patrons running for the
          exit.
          
          MAHLER AND DWIGHT BOTH GET HIT. Milo crawls over to a moaning
          Dwight and recovers his gun. He looks up in time to see CASS
          DISAPPEARING OUT THE FRONT DOOR.

          Milo comes out. THE BOARDWALK IS PACKED, CASS IS LOST IN THE

          and scatter REVEALING CASS, climbing into the Cadillac.

          MILO'S FACE APPEARS, UPSIDE-DOWN, IN THE WINDSHIELD,
          GRINNING.
          
                                CASS
                      Get off the car, Milo.
          
          He gives her the finger.

                      Get off the car, you psychopath.
          
                                MILO
                      Oh, I am a psychopath, and you know
                      why? Cause you made me that way.
                      And if I'm going crazy, I'm taking
                      you with me.
          
          He reaches a hand through the driver's window, grabbing at
          her. Cass SCREAMS, squeezes her eyes shut and HITS THE GAS.
          
          MORE SIRENS, RAPIDLY APPROACHING...
          
                                                                    100.

          Milo falls into the car, grabbing at the wheel. They fight
          for control of the car as it goes spinning off the road...

          Cass and Milo both just sit there breathing for a moment.
          Then Milo turns and glares at Cass, and THE LOOK ON HER FACE
          SAYS SHE KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT'S COMING NEXT:

          the lid.
          
          IMMEDIATELY, HIS CELL PHONE RINGS. Milo glances at it, then
          reluctantly answers:
          
                              MILO
                    Yeah?
          
          
          SPLIT-SCREEN:
          
          Bobby, ocean in the background, furious:
          
                              BOBBY
                    What the fuck are you doing? I
                    thought I told you to lie low.
          
                              MILO
                    I was lying low...
          
                              BOBBY
                    Yeah? Then how is it that a
                    statewide all-points was just put
                    out on the two of you?
          
                              MILO
                        (SIGHING)
                    It's a long story.
          
                              BOBBY

                    me, I'll protect you til we figure
                    this out. Can you get to Pier 19?
          
          Milo looks around. He can just make out Pier 19 in the
          distance, a mile or two away.
          
                                                                 102.

          Milo and Cass drive up in the Cadillac and park out of sight.
          They exit the car and look around. The pier seems to be
          deserted. Then they hear a soft motor, and BOBBY APPEARS IN A
          MOTORBOAT.
          
                                 BOBBY
                       Get in.

          The sound of a motorboat chugging along.
          
          
          INT MOTORBOAT- EVENING
          
          Bobby is at the back of the boat, steering. Cass and Milo are
          up front, explaining:
          
                                 CASS
                       So, these guys have a bunch of
                       stolen evidence stashed somewhere
                       in Atlantic City...
          
                                 MILO
                       And we think they're ditching it
                       tonight.
          
          A SMALL YACHT APPEARS ON THE HORIZON. Bobby steers the
          motorboat towards it. MILO AND CASS TURN TO LOOK AS THE YACHT
          COMES INTO VIEW. AND AT THE SAME MOMENT, CASS AND MILO MAKE
          OUT THE NAME ON THE SIDE OF THE BOAT:
          
          "SPARROW".
          
                                 BOBBY
                           (CASUALLY)
                       You know, if I was them, I'd store
                       the evidence on a boat, drive the
                       boat about 30 miles out, and blow
                       the whole thing up.
          
          Cass and Milo both slowly turn to find BOBBY POINTING A GUN
          AT THE TWO OF THEM. Off Milo's disappointed look:
          
                                 BOBBY
                       Hey, man. I got mouths to feed.
          
                                                                 103.
          
          
                              MILO
                    Aw. That's what all the dirty cops
                    say.
          
          Bobby quickly frisks Cass, and frisks and disarms Milo. He
          steers the boat one-handed up next to the yacht and cuts the
          motorboats engine.
          
          Milo makes a sudden LUNGE for Bobby and BOBBY CRACKS HIM OVER
          THE BACK OF THE HEAD WITH THE BUTT OF THE GUN, SENDING MILO
          SPRAWLING TO THE BACK OF THE BOAT, RIGHT ON TOP OF THE MOTOR.
          
          Milo struggles back up to a seated position.
          
                              BOBBY
                    You've always been such a stubborn
                    asshole, Milo. You just don't
                    listen. All you had to do was stay
                    where I told you and none of this
                    would have happen. Now the two of
                    you are gonna have to go down with
                    the boat.

                    Ok. Guess that's it. Gotta go.
                    (checking them out) You know what?
                    You guys make a great couple.
          
          Bobby exits and Cass and Milo are alone.
          
          Suddenly, CASS STARTS GIGGLING.
          
                              MILO
                    What's so funny?

          Cass is laughing harder and harder until MILO REALIZES:

                    Hey, are you crying?

                        (SOBBING)
                    No. I'm not...
          
          Milo doesn't know what to do. His hands are trapped in front
          of him, he can't even pat her on the shoulder.
          
                              MILO
                    Ok, just don't...
          
                              CASS
                    I'm not crying.
          
                              MILO
                    I know you're not.
          
                              CASS
                    I just...(miserable) I can't
                    believe I going to die by being
                    blown up and sinking to the bottom
                    of the ocean with someone who
                    thinks I'm a total liar.
          
                              MILO
                    We're not gonna die.
          
                              CASS
                    Oh yeah? What's the plan?
          
                              MILO
                        (THINKING)
                    Well...
          
          Milo looks around. There is a SMALL PORTHOLE IN ONE WALL.
          Milo assumes a take-charge manner:
          
                              MILO
                    Ok. Here's what we do. We're going
                    to synchronize our efforts in order
                    to cross the room and manipulate
                    the bomb out of the room and into
                    the water in order to diffuse the
                    explosive impact.
          
          Beat.
          
                              CASS
                    You mean we're going to throw the
                    bomb out the window?
          
                                                                105.
          
          
                              MILO
                    Uh, yeah. Or we can just wait to
                    get blown up.
          
          CLOSE ON- THE TIMER: "1:19, 1:18, 1:17..."
          
                              CASS
                        (QUICKLY)
                    I'm with you. Go, team, go.
          
                              MILO
                    That's the spirit. Ok, first we're
                    going sideways: to the left...
          
          Milo leans one way, Cass leans the other: THEY DON'T MOVE.
          
                              MILO
                    Ok. My left this time...
          
          They both lean to the left and topple over. Milo is facing
          the direction of the bomb.
          
                              MILO
                    Now we're gonna work our way over
                    to the bomb.
          
          They start moving like a sideways inchworm, creeping along.
          
                              MILO
                    And I don't think you're a total
                    liar, but in my own defense, I was
                    one of the top detectives in my
                    division, I had been working that
                    case for months, and then you just
                    waltzed in and solved it.
          
                              CASS
                    I didn't just "waltz in". You know
                    I had been working it for months,
                    too. Isn't it possible that we're
                    both good at our jobs, and I just
                    happened to come out ahead?
          
          Beat.
          
                              MILO
                        (FUMBLING)
                    Oh. Well, I...(blurting out) Look,
                    I was confused, I had never been in
                    love before!
          
                              CASS
                    Well, neither had I!
          
                                                                    106.
          
          
          Milo seems surprised to hear this. But before he can respond,
          THE BOAT ROCKS ON A WAVE AND THEY ARE SENT ROLLING IN CASS'
          DIRECTION. AS THEY ROLL:
          
                                CASS
                    Ow...
          
                                MILO
                    Shit..
          
                                CASS
                    Dammit...
          
          They are stopped when MILO'S FACE IS SLAMMED INTO THE SIDE OF
          THE BOAT. Milo lets out a grunt. Beat.
          
                                CASS
                    Milo?
          
                              MILO
                        (MUFFLED)
                    I'm Ok. Ok, we need to turn to the
                    right, and wait for the next wave.
          
          They both start turning separate ways:
          
                                MILO
                    My right.
          
          They turn to the right and wait. After a moment:
          
                              MILO
                    So. You were in love with me?
          
                              CASS
                    Of course I was in love with you,
                    why do you think I married you?
          
          No response. Behind her back, Milo looks sheepish. Cass
          REALIZES:
          
                              CASS
                    Oh. My. God. You think I married
                    you so I could get info on the
                    case? Who am I, Mata Hari?
          
          Milo looks confused. He is trying to figure out...
          
                              CASS
                    She's a spy, Milo.
          
          Aaah.
          
                                                                 107.
          
          
                              MILO
                        (QUICKLY)
                    I know that. Everybody knows that.
                    Mata Hari the spy.
          
          Beat. Milo clears his throat.
          
                              MILO
                    Well. It might be a little late for
                    this. But...nice job on the
                    article.
          
                              CASS
                    You know, if I had something sharp
                    right now, I would stab you.
          
                              MILO
                    No, really, I mean, it was well-
                    written and...
          
                              CASS
                    Can you just get us out of here,
                    please?
          
          Suddenly, A WAVE HITS THE BOAT, AND THEY GO ROLLING TOWARDS
          THE BOMB. AS THEY ROLL:
          
                              CASS
                    Umph...
          
                              MILO
                    Ughh...
          
                              CASS
                    Son of a...
          
                              MILO
                    Ow...
          
          And they come to a stop, MILO'S FACE PRESSED RIGHT UP TO THE
          BOMB. He watches the timer: "00:44, 00:43, 00:42..."
          
                              CASS
                    Can you see the bomb?
          
                               MILO
                    Uh, yeah. I can see the bomb. Now
                    we get up.
          
          MILO GRABS THE BOMB AND HOLDS IT AGAINST HIS BELLY. Cass and
          Milo push against each other, and struggle up to a standing
          position.
          
          Great. So far, so good.
          
                                                                 108.
          
          
          Only, MILO CAN'T RAISE HIS ARMS. AND THE PORTHOLE IS SIX FEET
          ABOVE THE GROUND. NOW WHAT?
          
                              CASS
                    Did you throw it?
          
                              MILO
                    Not exactly.
          
                              CASS
                    Well, what are you waiting for?
          
                              MILO
                    I'm waiting for a pig to fly in
                    here and grab it.
          
                              CASS
                        (starting to panic again)
                    Milo...
          
                              MILO
                    Ok, Ok. Um, on 3, I need you to
                    jump.
          
          Beat.
          
                              CASS
                    What?
          
                              MILO
                    You know: "jump, jump, jump around,
                    jump."
          
                              CASS
                    Are you serious?
          
                              MILO
                    No. I'm fucking with you. For fun.
                    Just for my own personal
                    enjoyment...
          
                              CASS
                    Ok, Ok.
          
                              MILO
                    Ok: 1, 2, 3...
          
          
          EXT PORTHOLE- EVENING
          
          We see MILO'S HEAD POP INTO VIEW, THEN DISAPPEAR.

          MILO'S HEAD POPS UP HIGHER...
          
          CLOSE ON- THE TIMER "00:06, 00:05, 00:04..."
          
          This time, MILO POPS UP HIGH ENOUGH THAT WE SEE HIS HANDS...
          
          CLOSE ON- THE TIMER "00:03, 00:02, 00:01..."
          
          And finally, MILO IS HIGH ENOUGH THAT HE CAN THRUST THE BOMB
          OUT THE WINDOW...
          
          CLOSE ON THE BOMB AS IT CRASHES INTO THE WATER...
          
          
          INT HULL OF BOAT- EVENING
          
          Milo and Cass, both a little out of breath, stand still,
          listening. Silence.
          
                              CASS
                    Think the water defused it?
          
                              MILO
                    Lemme ask you this? Has anything
                    gone our way yet?
          
          SUDDENLY, A LOW ROAR FROM BENEATH GROWS AND RISES UP BENEATH
          THE BOAT, ROCKING IT WILDLY AS WATER EXPLODES ON ALL SIDES.
          
          Cass and Milo get drenched, BUT ARE SAFE.
          
                                CASS
                    Nice job.
          
                              MILO
                    Hey. You, too.
          
                                CASS
                    Thanks.
          
                              MILO
                    Now lets find something to cut
                    these ropes off...
          
                              CASS
                    Think we can catch that cop?
          
                              MILO
                    Trust me: we can definitely catch
                    that cop.
          
          Because at this very moment...
          
                                                                    110.

          ...Bobby is paddling frantically, pausing every once in a
          while to curse the motor, WHICH FOR SOME REASON REFUSES TO
          START. He see the lights of another boat coming up behind
          him, and he paddles faster.
          
          
          EXT DECK OF YACHT- NIGHT
          
          Milo steers the yacht right up behind Bobby, dwarfing the
          motorboat. Calling out:
          
                              MILO
                    Hey, Bobby. I got one for ya...
          
          Bobby looks up to see MILO POINTING AN ASSAULT RIFLE HE
          GRABBED FROM THE EVIDENCE BOXES:
          
                              MILO
                    What's the difference between a
                    snowman and a snowwoman? (holding
                    something up) The spark plug.
          
          Bobby checks the motor: SO THAT'S WHY IT WON'T RUN. MILO
          GRABBED THE SPARK PLUG. Milo and Cass grin down at Bobby
          while he kicks the motor and swears.
          
          
          EXT PIER 19- DAWN
          
          CHIRON: "6:00 AM. PIER 19. 3 HOURS TO GO."
          
          Cops are everywhere. Cass and Milo are seated on a bench,
          exhausted, watching as THE COPS UNLOAD BOXES OF STOLEN
          EVIDENCE FROM THE YACHT. Bobby is cuffed in the back of a
          squad car.
          
          After a moment:
          
                              MILO
                    Merry Xmas. I got you this.
          
          Milo hands Cass some seaweed.
          
                              CASS
                    You shouldn't have.
          
          Milo checks his watch.
          
                              MILO
                    Hey. I've still got three hours to
                    get you to jail. Looks like I'm
                    gonna win that bet after all.
          
                                                                  111.
          
          
          Cass' eyes go wide. Suddenly, she JUMPS UP and BOLTS.
          
                              MILO
                        (to himself)
                    You have got to be kidding me.
          
          
          EXT BEACH- DAWN
          
          Like an action sequence in slo-mo, Cass stumbles across the
          sand, exhausted, Milo at her heels. Finally, he makes one
          last effort, LUNGES for her, brings her down and SNAPS on the
          cuffs.
          
                               CASS
                        (muffled, face in the
                         SAND)
                    I'm not going without a fight.
          
                              MILO
                    Yeah. I'm getting that.
          
          He pulls her to her feet.
          
          INT JERSEY CITY POLICE STATION- MORNING
          
          Milo leads Cass up to the clerk, both of them looking like a
          mess. He checks his watch:
          
                              MILO
                    9am. See? Easy as pie.(nudging
                    Cass) Go on, say it.
          
                              CASS
                        (to the clerk)
                    I'd like to turn myself in. (can't
                    resist) Though I didn't do anything
                    wrong...
          
                              MILO
                    Stop talking.
          
                              CASS
                    ...and I was unjustly arrested...
          
          To shut her up, Milo GRABS HER AND KISSES HER. THEN SHE IS
          KISSING HIM BACK. TIME STOPS FOR A MOMENT.
          
          Then Milo hands her over to the clerk.
          
                              MILO
                        (to Cass)

                    Oh. Ok.
          
          The clerk leads her into the jail.

          Milo exits. He passes some cops on their way in. ONE GELMAN,
          THE COP HE INSULTED IN THE BEGINNING.
          
                              GELMAN
                    Hey. It's that jerk-off bounty
                    hunter.
          
          Milo stops in his tracks. Mentally weighs the pros and cons.
          DECIDES:

                    Ah, what the hell.
          
          He turns around, walks back to Gelman, AND SMASHES HIM IN THE
          FACE WITH HIS FIST.

          Cass is trying to find a clean place to sit down, when MILO

                    Oh my god, what happened?
          
                              MILO
                    Hey. I couldn't let you spend Xmas
                    alone. Besides, I didn't really
                    have any plans other than drinking
                    some cheap whiskey and putting my
                    fist through a wall.
          
                              CASS
                    I'm touched that you would give
                    that up for me.
          
                              MILO
                    Hey. It's the kind of guy I am.

                     Of course I was right. I knew

                     were just stuck together long
                     enough. And thank god. Better she

                     I love you more.
          
          Cass smiles. Beat. Then:
          
                               CASS
                     Well, I doubt you love me more.
          
                               MILO
                     I'm just saying I love you a lot.
          
                               CASS
                     Right. I know. I love you a lot,
                     too. Let's just say you love me and
                     leave it at that.
          
                               MILO
                     Fine. I love you.

THE BROTHERS BLOOM

1   EXT. DIRT ROAD - SUNRISE                                      1

    Dawn with her rose-red fingers rises over a dusty country
    road. A car chugs over the horizon.

                        NARRATOR
              As far as con man stories go,
              I think I've heard them all.
              Of grifters, ropers, faro fixers,
              tales drawn long and tall.
              But if one bears a bookmark in
              the confidence man's tome,
              twould be that of Penelope,
              and of the brothers Bloom.


2   EXT. COUNTRY HOUSE - MORNING                                  2

    The car deposits two shabby boys (10 & 13) in front of a
    country house.

    Both in black.   Each with a suitcase.

                        NARRATOR
              At ten and thirteen Bloom and
              Stephen (the younger and the old)


3   INT. KITCHEN (FLASHBACK)                                      3

    The two brothers and an oafish FOSTER FATHER sit eating
    breakfast.

                        NARRATOR
              had been through several foster
              families.

    The FOSTER FATHER slaps Bloom upside the head. Stephen
    LAUNCHES across the table, tackling the dad and beating the
    crap out of him.

                        NARRATOR (cont'd)
              Thirty eight, all told.


4   INT. CHILD WELFARE OFFICE - DAY                               4

    CLOSE ON - A CHILD WELFARE FILE COVER

    "Bloom" stamped on it. It opens, and dozens of reports flip
    by. Under the "REASON FOR RETURN OF MINORS" field we catch
    different entries: "BEHAVIOR INAPPROPRIATE", "UNMANAGEABLE",
    "MOLESTED CAT", "SOLD OUR FURNITURE", "CAUSED FLOODING".



                                                               2

4   CONTINUED:                                                  4


                           NARRATOR
                 Mischief moved them on in life, and
                 moving kept them close.


5   EXT. COUNTRY HOUSE PORCH                                     5

    The brothers on the porch, suitcases in hand.

                           NARRATOR
                 For Bloom had Stephen, Stephen
                 Bloom, and both had more than most.

    The front door opens, and a pair of FOSTER PARENTS eye the
    brothers suspiciously.


6   EXT. SMALL TOWN SQUARE - LATER THAT DAY                      6

    A wide dusty Main Street, which the two brothers survey.

                           NARRATOR
                 Another home, another main street.
                 Stephen looked around,
                 then summed the burgh up thusly:

                           STEPHEN
                 Bloom, we've hit a one hat town.

                           NARRATOR
                 One theater. One car wash. One
                 cafe. One park. One cat. Which,
                 through some mishap, had one leg.

    The cat sits on a roller skate, rowing itself down the street
    with its one leg.

                           STEPHEN
                 Sweet Jesus. Look at that.


7   EXT. SCHOOL - DAY                                            7

    A group of children flee the school joyfully.

                           NARRATOR
                 One school, which meant one tight-
                 knit group of local well-off kids.

                                                                 3
  




8    EXT. CANDY SHOP                                                 8

     The children run out of the candy store, all slurping Rocket
     Pops.

                           NARRATOR
                 Their pocket-change bought rocket
                 pops,


9    INT. CANDY SHOP                                                 9

     The brothers at the counter. Bloom watches the children go,
     while Stephen counts out pennies.

                           NARRATOR
                 The brothers,

     Stephen slaps the change down angrily and points with a
     scowl.

                           STEPHEN
                 Pixie Stix.


10   EXT. PARK                                                   10

     The children play, resplendent with their Rocket Pops.

                           NARRATOR
                 They were the `they'. All well
                 loved, rooted, happy as you please.

     Bloom and Stephen sit off to the side of the park, none too
     happy nursing their Pixie Stix.

                           NARRATOR (cont'd)
                 Always there. In every town.

     Stephen glares, flicks the Stix away like a cigarette.

                           STEPHEN
                 The playground bourgeoisies.

     He storms off.    Bloom lingers, staring silently at the
     children.

                                                                  4
   




11   EXT. FOREST                                                  11

     The brothers amble down a wooded path.     Bloom stops, staring
     into the trees.

     Through the dense thicket of foliage... the children playing.
     And one gleaming eye framed perfectly through a small open
     patch in the leaves.

     Bloom pushes the leaves aside. A girl. Golden curls.
     Summer dress. Standing in the distance on a wide lawn.

     Bloom gazes.    Stephen places his hand on Bloom's back.


12   EXT. PARK - CONTINUOUS                                       12

     Bloom stumbles from the trees (very much as if he's been
     shoved) and regains his footing and freezes, not shielded at
     all now from the playing kids and the girl.

                         NARRATOR
               Could he simply

                         STEPHEN (O.S.)
               Talk to her!

                         NARRATOR
               Just drop his fears and go? Leave
               his brother in the woods, and join
               the children?

     The girl makes eye contact, twisting a daisy chain between
     her tiny fingers. Bloom's adam apple convulses.

     He turns tail and runs back into the woods.

                            NARRATOR (cont'd)
               No.


13   INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT                                         13

     Brothers in bed. Bloom gazes window-ward. Stephen gazes Bloom-
     wise, shuffling a pack of cards.

                         BLOOM
               What's doing?

                            STEPHEN
               What?



                                                                   5
    
13   CONTINUED:                                                    13


                            BLOOM
                  You shuffle when you're thinking
                  something through. So whatcha
                  thinking?

                            STEPHEN
                  Not a thing.

                            NARRATOR
                  This wasn't really true.
                  Cause in the root of Stephen's
                  psyche, something now began.
                  A seed of grand epiphany. A hook.
                  A tale.


14   EXT. WOODS - DAY                                                14

                            STEPHEN
                  A plan.

     Stephen spreads out a hand-drawn flowchart on a stump, and
     talks Bloom through it.

                            NARRATOR
                  A fiction made for profit, in which
                  both boys played a part.
                  A simple con in fifteen steps.

                            STEPHEN
                  And this is where we start.

     Stephen runs his finger backwards down the connected boxes,
     each neatly numbered, stopping at #1.... "Bloom Talks To
     Girl"


15   EXT. PARK - DAY                                                 15

     Children and the gold haired Girl playing.      The wall of
     foliage where the forest begins shimmers.

                            NARRATOR
                  And then, as if a curtain had been
                  pulled back from the sky...
                  Some barrier within the younger
                  Bloom was broken.

     Bloom bursts through the trees and strides across the wide
     lawn, confident, glowing, stopping face to golden face with
     the girl.


   

                                                                  6
   
15   CONTINUED:                                                   15


                            BLOOM
                  Hi.

     They talk.    They run.   They laugh.   They play.

                            NARRATOR
                  So Bloom performed his role in
                  Stephen's story to a T.

     BOX #2 on the flowchart - "Bloom wins the kids' trust"


16   EXT. TOWN SQUARE                                             16

     Bloom does indeed, sitting and laughing with a circle of
     kids, suddenly a natural born charmer.

                            NARRATOR
                  And being who he wasn't, could be
                  as he wished to be.

     The Golden Girl smiles at him.

     From the shadows of an adjacent alley, Stephen watches,
     pleased. He slinks away.

     SERIES OF SHOTS-


17   EXT. CAVE - DAY                                              17

     BOX #3 - "Stephen finds a cave" dissolves to Stephen scouting
     out a cave deep in the woods.


18   EXT. PARK - DAY                                              18

     In the park, Bloom runs with the kids, laughing.


19   INT. HARDWARE STORE - DAY                                    19

     BOX #5 - "Stephen buys supplies" dissolves to: Stephen in a
     hardware store, pointing. A flashlight, snow boots and
     several large coolers are purchased.


20   EXT. PARK - DAY                                              20

     Back in the park, Bloom says goodnight to the kids and walks
     homeward in the warm twilight.

                                                               7





21   INT. CHURCH - DAY                                            21

     BOX #8 - "Stephen scouts church" dissolves to: Stephen's
     eyes poke up from behind a pew in a church. He manages to
     look devious as he snags a SUNDAY SCHOOL SCHEDULE.


22   INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT                                         22

     Bloom enters, hears running water from the bathroom. He
     glimpses down at the flowchart on the bed, scanning down to:

     Box #10 - "Bloom comes home to find Stephen filling the
     coolers"

     Stephen backs out of the bathroom trolling a heavy cooler.

                         STEPHEN
               Oh - kay. How's it going on the
               playground front?

                         BLOOM
               It's great.

                         STEPHEN
               So, on to step eleven, then.   The
               Tale. You tell them -

                            BLOOM
               Wait...

     Bloom's lip quivers, obviously conflicted.

                         NARRATOR
               Must the numbers rattle on?    Must
               the fiction end?

                         BLOOM
               I think I need more time to win
               their-

                          STEPHEN
               Bloom. They're not your friends.
               They're part of this, and this aint
               real. Remember, it's a con.
               And when it's done, we've just got
               us. And we'll be moving on.
                   (beat)
               So, the tale. You tell them
               there's a

     Bloom holds court with the kids.

                            BLOOM
                  hermit in the woods. A one eyed,
                  steel toothed vagabond...


24   INT. ATTIC                                                24

     Back to Bloom and Stephen in the attic

                            BLOOM
                  ...with blood red eyes?

                             STEPHEN
                      (nods)
                  That's good. He stopped you coming
                  home from school...


25   EXT. PARK - DAY                                           25

                            BLOOM
                  ...and told me of a cave.

                            GIRL
                  What kind of cave?

                            BLOOM
                  A cave of wonders.

                              BOY
                  Pffft ha.

                            GIRL
                  Shut up, Dave.

                            BLOOM
                  At noon on every Sunday, there
                  appears a ball of light, which
                  flutters like a butterfly...

                            GIRL
                  A will-o-whisp?

                            BLOOM
                  That's right. It guides you

                                                               9

                  ...if you can keep up...


27   EXT. PARK                                                 27

                            BLOOM
                  ...to where the treasures lay.

                            BOY
                  So where's this cave?

                            GIRL
                  Yeah, where?


28   INT. ATTIC                                                28

                            STEPHEN
                  Ah-hah. The hermit didn't say.
                  He got this greedy glinting look,
                  the filthy red-eyed leech... and
                  said he'd tell for thirty bucks.

     Something in Bloom's face falls.


29   EXT. PARK                                                 29

     The girl's bright, trusting face looking at him. A moment of
     silence. Then, triumphant, an excited boy leaps to his feet.

                            EXCITED BOY
                  Well that's just two bucks each!

     The kids all rejoice, and fist-fulls of dollars are thrust at
     Bloom. He looks almost crestfallen as his eye catches the
     girl's joyful gaze.

                            NARRATOR
                  So Sunday came...


30   EXT. WOODS                                                30

     Children in their bright Sunday clothes run through the dark
     woods, led by Bloom.





                                                                10

                            NARRATOR
                  ...and straight from church, into
                  the woods Bloom led.


31   INT. CAVE                                                    31

     In the dim light of a cave, Stephen overturns the coolers of
     water and retreats into shadow. A flood soaks into the dirt
     floor, as outside the mouth of the cave the group of panting
     children come into sight.

                            NARRATOR
                  They stopped. Their hearts leapt.
                  There it was.


32   EXT. CAVE                                                    32

     The children look at the craggy mouth of a forboding cave.

                            GIRL
                  Just like the hermit said!

     Deep in the cave's dark maw, a spark of light.

     The children gasp collectively.    The Girl grabs Bloom's arm.

     Bloom stares, transfixed as any of them.

     The spark becomes a glowing, fluttering point of light, which
     hangs in the mouth of the cave for a tantalizing moment, then
     recedes deeper into the gloom.

     With a cry the children, Bloom included, dash into the cave.


33   INT. CAVE                                                    33

     The light glows just around the next corner... the children
     run after it, slipping in the mud, laughing, turning the
     corner...

     And the light glows just around the next corner. They
     scramble, they slip and slide, they can't catch the light,
     but they're all having the time of their lives.

     Bloom included.    Holding the girl's hand, laughing, eyes full
     of wonder.






                                                                11

                            NARRATOR
                  For just one moment, Bloom forgot
                  himself and ran too fast.

     He puts on a burst of speed, gets ahead of the crowd.

                            NARRATOR (cont'd)
                  He'd catch the light and find the
                  treasure...

     Turning a corner, he (alone) sees the rather tawdry image of
     Stephen, flashlight in hand, shooing him back as he turns the
     next corner.

     Bloom stops running.

                            NARRATOR (cont'd)
                  But the moment passed.

     The other kids and the girl pass him, but Bloom stands dead
     still, a strange expression on his face.

     The girl turns back towards him, still running, and holds out
     her hand for him to follow.

     But he doesn't.    He stays behind, and is soon left alone.


34   EXT. PLAYGROUND                                               34

                            NARRATOR
                  They didn't catch the will-o-wisp,
                  but didn't really care.

     The muddied children walk home, laughing, while Bloom leans
     against a lamppost. Stephen appears behind him, counting
     their money.

                            STEPHEN
                  It seems to me that in the end, the
                  perfect con is where
                  each one involved gets just the
                  thing they wanted.

                            BLOOM
                  Yeah I guess so.

                             NARRATOR
                  Our fledgling thieves were
                  satisfied.

                                                                12
  




35   EXT. FOSTER HOUSE - DAY                                      35

     A front door opens, revealing a porch-full of 30 angry
     parents holding 15 muddied kids by their ears.

                          NARRATOR
                The children's parents, less so.

     The Foster Parents exchange a glance.

     QUICK SHOTS -

     Stephen is smacked.

     The wad of money is snatched from a grubby small hand by an
     angry big one.

     A telephone slams down.

     On a form, the field "Reason for return:" is filled with
     "Larceny."


36   INT. BEDROOM - DAY                                           36

     Two suitcases on a bed are snapped closed and pulled away.
     The bed sits solid and vacant in the dusty afternoon
     sunlight.

                          NARRATOR
                A bitter ending? Maybe. But
                there's sweetness in the mix.

     Beneath the bed, forgotten, a piece of paper.    On it, the con
     flow-chart. Numbered boxes.

                          NARRATOR (cont'd)
                The brothers Bloom had found their
                calling.

     One of the boxes... number six...

                          NARRATOR (cont'd)
                As shown in number six.

     BOX #6:   "Cut % O'Henry's"

                          NARRATOR (cont'd)
                `Cut' meant to negotiate, `percent'
                percentage deal.

                                                              13





37   EXT. SMALL TOWN SQUARE - DAY                                 37

     Through a storefront window - rows of the children's muddy
     Sunday clothes hang, each tagged.

                         NARRATOR
               `O'Henry's' was the town's one dry
               clean shop.

     And striding out of the store beneath the `O'Henry's
     Cleaners' sign is Stephen, fifty dollars in hand, sucking a
     Rocket Pop. The OWNER leans out of the door, looking a
     little nervous. Stephen throws him back a salute.


38   EXT. BACK ALLEY - DAY                                        38

     Bloom sits against a wall, suitcases beside him. Boxes of
     Rocket Pops, and one in each fist. Stephen plops down beside
     him.

                         STEPHEN
               So how's it feel?

     Bloom's eye catches the children, and the girl, playing in
     the distance.

                         NARRATOR
               In truth, young Bloom won't know
               for twenty years just how he felt.

     HONK! A `Child Welfare' car waiting out on the street.    The
     brothers pick themselves up.

                         NARRATOR (cont'd)
               And so, we'll skip ahead now in our
               story.

     Stephen tosses his Rocket Pop.

                         STEPHEN
               Let `em melt.

     The con man team of the brothers Bloom, suitcases in hand,
     strides down the alleyway.

     Stephen in front.






                                                               14

     Bloom a few steps behind, stealing one last glance back at
     the children playing in the sun.

40   INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT                                         40

     Flames spread over a wall of bookshelves.

     TITLE CARD:    BERLIN, 25 YEARS LATER

     A YOUNG MAN in a nice suit and bowler hat steps in front of
     the flaming books.

                            YOUNG MAN
                  He gets the scarab, you get the
                  money, I get the girl... so in the
                  end, everyone gets everything he
                  wants.

     Three gunshots, two bloody holes in the nice suit and the
     young man folds to the ground.

     A sweaty man named CHARLESTON (40s) lowers his gun, while
     behind him the rest of the library roars in flames.

                            VOICE (O.S.)
                  Wha - Charleston, what - oh my god
                  are you... oh god he's dead,
                  Victor's dead... you've killed us!
                  We had it he was right it was all
                  in the bag and now we're dead, why?
                  Why, you stupid son of a bitch?

     The owner of the voice, a MAN a bit younger than Charleston
     in a derby cap, snatches the gun away and slaps Charleston
     hard.






                                                               15

                             CHARLESTON
                  Cause the Turk was right. After
                  seeing her, after that night on the
                  airstrip, after Cairo everything
                  changed, and he couldn't see the
                  play through that one milky eye,
                  but the Turk was right about one
                  thing, that there's nothing
                  beautiful about money. She's
                  beautiful.

                            MCGUIRE
                  This isn't happening...

                            CHARLESTON
                  He'll never have her now. She's
                  free. And I'll never see her in
                  scarlet again, her chestnut hair,
                  but it's worth the money and my job
                  and his life and the rest of my
                  life that she's free.

                            MCGUIRE
                  Charleston. I can't be here...

                            CHARLESTON
                  You're not here. Neither of us
                  are. It's Mowcher's gun.

                            MCGUIRE
                  Mowcher is at the bottom of the
                  Spree with a cowl in his neck!

     Charleston gets to his feet.

                            CHARLESTON
                  They won't find him for a week, and
                  the Albino will chalk it up to
                  Davey, he won't talk. We're clean.

                            MCGUIRE
                  Listen to you - four months ago you
                  were an investment banker! Now
                  you're nothing. The Scarab's lost.
                  The money's gone. It'll rot in the
                  Peruvian earth. It's gone.

     Charleston limps to the flaming doorway.






                                                              16

                         CHARLESTON
               The man named Charleston you met
               nine months and a thousand years
               ago at the hotel bar in Jodhpur is
               dead. If we see each other again
               it'll be as strangers. As for the
               money... let it rot.

     He exits, leaving McGuire stooped beside the crumpled form of
     Victor. A long beat. The distant roar of an engine, tires
     squealing.

     Then through the smoky doorway steps a beautiful ASIAN WOMAN,
     early 20s. She gives a nearly imperceptible nod.

                         MCGUIRE
               Wow.

     He pats Victor, who sits up, spitting blood. McGuire looks
     to Victor and the woman for a reaction. Gets none.

                         MCGUIRE (cont'd)
               Wow is the word you're both looking
               for. Wow.

     The Asian woman nods slightly.

                         VICTOR
                   (un-wowishly)
               You're a genius, Stephen.

     For McGuire is, of course, Stephen.

                         STEPHEN
               We're a genius, Bloom.

     Just as Victor is, indeed, Bloom.   He spits.

                         BLOOM
               Tastes like tin foil.

                         STEPHEN
               So does real blood. Buy you a
               drink.

     Stephen escorts the Asian woman out, while Bloom wipes his
     lip.

                                                              17





41   EXT. HOUSE - PRE-DAWN                                       41

     A stately house in the middle of nowhere, on fire. Stephen
     holds the door of a car open, while Bloom steps from the
     flaming house.

                         STEPHEN
               "Four months and a thousand years
               ago." That's Kipling, isn't it?
               He stole that from Kipling.

                           BLOOM
               No.


42   EXT. BERLIN - PRE-DAWN                                      42

     Hazy light over the sprawling city.


43   INT. DEUTCH MARK                                            43

     A low, cozy basement level bar. A dozen people crowd it, all
     expectant in a surprise-party type way.

     A TURKISH GENTLEMAN in a white linen suit and eye patch
     raises his drink when Bloom, Stephen and the woman enter.

                         THE TURK
               Make way, make room for the
               brothers Bloom!

     The bar bursts into cheers.


44   INT. DEUTCH MARK - LATER                                    44

     A DWARF dances on the bar. Stephen plays cards with the
     Turk, an ALBINO and a small crowd of character types.

                         THE TURK
               Nine months, six countries, three
               faked deaths, for one mark. You're
               a beautiful antique, my friend.

     They clink glasses.

                           ALL
               Proust.





                                                                    18

                            THE TURK
                  One thing baffles me. The entire
                  con would have fallen apart if
                  Charleston had walked away. How did
                  you know he'd pull the trigger?

     Stephen riffle shuffles a pack of cards.

                            STEPHEN
                  Just think of any card.    Got one?

     Stephen cuts the deck randomly - 2 of spades.

                               THE TURK
                  No.

     Stephen shrugs.

                            STEPHEN
                  But if I do it enough, eventually
                  it'll work on someone. And then
                  it'll be the best card trick in the
                  world.

     Wink. The dwarf slips, plummets from the bar. Stephen kicks
     a chair across the room, into which he lands with a crunch.

                               STEPHEN (cont'd)
                  Ante up.

                            THE TURK
                  It's true you never work with the
                  same crew twice?

                            STEPHEN
                  That's true.

                               THE TURK
                  Well shit.     Except for the uh, for
                  her?

                            STEPHEN
                  La Chinoise?

                               THE TURK
                  Yeah.

     Back at the bar - the Asian woman.       The CHINK.   Being hit on
     by a weasly ROMANIAN.

                            ROMANIAN
                  Yeah, I'm pretty big into anime.

  

                                                               19

     She almost imperceptibly rolls her eyes.

                         STEPHEN
               Our fifth Beatle. She knows the
               ins and the outs, and so far as I
               can tell, speaks three words of
               English.

     She taps on the bar.

                            THE CHINK
               Jameson.

                            BARTENDER
               Ice?

     She says `no' with a look.

                         THE ALBINO
               So she's with you and Bloom till
               the end.

                         STEPHEN
               Just till the wind changes.

     Stephen makes a gun with his finger and shoots at the Chink.

     She flicks a champaign flute to make a `DING!' and mimes the
     bullet bouncing off her.

                         THE TURK
               Where is Bloom?

     In the corner of the bar, in a private booth with drawn
     velvet curtains, Bloom sits alone playing solitaire. Stuck
     with a queen of hearts he can't play.

     A beautiful woman in scarlet with auburn hair pokes her face
     through the curtains.

                         ROSE
               There you are. Hiding?

                            BLOOM
               Yeah.

                         ROSE
               I've been learning.      Stephen likes
               to talk about you.

                         BLOOM
               Did he tell you the cave story?



                                                              20

44   CONTINUED: (3)                                            44


                         ROSE
               Is it true?

                         BLOOM
               What else did he tell you?

                         ROSE
               I'm not going to tell it as good as
               Stephen. You two kicked around
               till your early teens, then stowed
               away on a merchant marine freighter
               and ended up in St. Petersburg,
               where you spent five years under
               the tutelage of a shadowy old
               swindler named the Diamond Dog.
               And he was your Fagin and Stephen
               was his Artful Dodger, but it ended
               suddenly and badly.

                         BLOOM
               Stephen took his eye out with an
               antique rapier.

                         ROSE
               Why did he do that?

                         BLOOM
               And then the Brothers Bloom lit out
               on their own to make their fortune
               as gentleman thieves. Sounds
               romantic.

                          ROSE
               It does.

     She pushes the cards aside and slides clumsily onto the
     table, her face inches from Bloom's, eyes closed, expecting a
     kiss.

     Bloom's eyes stay open.

                         BLOOM
               You want to know how Stephen did
               it? With Charleston?

                         ROSE
               It's not the first thing on my
               mind.

                                                              21





45   INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)                          45

     A replay of Bloom in front of the flaming bookshelf.

                         BLOOM (O.S.)
               He positioned me in the same spot
               where, seven years ago,
               Charleston's wife stood and told
               him she was leaving.

     The room transforms, becomes daylit, not on fire, seven years
     ago, a WIFE standing in Bloom's place.

                         BLOOM (O.S.) (cont'd)
               He chose my outfit to mirror her
               suit.

     Sure enough, the colors and shape of Bloom's suit matches the
     Wife's outfit.

                         BLOOM (O.S.) (cont'd)
               He even phonetically matched my
               final words to hers.

                         WIFE
               This is the end. Charelston, you've
               always been a dunce.

     Everything snaps back to Bloom in the flaming room.

                         BLOOM (IN FLASHBACK)
               So in the end, everyone gets
               everything he wants.

     BANG.


46   INT. DEUTCH MARK                                          46

                         BLOOM
               That's what he does, he writes his
               cons the way dead Russians write
               novels, with thematic arcs and
               imbedded symbolism and shit. And
               he wrote me as a vulnerable anti-
               hero. And that's why you think you
               want to kiss me. It's a con.

     He leaves Rose lying on the table and sweeps through the bar
     towards the exit, passing Stephen.




                                                                   22

                  I need air.

                            STEPHEN
                  Who doesn't?
                      (plays a card)
                  That's the big 2.


47   EXT. BERLIN STREET - EARLY MORNING                               47

     Bloom stumbles up stone steps to street level.      A THOUSAND
     YEAR OLD MAN sweeps up across the square.

     Bloom sits wearily on the curb, bowler hat in hand, shirt
     bright red with fake blood, face long as hell.

     Putting the broom aside a moment, the old man walks painfully
     across the street to Bloom. Standing nearly toe to toe with
     him, the man pulls a huge joyful smile across his grizzled
     face.

     He then smears his hand over his mug, pulling the smile off
     his face and rubbing it on Bloom's mouth. When he takes his
     hand away, Bloom plays along and has the same big joyful
     smile. The old man winks at him and walks back to his broom.

     As soon as the old man is away, Bloom drops the smile.

     Stephen paces out into the street.

                            STEPHEN
                  We missed the sunrise.    That
                  would've been nice.

     They walk across the street to the Tiergarten.


48   EXT. TIERGARTEN - EARLY MORNING                                  48

     Berlin's Central Park and zoo, dead and brown. The brothers
     stroll through the woods, Stephen a few steps ahead, Bloom
     trailing behind, lost in thought.

     Camel heads poke over a wall with `Kamelhaus' painted on it.
     Stephen throws open the wall's gate.

                            STEPHEN
                      (to camels)
                  Back to the swamps!

     The camels are unimpressed.       Bloom slouches into a bench.

 

                                                               23

     Stephen shows the deck of cards to Bloom, who nods. Stephen
     cuts the deck, shows him a card. Bloom shakes his head, no.

                            STEPHEN (cont'd)
                  At least you're honest.

     Bloom stares into space.

                            STEPHEN (cont'd)
                  Alright, let's do this. Let's just
                  get it done. So first you say `I'm
                  quitting, Stephen. I'm out.' Then
                  I say...

                            BLOOM
                  `Do we have to go through this
                  again.'

                            STEPHEN
                  Then you make a show of putting on
                  your jacket and say `no I mean it
                  this time Stephen, this time I'm
                  really out.'

                            BLOOM
                  Then you say `let's have a drink,
                  and in the morning Bloom you'll
                  have come to your senses'

     Stephen pulls a flask, unscrews it.

                            STEPHEN
                      (re: Bloom's bright red
                       blood stain)
                  That's a major design flaw in fake
                  blood, by the way.

                            BLOOM
                  `and we'll be moving on.'

                            STEPHEN
                  Real blood turns brown after a half
                  hour.

                            BLOOM
                  Listen to me, Stephen.

                            STEPHEN
                  This scotch costs more than your
                  suit.

               Listen to me.

                         STEPHEN
               And the flask stopped a bullet from
               a black powder rifle at Appomattox.

                         BLOOM
               Listen.

     Bloom bats the flask away. A camel catches it, tips its
     camel neck back and gulps it down.

                         STEPHEN
               That's my new favorite camel.

                         BLOOM
               I hate you. I hate this life, I
               hate it, I hate that you won't
               fucking listen to me for one
               goddamn second. Just listen.

     Stephen listens.

                         BLOOM (cont'd)
               I can't wake up next to another
               stranger, who thinks they know me,
               or even wants to know me, cause I
               don't know - who - I'm thirty five
               years old, and I, I'm useless, I'm
               crippled, I don't, I've only ever
               lived life through these roles that
               aren't me, that are written for me
               by you.

                         STEPHEN
               Tell me what you want.

                         BLOOM
               Why? So you can write me a role in
               a story where I get it? You're not
               listening to me. I want a real...
               thing, I wanna do things how I
               don't know are gonna work out, a,
               I, want, a...

                         STEPHEN
                   (sotto)
               You want an unwritten life.

                  I want an unwritten life!
                      (realizes Stephen just
                       wrote that line for him)
                  Aauuugghh god!

     The camel belches.    Bloom makes a show of putting on his
     jacket.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  I'm going away. Somewhere you or
                  even the Chink won't be able to
                  track me down, so don't try. No
                  more stories.

     Bloom tosses Stephen the bowler, and storms off.    He gets
     about ten feet, then hesitates.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  I love you. Bye.

     Then goes.

     The camel nudges Stephen's jacket, looking for more scotch.
     Stephen puts the bowler on its camel head.

                               STEPHEN
                  Sorry bud.     I'm dry.

     Stephen watches his brother walk off into the rising morning
     mist, lost in thought.

     His hands mechanically begin shuffling the pack of cards.

     FADE OUT

     FADE IN:


49   EXT. ITALIAN COUNTRYSIDE - DAY                                49

     Beautiful green hills surround the walled medieval city of
     Ferentino.

     TITLE CARD:    Ferentino, Italy - 3 months later.

     A tiny red car inches its way across the countryside. It
     winds its way up and deeper into the city on the hill.

                                                                26
  




50   EXT. FERENTINO APARTMENT - DAY                                50

     The tiny stone porch outside a private apartment.   The red
     car's bumper pulls up, parks.

     On a small wood table, empty booze bottles and a loose pack
     of cards. Fingertips spread the cards, then the fingertips'
     owner heads for the apartment door.


51   INT. FERENTINO APARTMENT - DAY                                51

     Stephen steps in cautiously, surveys the apartment.

     A goddamn mess. Empty bottles and glasses, very little
     light. Stephen opens the curtains, light streams in the
     window. A groan of displeasure comes from the gloom.

     Bloom stirs, passed out in a hammock. Unkept beard, a few
     extra pounds. Crushed cigar hanging on his lip.

     A rotund GRANDMOTHER waddles in, cleaning up bottles and
     berating Bloom in a constant stream of angry Italian.

                         STEPHEN
               She's right, you know.

                         BLOOM
               Why are you here, Stephen?

                         STEPHEN
               Put on your face, let's eat.


52   EXT. FERENTINO APARTMENT - LATER                              52

     Stephen guides a dressed Bloom out the door. The grandmother
     follows them, still barking angry Italian at Bloom. At the
     last moment she says a few kind words, kisses him on the
     cheek and sends them off.


53   EXT. FERENTINO CAFE - DAY                                     53

     A few tables on a stone walkway overlooking the countryside.
     The red car parked nearby. Stephen eats, Bloom stares.

                         BLOOM
               How'd you find me?





                                                                    27

                  The Chink.

                            BLOOM
                  How'd the Chink find me?

     Stephen's eyes:       "Are you joking?"

                            STEPHEN
                  How've you been?

                               BLOOM
                  Great.

                            STEPHEN
                  I've done a lot of thinking the
                  past three months. You don't want
                  out. You think you do but you
                  don't. Here, c'mere. I want to
                  show you something.

                            BLOOM
                  I'm quits, Stephen.

     Stephen stands, strolls off.        Bloom wearily follows.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  Where are we going?

                            STEPHEN
                  New Jersey.

                            BLOOM
                      (sighs)
                  Well lemme get my jacket.

                                                             CUT TO:

55   EXT. LUDICROUS MANSION - AFTERNOON                                55

     A long private road through a tunnel of trees leads to a
     ludicrous mansion. Our trio watch it from the road.

                            BLOOM
                  Looks like an etching from a Bronte
                  novel.

  

                                                               28

     Stephen flips open a first edition Jane Eyre. The
     illustration inside is in fact an exact match, right down to
     a plaster deer in the front yard.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  Huh. Look at that. Well thanks.
                  I'm gonna head back to Italy.

                            STEPHEN
                  Big money. Inheritance. Dad died
                  early, Mom died two years ago after
                  ten years fighting an illness that
                  I can't pronounce.

                              BLOOM
                  How much?

     The Chink writes a number in the snow with a stick. Just
     when we think she's done, she adds several more zeros.

                              BLOOM (cont'd)
                  Jesus.

                              STEPHEN
                  Look out.

     Stephen pulls Bloom into the trees as a cherry red
     Lamborghini roars down the private road, does an unruly donut
     and crunches painfully into a tree, kicking up a cloud of
     dust and smoke.

     Thumping bass from the audio system turns off, and from the
     dust cloud emerges PENELOPE, early 30s, beautiful but in a
     non-Lamborghini way.

     Bloom watches her through the trees, none too happy.


56   EXT. THICKET - LATER                                        56

     Off to the side of the house. They lean on the hood of their
     rental car, an old school Cadillac.

     In the background, a tow truck arrives with a brand new
     Lamborghini, and leaves towing the old one.

                            BLOOM
                  What am I doing here, Stephen? I
                  have one rule, and you've never
                  even tested it.



 

                                                                   29

                            STEPHEN
                  Stick with me.

                            BLOOM
                  No women. One rule. You know we
                  don't do women, I don't, and it's
                  not a morality thing or- a thing-
                  it's, whatever it is it doesn't
                  matter what it is, that's just our
                  rule. So what are we,
                      (RE: the rental car)
                  Did you rent a `78 Caddy?

     Stephen nods to the Chink.       Bloom nods appreciatively.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  Controversial choice. So no, is
                  what I'm saying. I'm quits anyway.
                  I'll be in Italy. Drinking.

     The front door of the mansion slams, and they watch Penelope
     drag a harp around into the back yard.

                            STEPHEN
                  Penelope Stamp. Thirty three.
                  Lived at home her whole life.

     Bloom's eyes never leave Penelope.

                            BLOOM
                  An eccentric shut-in rich bitch.
                  You're not helping your case.

     The Chink silently hands Bloom a retractable spyglass, he
     watches Penelope drift atop a hill and sit on a stump.

                            STEPHEN
                  She's bored, a seed in the snow.
                  We're going to put her through a
                  grand adventure, bring her to life.

                            BLOOM
                  So this is the big plan. Lure me
                  back into things with some
                  beautiful intriguing elusive girl,
                  stir up old memories with the
                  prospect of redemption and rebirth.
                  Seriously Stephen. Amateur night.

     Bloom watches her play Clash songs on the harp.



   

                                                              30

                         BLOOM (cont'd)
               I'm not saying yes. But what's the
               con?

     Stephen spreads a folded piece of paper on a tree stump, with
     a flowchart on it. Numbered boxes.

     Bloom doesn't take his spyglass off Penelope.

                         STEPHEN
               It's actually pretty simple. We're
               brothers, antique dealers, perusing
               the Americas for antiquities en
               route to someplace exciting via
               luxury steamer, say Greece. You
               tie into her and work your magic...

     Penelope plays on.


57   INT. HOTEL BAR - NIGHT                                    57

     Very late. Bloom and Stephen in armchairs, collars loosened,
     drinks drunk. The Chink's Chuck Taylors stick up over the
     back of a chair.

     Bloom holds the con flowchart.

                         STEPHEN
               ...and so that's how it ends, in
               Mexico, a burst of violence then a
               moment of truth on the beach. What
               do you think?

     Bloom idly looks over the chart.

                         BLOOM
               You've got something up your
               sleeve. This is about me, right?
               Somehow.

                         STEPHEN
               This might not be something you
               know, but they've all been about
               you. Maybe that's why they've none
               of them been perfect, I've never
               been able to give you what you
               really want.

                  I want to be outta all this. So by
                  definition, this is not going to
                  give me what I want.

     Stephen answers by letting an ace fall from his sleeve.

                             BLOOM (cont'd)
                  This will be the last one.    You'll
                  let me go.

     The Chink's inert sneakers come to life and she's on her
     feet, silently going to Stephen's side.

                            STEPHEN
                  I will never approach you to do
                  another con again.
                      (to the Chink)
                  Let's make it a red Schwinn.

     Bloom stares at #1 on the flowchart - "BLOOM MEETS PENELOPE."


58   EXT. HILLTOP - MORNING                                      58

     A grumpy Bloom perched on the red Schwinn, an ill fitting
     Styrofoam helmet on his head.

     Stephen sits in a lawn chair watching the highway below.

     The Chink sets up a lawn umbrella, a chair for herself, and a
     cooler with Coronas.

                            BLOOM
                  There are less painful ways to cut
                  into a mark.

                            STEPHEN
                  Wahk wahk wahk wahk wahk wahk wahk.
                  Score to beat is 7.9. Keep your
                  head in the game, the Chinese judge
                  is tough.

                            BLOOM
                  This is a banana seat, man!

     He directs this to the Chink, who blinks with innocent
     incomprehension and opens two Coronas.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  Don't give me that blank look, you
                  know what a fuckin banana seat is.

 

                                                                   32

     Stephen spots something and blows a whistle.       With a grunt,
     Bloom launches the Schwinn forward.

     Gaining speed, bumping over weeds and gopher holes, down the
     steep steep hill.

     At the bottom of the hill, a two lane highway.      Cruising down
     the highway, a cherry red Lamborghini.

     Whose front right fender Bloom expertly smashes into.

                                                            CUT TO:


59   EXT. HIGHWAY / SKY - DAY                                         59

     Silent and blue. Time slows to a crawl as Bloom sails
     through the air, arcing over the Italian luxury car's hood
     and past a horrified Penelope, face frozen mid scream behind
     the wheel.

                            BLOOM (V.O.)
                  There's actually a knack to this.
                  You want to avoid dying or breaking
                  anything that won't grow back, but
                  you don't want to roll out of it
                  and come up roses. If you're
                  trying to fast track into a mark's
                  sympathies, there's nothing quite
                  as efficient as having your first
                  conversation be from a hospital bed
                  they put you in. I usually like to
                  try for a dislocated shoulder.

     Several things happen at once.

     Bloom hits the pavement shoulder-first, hard.      The bent bike
     follows suit.

     Up on the hill, Stephen and the Chink raise score cards.         8.9
     and 5.6.

     The Lamborghini screeches to a stop.

     Everything is still.

     Then the car jolts forward. Then stops. Then again, jolts
     and stops. Rolls forward a few feet, lazily drifting, then
     jolts and stops.

     Bloom painfully stands, as confused by the car's behavior as
     us.

 

                                                                33

     Stephen and the Chink lower their cards, equally confused.

     One last long beat of silence, then the car jolts forward,
     veers drunkenly to the left, tips into a ditch and chunks to
     a stop. The horn blares.

     Bloom looks up to the hilltop for guidance.

     Stephen stares blankly.    The Chink raises a new score card -
     7.8.


60   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT                                   60

     Penelope sleeps, bruised and battered. Bloom sits bedside
     uncomfortably, arm in a wimpy sling. She stirs. Bloom leans
     forward.

     Slurred with sleep and drugs, she painfully barely breathes

                            PENELOPE
                  Are you alright?


61   INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT                                61

     Bloom consults with Stephen and the Chink, both in scrubs.

                            STEPHEN
                  The Chink had it - I'm telling him,
                  I know, thank you - in her report,
                  I missed it. This is actually kind
                  of great, I'll tell you why.

     The Chink lights a cigarette.

                            BLOOM
                  You missed it?

                            STEPHEN
                  Dostoevsky was an epileptic.

                            BLOOM
                  I know.

                            STEPHEN
                  His seizures were preceded by an
                  enlightened euphoria, a sort of
                  opening of his spiritual eye.

                  I think the fact that she saw your
                  face the instant before a seizure
                  is a pretty goddamn good foot to
                  start things out on, right?

     Bloom stares blankly.        The Chink burps into her stethoscope.


62   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT                                      62

     Bloom slumps in a chair, watching Penelope sleep.

                            BLOOM (V.O.)
                  The next step is to figure out a
                  way to insinuate yourself into
                  their personal life.

     Bloom drifts off, then wakes with a start.

     It is MORNING.     Penelope is shaking him.

                            PENELOPE
                  I think they took my car.     Could
                  you drive me home?

                                BLOOM
                  Uh.   Yeah.

     She walks away, the back of her gown wide open, then turns.

                            PENELOPE
                  I'm Penelope Stamp.

                                BLOOM
                  Bloom.


63   INT. CADILLAC - MORNING                                         63

     Bloom drives, Penelope gazes stiffly out the window.

                            BLOOM (V.O.)
                  Engagement. Find a connection with
                  your mark through conversation.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  I'm sorry about your Lamborghini.

                                PENELOPE
                  S' ok.

     Silence. He notices her playing with the side mirror knob,
     angling it to stare at him while looking out the window.

  

                                                                      35

     More silence.

                            PENELOPE
                  This car is like riding in a huge
                  marshmallow.

     And still more silence.

                            BLOOM (V.O.)
                  Having now deftly set your hook in
                  the mark's psyche, this would be
                  the perfect time to tug the line,


64   EXT. LUDICROUS MANSION - MORNING                                  64

     They pull up in the car.          A tow truck is dropping off a new
     Lamborghini.

                            BLOOM (V.O.)
                  Get invited in for coffee, and tell
                  them the full tale.

     Bloom looks about to launch into something, when Penelope
     drops a stack of cash bound in a green rubber band on his
     dashboard.

                            PENELOPE
                  For the bike, and the whole, thing.
                  This was a big shit sandwich. Ok.
                  Bye.

     The car door slams and she's gone.         Bloom sits a moment.

                            BLOOM (V.O.)
                  However, there are advantages to
                  playing it cool. Letting it lie
                  for a day or two, then casually re-
                  establish contact.

     Bloom starts driving off, and adjusts the passenger side
     mirror so it points back to the road. As he does he sees
     Penelope in it, sprinting after his car.

     He stops.    A moment later she appears at his window, heaving.

65   INT. PENELOPE'S KITCHEN - DAY                                65

     Bloom and Penelope sit in a luxurious stone-based kitchen,
     neither touching their coffee. Bloom talks.

     This is how Penelope listens: she starts with her eyes on
     Bloom, then very quickly drifts away into her own thoughts,
     then recognizes she's doing it and makes eye contact again
     and gives an overbaked "oh yes go on" smile/nod, then does it
     all again. Three or four times.

                            BLOOM
                  ...didn't really have anyone except
                  each other growing up, and our
                  father was in the antique business,
                  he had a shop in Charleston. So we
                  stuck together, my brother Stephen
                  and me, we and just took over the
                  shop when dad died. Then we
                  realized one day, we saw the
                  dealers who were finding and
                  selling us the antiques coming from
                  exotic countries all over the
                  world, and there was a, almost a
                  scent they had, when they'd come in
                  the dusty shop we worked nine to
                  five in since we were nineteen, the
                  air would, like before a rain, the
                  ions would line up, and you could
                  just smell midnight trains to Paris
                  and steamer ships and Calcutta
                  bazaars, and we made the decision,
                  we just did it, that we want to
                  have that sort of life. So we did,
                  and we've been travelling and
                  treasure hunting the world ever
                  since, and could you, I'm sorry,
                  stop doing - that, you're, I'm, ok.
                  Alright, look.

                            PENELOPE
                  I'm really bad at talking to
                  people.

     Victorian, expensive. Penelope leans against the window,
     looking out. Sulking. Bloom enters.

                            BLOOM
                  So what kind of stuff do you do?

                  Alright. I'm just gonna finish my
                  coffee first.

     Very slowly, he sips it.     Each sip becomes a noisier and
     noisier slurp.

                            PENELOPE
                  I collect hobbies. I see someone

     Juggling various items.       Riding a unicycle.   Juggling while
     riding a unicycle.

     Playing ping-pong against a wall with ungodly speed.

     Karate chopping through too much wood.

     Breakdancing.

     Playing the accordion.

     Rapping to a drum machine.

     Creating a perfect origami dragon.

                            BLOOM
                  No. So you just thought, `so I
                  want to learn this and this,' and
                  you just did it? How do you plan
                  to use all these skills?

                  I dunno. I'm not a planner. I
                  just do stuff. Here, look at this
                  watermelon. It's a camera. You
                  can make a pinhole camera out of
                  anything hollowish and dark.

               No, yeah it does. That's what -
               the Taj Majal taken by a fat
               tourist with diarrhea and a point-
               and-shoot camera can be the

               stick our thumbs up our asses"
               picture. But you can look at the
               most menial everyday thing, and
               depending on how your pinhole
               camera eats the light, it's warped
               and peculiar and imperfect. It's
               not reproduction, it's

               It's a lie that tells the truth.

                         PENELOPE
               I dunno about truth. A photograph
               is a secret about a secret. The
               more it tells you, the less you
               know.

               What's changed between now and
               twenty minutes ago? Cause this is
               kinda like a conversation.

67   EXT. BACKYARD - DAY                                       67

     Bloom and Penelope walk and talk, finally rounding the house
     and ending up at the driveway.

                         BLOOM
               Well, I should, uh, it's late. So.
               I meet a lot of people in my job I

                  Well next time I'm in town. We're
                  taking a steamer at noon tomorrow
                  off the docks, to the continent for
                  a few months.

     During this, Bloom very naturally moves his hand to the small
     of Penelope's back. The edge of his thumb comes to rest on a
     small slit of exposed skin.

     Penelope's expression does not change, but a noticeable blush
     crosses her still face.

     When Bloom removes his hand, the blush falls.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  Paris and Greece, I think. I've
                  gotta get a hat. Thanks for the
                  pinhole camera demonstration. And
                  for the good conversation. Goodbye
                  Penelope.

                            PENELOPE
                  Goodbye Bloom.

     He drives off.    She stands in the doorway, watching him go.


68   EXT. THE DOCKS - DAY                                        68

     A jaunty steamer ship docked and ready. Bloom watches the
     access road, Stephen makes notes, the Chink whittles.

                            BLOOM
                  I need another day with her.

                            STEPHEN
                  You'll have two weeks on the boat.

                            BLOOM
                  I need another day to get her on
                  the boat, she isn't hooked. That
                  bit I skipped where we were talking
                  in the backyard, it was ten minutes
                  on the optics of lensless
                  photography, we didn't really talk.






                                                                    41

                            STEPHEN
                  It isn't the talking that hooked
                  her.

     Bloom turns from the road.

                            BLOOM
                  I think you're wrong.

     A screech of distant tires and a crash.        Bloom doesn't look.

                            BLOOM (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                  Though every time I say that, you
                  end up being comically right.
                  That's her, isn't it? Yeah.

     Penelope pulls a clumsy steamer trunk that never could have
     fit in her Lamborghini, which is bent around a pylon.

     Bloom meets her.

                              PENELOPE
                  Hey.

                              BLOOM
                  Hi.    What are you doing here?

     She holds out the stack of bills in the green rubber band.

                            PENELOPE
                  You left this money in my kitchen.

     He doesn't take it.

                            BLOOM
                  Yeah, I didn't want it, but thanks.

                              PENELOPE
                  Oh.
                      (beat)
                  Hey, where's this boat going?


69   EXT. THE ATLANTIC OCEAN - DAY                                   69

     The good ship Fidele breaks the waves Greece-ward.

     Bloom and Penelope stroll the deck.


  

                                                                 42

                            BLOOM
                  Why did you decide to come?

                            PENELOPE
                  Well I'd never been to Greece. Or
                  Europe. Or outside New Jersey.

                            BLOOM
                  It just seems like a big leap.
                  From where you were at yesterday to
                  being a world traveler.

                            PENELOPE
                  It looked like fun.   I wanted to do
                  it.

                            BLOOM
                  A new hobby.

     Up ahead, Bloom spots a large man in a fur collared cape
     gazing out to sea. He quickly turns Penelope away.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  Here, this way.


71   EXT. SHUFFLEBOARD DECK - DAY                                 71

     The Chink and Stephen play shuffleboard.     Bloom leads
     Penelope to them.

                            BLOOM
                  Penelope, this is my brother
                  Stephen.

                            STEPHEN
                  Pleased to make your acquaintance.
                  Bloom's told me about you, you're
                  the epileptic photographer?

                             PENELOPE
                  Sort of.

                            STEPHEN
                  This is my personal secretary and
                  masseuse, Mrs. Yuengling.

     A nearly imperceptible glare from the Chink.

                            PENELOPE
                  Yuengling like the beer?




                                                              43

71   CONTINUED:                                                71


                             STEPHEN
                  Heh. No. So what are your plans
                  in Greece?

                            PENELOPE
                  I don't plan.

                            STEPHEN
                  Good for you.

     The Chink hits a damn near impossible shuffleboard shot, then
     gives Stephen a pointed deferential giggle-bow.


72   INT. STATE ROOM - NIGHT                                    72

     The brothers dress for dinner.

                            BLOOM
                  You named the Chink `Yuengling?'

                            STEPHEN
                  I was writing in a bar. And she
                  doesn't drink, how does she know a
                  Philly beer?

                             BLOOM
                  She knows a lot of stuff.
                      (beat)
                  Was that who I thought it was on
                  the East deck this morning?

                            STEPHEN
                  Yes it was. Did he spot you?

     An ominous glance.

                             BLOOM
                  Not yet.


73   EXT. DECK - NIGHT                                          73

     Several small tables scattered about the moonlit deck, Bloom
     and Penelope sit with flutes of champagne. Penelope, in an
     elegant but understated dress, shuffles a pack of cards.

                            BLOOM
                  You look very nice.

     She laughs as if at a joke she doesn't think is funny.




                                                                 44

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  What was your childhood like?

                            PENELOPE
                  I make cameras out of watermelons.

                            BLOOM
                  Lonely.

                            PENELOPE
                  Lucky guess.

     Penelope's hands move faster.     She knows how to shuffle
     cards.

                            BLOOM
                  How was it lonely?

                            PENELOPE
                  Fishing for an entertaining
                  childhood anecdote that
                  encapsulates my adult issues?

                            BLOOM
                  Well it's funny how everyone's
                  usually got one.

     As Penelope tells her story she gets fancier with her
     shuffles.

                            PENELOPE
                  When I turned six I started getting
                  allergies, hayfever, rashes, really
                  bad. So my mom took me into the
                  doctor, and he did that test where
                  they use needles to prick a grid on
                  your back with all the different
                  toxins, to see which ones you're
                  allergic to. The next day I came
                  in, the doctor lifted up my shirt,
                  and my back looked like a patch of
                  oily, moldy, blackish green double-
                  puff marshmallows. I was allergic
                  to everything. So they sealed the
                  house with plastic and a special
                  ventilation system, and I spent my
                  entire childhood and adolescence
                  indoors. Mostly alone. Lonely.

     She pulls the Queens out of the deck and lays them face up on
     the table.


  

                                                              45

                         BLOOM
               Wow.

                         PENELOPE
               It wasn't `til I was nineteen they
               discovered what I was actually
               allergic to was the aluminum alloy
               the hypodermic needle was made out
               of. Then I was going to leave, but
               my mom got sick. So I stayed. And
               she stayed sick, a long time.

                         BLOOM
               Do you feel cheated?

     Penelope does an amazing card trick using the four queens.

                         PENELOPE
               The trick to not feeling cheated is
               to learn how to cheat. So I
               decided this wasn't a story about a
               miserable girl trapped in a house
               that smelled like medical supplies
               wasting her life on a dying person
               she sometimes hated. It was about
               a girl who could find infinite
               beauty in anything, any little
               thing. And do anything she decided
               to do. And love the person she was
               trapped with. So I told myself
               that story until it became true.
               Now did doing that let me escape a
               wasted life, or did it just blind
               me so I wouldn't want to escape it?
               I don't know. But either way, I
               was the one telling my own story.
               So I don't feel cheated.

     She finishes the trick.

     A single pair of hands clapping turns their heads. At the
     far end of the deck, alone at a table, the large man in the
     fur collared cape, who for reasons unlikely to become clear
     at the moment will be called THE CURATOR.

                         THE CURATOR
               And a magician is just an actor
               playing the part of a magician.   My
               compliments.

     Bloom takes Penelope gently by the elbow and guides her up
     and away.

                                                                 46
   




74   EXT. BOW - NIGHT                                             74

     They stroll out onto the moonlit bow of the ship.

                         PENELOPE
               Who is that man? You avoided him
               earlier on the deck.

                         BLOOM
               I don't know, but he's carrying a
               knife up his sleeve and wearing a
               cape. Do me a favor and steer
               clear of him.

     A waltz drifts through the air from a band unseen.

                         BLOOM (CONT'D) (cont'd)
               I don't suppose in all your hobby
               acquiring you ever learned how to
               dance?

                         PENELOPE
               I went through a phase when I was
               mildly obsessed with the Bolero.

                         BLOOM
               Give me a minute.

     He leaves her alone. Clouds obscure the moon, shadows
     deepen. She shivers.

     A match strikes.   She jumps.

     The moon re-emerges, and she is no longer alone on the deck.
     The Curator lights a dapper briar pipe, shakes out the match.

                         THE CURATOR
               Mademoiselle.

                           PENELOPE
               Monsieur.

                         THE CURATOR
                   (in French, subtitled)
               I didn't mean to startle you.

                         PENELOPE
                   (in French, subtitled)
               Yes you did.

                            THE CURATOR
                      (in French, subtitled)
                  Apologies, but the deck was dark,
                  and I had to approach.
                      (English)
                  It's been such a time since I've
                  encountered the Brothers Bloom.

                            PENELOPE
                  You're in antiques?

                            THE CURATOR
                      (Cheshire grin)
                  Antiques. I wonder, my dear, if
                  you know the true nature of the men
                  you travel with?

     The band strikes up a Bolero. The Curator flicks his wrist,
     and a long thin blade falls into his hand.

                            THE CURATOR (cont'd)
                  A little fear might suit you, I
                  think.

     He raises the blade... it is in fact a fine mustache brush,
     which he delicately employs.

                            THE CURATOR (cont'd)
                  Bon soir, ma cherie.

     With that the Curator backs into the shadows, and is gone.
     Moments later Bloom trots up to her, oblivious.

                            BLOOM
                  It isn't a Spanish band, but
                  they'll do their best.

     He hands her a single blood red rose. She puts it in her
     teeth, and they dance. If there is a tinge of tension in the
     air, the Bolero suits it.

     The moon ducks behind a cloud once more, and they dance on in
     the dark.


75   INT. STATE ROOM - MORNING                                    75

     Bloom wakes with a start. Morning light pours in through his
     porthole. He opens it, looks out to sea.






                                                              48

     His dinner jacket draped over a chair. The rose in its
     lapel. He fishes it out. Runs his fingers over the teeth
     marks on the stem.

     Then raises an eyebrow at a lump in the breast pocket, and
     pulls out the stack of bills in the green rubber band.




76   EXT. DECK - MORNING                                          76

     The Chink and Penelope lie on their stomachs on the deck, a
     beer can pinhole camera between them.

     Penelope gives a lesson on how it works.

     The Chink appreciates her.


77   EXT. BREAKFAST DECK - LATER                                  77

     Bloom escorts Penelope to breakfast.

                            PENELOPE
                  How'd you find her?

                            BLOOM
                  The Chi-nese, uh, Yeungling?   She
                  found us.


78   INT. KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING (FLASHBACK)                     78

     Bloom cooks breakfast in his bathrobe.

                            BLOOM (O.S.)
                  A few years back, when we hit the
                  top of our art dealing game, she
                  just appeared.

     A door opens and slams. Bloom turns. The Chink sits at his
     place at the table, suitcase beside her, smoking a cigarette.

                            BLOOM (O.S.) (cont'd)
                  She's stuck with us. We figure
                  when she gets bored she'll vanish
                  with the same lack of noise.

     Like feeding a strange animal, Bloom pours her coffee.   She
     drinks it without looking at him.

                                                              49





79   EXT. BREAKFAST DECK                                          79

                         PENELOPE
               I like her.

                           BLOOM
               Good.

     They smile when they see Stephen and the Chink at a table.

     Their smiles drop when they see the Curator sitting with
     them. Bloom glares at the Curator, but speaks to Stephen.

                         BLOOM (cont'd)
               What's he doing here?

                         STEPHEN
               I invited him, sit down. This
               ship's too small to dance around
               each other for a week, we might as
               well have it out now. Bloom. Sit.
               Penelope, do you know our friend?

                         PENELOPE
               Only as the creepy Frenchman.

                         THE CURATOR
               Book-learned. You know languages
               but not accents, my dear. I am
               Belgian. Maxmillion Melville, at
               your service.

                         BLOOM
               Also known in certain professional
               circles as the Curator.

                         PENELOPE
               Pleased to make your acquaintance.
               What do you do?

                         THE CURATOR
               I'm a curator, presently for the
               National Museum in Prague. And
               yourself?

                         PENELOPE
               I'm an epileptic photographer.

                         THE CURATOR
               Good for you. Boys? What do you
               do?



                                                                 50

                  We have a legitimate antique
                  reselling business.

                            THE CURATOR
                  Baissez le rideau, la farce est
                  jouee.

                            STEPHEN
                  We've gone straight, Max.

                             THE CURATOR
                  Pardon, but you do not ascend to
                  the grand heights of the Brothers
                  Bloom only to toss it all and sell
                  terra cotta to blue haired weekend
                  antiquers.

                             STEPHEN
                  We did.   Eat your waffles.

                            THE CURATOR
                  But Mademoiselle appears...
                  confused. Perhaps she is unawares?

                            BLOOM
                  Eat your waffles, fat man.

                            THE CURATOR
                  Unaware that the Brothers Bloom are
                  in fact the two most highly
                  respected art smugglers in the
                  western world?

                            STEPHEN
                  Were. We've been on the straight
                  for three years. So that's that.

                            THE CURATOR
                  Well, if that is that, then that is
                  indeed that. As you say.

     Penelope snaps her fingers.     Everyone looks up.

                            PENELOPE
                  Your name's Melville?

               Sorry, no, cause I noticed but I
               couldn't place it, this ship is the
               Fidele, which was the ship in
               Melville's novel "The Confidence
               Man." So that's weird.

     Everyone glances at Stephen, a little uncomfortable.

                         STEPHEN
               Huh.


80   INT. DECK - NIGHT                                         80

     Bloom paces, Stephen shuffles cards.

                         BLOOM
               I know you like to throw those
               clever little details in, but
               you've gotta watch that shit with
               her Stephen. She had a lot of time
               alone in that house, and she used
               it. She did the best Double Dutch
               Queens I've ever seen up on the
               deck last night.

                         STEPHEN
               Double Dutch Queens uses gaffed
               cards.

                         BLOOM
               She had them in her purse and cut
               them in while I was folding my
               napkin.

                         STEPHEN
               Jesus.

                         BLOOM
               That's what I'm saying. She's
               different, she knows, sometimes it
               feels like she knows everything.
               Doesn't that worry you?

                         STEPHEN
               No. But something about her is
               worrying you plenty.

                         BLOOM
               She feels like one of your
               characters.



                                                                   52

                  The day I con you is the day I die,
                  Bloom.

                             BLOOM
                  I know that.
                      (beat)
                  How did you get the Belgian, on our
                  budget?

                            STEPHEN
                  He's beautiful, right?

                            BLOOM
                  I didn't expect him to actually be
                  Belgian.

                            STEPHEN
                  I'm not sure he is.   I'm to bed.

     Stephen stands to go, then pauses.

                            STEPHEN (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                  I've always protected you, right?
                  The only real danger in this whole
                  play is that you'll actually fall
                  in love with her. Look at me.
                  Don't fall in love with her.


81   EXT. UPPER DECK - CONTINUOUS                                     81

     The Chink sits smoking her whittled pipe, watching Bloom
     alone on the deck. Stephen passes her, and she stops him
     with a look.

                             STEPHEN
                  Shut up.   I know what I'm doing.

     She hands him a thin piece of paper.       He looks it over.

                            STEPHEN (cont'd)
                  This came through just now?

     The paper is a telegram with the Fidele's imprint, received
     from St. Petersburg. Stephen reads it.




    

                                                                   53

     He crumples the paper, looks down at Bloom.

                  Wire him back for me. "Dear Dog

     Bloom and Penelope lie on the deck, watching dolphins.

     She says this word like she's eating chocolate:

                            PENELOPE
                  Smugglers. It's like an adventure
                  story. Whose idea was it to go
                  straight?

                            BLOOM
                  Mine. Stephen always loved the
                  life. Then he was almost killed on
                  a run to Jakarta, two thugs with
                  heads like canned hams worked him
                  beyond all reason.

               And I called it, that was it.

                           PENELOPE
               Scary.

                         BLOOM
               For me. Stephen enjoyed it. He
               loved the idea that we were
               internationally infamous art
               smugglers, but I think deep down,
               same as me, he felt like we were
               putting on a persona, faking it.

                         PENELOPE
               Telling a story.

                         BLOOM
               He'd love to die on a job.
               Cornered at midnight on a run to
               Jakarta. That's his dream, to tell
               his story so well it fulfills
               itself. It somehow would make it
               finally real for him.

                         PENELOPE
               That's kinda the thing we all want,
               right?

     He looks at her in the sun.

                         BLOOM
               Trying to get something real by
               telling yourself stories is a trap.
               Trust me on that one.

     With a wink, he is gone.     A beat.   Penelope stands apart.

                            BLOOM
                  My French is a little rusty, but I
                  believe he just told you `my offer

                  Whatever's in his pipe, it made me

     He brings her face close to hers, smoke twisting, and speaks
     unheard words low and fast.

                            PENELOPE
                  An 8th century prayer book.


89   EXT. PRAGUE STREETS - DAY                                       89

     We fly through the city streets...

                            PENELOPE (V.O.)
                  From his museum in Prague, stashed
                  in the castle.

     Up to the base of the castle, through a grated hole in an
     ancient wall, into...


90   INT. MUSEUM VAULT                                               90

     A stunning illuminated manuscript lies open on a stone table.
     The Curator's hands close it gently and take it away.

                            STEPHEN (V.O.)
                  A book of hours.

                            PENELOPE (V.O.)
                  Yeah. Medieval art bores the crap
                  out of me so I don't know it that
                  well. So that's what he does, he
                  makes pieces in his collections
                  disappear, then sells them off via
                  a trusted middleman.

                  That's what he does.

                            STEPHEN
                  Wonder who's his fence?

                            BLOOM
                  Probably his Spanish guy, right?
                      (asks Penelope)
                  Did he say who's buying?

                            PENELOPE
                  An Argentinian. Argentine?
                  Argentinian?


92   EXT. DECK - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)                             92

                            THE CURATOR
                  A gentleman from Argentina. He's
                  quite sick, cancer in his bones,
                  and desperate for sentimental
                  reasons to own this piece while he
                  may.


93   EXT. GRECIAN PORT                                         93

                  He'll sell it to a middleman for
                  one million, US. The Argentin...a
                  guy will pay two point five.

                             STEPHEN
                  Not bad.

                            PENELOPE
                  Is he legit?

                  The Curator? That's a relative
                  term. He's telling the truth.

                            BLOOM
                  I'm sorry you had to deal with that
                  guy.

     Behind Penelope, two porters load her steamer trunk into the
     back of a taxi.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  Where's that cab going?

                            PENELOPE
                  The train station.

     Bloom breathes.

                            PENELOPE (cont'd)
                  Let's do it. Let's, just, I want
                  to try this. Let's be smugglers.
                  I think it'd be fun. We should do
                  this.

                             BLOOM
                  No.

                  Well first off, we don't have a
                  million dollars.

                            PENELOPE
                  I do, I've got, that's whatever.   I
                  mean a real reason.

                            BLOOM
                  This is real, it's dangerous, it
                  could go very bad.

                            PENELOPE
                  I think a little real danger might
                  suit me. I'm gonna do it.

     She walks off towards the taxi.

                         BLOOM
               This is not an adventure story.

                         PENELOPE
               What are you talking about?    It
               totally is.


94   EXT. HUNGARIAN COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT                           94

     A train roars through the night towards Prague.


95   INT. STEPHEN'S SLEEPING CAR - NIGHT                          95

     Stephen reclines, hat on his face.    Bloom paces.

                         STEPHEN
               Take it easy. She's having fun,
               that's the point of this.

                         BLOOM
               She's making a flag for our
               "smugglers gang," man. She made me
               learn a secret smugglers handshake.
               Unhealthy. This afternoon, when
               she was writing, in the observation
               car? A letter? A journal? No.
               She is getting way too into this.

     Bloom fishes a crumpled piece of paper from his pocket and
     thrusts it in front of Stephen's face.

     On it are written dozens of variations in stylized fonts of
     "Penelope the smuggler."

                         BLOOM (cont'd)
               She's been singing the Smuggler
               Song since Athens.

                         STEPHEN
               What Smugglers Song?




 

                                                                59

                  You know, the one from whatsit, the
                  Disney thing, that Smuggler Song,
                  the `We're a band of smugglers hey,
                  la la la la la, we smuggle by night
                  and drink by day, smugglers ho, ho

                  isn't... there isn't a Smuggler
                  Song, is there? Ok. She made up a
                  Smuggler Song. With hand motions.

                            STEPHEN
                  The whole point of this was to
                  sweep her off her feet. Let her
                  enjoy it.

                            BLOOM
                  While it lasts.

                            STEPHEN
                  Nothing lasts.

     Exit Bloom.    Stephen sighs and drops his hat back on his
     face.


96   INT. BLOOM'S SLEEPING CAR                                    96

     Bloom reads. Footsteps pound by outside. Penelope and the
     Chink run past his door. A moment later a uniformed
     ATTENDANT runs past.

     A beat, then the footsteps come back, and the girls duck into
     Bloom's cabin, slamming the door. Sacks in their teeth.

     Off Bloom's quizzical look:

                               PENELOPE
                  Smuggling.     From the snack car.

     They pull bags of chips and tiny liquor bottles from their
     sacks.

     Bloom glares at the Chink, who tries to avoid his gaze.


97   INT. SNACK CAR                                               97

     Bloom pays the SNACK CAR ATTENDANT from a stack of Euros,
     while the Chink gives him counts on her fingers.



 

                                                                 60

                             THE CHINK
                  Jameson.

                            BLOOM
                  I'm not paying for that.

     She holds up two fingers, the Attendant pours two.

                             ATTENDANT
                  Ice?

     She says no with a look, they drink.

                            BLOOM
                  She made up the Smuggler Song.

     The Chink nods.      Bloom pays for the Jameson.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  I thought it was a Disney thing.


98   INT. PENELOPE'S SLEEPING CAR - LATER THAT NIGHT              98

     The lights are off. Penelope reclines on the bed, surrounded
     by empty tiny gin bottles. Drunk.

     Bloom sits on the floor, both framed in a big window looking
     out on a breathtaking moonlit landscape rolling hypnotically
     by.

                            PENELOPE
                  Gin is fuckin fruity. Have you
                  taken this train before?

                             BLOOM
                  Yeah.

                            PENELOPE
                  So this is all like fuckin
                  `whatever' to you.

                            BLOOM
                  I usually drink with the Chink in
                  the snack car, play cards.

                            PENELOPE

                  Mrs. Yeungling. That's her
                  smuggler nickname.

                            PENELOPE
                  That's offensive.

                            BLOOM
                  I think if it were offensive to
                  her, she'd let us know.

                            PENELOPE
                  Do I get a smuggler nickname?

     Bloom quietly slips the stack of cash in the green rubber
     band into Penelope's luggage.

                            BLOOM
                  No.

                  I think you're constipated.   In
                  your fuckin soul.

     Bloom makes several attempts to form a response to this
     before giving up.

                            BLOOM
                  What?

                            PENELOPE
                  You've got a big load of grumpy
                  petrified poop up your ass, I'm
                  just calling you out on it. Yeah
                  I'm pretending I'm a smuggler, so
                  you know what? I'm a fuckin
                  smuggler. If that's your thing,
                  fuckin tell it like you own it.
                  When you've got a spotlight in
                  front of your feet, man, fuckin
                  jump into it and dance the shit out

                  much. Enjoy the fuckin ride.
                  Fuck.

     A roll of thunder and spectacular flash of lightning ignites
     the landscape, and rain starts to patter. Penelope stiffens.

                            PENELOPE (cont'd)

      Another crash. Lying on her stomach, Penelope slowly starts
      feeling something which makes her undulate. Bloom stares,
      confused.

                          PENELOPE (cont'd)
                Whoa ha. Oh ho ho. Ohhhhhh whoooo
                ha ha ha ha.

      Beneath her, the train wheels rhythmically clack and vibrate
      against the tracks. Another flash of lightening, the rain
      falls harder.

      Penelope writhes.   Bloom silently shrinks back in terror.

      The door to her car latches, and Bloom is gone.

      Bloom sits drinking and playing cards with the Chink.    He
      spaces out, she snaps her fingers to wake him up.

                                STEPHEN
                   Pale skin.     Long feet.   So.

      He winks.

                             STEPHEN (V.O.)
                   Bloom and I will secure us lodging,

      The brothers set their suitcases on the beds. Bloom finds
      the stack of bills in the green rubber band in his.

                   Mrs. Yeungling will scout the
                   castle museum.

      The Chink, in ridiculous tourist garb and a "PROPERTY OF KGB"
      t-shirt, takes pictures with one of several cameras around
      her neck.

                   You will go to the bank, that wire
                   should have cleared if you put it
                   in at Athens.

                   Only movie thugs and Russians deal
                   in suitcases of cash. Draw a
                   certified check.

      A cashier hands over an elaborate check, which Penelope signs
      and puts in an envelope.


106   INT. APARTMENT STAIRCASE - DAY                              106

      A baroque spiral staircase, the spine of a high apartment
      building. Our intrepid four ring the bell beside an
      apartment door.

                             THE CURATOR (FROM INSIDE)
                   Who the hell is that?! Who is it?!

                             STEPHEN
                   Candy-Gram. It's us, Max.

      Stephen pushes open the door, and an instant later a SHOTGUN
      BLAST takes out a chunk of the landing beside his head.

      They all dive onto the floor, piling on top of each other.

                             THE CURATOR (FROM INSIDE)
                   Who the hell are you, what do you
                   want, who the hell!!!!??

                  BLOOM                            STEPHEN
      Max! Max! It's us, Bloom,         Max! Max! It's Stephen and
      Stephen, Jesus, Max, easy,        Bloom, easy, whoa, Christ,
      whoa!                             whoa now!

      The Curator stands in the smoky apartment hallway, sloppily
      draped in a ratty bathrobe, bottle in one hand and shotgun in
      the other. He squints at them.

                             THE CURATOR (cont'd)
                   Ah. Good morning. Come in. I
                   have been drinking.


107   INT. THE CURATOR'S APARTMENT - LATER                        107

      A schematic of the castle laid on the kitchen table. The
      Curator looks even worse in the light, red rimmed eyes, heavy
      skin on his face.

                             THE CURATOR
                   Here, off the Basilica, are offices
                   of administration, and beneath
                   those, an otherwise inaccessible
                   section of catacombs. And the
                   book.




                                                                 65

                             BLOOM
                   Administrative offices.    So how do
                   you steal the book?

                             THE CURATOR
                   The book is already stolen. The
                   stealing is in the bureaucracy, in
                   the filing, red tape. As far as
                   the museum is concerned, the book
                   does not exist. I am the curator,
                   I walk in, pinch the copy girl's
                   baboosh, put the book in a
                   briefcase and walk out. Tomorrow,
                   say, at two.

                             STEPHEN
                   Today.

                             THE CURATOR
                   Today is not a good day.

                             STEPHEN
                   Tomorrow. Now what about this
                   Argentinian.

                             THE CURATOR
                       (blank, then realizes)
                   Ah, the Argentine? Senor Luise
                   Belguta Rioso. I get his file.


108   INT. CURATORS APARTMENT BEDROOM - LATER                     108

      Penelope and Bloom wander into the bedroom, looking at an
      array of beautiful paintings on the wall.

                             PENELOPE
                   Gin is slow death, man.

      Stephen and the Chink poke their heads in, leaving.   The
      Curator strolls in.

                             STEPHEN
                   We'll see you back at the hotel.
                       (glances at the Curator)
                   Soon.

      They go, leaving Bloom and Penelope, who squints at an
      unframed oil on canvas, of a lonely stone well in a primeval
      forest clearing. It sits at the foot of an unmade bed.



 

                                                                    66

                             THE CURATOR
                   From a private collection on the
                   island of Ikaria. That one.

                             BLOOM
                   Who painted it?

                             THE CURATOR
                   I don't know.

                             PENELOPE
                   Why is it the last thing you see
                   every night, and the first thing
                   you see every morning?

                             THE CURATOR
                   That's a story. You have a minute?

      He closes the blinds and sits on a stool in front of the
      painting. Setting the stage.

                             THE CURATOR (cont'd)
                   My daughter travelled with me when
                   she was very young, and I'd show
                   her the places and the art, all the
                   most joyous and terrifying things
                   in the world.

      Memories of his daughter's hand in his, flashing against the
      sun.

                             THE CURATOR (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                   I wanted that the world was alive
                   in the most fantastic way for her.
                   To built her a pair of wings. Make
                   these things real. But maybe more
                   than any other objet d'art, she
                   loved to hear she'd ask to hear the
                   story of the stone golem. From a
                   painting in a small private
                   collection on the island of Ikaria.

      He motions to the painting, and we move into it. As he tells
      the story the scenes are shown in the painting, just as still
      images, which we move across like a picture book.

                             THE CURATOR (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                   Well Rachel, like most monsters the
                   Golem was once a human. A boy,
                   about your age.

                          THE CURATOR (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                And one day the boy was walking
                home, and he quarrelled, he fought,
                with a good friend of his. They
                got very angry and his friend
                pushed him a certain way and the
                boy fell and struck his head and
                died. The boy's friend was very
                sad but also very frightened. So
                instead of telling the boy's
                parents, he did something awful.
                He pulled the body into a quarry, a
                pit of broken rocks, and hid the
                boy beneath a pile of large stones.
                Well. Years went by, and the boy's
                friend became a young man, and one
                day while drinking in town (which
                in his guilt he did quite a lot of)
                he heard that a well was being
                built near the forest... with the
                stones from the quarry. He ran to
                the quarry to find it nearly
                empty... no stones, no body. He
                ran to the well where the masons
                were finishing their work. `Did
                they find anything strange in the
                quarry?' he asked, expecting, maybe
                hoping they'd arrest him for the
                awful crime on the spot. But no,
                they said, motioning to the well.
                Nothing strange. Just stones.
                They left him alone there at the
                well, and he stood looking into it
                as the sun fell behind the
                mountains and twilight set the
                world in a deep, still silence.

      The last image we land on is the well, alone in the clearing.

      Its dark innards loom ominously in the long pregnant silence
      that follows.

      Then, with a piercing ROAR, a living monster of stone lunges
      out of the well, animated and terrifying, grabs the friend by
      the throat and with a crunching of bones and one last roar
      pulls him back down into the depths of the well.

      Silence again. We pull out of the painting, back to the
      Curator, sitting very still.

                          THE CURATOR (cont'd)
                My daughter died nineteen years ago
                today. She was six. She went out
                to play one afternoon and vanished.

                The next morning we found her, in a
                stone well on a neighboring
                property. I climbed down to her,
                but slipped and broke my leg, and
                while we waited for the rescue team
                to pull us out she died in my arms.
                If you've had a child... my whole
                everything just focused down to one
                thing, to hold her and make her
                feel safe. But no matter what I
                said to her, I couldn't stop her
                shaking, crying. Her last moments
                on this earth were filled with
                terror. Of a stone golem.

      He stands, opens the blinds, pours another drink.

                          THE CURATOR (cont'd)
                It was the first painting I
                `acquired.' I keep it maybe hoping
                some night the golem will come for
                me.

                Mademoiselle.

      Bloom keeps going, anxious to leave, but Penelope lingers on

                Right.   Oh, right.

      She gives him the envelope with the certified check. He
      shakes her hand, then deftly adjusts his grip so that just
      for a moment he holds her hand as you would hold a child's.

      He lets go, and smiles apologetically.

                             THE CURATOR
                Au revoir.

                You aren't constipated. You're
                scared. What are you scared of?

      They walk on, suddenly somehow holding hands.

      As they approach the hotel, Bloom deftly breaks their hand
      holding off. Penelope notices why.

      A smell breaks his concentration.

                Diamond Dog, carrying a cup and a
                cane.

      Standing behind him, a soft old man in an ashy suit and
      eyepatch. The DIAMOND DOG.

                           DIAMOND DOG
                Bloom. How long has it been?
                     (sits, orders)
                Tea.
                     (to Bloom)
                Can you believe that? Tea? Been a
                long while.

                          BLOOM
                If I call Stephen down he'll kill
                you.

                   a look. I'm an old man with no
                   depth perception. You don't have
                   to be scared of me.

      The Dog plays with a heavy gold lighter, making sparks.

                   It's been a funny thing, watching

                   Brothers Bloom. And you hate me.
                   The curse of all bad fathers - that
                   my presence on this earth after I
                   die will not live on the lips of
                   admiring men, but will sink into
                   the murky backwaters of my
                   children's psyches.

                             BLOOM
                   Is this profundity?   Cause you can
                   skip it.

                              DIAMOND DOG
                   Ha!   Ha ha. Piss and vinegar.

      The Dog scoots next to Bloom.

                             DIAMOND DOG (cont'd)
                   When I first took you boys in,
                   showed you the ropes, haunting St.
                   Pete's, piss and vinegar. I still
                   crave that youthful joy. Even
                   today.

      The Dog's hand touches Bloom's leg.     There is something
      horrible about this.

      Beneath the bar, Bloom grips the sharp pencil like a knife.

                             BLOOM
                   Don't touch me.

                             DIAMOND DOG
                   You probably won't believe I loved
                   you boys very much.



   

                                                               71

                          BLOOM
                You're going to take your hand away
                or I'm going to break your arm,
                there's nothing between.

      He does, but Bloom's fingers don't loosen on the pencil.

                          DIAMOND DOG
                But love, you know. We know, folks
                like us, you can always blink and
                realize that it's a fiction, and
                like Peter walking on water or
                Wiley Coyote running off a cliff,
                if you look down in doubt you'll
                fall. That's the price of our
                lives, the wax in our wings. One
                day Stephen's going to fall. It
                may be glorious, but he's going to
                fall hard and he won't be there to
                tell you what to do and protect
                you. When he's gone, remember me.

      The Dog has moved in very close to Bloom, his breath hot on
      his face, and his hand comes to rest fully on Bloom's leg.

      Bloom's hand with the pencil quivers, about to strike-

      When Bloom is pulled from the bar stool by a heavy hand.
      Stephen, his eyes burning through the Dog.

                          DIAMOND DOG (cont'd)
                Hello Stephen.

      Stephen smashes a bottle from the bar and slashes it across
      the Dog's hand.

      Waiters and porters tackle him, the Dog howls, holding his
      bleeding hand. Bloom stands numb, and puts the pencil in his
      pocket.


114   EXT. PRAGUE HOTEL - NIGHT                                  114

      Bloom watches the Dog get into a waiting black Mercedes. For
      an instant the car's interior light shows an 11 year old boy
      behind the tinted glass, as the Dog slides in and puts his
      arm around him.

      The Mercedes drives off.

                                                                72
  




115   EXT. PRAGUE STREETS - NIGHT                               115

      Right in front of the hotel, on the water. Bloom sips coffee
      from a china cup, spinning a paper in his hands. Stephen
      joins him, with a matching cup.

                          STEPHEN
                I'm sorry I wasn't there.

                          BLOOM
                You can't always be there.

                          STEPHEN
                No, I guess can't.

      A beat.

                          BLOOM
                That was a real tonal shift.    The
                Curator's tale.

      On one side of the paper is the sketch of Penelope, on the
      other is the con flowchart. "#12 - The Curator's Tale."
      "#14 - Castle Break-In."

                          STEPHEN
                I'm a big fan of tonal shifts. I
                didn't write it for him, though.

                          BLOOM
                He made it up on the spot?

                          STEPHEN
                I don't know.


116   INT. BLOOM'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                           116

      Bloom flops into bed.   He turns and looks at the wall.

      Right on the other side of it...


117   INT. PENELOPE'S HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS                   117

      Penelope lies in bed, looking at the wall also.   She closes
      her eyes.

                                                                  73
    




118   INT. BLOOM'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                             118

      Bloom's breathing slows.   He closes his eyes.

      A beat. Then light snoring breaks the silence, coming
      through the wall. Penelope snoring.

      Bloom smiles slightly.   What a cute snore.

      The snoring deepens slightly.

      The clock on the wall advances from 1:30am to 5:50am, and
      through the window the horizon glows with the approach of
      dawn.

      Bloom lies wide awake on his back, red rimmed eyes wide open,
      the guttural snoring ringing in his ears.


119   INT. APARTMENT STAIRCASE - MORNING                          119

      Our four at the Curator's door. Bloom knocks, and they all
      step judiciously back. No response.

                           STEPHEN
                Max?

                          BLOOM
                We're a little early...


120   INT. THE CURATOR'S APARMENT - MORNING                       120

      Still and silent in the breaking light of morning.

      And totally empty.   Picked clean down to the bare walls.

      The only thing left in the apartment is the painting of the
      well... broken on the floor.

      Our intrepid four stand in various states of thoughtfulness.
      Penelope stares at the painting, Bloom at the window.

                          PENELOPE
                The Golem came for him. In my
                dream. Crawled out of the painting
                and killed him in a horrible way.






                                                                74
  
120   CONTINUED:                                                120


                             BLOOM
                   Well at least he had the decency to
                   just skip out on us, not do
                   something tacky like fake his own
                   death.

      Poking around the room, Bloom opens a closet. The Curator
      stands pressed against the back wall in his pajamas.

                             THE CURATOR
                       (sotto)
                   You're a little early.

      Bloom quickly closes it.

                             STEPHEN
                   I don't get it. If he was
                   hightailing it he could have waited
                   eight hours till we traded the
                   million for the book, and had some
                   traveling money. Well. Back to
                   antiquing. Nothing gained, nothing
                   lost.
                       (to Penelope)
                   And you got to see Prague, which is
                   nice.

      Penelope's eyes widen with realization.

                             PENELOPE
                   Oh.

                             BLOOM
                   You should stay in the city for
                   awhile, they have these amazing
                   puppet show opera things-

      But Stephen raises a hand to shut him up.

                             STEPHEN
                   Oh?


121   EXT. SIDEWALK BAR - DAY                                     121

      Several empty glasses of wine, one full one in Penelope's
      hand. All heads are slumped.

                             PENELOPE
                   Oh.





                                                                    75
      
121   CONTINUED:                                                    121


                             BLOOM
                   It's my fault. I can't believe I
                   left you alone with him.

      The Chink hands Stephen a piece of paper.       He glances at it.

                             STEPHEN
                   The check was cashed yesterday
                   afternoon, he'd have deposited it
                   in a Swiss account. I'm sorry Pen.

                             PENELOPE
                   What a waste.

      Bloom puts his hand on her arm, sympathetic.

                             PENELOPE (cont'd)
                   That poor man. What a waste.

      Bloom's expression turns quizzical.

                             PENELOPE (cont'd)
                   That poor Argentina man. He'll
                   never see the book now, it'll just
                   rot in the catacombs. What a
                   waste.

      When Penelope lifts her suddenly brightened eyes in a moment
      of divine inspiration, Bloom meets her gaze with fear.


122   EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE, PRAGUE - DAY                             122

      Bloom paces, Penelope looks up at the castle with binoculars.
      The Chink and Stephen stand by.

                             BLOOM
                   No. No no. Can't you see what
                   happened here, there is no book,
                   we've been swindled -

                             PENELOPE
                   But maybe there is, maybe it's
                   real, we don't know!

                             BLOOM
                   It's not real, it's a con.

                             PENELOPE
                   It's my money, I'm going to find
                   out for sure. He gave us every
                   piece of information we need.

  

                                                                  76

      She spreads the castle floor plan out on a bench.

      Bloom turns to Stephen and the Chink with a "this is crazy
      right?" expression and gesture. They give him nothing back.

                             STEPHEN
                   We'd need to clear the
                   administrative offices.   Some sort
                   of disruption.

      The Chink strokes her chin in mock-thoughtfulness.

                             PENELOPE
                       (to Bloom)
                   C'mon. Help me break into this
                   castle. It'll be fun.


123   EXT. FIELD - DAY                                            123

      A Barbie Doll set up in the middle of the field explodes in a
      theatrical plume of fire.

      Several others follow suit.

      The Chink pops up from behind a mound of dirt in her aviator
      goggles, cigarette dangling from her lip. She leans on a
      detonator plunger.

      Bloom, Stephen and Penelope crouch nearby, watching her work.

                             STEPHEN
                   She's an artist with nitroglycerin.
                   It's kind of her thing.

                              PENELOPE
                   I feel like I want to know more
                   about her.



                    BLOOM                            STEPHEN
      Yeah.                             Yeah.

                             STEPHEN
                   Check the tat.

      On the back of the Chink's neck, a few finely scripted lines
      of Chinese.






                                                                77

                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   An inky wisp of personal
                   information. We transcribed it,
                   brought it into a Chinese
                   restaurant.

                             PENELOPE
                   What's it say?

                             BLOOM
                   The literal translation is
                   something about water cranes, but
                   essentially it means "When you're
                   done with something, blow it up."


124   INT. PENELOPE'S PRAGUE HOTEL ROOM - EVENING               124

      The Chink lies on the floor with Penelope, showing her how to
      build a tiny remotely detonated bomb. She slices a tiny bit
      off a brick of dynamite, sets it in a petri dish with a
      detonator, and puts the whole thing in a handbag.

      Penelope appreciates her.

      Bloom and Stephen hunker over the castle floorplan.

                             STEPHEN
                   There's a smoke detector in these
                   empty rooms in the east tower. So
                   we plant and set off a tiny -
                       (to the Chink)
                   TINY tiny, tiny charge.

      The Chink clicks a seemingly innocent ballpoint pen. With a
      BEEP, a tiny poof of fire plumes from the handbag setting it
      on fire, and the smoke rises to the ceiling.

                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   Fire drill ensues, offices empty,
                   and you'll have exactly four and a
                   half minutes to get through the
                   access hatch, into the catacombs,
                   get the book and get out before the
                   fire department arrives.

      Penelope and the Chink do their elaborate handshake, and she
      gives Stephen and Bloom a finger snap thumbs up.

                                                                  78
    




125   INT. PENELOPE'S HOTEL ROOM - LATER                             125

      Bloom and Penelope, up late at the table.     Going over the
      floorplan one more time.

                          BLOOM
                So straight down the corridor,
                again, tell me where.

                          PENELOPE
                Second left, third right, access
                hatch behind the copier, I need to
                sleeeeeeep...

                          BLOOM
                The abort code if we need to abort
                is "corned beef." For some reason.

                          PENELOPE
                Bloom, I need to sleep.

      He folds up the plans, she wraps up the brick of dynamite and
      bomb components and spots a black leather backpack beside an
      open handbag on the table.

                          PENELOPE (cont'd)
                Is this Yeungling's backpack?

                            BLOOM
                Yeah.

      She gently puts the brick of stabilized nitroglycerin inside
      the front zipper compartment, and sets the tiny petri-dish
      bomb beside the handbag.

                          PENELOPE
                You know what I feel?

                            BLOOM
                Horny?

                          PENELOPE
                Scared. All my big talk.       But this
                isn't a story, it's real.      Fuckin
                scary.

      She kisses him.    He kisses her back.






                                                                 79

      The pure whole hearted sensuality with which they attack each
      other and the deluge of almost child-like need let loose in
      this one simple act quickly reaches a point where as a viewer
      we no longer feel comfortable intruding with our gaze.

      Fifteen seconds after this point, we FADE OUT.


126   EXT. PRAGUE - DAWN                                         126

      The sun arcs into the sky above the castle.


127   INT. PENELOPE'S PRAGUE HOTEL ROOM - DAWN                   127

      Bloom half wakes.

      Across the landscape of the bed, Penelope sleeps.   Sunlight
      on her body and her sleeping face.

      Distant KNOCKING.     From the next room over.

      Bloom's eyes snap open.    He scampers.


128   EXT. PRAGUE HOTEL WINDOW LEDGE - DAWN CONTINUOUS           128

      In his boxers, holding trousers and shirt in his teeth, Bloom
      swings over the ledge from Penelope's window into his.


129   INT. BLOOM'S PRAGUE HOTEL ROOM - DAWN CONTINUOUS           129

      He opens the door for Stephen, who regards him narrowly.

                             STEPHEN
                   Ready?


130   INT. PENELOPE'S PRAGUE HOTEL ROOM - MORNING                130

      The Chink picks up the backpack, handbag and petri dish bomb.


131   INT. PENELOPE'S PRAGUE HOTEL ROOM - MORNING                131

      Penelope folds a plastic bag and puts it under her jacket.


132   EXT. CASTLE ADJACENT STREETS - DAY                         132

      A little alcove with a good view of the castle.

 

                                                               80

      Stephen trains his gaze on one set of windows high in the
      Eastern tower. Bloom paces.


133   INT. EASTERN TOWER ROOM - CONTINUOUS                        133

      An empty storage room, half under construction. The Chink
      walks in, wearing the backpack and carrying the handbag. She
      goes straight for a spot just under a smoke detector.


134   EXT. CASTLE ADJACENT STREETS - CONTINUOUS                   134

      Stephen, Bloom and Penelope are joined by the Chink.

                              STEPHEN
                   Ok.

      He looks through his binoculars again.

                              BLOOM
                   Alright?

                              PENELOPE
                   Ok.

      They share a brief moment with their eyes, and Penelope trots
      off. The Chink caught it. She looks at Bloom slyly.

                             BLOOM
                   For the record, I'm still against
                   this. Why send her in alone?

      The Chink finds a way to casually smell Bloom's fingers.

                             STEPHEN
                   Because going in alone is a very
                   important thing to do. She's
                   walking into a zero security
                   tourism office during a fire drill
                   and taking a five hundred dollar
                   manuscript replica from a utility
                   crawlspace. Worst case scenario, a
                   file clerk asks if she's lost.
                   Which isn't even going to happen.
                       (to the Chink)
                   She's in position.

      He spots Penelope casually waiting beside an unmarked door.

      Bloom notices the Chink looking at him with a knowing grin.
      She mimes sealing her lips and tossing the key.



                                                                       81

      She then takes the ballpoint pen detonator... out of the
      handbag dangling at her hip.

                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   Cause nobody's going to know we
                   were ever here.

      Bloom spots the handbag.         Something's not right.

                               BLOOM
                   Uh-

      The Chink clicks the pen.


135   INT. EASTERN TOWER ROOM - CONTINUOUS                             135

      The black backpack, sitting under the smoke alarm, beeps.


136   EXT. CASTLE ADJACENT STREETS - CONTINUOUS                        136

      A THUNDEROUS EXPLOSION blows a massive ten foot wide chunk
      out of the side of the Eastern tower, spewing a painfully
      dramatic ball of fire and debris.

      Screams.   Shouts.      Panic.

      Our three look up at the tower, agape.

                               THE CHINK
                   Fuck me.

      Bloom grabs the binoculars from Stephen, looks for Penelope.


137   EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY                                      137

      Panicked tourists stumble away from the descending dust.
      Penelope sees what's happened, but holds her ground.

      The unmarked door opens, and a dozen business people pour
      out.


138   EXT. CASTLE ADJACENT STREETS - DAY                               138

                             BLOOM
                   Don't do it don't do it Penelope
                   don't-



     

                                                                  82

                             STEPHEN
                   They're locking down the castle,
                   she won't get in.


139   EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY                                 139

      She takes a step towards the door.


140   EXT. CASTLE ADJACENT STREETS - DAY                          140

      Bloom drops the binoculars and sprints.


141   EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY                                 141

      A burly SECURITY GUARD trots across the courtyard, herding
      tourists and smoking a cigar.

                             SECURITY GUARD
                   To ze back, no panic, to ze back...

      He blocks the office door, and sets his cigar down for a
      moment. Penelope spots it.


142   EXT. CASTLE ADJACENT STREETS - DAY                          142

      Bloom nears the courtyard, sees Penelope up ahead.

                             BLOOM
                   Pen! Don't - abort!   Corned beef!
                   Corned beef!


143   EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY                                 143

      Penelope deftly spins the cigar 180 degrees.

      The Guard absently picks it up and puts it back in his mouth,
      fire-side first. He howls, doubles over.

      She dashes into the door.

      Bloom bursts out of the crowd and lunges for the door, but a
      SECOND SECURITY GUARD stops him.

      Dozens more security guards swarm in. Overhead, an army
      helicopter buzzes by. Bloom stares into the doorway,
      helpless and scared.

                                                                 83
   




144   INT. TOURISM OFFICE HALLWAYS - DAY                         144

      Water rains down from the ceiling sprinklers.   Penelope
      weaves through the halls.


145   INT. COPY ROOM - DAY                                       145

      Cramped, ill lit, and with its own sprinkler.

      Penelope dashes in, shoulders the massive cold war era copy
      machine and with a Herculean effort pulls it away from the
      wall.

                          PENELOPE
                I'm in Prague. I burned a man's
                lips off to break into a castle in
                Prague.

      Revealing an access hatch.


146   INT. CRAWLSPACE                                            146

      Tiny, earthy.   Penelope shuts the hatch behind her.

      Light from a barred window illuminates a rectangular shape
      lying on a stone slab. Penelope approaches the small BOOK OF
      HOURS reverently.


147   EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE - DAY                                  147

      A full view of the castle reveals just about the worst case
      scenario. The entire area swarms with army helicopters and
      tanks, soldiers with rifles, yellow tape, news crews.

      Stephen, Bloom and the Chink sit behind the police line on
      the bridge with the rest of the crowds. Heads in their
      hands.


148   INT. CRAWLSPACE                                            148

      Penelope is broken out of her stupor by heavy footsteps all
      around her, soldiers searching the castle.

      Voices right outside the hatch.   She slides the wimpy little
      bolt shut. It rattles.

      She looks up - a moldy vent in the muddy ceiling.

                                                               84
 




149   EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE - DAY                                149

      Bloom suddenly stands.

                          BLOOM
                Wait. Wait, we're fine. She's
                fine. If the soldiers find her
                wandering the halls they'll assume
                she's a clerk, they'll just shoo
                her out. So as long as she doesn't
                do anything suspicious, she's fine.


150   INT. VENTILATION DUCT                                    150

      Penelope wriggles on her belly through a tin ventilation duct
      barely big enough for her. The book, encased in the plastic
      bag, hangs from her teeth.

      Sounds of soldiers searching the offices come from below her.

      Up ahead she sees a point of light. With a gleeful grunt she
      shimmies faster - she's nearly made it!


151   INT. TOURISM OFFICE - CONTINUOUS                         151

      A dozen SOLDIERS and the CHIEF OF POLICE have their eyes (and
      guns) trained on the tin ventilation duct above their heads.

      It is very very obvious not only that a person is crawling
      through it, but exactly where that person is.

      The Chief of Police pointedly coughs to get her attention.


152   INT. VENTILATION DUCT                                    152

      Penelope freezes.   A beat of silence.

      The tin gives way, and she plummets...


153   INT. TOURISM OFFICE - DAY                                153

      ...hitting the ground hard, then springing to her feet and
      through some knee-jerk primal instinct kicking a nearby
      soldier in the head.

      Eleven rifles cock and aim at her.




                                                                    85
      
153   CONTINUED:                                                    153


      And that's how she's caught, frozen in a kung fu stance,
      plastic bag in her teeth.

      She locks eyes with the Chief of Police.      Lets the bag drop
      from her teeth.

      And opens her mouth to speak.


154   EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE - AFTERNOON                               154

      The hubbub has died down considerably, soldiers march away
      from the castle in formation. Bloom Stephen and the Chink
      sit watching for some sign.

      Three police cars, sirens blazing, drive down the length of
      the bridge.

                             BLOOM
                   The Chief of Police.

      As the last one passes, Bloom sees the Chief of Police riding
      shotgun, and Penelope sitting with a soldier behind caged
      mesh in the back seat.

      His face falls.

      Then Penelope spots him, points and says something.

      Very suddenly, the police car stops.

      The Chief of Police gets out.       Nods at our intrepid three.

      And opens the door for Penelope. As she climbs out he
      motions for the passing soldiers to stand at attention and
      salute her.

      He kisses her hand.

                             CHIEF OF POLICE
                       (in Czech)
                   It has been a privilege, madame, to
                   behold even briefly such a strong,
                   beautiful flower.

                             PENELOPE
                       (in Czech)
                   Thank you sir, I will not soon
                   forget your kindness.

      She blushes and smiles, then does an unhurried victory strut
      back to Bloom, Stephen and the Chink.

  

                                                                    86

      The police cars drive off.

      Penelope pulls the book out from under her jacket and sets it
      on a bench. A moment of victorious silence.

      Clapping her hands, she does a little shuffle dance of joy.

                              PENELOPE (cont'd)
                       (sings)

155   EXT. SIDEWALK BAR - LATE AFTERNOON                              155

      Bloom and Stephen sit among empty wine glasses.

      The Chink approaches, gives Stephen a hand gesture.

                             STEPHEN
                   Let her sleep. Train doesn't leave
                   till eight.

                             BLOOM
                   That was real.

                             STEPHEN
                   Yeah, I know.

                             BLOOM
                   Fuckin scary.


156   EXT. PARK - LATE AFTERNOON                                      156

      Bloom walks pensively through a green park. Cat Stevens'
      "Miles from Nowhere" plays from a nearby radio.

      His eye catches something.       A shiny red apple on a fruit
      seller's cart.

      He approaches it slowly, face flushed, breath shallow, eyeing
      the elderly vendor with a thin semblance of nonchalance.

      Holy shit.    He is going to steal that apple.

      Deftly he passes, lifting and pocketing it just as the Vendor
      turns away. Bloom has done it. His pale face tightens.


  

                                                                   87

      And turns.

      And sees a five year old boy.      Giving him a stare of infinite
      judgement.

      Bloom turns on his heel and RUNS HELL FOR LEATHER.

      The vendor shouts. The little boy chases him, pointing and
      screaming. Dogs bark. People stare. And Bloom sprints,
      apple in hand, a joyful smile forming on his lips.


157   INT. PRAGUE POLICE STATION - EVENING                         157

      Stephen bails Bloom out.

                               STEPHEN
                   An apple?

                             BLOOM
                   Yeah, but it was part of an
                   epiphany.


158   EXT. HUNGARIAN COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT                           158

      The train thunders South, towards Greece.


159   INT. TRAIN SLEEPER CAR - NIGHT                               159

      Stephen pokes his head into Penelope's car, says goodnight.

      As soon as he's gone, a foot dangles down outside the window
      and taps it. Penelope pulls it open, Bloom shimmies in with
      two mini bottles of gin.

      He kisses her.


160   INT. SHIP STATE ROOM - MORNING                               160

      Bloom holds a sleeping Penelope, watching the sun stream
      through the window and slipping the green rubber band cash
      into her suitcase.

      A low horn blows, and Bloom's face darkens.


161   EXT. THE ATLANTIC OCEAN - DAY                                161

      The good ship Fidele breaks the waves, blowing its horn.

 

                                                                 88

      Stephen stands on the deck.      Bloom joins him.

                             STEPHEN
                   Mexico.

      He strolls off, leaving Bloom watching the horizon gloomily.


162   EXT. DECK - DAY                                            162

      Our intrepid four sit around a small table (except for the
      Chink, who lies on a deck chair in a bikini and Chuck
      Taylors, sunning herself.)

                             STEPHEN
                   Oh-kay. We're rendezvousing with
                   Senor Rioso's guys here, on an
                   isolated beach just south of the
                   Mexican port town Tampico. A
                   simple handoff. Penelope and
                   Yeungling will stay with the car,
                   Bloom and I will do the handing.

                             PENELOPE
                   You guys seem a little tense.

                             STEPHEN
                   Well I'm not thrilled they set this
                   in Mexico. There could be
                   legitimate reasons, but Mexico's -
                   and I don't want to simplistically
                   vilify an entire country, but
                   Mexico's a horrible place. So
                   we'll be careful.


163   EXT. MEXICO BEACH - LATE AFTERNOON                         163

      The Chink fires an automatic pistol eight times into the dead
      center of a target pinned to a palm tree. She re-loads.


164   EXT. TAMPICO HOTEL GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS                    164

      The beach sprawling below them, Penelope and Bloom meander.

      The hotel itself feels very old, red ruinous stone.

                             PENELOPE
                   Is this going to be more dangerous
                   than I think, tomorrow?


 

                                                               89

                             BLOOM
                   Yeah. You should sleep at the
                   hotel tonight, I'll stay with
                   Stephen at the beach house. You'll
                   need sleep.

      On the distant beach, following the faint rapport of gunfire,
      a palm tree falls over.

                             PENELOPE
                   I'm really happy right now.   Are
                   you?

                             BLOOM
                   Right now I am.

      She kisses him and runs off along the cliff side, singing the
      smuggler song.

                             BLOOM (cont'd)
                   Penelope...

      But she's too far away now, and the ocean is too loud. She
      can't hear him, and he can't hear her, and in another moment
      she has vanishes into the green brush and white flowers.

      Behind Bloom's pained face, the sun dips towards the beach.


165   INT. BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT                                  165

      Stephen packs for tomorrow, Bloom stares out the black
      window, drinking. Flower in his lapel.

      Stephen picks up the con flowchart.

                             STEPHEN
                   The last box in our last con. Let
                   them begin the beguine. How's it
                   feel?

                             BLOOM
                   She's something special, Stephen.

                              STEPHEN
                   Uh huh.

                              BLOOM
                   Can I...

      He stares at his drink.


 

                                                                    90

                             BLOOM (cont'd)
                   Can I just have a little more time?
                   Just a few days. I want to keep
                   her, like this, I don't want this
                   to just end. Don't make me do
                   this.

                             STEPHEN
                   Be angry at me, you son of a bitch.
                   Don't be pathetic. Make you?
                   Jesus. I told you not to fall for
                   her-

                             BLOOM
                   I'm not gonna do this.

      Stephen comes very close to Bloom's face, looks him straight
      in the eye. Finds his answer.

                             STEPHEN
                   I don't believe you.

      He goes back to packing.


166   EXT. TAMPICO HOTEL GROUNDS - NIGHT                            166

      Bloom stands, the beach behind him, the glowing lights of the
      hotel before him. Growing determination.


167   EXT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT                                    167

      Bloom knocks on a door.       Penelope answers, in her bathrobe.

                                PENELOPE
                   Hey.

                             BLOOM
                   I know what I've gotta do. I've
                   gotta talk to you. Are you wearing
                   shoes?

                                PENELOPE
                   What's up?

      He pulls her out of the room.


168   INT. TAMPICO HOTEL GROUNDS - NIGHT                            168

      Bloom pulls Penelope by the hand, but she stops.

  

                                                                91

                   Bloom.   What?

      Deep breath.

                             BLOOM
                   My brother and I are con men. All
                   things considered, we might be the
                   most respected con man team working
                   today. And everything since you
                   hit me with your Lamborghini, all
                   of this, it's all fake. It's all a
                   con.


169   EXT. BEACH - NIGHT                                          169

      The waves break angrily on the beach. In the distance,
      Stephen finishes his drink on the beach house porch, goes
      inside and turns out the light.


170   EXT. TAMPICO HOTEL GROUNDS - NIGHT                          170

                             BLOOM
                   No, we were going to blow you off
                   tomorrow using the cackle bladder,
                   it's a, term, we have actors
                   playing the Argentina guy's men,
                   when we showed up the deal would go
                   bad, they would open fire on us,
                   Stephen and I would pretend to be
                   shot using blood packets, squibs.
                   That's - cackle bladder, in the old
                   days they put fake blood in chicken
                   bladders, so... So you'd escape
                   with the Chink, she'd send you off
                   with a little travelling money and
                   that would be that.

                              PENELOPE
                   Wow.

                             BLOOM
                   But that's not how this one's going
                   to end. I love you now, and I want
                   to get you out of this. I'm going
                   to do what I have to do to get you
                   out of this, away from all this for
                   good. Are you ready?

                                                                   92
     




171   EXT. BEACH - NIGHT                                           171

      Bloom leads Penelope down the beach by the hand.

                           BLOOM
                 Stephen's gone into town to prep
                 the Argentina actors. Your money's
                 at his place.

                           PENELOPE
                 Money? I don't want the money,
                 let's just leave.

      For a moment he's tempted.      The dark beach house looms ahead.

                              BLOOM
                 C'mon.


172   INT. BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT                                     172

      Dark. Bloom leads Penelope in, stumbles in the dark,
      switches on a lamp. Click, click - it doesn't come on.

                           STEPHEN (O.S.)
                 You have to switch it on at the
                 base.

      A beat.   Bloom does.

      Stephen sits in an easy chair, not looking happy.     But not
      angry. Much more sad than angry.

                           BLOOM
                 So I've told her our whole play.
                 And I'm here. To take her money
                 back. How's that make you feel?

                           STEPHEN
                 Disappointed.

                           BLOOM
                 This isn't the ending you wanted?

                           STEPHEN
                 It doesn't matter now. This is the
                 way it ends. So let's get it over
                 with.

                           BLOOM
                 Where's the money?

 

                                                                    93

                               STEPHEN
                   I ate it.

                             BLOOM
                   Give me the money, Stephen.

                               STEPHEN
                   No.

                             PENELOPE
                   I don't want the money.

                             BLOOM
                   He's not going to keep a single
                   piece of you.

      Stephen stands.

                             STEPHEN
                   I'm sorry you fell in love with
                   her. But she's a mark. And all of
                   this, all of it is a con. Every
                   moment you shared with her, you
                   were just playing the part of a man
                   falling in love. That's what
                   you're afraid of, right? That you
                   don't know the difference? Or
                   maybe that there is no difference.
                   That that's what love is.

                             PENELOPE
                   We're leaving.

                             STEPHEN
                       (to Bloom)
                   No. You're too scared to leave.
                   You're scared to ride off into a
                   sunset that isn't painted
                   tarpaulin, cause real sunsets are
                   beautiful but they turn into dark
                   uncertain nights. If you were
                   ready for that, you wouldn't be
                   here. The money is in my bedroom.
                   Right behind me. But in my story
                   you don't get the money or the
                   sunset or the girl.

      A long beat.       The dark bedroom doorway looms behind Stephen.

                               PENELOPE
                   Bloom.    Let's just go.   Please.

      Bloom LUNGES, cracking Stephen in the jaw.

      Stephen goes down, Bloom leaps past him - but Stephen grabs
      Bloom's leg and brings him down.

      Then they are fighting.    Penelope watches, horrified.

      A frightening, brutal brawl that tears the small beach house
      apart, thirty years worth of a fight.

      Until Stephen throws Bloom to the ground at Penelope's feet.

      Upsetting a small table. The Chink's pistol, lying on the
      holey paper target, falls and strikes the ground.

      And goes off with a deafening rapport.

      Blood spreads just beneath Stephen's collarbone.

      Penelope screams.

      Stephen stays standing for a moment, shocked. A dribble of
      blood out of the corner of his mouth. He half grins.

                          STEPHEN
                Tastes like tin foil.

      And sinks to the ground.

      Bloom's eyes glaze.    He crawls to his brother.   Takes him in
      his arms.

                             BLOOM
                I'm sorry.

      Penelope watches the brothers holding each other. Tears in
      her eyes, but she backs away a step, very conscious of not
      being a part of this moment.

      Bloom looks up at her, almost taking a moment to recognize
      her.

                             PENELOPE
                Bloom...

      He doesn't move from his brother.

                             PENELOPE (cont'd)
                I'm sorry.

      She leaves.

      For a long moment the Brothers Bloom lie in each other's arms
      in the middle of the broken room.

      Then Bloom stands, goes to the window and watches Penelope
      walking off into the distance down the beach.

      From the darkened bedroom doorway steps the Chink, her face a
      mask.

      Stephen stands.   Lifts his shirt and removes the squib and
      blood packets.

      Bloom steps outside.


173   EXT. BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT                                    173

      A wood patio with steps leading down to the sand.   Bloom
      watches Penelope, now very distant, almost gone.

      Stephen comes out, pulls out a flask.

                             STEPHEN
                Hey.
                    (nothing)
                I think that was the most honest
                conversation we've ever had.
                    (more nothing)
                You actually connected on a few of
                those punches.

                          BLOOM
                Did you expect me to do it? To
                come here tonight, end it the way
                you wrote it? Or were you really
                disappointed I didn't run off with
                her?

                           STEPHEN
                I was disappointed.    But I wasn't
                surprised.

      Bloom turns and SLUGS him in the jaw.   Stephen falls to the
      sand.

                          BLOOM
                I let you do your monologue, but
                you wanna know why I did it? I did
                it so she'd never want to see me
                again. To get her away from all
                this for good.


 

                                                               96

      Without looking back Bloom walks off down the beach, in the
      opposite direction of Penelope, leaving Stephen bleeding in
      the sand, alone in the dark uncertain night.

                                                       FADE OUT.

174   EXT. LUDICROUS MANSION - DAY                               174

      Penelope's home, bucolic on a lazy Spring day.

      At a picnic table at the far edge of the front lawn, Penelope
      sits writing with intense concentration on a piece of paper.

      After awhile she raises her head, regarding what she's
      written thoughtfully. Folds it up, puts it in her pocket.

      Clicks the seemingly innocent ballpoint pen.

      BEEP.

      The mansion EXPLODES, completely.

      She walks away without looking back.

      After a beat, the plaster deer explodes in a ridiculous
      fireball.


175   EXT. ITALIAN COUNTRYSIDE - DAY                             175

      Green hills surround the walled medieval city of Ferentino.
      A tiny white car inches its way across the countryside, and
      up into the city.


176   EXT. FERENTINO APARTMENT - DAY                             176

      Bloom walks up the stone alley to his apartment, a bag of
      groceries in hand. He spots the white car parked out front.

      Loud shouting in Italian grows louder, until Penelope and the
      Grandmother burst out the front door. Berating each other
      with Italian curses and hand gestures.

      Penelope sees Bloom, and freezes.

                            PENELOPE
                   Hello.




                                                                97

                                BLOOM
                   Hey.

      The Grandmother keeps up her barrage as she takes the
      groceries from Bloom, but as soon as she's behind Penelope's
      back she gives Bloom a wink, points to her and gives a thumbs-
      up of approval.


177   EXT. FERENTINO STREETS - DAY                              177

      Bloom and Penelope wander the twisty alleyways of the city.

                             BLOOM
                   How did you find me?

                                PENELOPE
                   The Chink.

                             BLOOM
                   How did you find the Chink?

                             PENELOPE
                   She gave me her cell when we got to
                   Mexico.

                             BLOOM
                   I didn't even know she had one.

                             PENELOPE
                   I think she's kind of selective in
                   who she gives the number to.


178   EXT. FERENTINO CAFE - LATER                               178

      They sit with wine and bread.

                             BLOOM
                   Why are you here, Penelope?

                             PENELOPE
                   Why did you decide to stay with
                   your brother instead of coming with
                   me in Mexico?

                             BLOOM
                   Everything Stephen said that night
                   was true.






                                                                   98

                             PENELOPE
                   I've been doing a lot of thinking
                   the past three months. I want you
                   to consider something.

      She takes a piece of paper from her pocket, unfolds it and
      slides it across the table to him.

      On it, written over and over in a dozen different stylized
      fonts, is "PENELOPE THE CON ARTIST."

      Bloom sets the paper down with a snap.

                             BLOOM
                   Go away. Everything Stephen said
                   was true. I was just playing you
                   as a mark. Everything between us,
                   none of it was real.

      She leans in close to him, her hand on his leg.

                             PENELOPE
                   I don't believe you.

      It's obvious even before she kisses him that she's right.


179   EXT. FERENTINO STREETS - DAY                                  179

      Bloom dials a pay phone.    He's been crying.    It rings.

                             BLOOM
                   Pick up... c'mon...


180   INT. MONTE CARLO CASINO - CONTINUOUS                          180

      Lush, Edwardian. In a private room, a card table is
      overturned. Stephen lies on the ground in a defensive
      posture, a RAVISHING WOMAN in red lunging at him with a
      curved dagger. A BEARDED MAN with an eyepatch holds her back
      by the wrists, while a MONOCLED MAN in an antique wheelchair
      holds his tear stained face in his hands.

      This whole scene is frozen like a tableau, as Stephen's cell
      phone chirps away.

      Annoyed, the Bearded Man gives him a `go ahead' nod.

      Stephen hastily answers it.



   

                                                                99

                   How quickly can you get to
                   Ferentino?

                             STEPHEN (ON PHONE)
                   Uh... Nine-ish?

      Bloom fishes out his pocket watch.

                              BLOOM
                   Alright.

      Click. As he's putting his pocket watch back, he finds the
      stack of green rubber band money in his breast pocket.


182   INT. FERENTINO APARTMENT - NIGHT                           182

      Penelope plays cards with the Grandmother.


183   EXT. FERENTINO APARTMENT - NIGHT                           183

      Stephen and Bloom sit on the little landing outside the
      apartment.

                             STEPHEN
                   So she comes back wanting to work
                   with us. Honestly? I think we'd
                   be lucky to have her. If you
                   called me to hear my opinion on the
                   matter. Which I'm getting the
                   feeling you didn't.

                             BLOOM
                   I did what I did in Mexico to get
                   her out of all this. I would rather
                   die than bring her into the con.

                             STEPHEN
                   So maybe you want to tell me what
                   I'm doing in Ferentino.






                                                                 100

                   You knew she'd come back. What did
                   you figure she was good for,
                   another million?

                             STEPHEN
                   One point seven five.

                             BLOOM
                   We will play her again, one last
                   con, but not for money. I'm gonna
                   tell you how this one's gonna end.
                   You built us into this, you're
                   gonna fly us out, end it so she's
                   done with all of us. End it all so
                   it can't start up again.

                             STEPHEN
                   You want me to plan a con whose
                   sole purpose is to blow her off for
                   good?

                             BLOOM
                   I love her. You owe me this. I
                   don't want to turn her into me.

      Penelope sleeps on a cot against the window.

      Bloom enters wearily.    Sits in a chair.   Watches her.

      In the next room over, Stephen sits in the dark.    Shuffling
      cards.

      A lovely tune sung in Mandarin Chinese plays over this,
      segueing us into...

      TITLE CARD - Shanghai

      A wall of monitors, which the Chink steps in front of,
      singing the climax of the song. Beautiful and sad.

      As the song ends, she sees through the spotlight Penelope,
      Bloom and Stephen at a table. Penelope waves.

      disappointment.

                   So what's the next job?

                             STEPHEN
                   Before we do the next job, we need
                   to liquidate our assets from the
                   last job.

                             PENELOPE
                   But you've got-

                             STEPHEN
                   Your money from the last job, well
                   that's profit, not capital, the
                   three of us have already split it
                   up. So step one: sell the book of
                   hours.

                             PENELOPE
                   I thought it was fake.

                             STEPHEN
                   With all your random expertise we
                   couldn't risk a flat out fake. It
                   isn't worth two point five million,
                   we could maybe catch four hundred
                   grand for it, but it's real. Who'd
                   we buy it from?

                              BLOOM
                   Minskie.

                             STEPHEN
                   Perfect, we'll sell it right back
                   to him.

      The Chink hands him a piece of paper.

                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   If he wasn't dead.

                             BLOOM
                   Well there's Demarco or Boyer. Or
                   Roche, if we want to go state-side.



                                                                  102

                   All traceable. With Minskie out
                   we'd have to go deep black market
                   if we wanted to be a hundred
                   percent clear. There's only one
                   place that's deep enough for that.

      Bloom and the Chink know exactly what he's talking about, and
      they don't look happy.

                   Where?

                   Russia. It's like `cancer', I
                   don't even like saying the word.

      Bloom, Stephen and the Chink drink in a cramped little
      concrete room adjacent to the bar's kitchen.

                             STEPHEN
                   We're obviously not going to deal
                   with real Russians. They'll be our
                   guys in a phony set up, they'll
                   take our phony book and give her
                   phony cash, a closed loop. Safe
                   and simple.

      Bloom looks to the Chink for an opinion.      Gets a blank face.

                              STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   So.   We go to St. Petersburg.

      At the mention of St. Petersburg Bloom looks sharply at
      Stephen, but Stephen presses on.

                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   She does the hand-off with our fake
                   "Russians." But while we're
                   driving out of town, everything
                   goes bad.

      He lays a simple flowchart, drawn on a napkin - three boxes.
      He points to the first, "Penelope sells book to `Russians'"

                   counterfeit book in the first
                   place, which we've now sold to
                   Russian smugglers. We discover
                   this when the Russian mob starts
                   taking us out one by one. Oh shit.

      He points to the second box, "Red Dawn."

                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   First they ambush our car,
                   destroying the money. Then they
                   take me out, then the Chink, and
                   finally you Bloom, in a heroic
                   death that allows Penelope to
                   barely escape with her life.
                   Devastated but reborn with the
                   knowledge that you loved her so
                   much you died so she could live,
                   she drives off into a romantic life
                   of adventure and peril, on the run
                   from imaginary Russians.

      He points to the third box, "The End."

                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   What do you think?

                                                          CUT TO:


188   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - SUNSET                                 188

      The blood red sun sets over the city.


189   INT. ST. PETERSBURG HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                       189

      Penelope snores on the bed, while our intrepid three unpack.

      The phone rings.    Stephen answers it, listens, hangs up.

                             STEPHEN
                   Our "Russians" have arrived.


190   INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT                                        190

      Stephen, Bloom and the Chink ride down to the lobby with a
      red suitcase.


 

                                                                104

                             BLOOM
                   Who'd you get, anyway?

                              STEPHEN
                   Hm?

                             BLOOM
                   To play the "Russians?"

      DING.

      The elevator doors open, revealing the Diamond Dog.

                              DIAMOND DOG
                   My boys.


191   INT. HOTEL BAR - LATER                                     191

      Empty. The Dog leans against the bar with several LACKEYS,
      waiting patiently, making sparks with his gold lighter.
      Sounds of shouting come from the adjoining dining area.


192   INT. HOTEL DINING ROOM                                     192

                             BLOOM
                   I don't understand. Tell me so I
                   understand. Three months ago you
                   were ready to blind the old bastard-

                             STEPHEN
                   We need someone who can pass for
                   the Russian mob to buy our fake
                   book. The Dog's got his big store
                   right here in St. Petersburg.

                             BLOOM
                   Alright, fuckin stop. You want
                   this to finish in St. Petersburg,
                   you want this to end with the Dog
                   for some what thematic something?
                   Fine but don't tell it like a
                   story, let's say it. Twenty three
                   years ago and I can still smell,
                   that blood red apartment of his,
                   the smell of that place. I hate
                   him Stephen but this isn't that,
                   this is I don't trust him.




 

                                                                  105

                              STEPHEN
                   What's he gonna do? Steal our fake
                   money?
                       (beat)
                   I've thought this one out, believe
                   me. And we can't end it without
                   him. Trust me. It's gonna be ok.


193   INT. HOTEL BAR - LATER                                       193

      The red leather suitcase on the bar.

                             DIAMOND DOG
                   Stephen, still the grand architect
                   with your symbols. Red for
                   temptation, white for salvation.

      The Dog opens it, revealing US hundreds.      Examines it with a
      loupe.

                             DIAMOND DOG (cont'd)
                   Impressive, boys.

                             BLOOM
                   It's trash. There's visible cross
                   hatching in Franklin's eye.

      Sure enough - obvious jagged misprints cut into Ben
      Franklin's eye on the bills.

                             DIAMOND DOG
                   Hm.  I'll be damned.
                       (closes case)
                   Ruskies wouldn't be caught dead
                   handing over a rag bag like this,
                   it should be a steel attache.

                               STEPHEN
                   This'll   do. We'll do the drop off
                   at your   store. Make it scary,
                   think a   movie version of the
                   Russian   mafia, but don't hassle
                   her.

                               DIAMOND DOG
                   Alright.

      The Dog closes the case, and for a moment Bloom's eyes rest
      on his bandaged hand.

      He then takes the case and quickly moves off with his crew.

 

                                                                  106

                   I look forward to meeting the lady.
                   Take care, boys.

      Leaving his gold lighter on the bar.


194   INT. HOTEL CAR PORT - NIGHT                                  194

      The Chink leads Stephen and Bloom around the brown Peugeot.

                             STEPHEN
                   So. Our fake Russian attack. One
                   small charge will simulate a bullet
                   hit, and blow out the back window.

      The Chink points with an extendable pointer to a small nub on
      the rear windshield.

                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   So that one bang, then we roll off
                   the road. Once we get clear of the
                   car the Chink sets off the final
                   charge, incinerating the car and
                   the money in the trunk. This'll
                   all happen exactly twenty seconds
                   after we cross the main bridge out
                   of town. After the bridge.

      Stephen makes a note in a manila envelope, tucks it in his
      jacket.

                             BLOOM
                   Ok.


195   INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - LATER                                   195

      Bloom and the Chink walk back to their rooms.      The Chink is
      expressionless.

                             BLOOM
                   You've been awful quiet.

      She doesn't react.

                             BLOOM (cont'd)
                   I'm doing this for her.

      But a door clicks shut, and Bloom is alone in the hall.

                                                                   107
      




196   INT. PENELOPE'S HOTEL ROOM                                    196

      Penelope in bed. Her door cracks open, and she sleepily
      looks up. Bloom stands silhouetted in the doorway.

                          PENELOPE
                Tomorrow it all starts.

      She lifts the sheets. He gets into bed, and as she drifts
      into peaceful slumber Bloom is very conscious of holding her
      for the last time.

      When her snores begin, he has ear plugs ready.


197   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - SUNRISE                                 197

      The Peugeot drives into the heart of the city.


198   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG ALLEY - DAY                               198

      Bloom, Stephen and the Chink parked in an alley, watching a
      doorway across the street with a pair of binoculars.

      Bloom breathes uneasily, checks his watch.

                          BLOOM
                She gives the Dog the book, he
                gives her the fake money. This is
                taking too long.

      Just then Penelope trots out.    Metal attache case in hand.


199   EXT. RUSSIA HIGHWAY - MORNING                                 199

      On the outskirts of town, parked beside a murky little lake.
      Our heroes gather around the metal attache case on the hood.

                          PENELOPE
                He hassled me. Took forever
                looking the book over, haggled the
                price. Wanted to pay me in Rubles.

      Stephen smirks, then opens it.    The money's there.

                           STEPHEN
                Alright.   Let's get the hell out of
                Russia.


  

                                                                 108
    
199   CONTINUED:                                                  199


      Bloom pulls the Dog's gold lighter from his pocket, takes one
      last glance at St. Petersburg and tosses it down into the
      lake.


200   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG HIGHWAY - MORNING                       200

      The brown Peugeot drives towards the climbing sun.


201   INT. PEUGEOT                                                201

      The Chink drives, Stephen rides shotgun.

      Bloom and Penelope in the back seat.    He looks weary.

      He sees the bridge approaching, maybe a half mile ahead.

      She pulls his head down into her lap, fingers in his hair.
      He breathes, closes his eyes.

      An explosion shatters the front passenger window.

      Bloom's eyes snap open, he bolts upright.

      The bridge is still a quarter mile away.

      In the next moment the car becomes a din of breaking glass,
      screams, tires screeching.


202   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG HIGHWAY                                 202

      A BLACK MERCEDES roars out on to the road, machine gun fire
      blazing from its windows, literally shredding the Peugeot.

      The car spins, tires flapping, and hits a highway embankment
      full speed, launching into the air.


203   INT. PEUGEOT                                                203

      A moment of strange silence as the car flips mid-air.     The
      brothers lock eyes for a split second.


204   EXT. FOREST BESIDE ST. PETERSBURG HIGHWAY                   204

      The car slams into the steep grassy embankment, manages to
      flip upright, and rolls into a thick forest, coming to an
      abrupt stop against a stout tree.




                                                                   109
      
204   CONTINUED:                                                    204


                             STEPHEN
                   OUT!

      They all four dive out of the car, Bloom shoving Penelope,
      tumbling into the thick forest an instant before the car
      becomes a roiling ball of flame.

      Bloom lies shell-shocked, his vision blurry. He vaguely sees
      Penelope passed out beside him, Stephen on the other side of
      the car.

      A DARK FIGURE comes trotting into the woods, shining a
      flashlight on the charred car. Goes to Stephen. Reaches
      down to him...

      Bloom's mind flutters away into darkness.


205   INT. FOREST - DAY                                                205

      Bloom wakes. Rain splattering.       Slumped against a tree.
      Penelope hunches over him.

                             BLOOM
                   What happened?

                             PENELOPE
                   Are you alright?

                             BLOOM
                   What happened?

                             PENELOPE
                   Yeungling went to get another car.

                             BLOOM
                   Where's Stephen?

                             PENELOPE
                   We don't know. He was gone.

      Bloom stands shakily, goes to the charred car.      Runs his
      fingers over the dozens of bullet holes.

      Goes to where Stephen fell.       Lying in the grass, a manila
      envelope.

                             PENELOPE (cont'd)
                   We're going to find him. If he
                   escaped, he'll contact us. If
                   they've got him, it's for ransom.


  

                                                                110

                             BLOOM
                   Who's got him?

                             PENELOPE
                   The Russians.

      The Chink pulls up in the green bug, headlights catching
      Bloom's face against the dark forest depths.


206   EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY                                     206

      A desolate gas station parking lot. Bloom sits in the Bug,
      loading his revolver with shaky fingers. Penelope stands
      outside.

                             BLOOM
                   Stephen, god please what's
                   happening. I don't know what to
                   do. I don't know Stephen please.
                   Please. What's happening. Please.

      A long black sedan screeches to a halt in the parking lot
      outside the window, Bloom bolts out of the car, pistol ready.

      But the Chink climbs out of the black sedan.

                             PENELOPE
                   Where does she get all these cars?

      Bloom motions for Penelope to stay back, then goes to meet
      the Chink in the middle of the parking lot.

                             BLOOM
                   If you know what's happening, now
                   would be a really good time to
                   speak up.

      She sets a suitcase down beside her.    Bloom takes this in.

                             BLOOM (cont'd)
                   No, please. Not now. I need your
                   help here now, I don't know what to
                   do.

      The slightest smile communicates all the compassion in the
      world. But she's leaving.

      She hands him a small slip of paper, their fingers touching
      for an instant.



 

                                                                    111

      She gives Penelope a quick little "call me" gesture, picks up
      her case and walks off.

      A truck blocking our view of her car pulls away, and she gets
      in.

      Bloom looks down at the slip of paper.        A short phrase, in
      Chinese.

                               BLOOM (cont'd)
                   Thanks.

      The engine turns over, and the Chink's car EXPLODES in a
      dramatic fireball.

      The paper flutters out of Blooms's fingers a moment before he
      and Penelope are thrown to the pavement by the shock wave.

      Bloom and Penelope lift their heads, absorbing what just
      happened.


207   EXT. CHICAGO - DAY                                             207

      A busy street, which a title card identifies as "Chicago,
      Illinois."

      On the corner, an unassuming Chinese restaurant.


208   INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - DAY                                  208

      A dive.   The chef on the phone.

                             CHEF
                   Ah, ah yes, Mr. Bloom.      Yes, ok.

                               ALL THE COOKS
                   Blooooom!

      He puts the phone down and goes to the fax machine, which is
      spitting out a facsimile of the Chink's slip of paper.


209   INT. ST. PETERSBURG COPY SHOP - EARLY MORNING                  209

      Bloom on a pay phone, scribbling on a piece of paper.




   

                                                               112

                             BLOOM
                   Uh huh. Assholes. Ok. Um, ok.
                   So I've got "We are all assholes in
                   our own theatrical enterprises."
                   You sure?

      This phrase, written on Bloom's paper.

                             CHEF
                   And then it end with "Goodbye shit
                   head."

                                BLOOM
                   Shit head?

                             CHEF
                   But it is different meaning in
                   Mandarin, uh, endearing. "Shit
                   head" if you have affection for
                   shit.


210   EXT. SIDEWALK - MOMENTS LATER                             210

      The Bug parked nearby. Penelope sits on the curb, crying.
      Bloom sits next to her.

                             PENELOPE
                   What did it mean?

                             BLOOM
                   I don't know.

                             PENELOPE
                   What did it say?

                             BLOOM
                   "We're all of us marks in our own
                   cons." And she said goodbye.

                             PENELOPE
                   I still can't believe it.

                             BLOOM
                   That the Chink fell for a car bomb?
                   Neither can I.

                             PENELOPE
                       (hopeful)
                   What? Oh, oh god do you think she
                   faked it? So the Russians would
                   think she was dead?



                                                                   113

      Bloom stands, paces away. He leafs limply through the manila
      folder - addresses, pictures, information...

      A paper with the Dog's photo clipped to it.       An address in
      St. Petersburg.

      The napkin Stephen wrote the con flowchart on.      The third box
      - "The End."

                             PENELOPE (cont'd)
                   What do we do now?

      Scrawled on the inside of the manila envelope - "An unwritten
      life." Bloom's face clears. He wipes his eyes.

                             BLOOM
                   Ok.

      Bloom goes to the Bug.

                             PENELOPE
                   Where are you going?

                             BLOOM
                   This wasn't Russians. This was
                   done by an old mentor of ours who
                   wants us off the map. He has an
                   apartment in St. Petersburg. So
                   this is, yeah. I've gotta go back
                   to that apartment to face the Dog
                   and get my brother back. That's
                   how I'm gonna end this.

      Penelope's eyes gleam. She jumps up to the passenger door,
      and Bloom stops her with a weary look.

                             PENELOPE
                   We can skip the whole you-sending-
                   me-nobly-away-and-me-refusing-to-

                             BLOOM
                   Thank Christ.


211   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG STREET - LATE MORNING                     211

      A narrow alley between tall apartments.    Bloom parks, pulls
      his gun and checks it.




  

                                                                     114

                   If there are shots you run to the
                   car and drive, with or without me.


212   INT. APARTMENT ENTRYWAY - DAY                                   212

      A badly lit apartment hallway.       Bloom approaches a door,
      Penelope behind him.

      His breathing becomes hard.        His face contorts.   He crumples
      next to the door.

                             PENELOPE
                   What's in there? Tell me who this
                   guy is.

      Bloom's breathing steadies.

                             BLOOM
                   He's just an old man.

      He tries the knob.     It opens.


213   INT. DIAMOND DOG'S APARTMENT - D                                213

      Blood red walls.

      Dark, neglected and to all appearances empty.       Bloom creeps
      down the darkened corridor, gun outstretched.       Breathes
      through his nose, chokes.

                              BLOOM
                   Dog!   I came back.

      He kicks open a door, revealing a large living space.         Empty.

      He lowers his gun, switches on the light.

      Penelope enters.     Sniffs the air.

                             PENELOPE
                   Moth balls.

      Bloom almost laughs.

                             BLOOM
                   Is that what that smell is?

      BAM! A closet door smacks open, revealing the business end
      of a double barrel shotgun.

    

                                                                   115

      Bloom spins, gun drawn.      Penelope screams.

      Then a moment of stillness.       The shotgun barrel quivers.

      It's held by the 11 year old boy Bloom saw in the Dog's
      Mercedes in Prague. Malnourished and scared.

      Penelope approaches him slowly.

                             PENELOPE
                       (in Russian)
                   It's okay. Honey, it's alright.

      The shotgun sinks to the ground.      Penelope strokes his hair
      back from his face.

      Bloom lowers the gun, trembling.

                             BLOOM
                   Ask him if anyone else is here.

      She does.

                             BOY
                   Nyet.

                             BLOOM
                   Ask him where the Diamond Dog is.

                             PENELOPE
                   Diamond Dog?
                       (in Russian)
                   Where is the Diamond Dog?

                             BOY
                       (in English)
                   The Dog of Diamonds is gone.

      Bloom does a quick search of the rest of the room. As he
      does Penelope asks the boy one more question in Russian, and
      gets a quick answer.

                             BLOOM
                   Get the car started.

                             PENELOPE
                   What about him?

                             BLOOM
                   It's alright.



  

                                                               116

      She believes him, and goes.   Bloom kneels in front of the
      boy.

                          BLOOM (cont'd)
                You don't need to be afraid of him
                anymore. Or angry at him. Or ever
                come back here again. He doesn't
                concern you anymore. Understand?
                It's gonna be ok.

      The boy nods. Bloom hands him the stack of bills wrapped in
      the green rubber band. The boy snatches it and runs off.


214   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG STREET - DAY                             214

      Bloom trots out of the apartment building, and sees two
      things: Penelope working the VW's starter, and a black
      Mercedes speeding down the narrow street towards her.

      He sprints towards her, screaming

                           BLOOM
                Get out!   Get out of the car!!

      She sees the approaching Merc, too late, and ducks down.

      A hand hurls something from the darkened window. It smashes
      through the Bug's passenger side window, showering Penelope
      with glass.

      The Mercedes roars off down the street.

      Bloom reaches the Bug and throws the door open.

      Penelope lies covered in safety glass, holding a Russian
      nesting doll.


215   INT. BUG - LATER                                             215

      The seven progressively smaller dolls lie open on the back
      seat, Bloom holds the two halves of the final tiny doll, and
      Penelope holds a note.

                          PENELOPE
                It's a ransom note. It says they
                have Stephen, it says they want the
                money wired to a specific account,
                they give a bank to do it at and a
                manager to ask for.

                             PENELOPE
                   It's a lot.

      A cold pit opens in Bloom's stomach.

                   Oh.   Oh oh. No no NO.

      Bloom sits in the car, alone. He punches the dashboard
      again, helpless enraged and scared.

      Penelope gets in, looks at the address on the note.

217   EXT. BURNED OUT THEATER - DAY                               217

      Penelope and Bloom sit in the car, parked in front of the
      impressive facade of a closed, burned out old theater.

      The clock on the dashboard reads 1:50.

                           BLOOM
                I'm so scared. Anything I can
                imagine finding in there, I'm
                scared of.

                          PENELOPE
                I'm going to be here when you come
                out.

      She kisses him.

      He puts his hand on the door.    Hesitates.   Then goes.

      Walks up the stairs to the inky maw of the theater door.
      Goes in alone.

                                                               119
  




218   INT. THEATER LOBBY                                            218

      No lights. Moldy dust. A genuinely creepy place.      Bloom
      steps lightly, deeper into the theater.

                           BLOOM
                Stephen!


219   INT. THEATER AUDITORIUM                                       219

      A few lights flicker on the walls, fitfully illuminating the
      broken dusty seats and bare ruined stage.

      Bloom walks down the aisle, trying to keep his voice steady.

                           BLOOM
                Stephen!

      A spotlight snaps on from the mezzanine, right in Bloom's
      face. He spins, trapped in its glare.

      A guttural command is shouted in what might be Russian.

      When Bloom doesn't respond, the spot silently advances a few
      feet ahead of him towards the stage.

      Bloom gingerly follows it, up onto the splintered stage and
      finally resting on a split in the tarpaulin backdrop.

      With a wary glance back, Bloom steps through it.


220   INT. THEATER BACKSTAGE                                        220

      Giant fossils of antique stage scenery. Utility lights high
      above, cut by scaffolding, patch everything in dim jagged
      forms of light and black.

                          BLOOM
                    (unsteady)
                Stephen. Game's up. Come on out.
                Let's blow this one hat town.

      Silence. Then a harsh utility lamp snaps on, cruelly
      lighting Stephen's face.

      Shockingly bruised and battered, old and new blood.

      Bloom cries and rushes towards him...




                                                                120
   
220   CONTINUED:                                                 220


                              STEPHEN
                   No!   No Bloom, freeze.

      He obeys. Stephen is tied to a chair. A dark figure behind
      him holds the lamp with a black gloved hand.

                             BLOOM
                   Stephen, who is it?   Is it the Dog?

                             STEPHEN
                   Did Penelope wire the money?

                              BLOOM
                   Yeah.

                             STEPHEN
                   They're calling to check right now.
                   Don't move. I'm alright.

      The dark figure's cell phone rings, he holds it to his ear
      for a moment then flips it closed.

      Something happens in the blackness, and Stephen shakily
      stands, cut loose.

                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   Stay where you are, Bloom. I'm
                   coming to you.

      He takes a couple wobbly steps.

      Behind him, Bloom sees the dark figure raising his gun
      towards Stephen's back, pulling the hammer...

      And the utility lamp switches off.

                              BLOOM
                   No!

      Bloom's revolver pops out of his sleeve and he's firing into
      the blackness.

      Stephen drops flat to the ground.

      The fiery rapport of a big pistol flashes from the blackness,
      strobing the scene like stage lightning.

      Bloom reloads behind the cover of a heavy flat, but Stephen
      lies on his stomach out in the open.

                              BLOOM (cont'd)
                   Stephen!



                                                                 121
    
220   CONTINUED: (2)                                              220


                              STEPHEN
                 Stay back!

      But Bloom makes a dash for his brother, out into the open,
      unloading three more rounds into the dark.

      The dark figure returns fire on Bloom, who is sprinting full
      on his feet in a large pool of light. A sitting duck.

      Stephen launches himself up, tackling Bloom backwards.

      Just before they fall behind the safety of the flat, a red
      burst of blood flowers from Stephen's left lower back.

      Bloom sets him down gently, and hears heavy footsteps behind
      him.

      He turns, firing, but only sees a blur of dark coat go by,
      through the torn backdrop.

      Bloom runs out on stage, tearing the tarpaulin, and fires
      after the dark figure limping up the aisle and away into the
      lobby.

      Silence.

      Bloom walks back to Stephen, who lies behind the flat,
      breathing heavy. Blood soaking through his shirt.

                           BLOOM
                 Please tell me this is all gonna be
                 ok. Tell me that's a squib, and
                 that's makeup, and that you just
                 gave me what I always wanted and
                 pulled off the perfect con.

      A long, long moment.

      Stephen coughs, spits.     Then a wry grin spreads across his
      face.

                           STEPHEN
                 You said it, not me.

      He stands, the shakiness gone.

                           STEPHEN (cont'd)
                 Can I get a `wow' for this one?

                           BLOOM
                 You son of a bitch.




                                                               122

      Bloom looks like he might hit him, but his face breaks and he
      embraces him, crying. The Brothers Bloom stay like that for
      a long while, holding each other in the spotlight's glow.

      Finally Stephen pulls away, tears in his eyes.   He wipes
      them, wipes blood from his lip.

                          STEPHEN
                Tastes like tin foil. Alright
                here's what I want you to do. The
                Chink split?

                           BLOOM
                Yeah.   Clean exit.

                            STEPHEN
                How?

                            BLOOM
                Car bomb.

      A hint of relief in Stephen's face.

                          STEPHEN
                Good. Here's what. Take Penelope
                back to Helsinki, take that flight
                to Rio. Lay low like we said.
                Play out the on-the-run-from-
                vengeful-Russians thing, that'll be
                fun for her. Play it like I'm
                dead, actually - that'll add some
                gravity to everything, that'll be
                nice. And I'll see you when I see
                you.

                            BLOOM
                Soon?

                          STEPHEN
                I hope not. Last thing you need is
                me hanging around. Anyway, how
                could I top this?

      Bloom hugs him again.

                          BLOOM
                I love you. Bye.

      He turns to go.

                            STEPHEN
                Hey.    Think of any card.



                                                               123

      Stephen pulls out a pack of cards.

                              BLOOM
                 Alright.

      Stephen cuts, to the Queen of hearts.

                           BLOOM (cont'd)
                 Stephen. That's it.
                     (grins)
                 That's the best card trick I've
                 ever seen. I just wish you had a
                 bigger audience.

                           STEPHEN
                 You're the only audience I've ever
                 needed.

      Wink.   Bloom leaves.

      Stephen watches him go.


221   EXT. RUSSIA HIGHWAY - LATE AFTERNOON                      221

      Rumbling towards Finland.

      In the Bug, Bloom sleeps in Penelope's arm while she drives.

      She looks at his hand on hers, his shirt cuff bright red with
      Stephen's "blood." She strokes his shoulder sadly.

      Off Bloom's sleeping face...


222   INT. THEATER STAGE                                        222

      Stephen pulls a chair out onto the stage, sets it right in
      the spotlight's glare.

      Trembling as if it takes all his last strength in the world.

      Sits.   Looks at the Queen of Hearts, moves his fingers over
      it.

      Then slides is up his sleeve.

      Blood trickles down his hand.

                                                                  124
     




223   INT. BUG - SUNSET                                            223

      Bloom wakes with a start.

                            PENELOPE
                  Hey. Hey, it's ok. The bridge is
                  coming up, we're almost at the
                  border. Were you dreaming about
                  Stephen?

      She strokes his hair back from his face.

      He nods, and looks down at his sleeve.

      Stephen's "blood" on his white cuff.

      Now a dark shade of brown.

      Bloom looks at this shirt.      All the blood, it's all brown.

      He looks up at the road, nearly panicked.

      Maybe a quarter mile ahead is the bridge.

                               BLOOM
                  Pull over.     Pull over!!

      She does.

      He bursts out of the car, and run/tumbles down the grassy
      hillside till he finds the car tracks.

      He follows them to the charred remains of the Peugeot.

      Penelope stumbles down after him.

                            PENELOPE
                  What is it? You're scaring me-

                            BLOOM
                  What did you ask the Russian kid,
                  in the Dog's apartment? He said
                  the Dog isn't here, then what did
                  you ask?

      Bloom kicks open the trunk.      Pries open the blistered attache
      case.


 

                                                                125

      Sifts through the charred pile of cinders that was the money
      from the "Russians" till he finds what he was looking for and
      brings it out into the dying light.

                             PENELOPE
                   How long had he been alone.

                             BLOOM
                   And what did he say?

      A scrap of unburned money.    A fragment of Ben Franklin's
      face.

                             PENELOPE
                   Since yesterday morning.

      A single eye gazing up at him, the green grass behind it.

      The eye is perfect.    No cross hatching.

      Bloom sinks to his knees.

                             BLOOM
                   This is real. They hassled you.

                             PENELOPE
                   Bloom-

                             BLOOM
                   The Dog was gone before we got
                   there. They hadn't cleared out of
                   their apartment, they had been
                   cleared out.


225   INT. DIAMOND DOG'S APARTMENT - DAY FLASHBACK                 225

      RUSSIANS in black overcoats burst in, shooting the Dog's men
      with silenced pistols.

      The BOY shuts himself in the closet, terrified.


226   EXT. ROADSIDE - SUNSET                                       226

                   Real Russians. Took his store.
                   They didn't know about his deal
                   with us, but you haggled with them.
                   You really sold the book to real
                   Russians. The Diamond Dog was
                   gone.

      in the attache case.

                          STEPHEN
                Let's get the hell out of Russia.

      Bloom tosses the gold lighter, it splashes into the lake.    We
      follow it, plunging beneath the surface.

      Deep deep down, among weak tendrils of light, the Diamond Dog
      sinks into watery blackness, a long blade in his neck.


228   EXT. ROADSIDE - SUNSET                                      228

                And they came after us.   And
                Stephen...

      Penelope holds him tight.

                             PENELOPE
                I know.

                          BLOOM
                Stephen saved my life.

                             PENELOPE
                I know.

                             BLOOM
                He's gone.

      Bloom folds into Penelope's arms, but she doesn't let him.
      She holds his crying face up.

                          PENELOPE
                And he did it so you could live.
                Your brother loved you. He loved
                you so much. Look at me. Stephen
                said something once, I got the
                feeling he'd rather be telling it
                to you. He said there's no such
                thing as an unwritten life. Just
                badly written ones. I love you.

                   Russian mafia, and we're gonna hide

                   like we're telling the best fucking
                   story in the world. Are you ready?

      She holds his face close to hers for a long beat. Then
      smiles and pushes away, launching up the grassy hill.

      Bloom watches her.

      Time slows as she turns back towards him, still running, and
      holds out her hand for him to follow.

                             BLOOM (V.O.)
                   I was thinking of something Stephen
                   said too. "The perfect con is one
                   where everyone involved gets just
                   the thing they wanted." Well.

      He takes the girl's hand, and runs with her towards the point
      of light breaking over the hill.


229   EXT. HIGHWAY - SUNSET                                      229

      Sunset with her wine-red fingers falls over the road ahead.
      The rumbly old VW chugs away from us, towards the horizon.

    FADE IN


1   EXT. EASTERN SEABOARD - AERIALS - DAY                           1

    High in the air----so high we an see the curvature of the
    earth. The eastern seaboard stretches away, flecked with
    clouds.

    As we dissolve in closer the picture bleaches of color.   We
    are looking down at the city of Washington, D.C.

    Dissolve closer still: a black-and-white aerial photograph of
    a neighborhood in suburban D.C. dominated by a sprawling
    building. Computer type quickly bleeps on:

                  C.I.A. Headquarters
                   Langley, Virginia


2   INT. CIA - HALLWAY - DAY                                        2

    We track at floor level, following the well shined shoes of
    someone walking down the well polished hallway.


3   INT. PALMER'S OFFICE - DAY                                      3

    We hear a door opening and a silver-haired man rises behind
    his desk. A nameplate on the desk identifies him as Palmer
    DeBakey Smith.

                          PALMER
              Ozzie.    Sit down.

    Osbourne Cox, entering, is a middle-aged man in a striped
    shirt and bow tie.

                         OSBOURNE
              Palmer.   What's up.

                        PALMER
              You know Peck, and Olson.

    The two men, sitting on chairs facing the desk, nod at
    Osbourne, who is surprised to see them.

                        OSBOURNE
              Peck, yes, hiya. Olson, by
              reputation. Hi, Osbourne Cox.

                        OLSON
              Yeah, hiyah.

                                                       2.


                    OSBOURNE
          Aren't you with...aren't you,
          uh...

Palmer jumps in:

                    PALMER
          Yeah, that's right. Oz, look.
          There's no easy way to say this.
          We're taking you off the Balkans desk.

                      OSBOURNE
          You're----what? Why?

                    PALMER
          In fact we're moving you out of Sigint
          entirely.

                      OSBOURNE
          ...What?    No discussion, just----you're
          out?

                    PALMER
          Well, we're having the discussion now
          Oz. This doesn't have to be
          unpleasant.

                    OSBOURNE
          Palmer, with all due respect----what the
          fuck are you talking about?

A beat.

                    OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
          ... And why is Olson here?

Another uncomfortable beat.

                    PALMER
          ... Look, Ozzie----

                    OSBOURNE
          What the fuck is this?!     Is it my----I
          know it's not my work.

                      PALMER
          Ozzie----

                    OSBOURNE
          I'm a great fucking analyst!     Is it----

                    PALMER
          Oz, things are not going well.      As you
          know.

                                                        3.


                       PECK
             You have a drinking problem.

Stunned silence.         Ozzie turns to look at Peck.

At length:

                       OSBOURNE
             I have a drinking problem.

                       PALMER
             This doesn't have to be unpleasant.
             We found you something in State. It's
             a, uh...

He gropes, uncomfortable.

                       PALMER (CONT'D)
             ... It's a lower clearance level.
             Yes. But we're not, this isn't, we're
             not terminating you.

                       OSBOURNE
                 (quietly)
             This is an assault.

                       PECK
             Come on, Ozzie.

                       OSBOURNE
             This is an assault. I have a drinking
             problem? Fuck you, Peck, you're a
             Mormon!

                           PECK
             Ozzie----

                       OSBOURNE
             Next to you we all have a drinking
             problem! Fuck you guys! Whose ass
             didn't I kiss? Let's be honest!

Palmer nods at Olson.

                       PALMER
             Okay, Olson----

                       OSBOURNE
             Let's be fucking honest...

Osbourne gets to his feet, agitated.

                                                                 4.


                         OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
               ... This is a crucifixion! This is
               political! Don't tell me it's not!

    He storms out the door.

                         OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
               ... I have a drinking problem!

    The door slams.   Palmer Smith looks at Olson.     Olson arches
    an eyebrow.


4   INT. COX KITCHEN - DAY                                            4

    OSBOURNE

    Bow tie loosened, he stands at a kitchen counter.

    His shoulders twist as he does something below frame: we hear
    the crackle of ice cubes wrenching loose from a tray.

    Behind him we see the apartment door opening. Katie, an
    attractive middle-aged woman, enters, taking her key out of
    the door, but stops, surprised to see Osbourne.

                         KATIE
               You're home.

    Osbourne continues making himself a drink.

                         OSBOURNE
               Hang on to your hat, honey.    I have
               some news. I----

                         KATIE
               Did you pick up the cheeses?

                         OSBOURNE
               Huh?

                         KATIE
               Were they ready? I didn't know you
               were coming home this early.

                         OSBOURNE
                   (blank)
               The cheeses.

    Katie rolls her eyes.

                                                       5.


                        KATIE
              I left a message for you to stop at
              Todaro's. The Magruders and the
              Pfarrers are coming over.

                        OSBOURNE
              The Pfarrers? Ugh.    I----what did
              Kathleen say?

                          KATIE
              What?

                        OSBOURNE
              When you left the message?

                          KATIE
              She said.    She would give you.   The
              message.

                        OSBOURNE
              Well she, I don't know, I guess we had
              bigger news today. My day didn't
              revolve arou----

                        KATIE
              So you didn't get the cheeses.

                        OSBOURNE
              Well, since I didn't get the message,
              no, I didn't get the cheeses. But
              hang on to your hat, I----

                        KATIE
              Oh for fuck's sake, Ozzie, you mean I
              have to go out again? All right,
              well, you better get dressed.

                        OSBOURNE
              Honey, we have to talk.

                        KATIE
              Not right now. They'll be here in,
              what, less than an hour.


5   INT. COX LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                            5

    A hand hovers, hesitates.

                        VOICE
              Is this a, uh, goat cheese?

                        OSBOURNE (OFF)
              Chevre, yes, that is a goat cheese.

                                     Pink Revision 8/14/07 6.


Wider shows the cocktail party, meagerly attended but in full
swing. Besides Osbourne and Katie there is Harry Pfarrer
(who has just inquired about the cheese), bearded, forties,
rugged; his wife Sandy; and a shiny-faced young couple, Doug
and Tina Magruder.

Osbourne holds a cocktail tumbler.

                    HARRY
          Because I have lactose reflux.    But I
          can----

                    OSBOURNE
          You're lactose intolerant?

                    HARRY
          Yes, but I can----

                    OSBOURNE
          Or you have acid reflux?    They're two
          different things.

Harry looks at him coldly.

                    HARRY
          I know what they are.

                    OSBOURNE
          Then you misspoke yourself.    So I----

                    HARRY
          Thank you for correcting me.

                    KATIE
          You should try the chevre, Harry.
          It's very good.

                     HARRY
          Yeah.   I can eat goat cheese.

He eats a piece, cupping one hand under his mouth.

                    HARRY (CONT'D)
          ... I was just explaining to your
          husband here, I have a condition----

Katie tries to separate the two men by including Doug
Magruder.

                    KATIE
          Harry works with the Marshalls'                       *
          Service.                                              *

                       Pink Revision 8/14/07 6A.


          DOUG MAGRUDER
Ah. I'm on the legislative side, I                 *
work with Senator Hobby.                           *

                                     Pink Revision 8/14/07 7.


                    HARRY                                       *
          Used to work for Treasury, but I                      *
          didn't go over to Homeland Security.                  *
          I'm with the Marshalls.                               *

                    OSBOURNE
          If you want he'll show you his great
          big gun.

                    HARRY
          Very amusing. The gun is actually no
          big deal. Twenty years in the
          marshall's service and I've never
          discharged my weapon.

                    OSBOURNE
          Sounds like something you should be
          telling your psychiatrist.

                     HARRY
          What?   I don't have a psychiatrist.

                    DOUG MAGRUDER
          Boy, I guess my job is pretty
          undramatic. I'm on the legislative
          side. What do you do Mrs. Pfarrer? Do
          you also carry a gun?

Harry laughs.

                    HARRY
          Sandy writes children's books.

                    SANDY
          I write children's books----

                    HARRY
          Oliver The Cat Who...Who..arghh----Who----

Choking on piece of cheese, coughing

                    HARRY (CONT'D)
          ...Who Lives In The Rotunda.     Excuse
          me.

                      TINA
          Those are wonderful!    My nieces and
          nephews----

                                                              8.


                         HARRY
               Yeah, it's a beloved series. You
               wouldn't believe her fan mail. Unghh.
               Are you sure this is goat cheese?

                         KATIE
               Why don't you let your wife tell them
               about her own books, Harry?

                          HARRY
               I'm sorry----was I----

                         KATIE
               Here, come in the kitchen, help me
               with the crudités.


6    INT. COX KITCHEN - NIGHT                                       6

     They enter.

                            HARRY
               Goddamnit.     He knows, doesn't he.

     He looks down at the floor.        He stamps.

                         HARRY (CONT'D)
               ... Nice floors.

                         KATIE
               Knows what?

     Harry is looking around the kitchen, taking in the fixtures.
     Absently:

                         HARRY
               About us, he knows about us.          Little
               prick.

                         KATIE
               Don't be an ass, he doesn't know a
               thing.

     Harry is staring down at the linoleum again.

                         HARRY
               What is that, forbo?


A6   EXT. STREET - NIGHT                                            A6

     A car drives by.

                                                             9.


7   INT. HARRY'S CAR - NIGHT                                      7

    Harry driving, his wife next to him.

    A long beat.

    Finally:

                         HARRY
               What a horse's ass.

                         SANDY
               I don't know why we see them.

    Harry shrugs.

                         HARRY
               Well, she's all right.

                         SANDY
               She is a cold, stuck-up bitch.

    Harry opens his mouth to reply, considers, doesn't.

    They drive.


8   INT. COX MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                               8

    KATIE

    She is staring, in front of a mirror, face covered in cold
    cream, one hand arrested on the way up to daub on more.

                            KATIE
               You quit?!

    Osbourne is buttoning a pajama top.

                            OSBOURNE
               Uh-huh.

                           KATIE
               Well----Thank you for letting me know!

                         OSBOURNE
               I tried to tell you this afternoon.

                         KATIE
               You tried? You tried? And then----
               what, the aphasia kicked in?

                         OSBOURNE
               Our guests came. We----

                                         10.


            KATIE
Why?!    For fuck's sake, Ozzie!

            OSBOURNE
I'm just----I don't know.    I got so
tired.

          KATIE
You're tired.

          OSBOURNE
Tired of swimming against the current.

               KATIE
Uh-huh.

          OSBOURNE
Independent thought is not only not
valued there, they resist it, they
fight it, the bureaucracy is
positively----

          KATIE
Did you get a pension, or severance or
something, or----

          OSBOURNE
I didn't retire you know, I, I quit.
I don't want their benefits.

          KATIE
But I suppose my benefits are all
right, I suppose you can live with
those, is that the idea?

          OSBOURNE
It's not like that's the only way to
make money.

               KATIE
Yes?    Yes?     What're you gonna do?

          OSBOURNE
I'll do some consulting.

          KATIE
Consulting.

          OSBOURNE
Yes, to help while I----I've always
wanted to write.

            KATIE
Write.    Write what.

                                                           11.


                           OSBOURNE
                 I've been thinking about it.    A book,
                 a sort of, sort of memoir.

    Katie stares at him in the mirror.

    A beat.

    She bursts into laughter.


9   EXT. YACHT/AT SEA - DAY                                        9

    THE BRIDGE

    A small yacht. Osbourne stands at the wheel, a light wind in
    his face, as the boat sails under motor power.

    After a beat he moves to the front of the boat.

    An old man sits on a bench on the prow facing out into the
    wind. He has snowy hair and a stern Yankee face. He wears a
    tweed cap. He doesn't much react to Osbourne's approach.

                           OSBOURNE
                 You okay there, Dad?

    The old man remains silent, staring. Osbourne sits next to
    him and idly tucks in the plaid blanket resting over the
    man's knees.

                           OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
                 ... Dad, I left my job at the
                 Agency...

    The old man stares out into the wind.

                           OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
                 ... I, uh... I'm sorry. Dad,
                 government service is not what it was
                 when you were in State. Things are
                 different now. I don't know, maybe
                 it's... it's... the Cold War ending;
                 now it seems like it's all bureaucracy
                 and no mission...

    The old man stares out into the wind.

                           OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
                 ... I'm writing a memoir. I think
                 it's going to be pretty explosive.
                 But I don't think you'll disapprove.
                 I don't think you'll disapprove.
                 Katie has had trouble accepting it.
                           (MORE)

                                                             12.

                          OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
               But... sometimes there's a higher
               patriotism, Dad. So we'll... Yes,
               change is hard. It's hard on Katie.
               But we'll be okay. We'll be okay.
               Life is change. This is good. We
               were all blocked up, Katie and me.
               This is, this is a blessing in
               disguise. I'll go into training, you
               know. Lay off the sauce. Like you
               did. You managed to do it. Finally.
               And then I can concentrate on, you
               know. New beginning. And this'll all
               have been for the best. Don't you
               think Dad?

     The old man stares out into the wind.

     Osbourne sniffles.

                           OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
               ... Cold.

     He taps the old man on the knee and rises.

                         OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
               ... I guess we should head back.


10   EXT. PIER - DAY                                                10

     LONG SHOT THRU THE WINDSHIELD OF A CAR

     The sailboat docked at the end of a marina. Osbourne is
     pushing the old man in a wheel chair down the pier away from
     the boat.

                         A MAN'S VOICE
               We've seen this...


11   INT. LAW FIRM - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY                          11

     THE MAN

     White hair, bushy eyebrows, a florid face. He is in a law-
     book lined conference room. He wears an expensive suit,
     suspenders, a white shirt with blue collar and cuffs. He is
     Bogus Terikhian.

                          TERIKHIAN
               ... I know this kind of man.    We've
               seen this.

                                                        13.


Wider on the conference room shows that Katie Cox sits at the
table, along with Terikhian, another lawyer, and an
assistant.

                       TERIKHIAN (CONT'D)
             ... Mrs. Cox, you can't let this man
             take advantage of you. And he will.
             He will.

                         KATIE
             Yes. This is my fear. He's trying----
             he says----he's trying to pull himself
             together, but...

                       TERIKHIAN
             Look, sure, I----I'm obliged to tell you
             you should try to salvage things. And
             you should. People turn themselves
             around. Not unheard-of. But. You----
             you haven't broached the possibility
             of divorce yet?

                         KATIE
             No.

                       TERIKHIAN
             Well that's good.   Because first you
             should get all his financials. Before
             he's forewarned. Because here's a
             man, here's a man, practiced in
             deceit, this is almost, you could say
             it's his job, practiced at hiding
             things, and there is no reason, it is
             not improper, there is no reason for
             you not to get a picture of the
             household finances. Paper files,
             computer files, whatever----this is your
             prerogative. You can be a spy too,
             madam. Do this before you put him on
             alert. Before the turtle can draw in
             his head and his, uh...

He waggles his hands, groping for the word.

                         TERIKHIAN (CONT'D)
             ... Feet.

He shrugs.

                       TERIKHIAN (CONT'D)
             ... And hopefully everything will work
             out. He will reform. But! If not:
             forewarned is forearmed.

                                                              14.


12   INT. COX HOUSE - DAY                                            12

     Osbourne is splayed on an easy chair, wearing a bathrobe over
     pyjamas. He stares at the ceiling, motionless, arms out-
     flung, like Marat in his bathtub.

     A long still beat.   A clock ticks.

     Abruptly Osbourne raises one hand to speak into a
     microcassette recorder.

                         OSBOURNE
               We were young and committed and there
               was nothing we couldn't do. We
               thought of the Agency less as... less
               as...

     The thought, such as it was, peters out.   Osbourne rises and
     wanders around the room, glassy-eyed.

     He suddenly raises the microcassette again.

                         OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
               ... The principles of George Kennan----a
               personal hero of mine----were what
               animated us. In fact they were what
               had originally inspired me to enter
               government service. Like the State
               Department's China Hands of yore, or,
               in a different forum, in a different
               venue, in a different medium, in,
               um... "Murrow's Boys," the fabled----in
               a different----

     He suddenly stops, head cocked, listening.

     Faintly, a ringing phone.


13   INT. COX BASEMENT STAIRWAY - DAY                                13

     At the cut Osbourne is thundering down a steep carpeted
     stairway. He inclines his head to clear the ceiling that
     juts over the bottom half of the stairwell.

     The phone is louder here.


14   INT. COX BASEMENT - DAY                                         14

     A semi-finished basement with cheap paneling and a low
     dropped ceiling of water-stained Johnson-Armstrong tile. The
     ringing phone is on a cheap government-surplus desk. The
     answering machine, with Osbourne's voice, picks up:

                                                                 15.


                          MACHINE
                You have reached The Cox Group...

     Osbourne, robe flapping, shuffles hurriedly in his slippered
     feet toward the phone.

                          MACHINE (CONT'D)
                ... We can't answer your call right
                now. Please leave a----

                          OSBOURNE
                    (heavy breathing)
                Hello.

     He eases into the chair, having swiped up the phone.    A
     listening beat.

                          OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
                ... Yes?... Oh, no... No, call her
                number... No, upstairs...No she's not,
                but leave it on her machine.


15   INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY - LATER                                     15

     We are looking over Osbourne's shoulder----he is still in his
     robe----as he sits hunched on an ottoman, looking at a daytime
     game show.

     A few beats of the show.

     Roaring laughter from the studio audience.     Mild chuckle from
     Osbourne in the foreground.


16   INT LIVING ROOM - DAY - STILL LATER                                16

     Ticking clock. Osbourne paces with the microcassette
     recorder. He raises it with a thought, draws a breath, and
     then stops, and looks off.

     The ticking grandfather clock: ornate hands on an ornate
     clock face Two or three minutes to five.

     Osbourne stares for a long beat.


17   INT. COX KITCHEN - DAY                                             17

     OSBOURNE

     Shoulders twisting as we hear ice clattering out of a tray.

     He pours coke sizzling onto the ice.

                                                              16.


     He pauses for a long beat.

     He takes a bottle of rum out of a cabinet.

     He pours some into a hatch-marked shot glass.

     He looks at it. The amber liquid tops the hatch mark.    He
     conscientiously pours the overage back, murmuring:

                            OSBOURNE
               Single...

     He dumps the shot into the Coke.


18   EXT. SAILBOAT - DUSK                                            18

     As before, the boat, docked at the end of the marina pier, is
     seen in long shot through the windshield of a car.

     Closer on the boat. As water laps against pilings and the
     boat gently bobs and creaks, we hear, muffled, the sounds of
     a couple having sex. When it builds to climax we cut:


19   INT. SAILBOAT - DUSK                                            19

     Minutes later. We hold on a door for a quiet beat, then we
     hear the gurgle of water, and then the door opens. Harry
     Pfarrer emerges from the small bathroom, buckling his belt.

     In the bedroom which he emerges into Katie Cox is just
     finishing dressing.

     Harry looks at his watch.

                         HARRY
               I should try to get a run in.


20   INT. COX HOUSE - DUSK                                           20

     Katie is letting herself in.

                            KATIE
               Ozzie!

     Quiet.


21   INT. KITCHEN - DUSK                                             21

     Katie enters and sees a note on the counter paperweighted by
     a plate of used lime wedges:

                                                                  17.



               Honey,

               At Fenninger's.     Reunion committee
               dinner.
               See you later.


22   EXT. POTOMAC BRIDGE - DUSK                                         22

     Long-lens, hand-held, point-of-view seeming: Harry Pfarrer is
     jogging in his Treasury sweats.

     Closer on him.   Brow furrows.   He spins, jogs backwards,
     looking.

     His point-of-view: nothing unusual; traffic on the bridge, no
     pedestrians particularly close.

     Harry, mildly puzzled, slows and stops.    He turns again.

     Point-of-view up the bridge: empty.

     Harry starts jogging again.


23   INT. COX BASEMENT - NIGHT                                          23

     We are tracking toward the desk in the corner, at which Katie
     sits. She cracks open a CD case and loads the CD into
     Osbourne's computer. A suspense drone builds as we track in.

     Katie starts typing, then suddenly stops. She holds still,
     listening for noises in the house. Nothing. She resumes
     typing.

     We hear male voices beginning to swell in song. The voices
     continue after the suspense drone snaps off, at the cut to:


24   INT. FENNINGER'S - NIGHT                                           24

     A musty steakhouse. On the walls are hunting-scene prints
     and steel engravings of English country houses.

     A placard resting on a chair outside the Georgian Room:
     CLOSED FOR PRIVATE PARTY.

     From inside the room, male voices:

                         VOICES
               Tune every heart and every voice...

                                                             18.


25   INT. FENNINGER'S - GEORGIAN ROOM - NIGHT                        25

     A dozen middle-aged men around a long table, each holding
     high a glass.

                          MEN
                ... Bid every care withdraw.    Let all
                with one accord rejoice...

     The men are sweaty, tie-loosened, dinner-stuffed and boozy.

                          MEN (CONT'D)
                ... In praise of Old Nassau...

     Close on Osbourne as a rotund middle-aged classmate fills his
     glass to brimming. The two sway unsteadily with the music..

                          MEN (CONT'D)
                ... In praise of Old Nassau my boys,
                Hoo-rah, hoo-rah, hoorah!

     All swing their glasses side-to-side in rhythm:

                          MEN (CONT'D)
                ... Her sons... shall give... while
                they... shall live...

     Glasses are thrust high with a ringing finish:

                          MEN (CONT'D)
                ... In praise of Old Nassau!


26   INT. EXAM ROOM - DAY                                            26

     A WOMAN'S ASS

     Bare.   Pale.   Middle-aged.

     Someone with a marker is drawing on the flesh to illustrate:

                          DOCTOR (OFF)
                We take all the chicken fat off your
                buttocks, here... and here... And the
                upper arms. And a little off your
                tummy...

     The camera is arcing around a standing, naked, middle-aged
     woman, to reveal the doctor sitting on a stool in the
     examining room, facing her. He reaches forward again with
     the marker.

                                                        19.


                    DOCTOR (OFF) (CONT'D)
          ...And we do breast augmentation with
          a tiny incision here... and here.

                      PATIENT (OFF)
          Uh-huh.    And what about the thigh
          area?

                    DOCTOR
          Well we can do liposuction there as
          well, but that area will respond to
          exercise. Buttocks and upper arms
          begin to store more fat when you get
          up around forty, the body just tells
          it to go there, but the thighs will
          respond to toning exercises.

                    PATIENT
          Uh-huh. I know, I can work out on my
          arms til the cows come home, but...

                    DOCTOR
          Uh-huh. And of course there are also
          genetic factors.

                    PATIENT
          The Litzkes are big.

                    DOCTOR
          Uh-huh, well everything's----

                    PATIENT
          My mom had an ass that could pull a
          bus.

                      DOCTOR
          Wow.    Well that's a predispo----

                    PATIENT
          Father's side too, although Dad tends
          to carry his weight in front of him.

                      DOCTOR
          Uh-huh.

                    PATIENT
          In the gut area. Derriere, not so
          much.

                      DOCTOR
          Okay.

The continuing track around is also booming up to reveal the
face of the patient, Linda Litzke.

                                                                20.


                           LINDA
                 And what about the face, you know, the
                 window to the soul.

                           DOCTOR
                 Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Very well put. Well
                 your eyes are one of your best
                 features. But we can do something
                 about the incipient crow's feet.

                           LINDA
                 Baby crow's feet. Little chickling's
                 feet. I mean chicks. Chickie chickie
                 chickie.

                           DOCTOR
                 Ha-ha, yes, again, well put. You have
                 a way with words. We cut here...

     He marks.

                           DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                 ... And we pull the skin tight, like
                 stretching the skin over a drum. Not
                 too tight, though. We don't want that
                 "worked-on" look. You need sufficient
                 slack for the face to remain
                 expressive.

                           LINDA
                 Yeah, I don't wanna look like Boris
                 Karloff.

                           DOCTOR
                 Uh-huh! Heh-heh, so you don't want a
                 sex change!

                           LINDA
                 No, I'm all woman!


27   INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY                                       27

     Doctor and patient, now dressed, sit on either side of a
     desk.

                           DOCTOR
                 So Linda, what we're talking about
                 here is four different procedures.
                     (ticks them off)
                 The liposuction... The rhinoplasty...
                 The facial tuck, which I would
                 strongly recommend over the chemical
                 peel----

                                                             21.


                         LINDA
               Yeah, I don't want to get anything
               burned off.

                         DOCTOR
               And why should you. With that lovely
               skin. And lastly, the breast
               augmentation. Now we can also do
               something about the vaccine scar----I
               don't know if you wear sleeveless
               dresses much----

                         LINDA
               Not with these ham hocks!

                         DOCTOR
               Yes, well once they're nice and
               svelte, post-op, you----

                           LINDA
               Well I don't know. Is the vaccine
               thing----can you counsel me on this? I
               don't know, is it unsightly? I see it
               a lot, a bunch of people have it.

                         DOCTOR
               Absolutely! Some women don't mind it
               at all! Personal taste!


28   INT. HARDBODIES - DAY                                           28

     Linda Litzke, in a Hardbodies polo shirt with "Linda"
     stitched on the breast, leans out of her semi-enclosed office
     on the gym floor.

                         LINDA
               Chad!


29   INT. HARDBODIES - GYM FLOOR - DAY                               29

     Chad Feldheimer, trainer, fortyish and well-muscled, has a
     gym patron up on a table and is helping him stretch a leg
     back.

                         PATRON
               Ow!

                         CHAD
               I'm sorry, was that too much?

                                                                22.


                         PATRON
               I felt a straining... a tightness in
               the... in the front of my ass...

                         CHAD
               Well you're pretty tight.     You have to
               feel it or----

                         LINDA
                   (on the public address)
               Chad Feldheimer. Office.

                         CHAD
               I'll be back in a minute.     We'll work
               on opening those hips.


30   INT. LINDA'S OFFICE - DAY                                        30

     Linda is tapping at her computer as Chad enters.

                         LINDA
               I got a batch from BeWithMeDC dot com.

     Chad perches on the desk, chewing gum as he gazes at the
     screen.

                          CHAD
               Oh wow.   Any good?

                         LINDA
               I don't know yet, just looking... How
               do you open this?

                         CHAD
               Click on, uh... yeah...

                            LINDA
               Oh my god!

                            CHAD
               What?

                         LINDA
               Oh my God, what a loser!

     She clicks.

                            LINDA (CONT'D)
               ... Loser!

     She clicks.   Chad is laughing.   Linda scowls.

                                           23.


          LINDA (CONT'D)
... Loser!... What is this! They
should call this Mr. Saggy dot com.

             CHAD
Cripes.

             LINDA
Loser!

          CHAD
Did you have to send a picture?

          LINDA
No, only guys do. I submitted a
verbal profile, turn-ons, turn-offs,
et cetera. I'm really looking for
someone with a sense of humor.

            CHAD
That guy----wait----that guy wasn't bad.

             LINDA
Him?

          CHAD
No, before.

             LINDA
Him?

            CHAD
Yeah.    He uh, he might not be a loser.

          LINDA
How can you tell?

          CHAD
That's a Brioni suit.

             LINDA
Oh yeah?

             CHAD
Shit yeah.

          LINDA
    (dubious)
Does he look like he has a sense of
humor?

          CHAD
He looks like his optometrist has a
sense of humor.

                                                             24.


     Linda slaps his arm.

                         CHAD (CONT'D)
               ... Huh-huh-huh. What does he do?

                         LINDA
               State Department.

                         CHAD
               That's cool.

                         LINDA
               His hair is... what is that?

                            CHAD
               Plugs.


31   INT. GYM - NEXT DAY                                             31

     Linda is showing someone around the floor.

                         LINDA
               This is the cardio area. A lot of
               machines here so that, believe me,
               there's never a wait. What you're
               seeing now, this is our busiest time,
               and there's still a couple of open
               treadmills I see, three Stairmasters----
               I call it the Butt-Blaster----couple of
               LifeCycles----Hi, Chad.

     Chad is working with a medicine ball and a heavy young woman.

                            CHAD
               Hi Linda.     Did you call that guy?

                         LINDA
               Not yet! Chad is one of our trainers.
               I've just started internet dating and
               I got my first look at the, uh...

                         CUSTOMER
               What service?

                         LINDA
               BeWithMeDC dot com?

                            CUSTOMER
               Nice.

                         LINDA
               Have you used them?

                                                             25.


                           CUSTOMER
               No----two friends did and they're both
               hooked up. With really special guys.

                         LINDA
               That's fantastic.


32   INT. LINDA'S OFFICE - LATER                                   32

     Linda is leaning forward at her desk, phone wedged between
     ear and shoulder, one hand up at her forehead.

     After a long still beat:

                            LINDA
               Yes!

     Another still beat.

                         LINDA (CONT'D)
               ... English!

     Beat.

                            LINDA (CONT'D)
               ... Agent!

     Beat.

                            LINDA DRIVING
               ... Agent!     Agent!

     Beat.

                         LINDA
               ... Yes, hi, this is Linda Litzke,
               should I give you my account number?
               You have it up? Okay. I was informed
               that I needed pre-approval for these
               surgeries, and then... Yes, it was
               denied.

     Listening, then:

                         LINDA (CONT'D)
               ...No, those are four different
               operations... It's very complicated;
               I'm reinventing myself, it's a whole
               new look so it isn't just one thing,
               however, it's all approved by my
               doctor... But----madam! This is not----my
               job involves, you know, public
               interface! This is not...

                                                              26.


     Her jaw sets.   She controls her fury.   Quieter:

                         LINDA (CONT'D)
               ... Yes I do understand. Could I
               speak to your supervisor please?


33   INT. TED'S OFFICE/LINDA'S OFFICE - DAY - MINUTES LATER         33

     We are on a long lens point-of-view, from several cubicles
     over, of Linda, now slumped at her desk, head in her arms.
     We faintly hear her sobbing.

     Reverse shows Ted Treffon, middle-aged, balding, the soulful
     manager of Hardbodies. He looks at Linda, puzzled and a
     little alarmed. He tenses as if to rise but doesn't, and
     hovers uncomfortably, unsure of whether to intrude.


34   EXT. WASHINGTON MALL - DAY                                     34

     Linda walks down the promenade dressed in a smart pant suit.

     Her moving POV passes over a couple in conversation, an old
     woman feeding the birds, a man in a business suit reading a
     newspaper.

     She passes the man and turns around. He has looked up from
     the paper and is staring at her. He wears aviator-shaped
     glasses with clear plastic rims. He may have hair plugs.

                            LINDA
               Alan?

                         MAN (ALAN)
               Are you, uh... Linda?


35   EXT. CIRCLE THEATRE - DUSK                                     35

     A poster advertises Totally Stoked! with Dermot Mulroney and
     Claire Danes.


36   INT. THEATRE - NIGHT                                           36

     On the screen, Dermot Mulroney, dressed in a tuxedo, cranes
     his head to look steeply up and off.

     Linda sits next to Alan in the half-empty theatre, nervously
     watching the screen.

                                                               27.


                         DERMOT (OFF)
               First you tell me that you can't
               commit, then you----WOULD YOU GET DOWN
               FROM THERE!

     Linda laughs raucously, then catches herself and looks at
     Alan.


37   INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT                                           37

     The couple sit across from each other at a small table. They
     pick at their food.


38   INT. LINDA'S APARTMENT/BEDROOM - NIGHT                            38

     The couple are making love in the dark room on a frilly
     comforter. Alan, still wearing his glasses, wheezes
     asthmatically.


39   INT. LINDA'S APARTMENT/BEDROOM - LATER                            39

     Alan is snoring. After a long beat Linda gets up and puts on
     a robe. She bends down near the bed and picks something up
     out of Alan's trousers.


40   INT. LINDA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                                  40

     She sits into a chair near the window in the dark room and
     opens Alan's wallet. A Discover card, driver's license, a
     condom. A photograph of Alan holding a large bluefish.

     She unfolds a piece of notepaper.    Written in a feminine hand
     in pencil:

     Please pick up:
         Plunge
         Honey Nut Cheerios.

                         LINDA
               Oh for Pete's sake!

     She catches herself, looks around.

     The snoring, off, continues.

     She looks out the window.

     The lights of the freeway twinkle.

                                                                 28.


41   INT. YACHT - NIGHT                                                41

     We are in the bedroom.   The boat rides gently at anchor.

     Harry has an arm around Katie, in bed.   Both stare at a point
     in space.

     After a beat that is silent except for the faint sloshing of
     water against hull:

                           HARRY
               ... and then, you know, you grow up.
               I guess that's what's happened with
               me. You just... people change. We
               married when I was, what, in my mid-
               twenties. A kid. We were kids.
               Twenties. You think it's forever.
               Then, you know, you're older----you
               begin to feel your mortality, you
               start to think, well, there's no more
               time for dishonesty. Subterfuge. You
               go, I'm not that person. The choices
               you made, you can't, just through
               inertia----

                         KATIE
               I'm thinking of divorcing Ozzie.

     Harry doesn't react----a careful, studied non-reaction.   After
     more sloshing:

                         HARRY
               ... I'm just thinking, Whoa. I mean,
               frankly, I'm thinking, Whoa. I, I, I
               guess that's what I should be thinking
               about too. With Sandy.

                         KATIE
               That's what you were just saying.

                         HARRY
               Yes! Absolutely! And you should be
               getting rid of that bozo.  No
               question about that. I agree.

                         KATIE
               So if I were divorced----

                         HARRY
               Well yes, if you were uh, you know,
               yes. Yes, I should settle things.
               With Sandy. Because of you and me.
               It just takes, courage, you know. To
               inflict that pain. Scary stuff.

                                                             29.

                         HARRY (CONT'D)
               Scary stuff. You're a brave lady.
               Well, of course, it would be easier
               for you.

                         KATIE
               Why's that? I don't see that.

                         HARRY
                   (chuckling)
               Well you know, because he's such a
               dope.
                   (sobers)
               But Sandy, she's... a good lady. A
               very special lady.

                         KATIE
               She's a cold, stuck-up bitch.

                         HARRY
               Well that's... a little----

                          KATIE
               You and I should sort things out.
               I've told you that this is not just
               frivolity.

                         HARRY
               No, that's understood.   You've been
               very straight.

                         KATIE
               I thought I was loud and clear.

                         HARRY
               Absolutely. Not just fun and games.

     Awkward beat.   The sloshing of waves.   Harry nods.

                         HARRY (CONT'D)
               ... Absolutely.


42   INT. HOME DEPOT - DAY                                         42

     Harry Pfarrer pulls a length of metal tubing from a shelf.
     He sights down it, examines the gauge, hefts it.

     He slides it back in and pulls a length, wider gauge, from
     the shelf below.

                                                              30.


43   EXT. HOME DEPOT - DAY                                             43

     Long lens, hand-held, point-of-view seeming: Harry is pushing
     a red shopping cart through the parking lot. Standing in the
     cart are lengths of metal tubing that he steadies with one
     hand as he pushes.


44   INT. LINDA LITZKE'S CUBICLE - DAY                                 44

     Linda has a hand cupped to her forehead and the phone pressed
     to one ear.

                         LINDA
               English!... Agent!... Agent!...

     After a short beat she hits a button on the phone console and
     cradles the handset. From the speaker we hear:

                           RECORDED VOICE
               ----important to us. Please stay on the
               line for the next available agent.

     Music.

     Linda listens for a moment, then abruptly lifts the handset
     and slams it back down.


45   INT. HARDBODIES - TED'S CUBICLE - DAY                             45

     TRACKING IN ON TED'S CUBICLE

     Ted Treffon, the soulful manager of Hardbodies, stands with
     one hand on the back of his chair----which Chad occupies----and
     one hand on the desktop, looking over Chad's shoulder at a
     computer screen that Chad is scrolling down. Standing behind
     both men is a short Mexican Indian man, also in a Hardbodies
     uniform.

                         CHAD
               Holy shit...

                         LINDA
               Ted, can I talk to you about our
               Mickey Mouse health plan?

     Ted continues to stare at the computer screen in mounting
     alarm. He responds absently to Linda:

                         TED
               Uh-huh... Hang on...

                                  Yellow Revision 8/24/07 31.


                    CHAD
          This is some heavy shit.

                    LINDA
          Is that my date list?

                    CHAD
          No... fuck...

                    LINDA
          You know, I'm trying to reinvent
          myself, and these procedures, which
          are so incredibly not cheap, this
          Micky Mouse HMO is saying they're not,
          they're... What is this?

She is looking at the screen.

                    CHAD
          I can't believe this... This is
          like... intelligence shit.

                    TED
          I am not comfortable with this.

                    LINDA
          What is it?

                    CHAD
          This is, like, I can't believe this
          shit I'm seeing.

          Manolo found it.

                    CHAD
          Manolo found this, like, CD just lying
          in a locker. Locker floor. Ladies'
          locker room.

          Like it's talking about SigInt, and
          signals and shit. Which, Signals
          means code, you know.

                    MANOLO

                    CHAD

          here, and their names and shit. And
          then these other files are just, like,
          numbers. Arrayed. Numbers and dates
          and numbers... And numbers. I think                  *
          that's the shit, man. The raw
          intelligence.

                    TED
          I am not touching this.    I want this
          out of here.

                    CHAD
          Wul... Throw it out?

                    LINDA
          You can't do that! You should put a
          note up in the ladies' locker room.

                    CHAD
          Put a note up? Highly classified shit
          found, Signals intelligence shit, CIA
          shit? Hello! Did you lose your
          secret CIA shit? I don't think so.

As he backs out of the office:

                    TED (CONT'D)
          ... We're running a gym here!

Chad swivels around.

                     CHAD
          Look,   Manolo...

He zippers his lip.

                    CHAD (CONT'D)
          ...you didn't find this.

                                                                 33.

46   INT. HARRY'S CAR - DAY                                            46

     CLOSE ON A REAR-VIEW MIRROR

     A dark blue Ford Taurus, three or four car lengths back on a
     quiet Chevy Chase street.

     Harry Pfarrer glances at the rear view mirror. Behind him we
     see the steel pipe from Home Depot laying across the top of
     the back seat of the station wagon.


47   EXT. CHEVY CHASE HOUSE - DAY                                      47

     Harry is just getting out of the wagon which is parked in the
     driveway of the suburban house.


48   INT. HOUSE - DAY                                                  48

     Harry is struggling through the      front door with the length
     of pipe.

     We hear his wife call down from upstairs:

                            SANDY
               Harry?      Is that you?

                         HARRY
               Yeah, yeah, it's me.

     He takes the pipe, opens the staircase door to the cellar,
     sets the pipe inside on the upper stair, and closes the door
     behind him.


49   INT. CELLAR - NIGHT                                               49

     Harry is at a workbench welding a length of trimmed pipe to a
     short piece of hardware clamped in a table vise.

     His home shop is in a caged-off section of the basement.
     There is also haphazard storage.

                                      Yellow Revision 8/24/07 34.


     One shelf holds stacked boxes labeled with magic marker:
     "Oliver in the Oval Office," "Yea and Nay for Oliver,"
     "Point of Order, Oliver!"

     Harry loosens the vise and takes out the piece of hardware.
     He drops it, a small bearing-mounted clip, onto a length of
     pipe held horizontal in another vise. He experimentally
     slides the clip along the length of pipe: it slides smoothly
     back and forth, nicely balanced.


50   INT. MONKEY DAVE'S - NIGHT                                     50

     Linda Litzke and Ted Treffon, the soulful manager of
     Hardbodies, are at a table in the yuppie bar Monkey Dave's.
     To a waitress:

                         LINDA
               Absolut Saketini, please?

                         TED
               Just a Tab.

                         LINDA
               You know, it wouldn't cover all of it,
               but if I got some advance on my salary
               I could at least get the surgery ball
               rolling.

                         TED
               Whoa! There's a payroll company, you
               know. They don't just advance people
               money. They just don't do that. I
               mean, sure, I could say, Yes, I                           *
               authorize it, but that's not going to
               mean anything to them.

                         LINDA
               Well why do they have us on a
               cockamamie health plan? I need these
               surgeries, Ted!

                    LINDA
          That's right, Ted, I would be laughed
          out of Hollywood. I have very limited
          breasts and a gi-normous ass and I
          have this gut that swings back and
          forth in front a me like a shopping
          cart with a bent wheel.

          always a manager at Hardbodies. I,

He looks at her, appraising.   He decides.

He reaches into his wallet.    He pulls out a picture:

A snapshot of a soulful man in a dark robe and a high caftan
standing on a curb in front of a large stone building.

Linda shrieks:

51   INT. LINDA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                  51

     It is night. Linda sleeps in a darkened bedroom under the
     frilly comforter.   We hear a distant banging. Finally the
     banging stops and a moment later the telephone rings.

     Linda stirs, wakes and reaches for the bedside phone.

                            LINDA
               Hurrow----

     She removes an appliance from her mouth.

52   INT. APARTMENT STAIRWELL - NIGHT                                52

     We hear a door being buzzed open. At the top of the staircase
     an apartment door opens and Linda appears in a robe.

     Her POV down the steep staircase: Chad Feldheimer is walking
     up towards the landing dressed in a black lycra bicycle
     unitard with lime green flames. He holds a bike wheel in one
     hand and a plastic squirt bottle in the other.

     He looks up, foreshortened.

                            CHAD
               Omygod.


53   INT. LINDA'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER                          53

     Chad enters with his bicycle wheel and squirt bottle.   Linda
     shuts the door behind him.

                            CHAD
               Omygod.

                         LINDA
               Chad, you know what time it is?

                         CHAD
               Uh-huh. So, like, I couldn't tell you
               this on your totally unsecure phone,
               but I know who the guy is.

     He leans his wheel against the wall and sits on a low chair
     that brings his knees up near his chin. He looks smugly at
     Linda.

                                                   38.


                       LINDA
           The guy?

                     CHAD
           The guy, the secret guy.

                     LINDA
           Is he high up?

A beat.   Chad stares.

                     CHAD
           Um. I don't know if he's high up.
           Probably. I mean, I know his name,
           not like his rank.

                     LINDA
           What is it?

                       CHAD
           Osbourne.    Cox.

                     LINDA
           Never heard of him.

                     CHAD
           Oh, like you're so plugged in to the
           intelligence community.

                     LINDA
           I'm just saying, to the layman----

                     CHAD
           Well I think like the quality of the
           intelligence dictates how high up he
           is.

                       LINDA
           Uh-huh.

                     CHAD
           Not what we know.

                       LINDA
           Uh-huh.

                     CHAD
           And I also got his----do you have any
           water? I gotta hydrate.

                     LINDA
           I have tap water

                                                        39.


                    CHAD
          Are you kidding?

                    LINDA
          How did you find out who he is?

                     CHAD
          Sources.

                    LINDA
          What do you mean sources?

                    CHAD
          Do you have like Gatorade? Anything
          besides, like, Maryland swamp water?

He rises and heads for the kitchen.

                    CHAD (CONT'D)
          ... You know how far this is from my
          place?

                    LINDA
          How do you know his name?

                    CHAD
          I have this geek friend, Ernie
          Gallegos? He does computer stuff,
          hooks up people's computers and
          programs their VCRs'n shit? So he
          examines the files and he pulls off
          the digital watermark that tells what
          computer they were created on.
          Fucking child's play for Ernie.

                     LINDA
          Uh-huh.

Chad opens the refrigerator and starts rummaging.

                    CHAD
          I also have his telephone number.
          That was a little harder.

                     LINDA
          Omygod!

Chad straightens up with a bottle of orange juice which he
rolls across his forehead.

                    CHAD
          Shall we give him a tinkle?

                                           Yellow Revision 8/24/07 40.


                         LINDA
               Omygod, why?

                         CHAD
               Because he's gonna wanna know that his
               shit is secure. You know, he's gonna
               be relieved. He might even be so
               relieved he gives us a reward----I would
               be very fucking surprised if he did
               not.

                           LINDA
               Oh, wow.

                         CHAD
               Very surprised. Like, you know, the                            *
               Good Samaritan tax. Which is not even
               a tax, really, since it's voluntary.


54   INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER                                        54

     Chad is looking at a crumpled piece of notepaper and punching
     numbers into a wall phone. In the background we see Linda
     watching him from the living room couch.

     A beat.

     We hear the call ring through.

     The click of the connection being made, and Chad silently
     gestures, with an upward sweep of his hand, for Linda to pick
     up her extension.

                           CHAD
               Hello?


55   INT. OSBOURNE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                     55

     He has the phone pressed groggily to his ear.

                           OSBOURNE
               Hello?

                           CHAD
               Osbourne?    Osbourne Cox?

                             OSBOURNE
               Yes----uh----Who is this?

                         CHAD
               Are you... uh... Osbourne Cox?

                                                    41.


                    OSBOURNE
          Who is this? What time is it?     Who
          are you?

                    CHAD
          I'm a Good Samaritan. I'm sorry I'm
          calling at such an hour, but I thought
          you might be worried.

                       OSBOURNE
          Worried?

                    CHAD
          About the security.     Of your shit.

A beat.

                    OSBOURNE
          What on earth are you talking about?
          Who am I speaking to?

Katie stirs in bed.

                       KATIE
          Who is it?

                    CHAD
          Your files----your documents. I know
          these documents are sensitive. But I
          am perfectly happy to return to you
          your sensitive shit. At a time of
          your choosing.

                    OSBOURNE
          What documents? What are you talking
          about?

                    CHAD
          ... Osbourne Cox?

                    OSBOURNE
              (explosive)
          Yes! Yes, I'm Osbourne Cox!     Who the
          fuck­

                    CHAD
          Settle down, Osbourne.

                    KATIE
          Who is that?

                    OSBOURNE
          What documents are you talking about?

                       Yellow Revision 8/24/07 42.


           CHAD
    (referring to his
     notepaper)
OK. "The bureau chief in Belgrade we                 *
all called Slovak the Butcher. He had
   very little report with his staff,
and his despatches were marked by----

            OSBOURNE
Ra-por, very little rapport with his
staff, you fucking moron!    How did
you get----

          CHAD
Don't blow a gasket, Osbourne.    I
have----

          OSBOURNE
How did you get a hold of that!

          CHAD
It's not important where I----

          OSBOURNE
You're in way over your fucking head!
Who the fuck are you? You have no
idea what you're doing!

          CHAD
Oh! Why so uptight, Osbourne Cox?
I'm just a Good Samaritan, like, a
traveler on the road who has happened
upon----

            LINDA
We're going to return it, we just
thought----

          CHAD
Linda, I'll do it!

          OSBOURNE
Who's this?!

          KATIE
Ozzie, what is going on.

          LINDA
Like a Good Samaritan tax----

          OSBOURNE
Who the fuck----

                                                       43.


                    CHAD
          You know, this is a major
          inconvenience for us and we thought,
          you know, a reward----

                    OSBOURNE
          So it's money! So it's money!

                    CHAD
          Well, yeah, uh... why not? I mean,
          this is not----am I out of line here?

                    OSBOURNE
          All right, you two clowns listen to me
          very very carefully. I don't know who
          you are, but I warn you most
          emphatically----

                    LINDA
          You warn us? You warn us? You know
          what, Mr., Mr. Intelligence? We warn
          you! We'll call you back with our
          demands!

She slams down the phone.

                     CHAD
          Hello?   We just----

                         OSBOURNE

          Hello!   Hello!

                    CHAD
              (into the phone as he
               hangs it up)
          Sorry.

He walks back into the living room shaking his head.

                    CHAD (CONT'D)
          ... Geeze...

                    LINDA
          The nerve of that guy!

                    CHAD
          ... I am very fucking surprised he did
          not give us the reward.

56   THE COX BEDROOM - NIGHT                                        56

     Osbourne sits on the edge of his bed in the dark room,
     shaking his head.

                         KATIE
               What in God's name is going on?

                           OSBOURNE
               There's some clown----a couple of clowns
               ----somehow got a hold of my memoir----

                            KATIE
               Your what?

                          OSBOURNE
               Stole it or----I have no idea how they
               got it----

                            KATIE
               Your what?

                         OSBOURNE
               My memoir, the book   I'm writing.

                         KATIE
               Why in God's name would they think
               that's worth anything.

                          OSBOURNE
               Well they----I... I've no idea how they
               got it.


57   INT. LINDA'S APARTMENT                                         57

     Chad paces, shaking his head.

                          CHAD
               But it doesn't sound like he's gonna
               play ball.

                         LINDA
               Oh, he'll play ball! We just have to
               let him know who's boss.

                         CHAD
               Well, that's----he sounds very senior.
               I think this is some senior guy who
               has screwed the pooch, big-time.

                            LINDA
                  Yeah, that's why we got him, you know,
                  we've caught him with his thing caught
                  in a big fat wringer.

                              CHAD
                  Yuh-huh.

                            LINDA
                  And us in the driver's seat. This is
                  our opportunity, like, you don't get
                  many of these. You slip on the ice
                  outside of, you know, a fancy
                  restaurant.

                              CHAD
                  Yuh-huh.

                            LINDA
                  Or this happens.

                              CHAD
                  Right.

                            LINDA
                  And right now this has happened.

                             CHAD
                  Yup.   It sure has.

                             LINDA
                  This could put a big dent in my
                  surgeries.

                              CHAD
                  Big time.

     SANDY PFARRER

     We are dutch on her as she leans down a staircase, one hand
     on its rail, calling to be heard over the buzz of a bandsaw:

                              SANDY
                  Honey!

     No answer.    The bandsaw whines higher, cutting through steel.
     Louder:

                              SANDY (CONT'D)
                  Honey!

                                            Blue Revision 8/1/07 46.


     The whine hums down.

                            HARRY'S VOICE
               Huh?

                         SANDY
               My cab is here, I'm off.      Mystery man.

     Her point-of-view: down the stairs, oddly cropped by the
     angles of dropped ceiling and walls, we see Harry's lower
     body as he throws a drape over his project. He emerges from
     the shop cage and closes its mesh door and padlocks it.

                         SANDY (CONT'D)
               ... What is that thing?

                            HARRY
               Oh baby.     Top secret.

     He comes up the stairs, pushing goggles onto his forehead.

                         HARRY (CONT'D)
               ... You're gonna knock 'em dead.

     At the top of the stairs he kisses her.

                         HARRY (CONT'D)
               ... How many cities?

                         SANDY
               Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles,
               Chicago.

     He picks up her bag and they go out.

                         HARRY
               Why do they always have you do
               Seattle. Not a big market.

                         SANDY
               I don't know, lots of independent
               bookstores. Rains all day, what are
               people gonna do.

                         HARRY
               I can think of a couple of things.

                         SANDY
               You can think of one thing.

                         SANDY
               It better be the Peninsula. The money
               I make for them. Are you gonna be
               okay?

                         HARRY
               I'll be sad. But I'll be okay.

                         SANDY
               Not too sad..

                         HARRY
               Just the right amount.

     He kisses her.

                         HARRY (CONT'D)
               ... I am crazy about you, baby.

     He slams the car door after her. As the car pulls out his
     look travels with it and then lingers up the street, caught
     on:

     A Ford Taurus, parked, dark.

     Harry hesitates, then starts walking up the street towards
     the parked car.

     When he has taken several steps the ignition is turned in the
     car. A shape briefly visible in the driver's seat is lost
     when the headlights flash on. The car pulls out from the
     curb into a U-turn and drives away.

     Harry watches the tail lights recede.

     The secretary rummages through a gym bag that has the
     Hardbodies logo. There are gym clothes among the odds and
     ends. She picks up her handset.

                         SECRETARY

               So. We've drawn up the papers and are
               prepared to execute service on
               Osbourne if you so elect, Mrs. Cox.
               Our missiles are pointed at his
               capital, so to speak, and we await
               only your word. But, be mindful,
               madam: once these missiles are
               launched, there is no recalling them.
               We are not picking daisies. We are
               declaring war, and hostilities will
               then impose their own logic. I think
               you understand what I'm saying.

               Mr. Terikhian, I have given my husband

                         BOGUS
               Of course. But since we are at the
               point of no return, I always urge my
               clients at this juncture to give it
               one more day of reflection.

                          KATIE
               Yes.   Understood.


63   EXT. WASHINGTON MALL - DAY                                      63

     Linda walks down the promenade, dressed in a smart pant suit.

     Her moving POV passes over people relaxing in the park: a
     mother with a stroller, kids running with a ball. Her look
     settles on the bench that formerly held her first date, now
     occupied by:

     A man spitting sunflower seeds.   Harry Pfarrer.

     The point-of-view arcs past him as Linda gives him the once-
     over.

     She doubles back.

                           LINDA
               Harry?    I'm Linda.


64   INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT                                         64

     Harry and Linda eat with appetite as they talk.

                         HARRY
               Yeah, I did the whole bodyguard thing
               for years. My guy was in State, the
               Secretary in fact, so of course I
               traveled a lot.

     Harry talks into his sleeve-cuff as if into a radio
     transmitter:

                         HARRY (CONT'D)
               ..."Ironside is leaving the building."
               We called him Iron Ass.

     Linda cackles.

                    HARRY (CONT'D)
          ... Not to his face, of course.     Not
          to his ass, either!

Linda cackles again; Harry smiles.

                    HARRY (CONT'D)
          ... Ah, he was okay. But, Personal
          Protection----that's a young man's game.

          delicious.

                       HARRY

He reaches but hesitates.

                    HARRY (CONT'D)
          ... Does it have shellfood in it?                      *

                       LINDA

          `Cause I have this sensitivity. I, uh,                 *

Through a mouthful:                                              *

                    HARRY (CONT'D)                               *
          ... Can't always wear a condom.

Linda cackles.

                    LINDA
          That's right! Not always!

                    HARRY
          Anyway, my job's more administrative                   *

65   INT. LINDA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                 65

     Linda swings the door open, leading Harry in.

     Harry talks as he looks appraisingly around the apartment.

                           HARRY
               ----but there was just a hell of a lot
               of political infighting, petty, petty,
               shit, and then basically the old man
               stepped on Goldberger's throat.
               Nice...

     He is evaluating the place.   He stamps on the floor.

                         HARRY (CONT'D)
               ... Wide-plank pine?

                          LINDA
               I guess.

     Harry is taking off his coat.

                         HARRY
               Listen, full disclosure here Linda...

     He holds up both hands and waggles the fingers.

                         HARRY (CONT'D)
               ... I'm not wearing a wedding ring but
               I am married. Took the ring off,
               what, eighteen months ago when we
               agreed to separate. Agreed to
               disagree. That's about the only thing
               we ever agreed on.

     Linda cackles.

                                                               52.


                         LINDA
               Thanks for telling me.     I really do
               appreciate it, Harry.

                         HARRY
               Well, full transparency, the only way
               to----

     As Linda passes he grabs and embraces her.    Linda reacts to
     his gun in the shoulder holster:

                         LINDA
               That's not gonna go off, is it?

                         HARRY
               Well let's go in the other room and
               find out!   Grrr!

               That's great. That sounds...
               exciting.

     Wider shows Linda in the manager's cubicle.

                         LINDA
               He's very very communicative. Very
               accessible. He has a sense of humor.
               And he agrees one hundred percent
               about my surgeries.

                             TED
               Well, I----

                           LINDA
               He thinks my ass could be smaller. I
               mean, not in a mean way, he kidded
               about it----he's got a terrific sense of
               humor.

                         TED
               That's good, but... but... Linda, what
               do you really know about this guy?

                         LINDA
               I told you, he's in the Treasury
               Department and he----

                                                                53.


                            TED
               But he could be one of these people

               internet----

                         LINDA
               Yeah, so am I!

     A rattling knock.   Linda looks over:

     Chad Feldheimer, in his trainer's polo shirt, is knocking on
     the cubicle window. He gestures urgently for her to come
     out.


67   EXT. SERVICE ALLEY - DAY                                         67

     Behind Hardbodies. Linda and Chad emerge from the health
     club through a heavy back door.

                         LINDA
               No, you can't go like that!     You gotta
               wear a suit.

                           CHAD
               Well----you mean----go home and change?

                            LINDA
               Yeah!

                         CHAD
               I was gonna ride my bike.     Do I have
               time?


68   INT. DOWNTOWN RESTAURANT - DAY                                   68

     Harry and Katie are at a downtown D.C. restaurant in the
     middle of lunch.

                           KATIE
               ----which to my mind is all the more
               reason to lower the boom on Ozzie.

                            HARRY
               Mm.

                            KATIE
               That's it?     "Mm"?

                         HARRY
               I'm just... wondering if it's the
               right time.

                                                         54.


                    KATIE
          Of course it's the right time.   Why
          wouldn't it be the right time.   Does
          it threaten you?

                    HARRY
          No no. No, you and me are rock solid.
          That's why I, uh, I think we can
          afford to be big. We can think about
          Ozzie, whether maybe we should let him
          get himself together a little before
          you hammer him with, um----

                    KATIE
          Is that how you see me, "hammering"
          him?

                    HARRY
          Of course not, but----

                    KATIE
          Weren't those your words?

                         HARRY
          Yes, but----

                    KATIE
          I don't "hammer."

                      HARRY
          No, uh-huh, of course not. But, I'm
          saying----I'm no friend of the guy. You
          know that. I think he's an arrogant
          little geek. But for Christ sakes,
          you and me have all the time in the
          world, and he just lost his job----

                    KATIE
          He didn't lose it, he quit.

                    HARRY
          Yeah. Most of the people who "quit"
          in this town were fired.

Katie looks at Harry, reckoning.   He returns her look with an
open one.

                    HARRY (CONT'D)
          ... I feel sorry for the guy. And
          he'll be easier to deal with when he
          doesn't feel... cornered.

                                                                 55.


                         KATIE
               Maybe. As long as we're talking about
               Ozzie and not you.

                         HARRY
               Of course we're talking about Ozzie.
               Baby, I stand by you whatever you do.
               I adore you.

     She nods, thinking, still gazing at him.   Her cell phone
     chirps and she reaches into her purse.

                         KATIE
               Please get the check.

     She flips open the phone.

                         KATIE (CONT'D)
               ...Yes?... Yes?... Is there blood in
               his stool?...Yes, soon.

     She looks at her watch, rises.

                         KATIE (CONT'D)
               It's after two. I have to get back to
               work.

     Harry rises to kiss her.

                         HARRY
               I love you so much.


69   INT./EXT. COX'S CAR/STREET - DAY                                  69

     CLOSE ON A WATCH

     Showing 2:20.

     Wider shows Osbourne Cox, sitting in a car parked on a
     downtown street, consulting his watch.

     He looks up, irritated, and glances around.   His look is
     arrested by:

     The side-view mirror. It shows a man approaching on bicycle
     along the sidewalk wearing a suit and a bike helmet. The man
     dismounts several paces behind the parked car, locks his bike
     to a fence separating the sidewalk from a small park, and
     takes off his helmet. It is Chad.

     He walks along the sidewalk to the car, opens the passenger
     door and sits in with his bike helmet clamped under one arm.

                                                      56.


                    CHAD
          Osbourne Cox?

                    OSBOURNE
          And you, I take it, are "Mr. Black"?

                      CHAD
          Yes I am.    You have the money?

                    OSBOURNE
          The fifty-thousand dollars.

                    CHAD
          That's what was agreed upon, Osbourne
          Cox.

                    OSBOURNE
          All right. Let me explain something
          to you, "Mr. Black." You know who I
          am; I know who you are.

                     CHAD
              (smug)
          Perhaps. But appearances can be----
          deceptive.

                    OSBOURNE
          Yeah. What you're engaged in is
          blackmail, which is a felony. That's
          for starters.

                    CHAD
          Appearances can be----deceptive.   I am a
          mere Good Samar----

                    OSBOURNE
          Secondly, the unauthorized
          dissemination of classified material
          is a federal crime. If you ever
          carried out your proposed threat, you
          would experience such a shitstorm of
          consequences, my friend, it would make
          your empty little head spin faster
          than your Schwinn bicycle over there.

Chad chuckles.

                    CHAD
          You think that's a Schwinn?

                    OSBOURNE
          Now give me the fucking floppy or the
          CD or whatever the fuck you have it
          on, and I will----

                                                                57.


                         CHAD
               As soon as you give me the money,
               dickwad! I'm not----Huhgf!

     Osbourne has punched him in the nose.

     Chad stares at him, stunned.

     His nose starts bleeding.

                         CHAD (CONT'D)
               ... You fuck!

                         OSBOURNE
               Give it to me, fuck!

                            CHAD
               You fuck!     You fucker!

     He opens the car door and gets out, hand to his nose.

     He slams the door.


70   EXT. STREET/COX'S CAR - DAY                                      70

     As Chad goes over to his bike Osbourne leans across the front
     seat and cranks down the passenger window to bellow:

                         OSBOURNE
               I know who you are, fucker!

     He pulls out.

                         CHAD
               You're the fucker!

     There is the honk of a car horn----not Osbourne's.

     Chad looks, surprised.    Linda is pulling up.   Her passenger
     window rolls down.

                         LINDA
               Where's the money?

                            CHAD
               He hit me!

                         LINDA
               Where's the money?!

                         CHAD
               He didn't give it to me­

                                                                     58.


                               LINDA
                   Oh, for----Get in!

      Chad does.

                             CHAD
                   That fucker!


71    INT. LINDA'S CAR/EXT. STREET - DAY                                   71

      He is thrown back against the seat as Linda floors it.
      Recovering:

                               CHAD
                   ... Hey----what're you----

      Linda is coming up fast behind Osbourne's car in traffic.

                               CHAD (CONT'D)
                   Oh shit!

      The crash of impact----ramming Osbourne.


72    INT. OSBOURNE'S CAR/EXT. STREET - DAY                                72

      He recoils from the impact.

                             OSBOURNE
                   Holy fucking----you fucking morons!

      The follow car is speeding up again----but it doesn't hit him.
      It swerves out, screeching, to pass, and Linda angrily flips
      him the finger as she speeds by.

                             LINDA
                   That'll give him something to think
                   about.

      Chad is chuckling.      Suddenly he sobers.

                             CHAD
                   Wait, wait! We gotta go back!

      Linda's jaw is set.      The car is ripping through traffic.

                                        Yellow Revision 8/24/07 59.


                          LINDA
                I knew this would happen.

                          CHAD
                We gotta go back!     My bike!

                          LINDA
                It's on to Plan B.

                          CHAD
                It's just a Kryptonite lock----you can

                          CHAD
                Where we going?     My bike!

                          LINDA
                Some people!

      A skidding turn sends his weight against the door, and the
      car lurches to a halt.

                          CHAD
                ... What is this?

                          LINDA

74    INT. EMBASSY RECEPTION - DAY                                    74

      Linda stands before a reception desk. Chad is just behind
      her, his shirt front spotted with blood and his head tipped
      back with one hand pressing a hankie to his nose. His bike
      helmet is clamped under his other arm.

                          LINDA
                I told Mr. Krapkin I might be stopping                      *
                by?

                          CHAD
                Is there a men's room?

                                                               60.


75   INT. MR. KRAPOTKIN'S OFFICE - DAY                               75

     Linda and Chad sit in, Chad with a moistened hand-towel now
     pressed to his nose.

     Behind the desk sits a sixtyish Russian functionary with the
     beetle-browed sphynx-like look of the Brezhnev-era
     bureaucrat. This is Krapotkin.

                           KRAPOTKIN
               ----Not exactly. I am assistant
               cultural attaché. The organs of state
               security are not allowed to function
               within the borders of your country.

                         LINDA
               ... The organs of state security?

                         KRAPOTKIN
               Yes.

                         LINDA
               But if I had, oh, say, secrets of a
               highly, um, secrets that would
               interest the organs of state
               security...

     She trails off, nodding encouragingly at Krapotkin.
     Krapotkin looks blankly back.

     A long beat.

                         KRAPOTKIN
               Yes.

     She rummages in her handbag and pulls out the diskette. She
     holds it aloft, waggling it for Krapotkin.

     Krapotkin stares.

     Linda sets the diskette on the table and slides it across.

                         LINDA
               ... This is just a taste.

     After a beat of looking at the proffered diskette, Krapotkin
     leans forward to take it. Linda smiles. Krapotkin turns the
     diskette over a couple of times, looks sadly up.

                         KRAPOTKIN
               May I ask the source of this...

     Linda slowly shakes her head, eyes locked on Krapotkin.

                                      Yellow Revision 8/24/07 61.


                      LINDA
            No you may not.

                      CHAD
            Very high up.

                          LINDA
            Chad!

                      CHAD
            I'm just saying he's high up!

A large drop of blood has gathered at the tip of Chad's nose.
It now drops onto his shirt.

Silence.

Finally:

                      KRAPOTKIN
            PC or Meck?

                          LINDA
            Um.    PC.                                              *

                      KRAPOTKIN
            Could you wait please?

He rises.

                          LINDA
            Well----

She looks anxiously at her watch.

                      LINDA (CONT'D)
            ... I have a date----

Krapotkin leaves.

When the door closes behind him:

                          LINDA (CONT'D)                            *
            The fish.      Has bitten.                              *

            What?      Oh, yeah.   Yeah, he seems cool.

A long beat.      Linda looks at her watch.

Chad sighs.

                      CHAD (CONT'D)
            ... That fucker really hit me.

                                                                62.


76   INT. MR. KRAPOTKIN'S OFFICE - DAY - MANY MINUTES LATER             76

     Chad is slumped back with his head tilted back.     Linda looks
     at her watch.

     The door opens.     A man in a suit:

                            MAN
                  Could you accompany me please?

                              LINDA

     Linda gazes around; Chad has his head mostly back.


78   INT. ANOTHER EMBASSY OFFICE - DAY                                  78

     Vladimir Putin glares down from a framed photograph on the
     wall. Chad and Linda are sitting before yet another man, even
     blander than the first.

                            NEW EMBASSY MAN
                  Can you tell me where this material
                  comes from?

     Linda makes a pantomime of zipping her lip.

     The man looks at her impassively.

                            CHAD
                  Name, rank and serial number.

     The Russian's focus shifts to the man with the bloody nose:

                               NEW EMBASSY MAN
                  Excuse me?

                            CHAD
                  We, um... we know our rights.

     The man stares at him.       A beat.

                            LINDA
                  This is just a taste.

     The man's look swings back to the woman for another staring
     beat.

     At length:

                                      Yellow Revision 8/24/07 63.


                         NEW EMBASSY MAN
               There is more material?

                         LINDA
               There's a lot more.    But we need to be
               paid.

                         NEW EMBASSY MAN
               You are not ideological.

     A beat.

                         CHAD
               I don't think so.

                         LINDA
               Look, I have a date.

                           NEW EMBASSY MAN
               Hm?

     Linda holds up her watch and taps at it:

                           LINDA
               Date.

     The man sighs.

                         NEW EMBASSY MAN
               ... We will examine the material.   How
               do I contact?

                         LINDA
               We work at the Hardbodies in

                         CHAD

                         LINDA

     Beat.

               I just----

                         TED
               This is not acceptable at Hardbodies.
               You two know better than that.

                            LINDA
               Yes we do.     I'm sorry, Ted.

                         TED
               This is no way.

                         CHAD
               It was unavoidable.    This won't happen
               again.

     A considering beat.

                         TED
               But you won't tell me what's going on.

                         LINDA
               We can't. I... I... Ted, I know this
               is terrible, but----I have to run. I
               have a date.

     Ted looks at her dolefully.

                         TED
               You're changing, Linda.

     He shakes his head.

                          TED (CONT'D)
                ... Very sad.


81   EXT. COX TOWNHOUSE - OSBOURNE'S CAR - DAY                       81 *

     The car is parked in the driveway of the Cox townhouse, its
     back crumpled.

     Reverse shows Katie, looking at it, furious, her jaw set.


82   INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - DAY                                        82 *

     Katie marches in the door.

                          KATIE
                Ozzie! Goddamnit, Ozzie, what have
                you done to the car?!

     Silence.


83   INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY                                          83 *

     Katie enters.

                            KATIE
                Ozzie!

     Osbourne, lightly sheened by sweat, is in the easy chair in
     his robe, his microcassette recorder under the hand splayed
     across his chest. Amber fluid puddles a glass on the side
     table. Osbourne snores softly.

     Katie's fury mounts.    She visibly fights it down.

                          KATIE (CONT'D)
                ... All right. All right.


84   INT. PFARRER BATHROOM - DAY                                     84 *

     In Harry Pfarrer's house. Harry stands before the mirror
     humming as he meticulously trims his eyebrow hair with a
     Hoffritz scissors.

     We hear his phone ringing, then the answering machine:

                          HARRY'S VOICE
                Sandy and I aren't here to take your
                call. Please leave a message.

                                          Blue Revision 8/1/07 66.


     After a beep:

                         KATIE'S VOICE
               Can I see you please. Harry, please
               call me. I'm very upset.

     Harry continues to hum, trimming his eyebrows.   The machine
     beeps off.


85   INT. PFARRER LIVING ROOM - DAY                                  85 *

     Harry walks into the living room. He takes some as-yet-
     unfolded packing boxes and strews them with studied
     randomness across the floor. As he does so we hear a cell
     phone chirp.

     Harry fishes the phone out of his pocket and holds it at
     arm's length, squinting at the number. Still humming, he
     stuffs the phone back in his pocket.


86   EXT. STREET/CIRCLE THEATRE - NIGHT                              86

     Linda meets Harry with a kiss.

                          LINDA
               I'm sorry----am I late?

                         HARRY
               No no, doesn't start for five minutes.

     He is escorting to a movie theater entrance.

                         HARRY (CONT'D)
               ... You haven't seen this, have you?

                          LINDA
               Oh!   No, no I haven't.

     Our follow-move brings in a light box displaying the one-
     sheet for Totally Stoked! with Dermot Mulroney and Claire
     Danes.

     As they tail out of frame:

                         HARRY
               I hear it's terrific.


87   INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT                                         87

     On the screen, Dermot Mulroney, dressed in a tuxedo, cranes
     his head to look steeply up and off.

                                                                 67.


                         DERMOT
               First you tell me that you can't
               commit, then you----WOULD YOU GET DOWN
               FROM THERE!

     Along with Linda, Harry laughs raucously, tossing popcorn
     into his mouth.


88   INT. HARRY'S CHEVY CHASE HOUSE - NIGHT                            88

     The door swings in and Harry and Linda enter.      Harry refers
     to the boxes littering the floor:

                         HARRY
               Pardon our dust, I, uh----the ex is in
               the process of moving out. Damn! I
               told her I wanted to expedite this.

                         LINDA
               Uh-huh.

                         HARRY
               We, uh, you know you try to act like
               an adult.

                         LINDA
               Oh, it's never easy.

                          HARRY
               Oh! Come on downstairs.    Do you like
               surprises?

                         LINDA
               Well, I'm very open to new
               experiences...


89   INT. PFARRER BASEMENT - NIGHT                                     89

     The overhead light is switched on.

     As Harry and Linda come down the stairs:

                           HARRY
               I gotta tell ya----I saw an ad for this
               in a gentleman's magazine----twelve
               hundred bucks. I take a look at this
               thing, I think, Jesus, you gotta be
               kidding----I'm a hobbyist, this is
               basically nothing but speed-rail, I
               could probably go to Home Depot and
               whip this up myself for, like, a
               hundred bucks...

                                                             68.


     He sweeps the drop-cloth off his project.

     It looks like a rowing machine, though with a higher seat.
     Its function is obscure.

                            LINDA
                  ... What is it?

                             HARRY
                      (smug)
                  What is it. You siddown, feet in the
                  stirrups, and...

     He pushes the seat with his foot. It slides forward then
     back, forward and back, rocking. On its forward arc a dildo
     emerges from the center of the seat's pipe-track, angled
     toward the seat-bottom which is cleft to accommodate its
     entrance.

     A long beat as the seat squeaks back and forth, the dildo
     rhythmically bobbing up and down.

     At length:

                              LINDA
                  Omygod!

     Another couple of cycles.

                            LINDA (CONT'D)
                  ... It's fantastic!

                            HARRY
                  Isn't that somethin'? Hundred bucks
                  all-in if you don't count my labor.
                  And the, you know----cost of the dildo.
                  Those things are not cheap.

                              LINDA
                  Uh-uh.

                            HARRY
                  But I lack the, uh, I'm not set up to
                  mold hard rubber.

     Both stare at the rocking love seat:

     Squeak.   Squeak.      Squeak.


90   INT. BAR - NIGHT                                              90

                                                        69.


CLOSE ON OSBOURNE

Sitting in a bar booth, staring, incredulous.

                    OSBOURNE
          ... The Russians?

Across from him, a man of Osbourne's age.

                       MAN (HAL)
          Uh-huh.

                    OSBOURNE
          The Russians?

                      HAL
          Uh-huh.    Russian Embassy, yeah.

Osbourne stares.

                    OSBOURNE
          ... You're sure?

                    HAL
          Hey, the guy was not hard to follow.
          As you know.

                     OSBOURNE
          Why the FUCK would they go to the
          Russians?!

The man responds only with a shrug and a commiserating head-
shake.

                    OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
          ... Why the FUCK...

Osbourne struggles to compose himself.

                    OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
          ... I'm sorry. Thank you, Hal.

                       HAL
          Hey.     No problemo.

He leans in, voice lowered.

                    HAL (CONT'D)
          ... Ozzie, I hate to be the paranoid
          old spook, but those two guys seem
          very interested in you.

Osbourne looks.

                                                         70.


                    HAL (CONT'D)
          ...You haven't gone poofy on me, have
          ya Oz?

There are two men with drinks at a booth. At Osbourne's look
one of them, who has been staring, looks hastily away.

                    OSBOURNE
              (sharply)
          Can I help you?

The man meets his look again.   He smiles, rises, ambles over.

                    MAN (PROCESS SERVER)
          Sorry to stare, I just couldn't place
          the... You're Princeton, aren't you?
          My year? '73?

                    OSBOURNE
              (softening)
          Yeah.

                    PROCESS SERVER
          I just didn't remember your...

Osbourne extends a hand.

                    OSBOURNE
          Osbourne Cox.

                    PROCESS SERVER
          Thought so.

He smiles as he deposits a large manila envelope in
Osbourne's extended hand.

                    PROCESS SERVER (CONT'D)
          ... Served...

He nods toward his companion, watching from the booth.

                    PROCESS SERVER (CONT'D)
          ... and witnessed. Have a good
          evening.

The man walks off; his friend hastily knocks back the rest of
his drink and rises to follow him.

Osbourne stares stupidly at the envelope in his hand.

                    HAL
          Ouch.

                                                             71.


91   INT. COX'S CAR/EXT. COX'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT                    91

     THRU A WINDSHIELD

     Night.    Rain.

     The car corners into a driveway and its headlights rake the
     front of the Cox townhouse, which is dark. A couple of
     pieces of luggage and several cardboard boxes are stacked on
     the stoop, most of them protected from the rain by the eave
     but some not.

                           OSBOURNE'S VOICE
                 What the fuck?

     OUTSIDE

     The car stops. Osbourne emerges, runs through the rain to
     the front stoop. Rain drums against cardboard.

                           OSBOURNE
                 What the fuck?

     He puts his key in the lock and----it doesn't turn.

                           OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
                 ... Fucking...

     He nudges a cardboard box with his toe.

     He looks up at the dark house, squinting against the rain.


92   INT. JAMBA JUICE - DAY                                         92

     Linda and Chad sit at the counter, Linda drinking a large
     protein shake, Chad idly twirling a straw wrapper around one
     finger.

                           CHAD
                 Why did you tell him we could get more
                 stuff?

                           LINDA
                 Well maybe we can.

                           CHAD
                 That's all Manolo found! That was
                 everything! What're we, gonna tell
                 Manolo to scoop some more secret shit
                 off the locker room floor!

                           LINDA

                        Yellow Revision 8/24/07 72.


            CHAD
What.

          LINDA
I don't like the snideness!    Nor the                *
negativity!

           CHAD
    (abashed)
I'm sorry.

          LINDA
I'm just trying to work this thing!
If I'm going to reinvent myself I need
those surgeries. And those surgeries
cost money! This is not just fun and
games!

           CHAD
Yuh-huh.   I'm sorry.

          LINDA
So let's figure this thing out!

          PUBLIC ADDRESS
Chad, your Berry Blast is ready.

          LINDA
We know who he is

          CHAD
Right: Osbourne Cox.

          LINDA
So we can find out where he lives,
right?

            CHAD
Um.    I guess.

          LINDA
You should change.   Into your suit.

            CHAD
Why?

          LINDA
So you don't look out of place in the
neighborhood. There are certain
elementary things.

          CHAD
His neighborhood?

                                      Yellow Revision 8/24/07 73.


                         LINDA
               Yes. We'll remove the laundry marks
               and labels. And you should not be
               carrying ID.

                         CHAD
               Laundry marks?                                               *

                         LINDA
               Deniability.

                            CHAD
               Okay.

                         PUBLIC ADDRESS
               Chad, your Berry Blast is waiting.


93   EXT. COX TOWNHOUSE - DAY                                          93

     LONG LENS POINT-OF-VIEW

     A car is pulling into the driveway.   Katie Cox emerges from
     the driver's side.

     Reverse shows Chad, in his suit, watching from a parked car
     across the street.

     Now Harry Pfarrer emerges from the passenger side wearing a
     brown pin-striped suit. Encumbered by something bulky he
     follows Katie up the walk.

     It seems to be some kind of pillow or cushion under his arm,
     but very large, and wedge-shaped. Katie is letting herself
     in; Harry gives a furtive glance around----as Chad sinks back
     in his car seat----before entering with the wedge-cushion.

     The door closes.

     Chad relaxes, straightens up.   A beat.   He looks idly around.
     He notices:

     Another car, parked on the same side of the street, further
     up. Someone is just straightening from a slouch to become
     visible over the driver's headrest.

     Chad looks, puzzled.


94   INT. CAR/EXT. COX TOWNHOUSE - DAY - LATER                         94

     Chad is sucking the dregs of his Jamba Juice up a straw when
     a noise brings his look around:

                                                               74.


     The door to the townhouse is opening. Katie emerges, in a
     change of clothes. Harry follows in sweats.

     They get into her car.   It pulls out.

     Chad watches it go up the street.    He is about to open his
     door but pauses, seeing:

     The parked car up the street. Katie's car having passed, it
     now pulls out and follows at a discreet distance. Both cars
     disappear.

     Chad opens his door and gets out. He is crossing to the
     townhouse when he notices another car parked on the other
     side of the street. A man sits in the driver's seat,
     smoking.

     Chad proceeds on to the house. There is a barred garden-
     level door tucked under the stoop. Chad checks out the
     caging on the door. He looks up the façade of the house.


95   INT. KATIE'S CAR/EXT. POTOMAC BRIDGE - DAY                      95

     It pulls over at one end of the Potomac bridge that we have
     seen before. Harry emerges.

                         HARRY
               What's the odometer say?

                         KATIE
               Five.

                           HARRY
               About five or approximately five?    I
               mean----about f----

                         KATIE
               For fuck's sake, Harry, it's five
               miles. Five point two.

                         HARRY
               Okay, fine----I gotta do at least five.
               Five and a deuce is okay.

                         KATIE
               I'm surprised you have any energy
               left.

                         HARRY
               You kiddin'----pull around the corner
               we'll do it again in back!

                                                                 75.


                          KATIE
                You are very coarse.

                          HARRY
                No, back of the car.   I didn't mean a
                rear-entry, uh----

                           KATIE
                Ach.   I'm late----

      The car squeals away, leaving Harry on the shoulder.


96    EXT. COX TOWNHOUSE - DAY                                         96

      Chad is cornering the house on the driveway side, appraising.
      A low wall separates driveway from back garden. Chad gives a
      quick glance around.


97    EXT. COX TOWNHOUSE - BACK GARDEN - DAY                           97

      Chad vaults the wall to land in the garden.

      The garden steps down to a back door. Chad checks out the
      windows in back, then goes to the door. It is locked. It
      has a large window.


98    INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - BACK WINDOW - DAY                           98

      We can see Chad's form outside the door.   Its pane is tapped
      once... twice... it breaks.


99    EXT. POTOMAC BRIDGE - DAY                                        99

      HARRY JOGGING

      He spins, jogs backward.

      His point-of-view: a car, traveling slowly.   Following?

      Harry cuts across a park lawn.


100   INT. TOWNHOUSE BASEMENT - DAY                                    100

      Chad is nosing around the basement.   He notices Ozzie's
      office set-up.


101   EXT. STREET NEAR PARK - DAY                                      101

                                                                 76.


      HARRY

      Emerging from the park onto another street. He looks around
      and, satisfied that he has lost the tail, jogs on.


102   INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY                              102

      Chad is looking at the screen of Ozzie's computer.

      He fishes a CD out of his suit pocket, feeds it into the
      computer.


103   EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY                                    103

      HARRY

      Jogging, entering a residential area.


104   INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - DAY                                         104

      Chad is emerging from the basement. He is looking idly
      around, heading toward the front door when a shape
      materializes in its frosted glass sidelight.

      Chad freezes.

      There is scraping at the lock.

      Chad quickly mounts the stairs.


105   INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - SECOND FLOOR - DAY                          105

      Chad freezes, listening.

      The downstairs door swings open, shut.

      Footsteps.

      A tread on the stairs: Chad scurries into the first open
      door.


106   INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY                               106

      Chad hotfoots into a closet and eases its door most of the
      way shut. The footsteps mount the stairs. Chad peeks out.

      His POV: The bed, bedclothes rumpled.    In the middle of the
      bed, a wedge-cushion.

                                                           77.


Beyond, the open bedroom door shows a slice of hallway and
stairs. Harry arrives at the top of the stairs. He nudges
back a drape on the window at the top of the steps. He looks
down one way, then the other. He lets the drape fall back
and seems to relax.

Harry enters the bedroom. He strips off his shirt and steps
out of his pants on his way into the bathroom off the master
bedroom. He leaves the door open.

Chad reaches gingerly for the closet door to close it but
stops abruptly as we hear the shower turned off and the
curtain whipped back. Harry emerges from the shower. He
rinses off, humming "Born Free," and walks into the
foreground pulling on shorts and shirt and a pair of dress
pants that was draped across a bureau.

Chad shrinks back into the closet as Harry approaches.     Harry
stops, just outside the cracked door.

Through the crack we see only the white of his shirt.
Abruptly Harry turns his back to us and recedes into the room
and bends to pick something off the floor.

Chad leans in ever so slightly to see, but draws back again
as Harry approaches.

Chad looks over to his right: on a hanger, the brown
pinstripe coat that matches Harry's pants.

The closet door is thrown open.

                     CHAD
          Nuhhh!

                    HARRY
          AHHHHHHHHHH!

Harry jerks up the gun which he's pulled from the shoulder
holster in his other hand and----BAM----shoots Chad in the face.

The gun bucks. Unused to the recoil and still screaming,
Harry staggers back and trips over the edge of the bed and
drops the weapon.

He crabs briefly backward and then flips over and scrambles
off on all fours. In the hallway he rises and tramples down
the stairs.

                                                                78.


107   INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - BOTTOM OF STAIRS - DAY                     107

      He stops at the bottom of the steps, panting. He looks back
      up the steps, trying to control his heavy breathing so that
      he can listen.

      A long silence.

                                HARRY
                   ... Hello?

      No answer.

      He looks around.


108   INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY                              108

      Harry enters.    He opens a drawer, closes it, opens another.


109   INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - FOYER - DAY                                109

      Harry enters from the kitchen and starts slowly mounting the
      stairs, a chopping knife in one hand.

                                HARRY
                   ... Hello?


110   INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - SECOND FLOOR - DAY                         110

      Harry tops the stairs.       He pauses, looking at:

      The bedroom door, ajar.

      Inside, his gun lies on the floor.

      Harry takes cautious steps toward the door.

      He pauses at the cracked door.      Suddenly:

                                HARRY
                   Hungh!

      He plunges through the door and runs for the gun and scoops
      it, dropping the knife.

      He stands and spins, panting.

      His point-of-view: the closet. Its door ajar. Legs protrude
      into the room as if Chad, hidden within, is sitting with his
      back against the closet wall contemplating his next move.

                                                             79.


Harry walks cautiously over. With a bare foot he
experimentally waggles one of Chad's feet. Limp.

Harry nudges the door.

                       HARRY (CONT'D)
          ... Hello?

It creaks fully open.

                    HARRY (CONT'D)
          ... Omygod. Omygod.

Chad's face is a powder-burned, chewed-up mess.

                    HARRY (CONT'D)
          ... Omygod who are you. You fucker.
          Omygod.

He gingerly crouches down.

                    HARRY (CONT'D)
          ... You fucker...

He tries to avert his eyes as he feels in Chad's suit
pockets.

                    HARRY (CONT'D)
          ... Omygod, my god... Ungh...

He comes away with a wallet and hastily stands.

                    HARRY (CONT'D)
          ... Omygod...

Inside are a few dollars and nothing else: no credit cards,
driver's license; empty.

                    HARRY (CONT'D)
          ... What the fuck...

He leans back in, trying not to look, but for some reason
feeling obliged to return the wallet.

As he opens the suit coat to slip it back in the inside
pocket he notices:

The suit label has been cut away.       He fingers the raveled
fringe.

                    HARRY (CONT'D)
          ... Oh my fuck...

He straightens up again.

                                                              80.


                          HARRY (CONT'D)
                ... I killed a fucking spook.    You
                fucker...

      He gazes down at the body.

                          HARRY (CONT'D)
                ... What are you doing here, you
                fucker.


111   INT. CIA HALLWAY - DAY                                          111

      We track at floor level, following the well shined shoes of
      someone walking down the well polished hallway.


112   INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - DOOR/PALMER'S OFFICE - DAY              112

      We are low, outside an office door. The shoes enter frame
      and the door is swung inward, away from us, to show Palmer
      DeBakey Smith seated behind his desk.

      He looks up.

                            PALMER
                Olson.    What's up.

      The door slams shut.


113   INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - DOOR/PALMER'S OFFICE - DAY              113

      Some time later.    Our camera position is higher.

      At the cut the door swings open and Palmer Smith strides out,
      grim-faced.


114   INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - OFFICE HALLWAY - DAY                    114

      Tracking behind his shoes down a different piece of hallway.


115   INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - ANOTHER DOOR/CHUBB'S OFFICE - DAY       115

      Palmer Smith's back enters and he swings the door open. A
      silver-haired man looks up from his desk where he is leaned
      back, eating orange sections off a paper towel on the
      desktop.

                            MAN
                Palmer.    What's up.

                                                        81.


                    PALMER
          Not quite certain, sir, but it's...
          messy.

He seats himself facing the desk. A desktop nameplate
identifies his superior as Gardner McC. Chubb.

Palmer hands a folder across, grimacing.

                    PALMER (CONT'D)
          ... Kolyma-2 tells us that they have
          computer files from an ex-analyst of
          mine, Osbourne Cox.

                       GARDNER CHUBB
          Kolyma-2?

                    PALMER
          Our man in the Russian Embassy.

                       GARDNER CHUBB
          Mm.

                    PALMER
          It was brought to them by a woman
          who----

                    GARDNER CHUBB
          The Russians?

                    PALMER
          Yeah. It was brought in by Linda
          Litzke, an associate of a guy named
          Harry Pfarrer. Picture's in the
          folder. With Pfarrer's.

                    GARDNER CHUBB
          The Russians.

                       PALMER
          Yeah.

                    GARDNER CHUBB
          Who's Pfarrer?

                    PALMER
          Treasury agent who's been, um,
          screwing Mrs. Cox. Must be how they
          got the files. Or maybe Ozzie knows
          about it, they all seem to be sleeping
          with each other.

                       GARDNER CHUBB
          All right.     Spare me.

                                                        82.


                    PALMER
          Yes sir. But this Treasury guy----it's
          gotten... complicated. He just shot
          somebody in Ozzie's house.

                      GARDNER CHUBB
          Shot----your analyst?

Palmer shakes his head.

                    PALMER
          Ozzie wasn't there. Our man surveying
          hears a gunshot, sees the Treasury guy
          wrestle something into his car,
          follows him; he dumps a body in the
          Chesapeake Bay.

                      GARDNER CHUBB
          Well----what'd he do that for?

                    PALMER
          Don't know sir.

                    GARDNER CHUBB
          Oh for Christ sake. Anyone fish the
          body out?

                     PALMER
          Mm-hm.

                     GARDNER CHUBB
          Russian?   American?

                    PALMER
          Don't know. Scrubbed of ID.

                    GARDNER CHUBB
          And this... Linda...?

                    PALMER
          Linda Litzke.

                    GARDNER CHUBB
          She's Treasury?

                     PALMER
          No, we're----um... fuzzy on her.

Gardner Chubb is flipping bemusedly through the contents of
the folder.

                        GARDNER CHUBB
          Well----so----we don't really know what
          anyone is after.

                                                             83.


                          PALMER
                Not really, sir.

                          GARDNER CHUBB
                This analyst, ex-analyst, uh...

                            PALMER
                Cox.

                            GARDNER CHUBB
                Yeah.    What's his clearance level.

                            PALMER
                Three.

                            GARDNER CHUBB
                Okay.    Okay, no biggie...

      He reaches the folder back to Palmer.

                          GARDNER CHUBB (CONT'D)
                ... for now just keep an eye on
                everyone, see what they do.

                          PALMER
                Right, sir. And----we'll interface with
                the FBI on this, uh, dead body?

                          GARDNER CHUBB
                No! No, we don't want those idiots
                blundering around in this. Burn the
                body. Get rid of it. And keep an eye
                on everyone, see what they do. Report
                back when, um, I don't know. When it
                makes sense.


116   INT. YACHT CABIN - DAY                                        116

      A HOPPING MAN IN A UNITARD

      His hands are on his hips. He is darkly Mediterranean and
      very fit. He smiles into the camera as he hops in time to
      upbeat music, kicking a leg out on each beat.

                          MAN
                To the left!... Repeat!... To the
                right!... Repeat!... And in!... And
                out!... And higher!... Repeat!...

      Wider shows that the man is on TV leading the viewer in
      exercise. The viewer, in this case, is Osbourne Cox, on his
      boat.

                                                              84.


      He follows along in his underwear in the cramped quarters
      belowdecks. Boxes and luggage are strewn about, half-
      unpacked.

      He pants as he exercises:

                          OSBOURNE
                I'm bigger... I'm back... I'm
                better... I'm back... than ever... I'm
                back... fuckers... I'm back...

                          MAN ON TV
                ... And good!... Repeat!... Now
                bend!... And bounce!... . And
                lower!... Repeat!... And up!... And
                back!... And up!... Repeat!


117   INT. TED'S OFFICE/LINDA'S OFFICE - DAY                          117

      LINDA

      We are on a long lens point-of-view, from several cubicles
      over, of Linda slumped at her desk, head in her arms. We
      faintly hear her sobbing.

      Reverse shows Ted Treffon, the soulful manager of Hardbodies,
      looking at her, unsettled.

      CLOSE ON LINDA

      We are in her cubicle now, her weeping bumping up at the cut.

      A tap against the cubicle window brings her head up.

      Ted Treffon opens the door.

                           TED
                Linda.   You okay?

                          LINDA
                I'm fine, Ted, I'm sorry.

      He sits at the chair alongside her desk.

                          TED
                You don't look fine.

                          LINDA
                No no, I'm... I'm...

                          TED
                You won't tell me what it's about.
                You never let me in, Linda.

                                                       85.


                       LINDA
             Oh, I know you're trustworthy, I
             just... don't want to endanger other
             people with----I mean, it's a path I've
             chosen, it's not, you have to isolate,
             you know, a firewall.

Ted sighs.

                        TED
             Uh-huh. Well, I don't know what to
             think. You both go AWOL on Friday;
             today Chad doesn't bother to come in
             at all----

                       LINDA
             I know, Ted.

                       TED
             Linda, I can't run a gym this way.

                       LINDA
             I know, Ted.

                       TED
             I'm going to have to fire him.

                       LINDA
             No! No no no, Ted!   Just, just. .   .

                         TED
             What?

                       LINDA
             Give me twenty-four hours!

             To what?

                       LINDA
             To, um... I don't know, twenty-four
             hours!

                       LINDA
             Just give me twenty-four hours to
             solve this thing!

                       TED
             Linda. I have to tell you. A man was
             here earlier asking about you.

Linda looks at Ted for a beat, thinking.

                       LINDA
          Foreigner?

                     TED
          Linda, are you in some kind of
          trouble? Is Chad running from
          something?

                    LINDA
          Ted, we know what we're doing. Let me
          ask you this: did he know my name.

                      TED
          Whuh----yes, he was asking about you.
          Employment history, et cetera. Real
          jerk. I told him to get lost.

She takes his hand.

                    LINDA
          Thank you, Ted.

Ted swallows.   He looks down.

                    TED
          Well, we...

Linda still has his hand.      He tries to cover his reaction to
the physical contact.

                    TED (CONT'D)
          ... we just don't give that out at
          Hardbodies.

The phone beeps.    A voice comes through the intercom:

                    VOICE
          Linda, there's a Mr. Krapotkin on line                   *
          two.

                       LINDA

She punches a button on the phone.

                    LINDA (CONT'D)
          ... Hello? Mr. Krapkin?                                  *

          Yes, yes!----hang on.    Ted, I'm sorry.
          This is private.

Looking at her, Ted sighs. He shakes his head sadly, rises
and goes. Linda pushes the door of the cubicle shut with her
foot.

                       LINDA (CONT'D)
          ... Hello.     Is this a secure line, Mr.

                       KRAPOTKIN
          Heh-heh.

Another beat.

          Do we have him?

                      LINDA

                Um...

      Linda glances up. Outside her cubicle window Ted waits; at
      Linda's look he turns palms up: What's going on? Linda holds
      up a finger: one second.

                          LINDA
                Do you know where he is?

                          KRAPOTKIN
                Is he not... at Hardbodies?

118   INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY                               118 *

      Harry Pfarrer stands at the kitchen counter chopping carrots.
      He is intensely focused and chops very, very quickly,
      producing slices in high volume.

      Reverse shows Katie Cox in a chair in the living room, frozen
      in a look up, a file of papers forgotten in one hand as she
      gazes over half-glasses at Harry. His chopping continues
      unabated.

      After a long look and much chopping:

                          KATIE
                You seem distracted.

                          HARRY
                    (still chopping)
                Do I?

                          KATIE
                Very distracted.      The last two days.

                              HARRY
                Nn.   Work.

      The chopping continues.

      Katie's eyes shift down to the countertop, back up to Harry.
      Another beat.

                          KATIE
                ... That's enough carrots, don't you
                think?

                                                          89.


                      HARRY
          Huh?

                    KATIE
          For the salad?

The chopping stops.

Harry slaps the knife down.   He stares at Katie, jaw
grinding, for a beat.

                    HARRY
          You know: you're really a very
          negative person.

                      KATIE
          ... What?

Through grit teeth:

                    HARRY
          I've tried. To ignore it.    And stay
          upbeat.

Katie, unused to backtalk from Harry, is stunned.   She
returns in a manner as hard as his:

                    KATIE
          Harry: stop the foolishness.

                    HARRY
          Stop the foolishness?

                    KATIE
          Yes. And behave.    You are not talking
          to one of your...

Her fingers form quotes:

                    KATIE (CONT'D)
          ... "shithole buddies."

Harry glares at her, vibrating with rage.   Her look at him is
equally hard.

Harry abruptly turns and stomps up the stairs.

Brief tromping on the second floor.   Katie sits in puzzled
suspense.

Footfalls descend the staircase.

                                             Blue Revision 8/1/07 90.


      Harry reappears at the foot of the stairs with his wedge-
      cushion tucked under an arm. He flings the front door open,
      goes out, slams it shut.


119   EXT. COX TOWNHOUSE/INT. HARRY'S CAR - DAY                         119 *

      Harry stomps to his car in the driveway and flings in the
      cushion. He gets in, seething. After a beat he pulls out
      his cell phone and dials.

      A ring.   Pick-up.   A female voice:

                             SANDY
                 Hello?

                             HARRY
                 Honey.    It's so good to hear your
                 voice.

                           SANDY
                 Something wrong, Harry?

                           HARRY
                 No. Yes. Can you come home?       Your
                 baby needs you.

      A beat.

                           HARRY (CONT'D)
                 ... Can you please come home?

                           SANDY
                 Harry, you know I----

                           HARRY
                 I can show you your present.     It's
                 finished.

                             SANDY
                 Oh Harry.    I can't just leave the book
                 tour.

      Harry sags.

                             HARRY
                 Yeah.

                           SANDY
                 There are two days left.     There's
                 still Seattle.

                             HARRY
                 Yeah.

                                           Blue Revision 8/1/07 91.


                          SANDY
                I love you, Harry.

                           HARRY
                Okay.   Yeah. Love you too.

      He folds the phone, miserable.

      As he pockets it his attention is caught by something in the
      side-view mirror:

      The car parked across the street.    A man's shape in the
      driver's seat.


120   EXT. TOWNHOUSE - DAY                                            120 *

      Harry, jaw set, gets out of the car and starts down the
      drive.

      The parked car starts.

                            HARRY
                Hey!    Fucker!

      The car tries to pull out but is closely hemmed in by cars
      front and back; it will need a couple moves.

      Harry runs back to his own car, starts it, throws it into
      reverse and backs straight down the drive toward the
      frantically shuttling car.

      He t-bones it.

                             VOICE FROM WITHIN CAR
                Fucker!

      Harry, amped, throws his car into drive, pulls halfway up the
      driveway.

                           HARRY
                Fucker!   Fucker!

      He again throws the car into reverse.

      The man in the other car abandons his attempt to pull out and
      scrambles frantically toward the passenger side.

      Harry again smashes into the car.

121   EXT. STREET ACROSS FROM TOWNHOUSE - DAY                         121 *

      The other man emerges from the far side. He flees down the
      sidewalk as fast as his weight will permit, pocket change
      jingling, yelling as he runs:

                            MAN
                Fucker!

      Harry runs after him, calling:

                          HARRY
                Who do you work for?!   Who do you work
                for?!

      Pounding footsteps.

                          HARRY (CONT'D)
                ... Tell me!

      The overweight man does not have Harry's stamina: Harry
      closes, leaps, and tackles.

      He crawls up the man's body, hand-over-hand, panting:

                          HARRY (CONT'D)
                ... Who do you work for? CIA?     NSC?

      The other man is panting much harder:

                          MAN
                Tuchman Marsh!

      This stops Harry.   He isn't sure what he's heard.

                            HARRY
                What?

                          MAN
                Tuchman Marsh!

                          HARRY
                ... Tuchman Marsh?

                            MAN
                Yes!

                          HARRY
                Your name is... Tuchman Marsh?

                          MAN
                Tuchman Marsh Hauptman Rodino!

                                                              93.


Harry stares at the man underneath him.     The gasping man
explains:

                    MAN (CONT'D)
          ... I work for them!

                    HARRY
          You... work for Tuchman Marsh.

                       MAN
          Yes!

                    HARRY
          Which is a law firm.

                   MAN
          No! A rock band!      Yes, it's a law
          firm!

                    HARRY
          Well... why are you following me?

                    MAN
          Divorce action, numbnuts!

Harry is blindsided.    He stares.   He slowly sits up,
digesting:

                    HARRY
          My... my wife hired you?!

The freed Tuchman Marsh man also sits up, still panting
heavily.

                    MAN
          No. Your wife hired Tuchman Marsh.
          Tuchman Marsh hired me. I work for
          Tuchman Marsh.

                      HARRY
          You're----you're----a divorce detective.

                       MAN
          Not just.     Credit, missing persons,
          whatever.

                    HARRY
          But this is divorce.

                    MAN
              ("duh")
          Well... yeah.

                                                            94.


Harry rises and walks stiffly, zombie-like, up the street.
The man watches him go.

After a few paces Harry stops and sits on the curb.    He
starts weeping.

The man, still breathing heavily, calls out:

                     MAN (CONT'D)
          ... Jesus----grow up, man!    It happens
          to everybody!

Harry's cell phone chirps.     He fishes it out and unfolds it,
sniveling.

                       HARRY
          Yeah?

                    VOICE
          Harry, it's Osbourne Cox.

Harry stares, trying to fit this in.     Osbourne prompts, after
a silent beat:

                       VOICE (CONT'D)
          ... Harry?

                       HARRY
          Yeah?

                    OSBOURNE
          Harry, could I get your wife's number?
          This is Osbourne Cox, could I trouble
          you for your wife's----

                    HARRY
          You can't tell her anything she
          doesn't already know, fucker.

                       OSBOURNE
          What?

Harry again stares: maybe he has this figured wrong.

After a silence:

                    OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
          ...Is this... Harry Pfarrer?

                    HARRY
          You want... Sandy's number?

Echoing up the street:

122   INT. OSBOURNE'S BOAT - DAY                                      122 *

      Osbourne paces the cramped cabin belowdecks, a phone to his
      ear. He is unshaven, wearing a robe.

      Filtered rings, then a connection:

                          SANDY'S VOICE
                Hello?

                          OSBOURNE
                Sandy?

                          SANDY
                Yes?

                          OSBOURNE
                Hi, it's Osbourne Cox, how are you.
                Hi.

                          SANDY
                ... Hi.

                            OSBOURNE
                Hi. Sorry to call out of the blue but
                I have a, well, a publishing question
                and I thought you might be the person
                to ask, I have this manuscript,
                something to do with my professional
                experiences, not to go into too much
                detail but I think it's pretty
                explosive stuff and I think that it
                could merit a fairly wide readership
                handled properly and it isn't quite
                finished yet but there's a situation
                where I'm worried about it leaking now
                and maybe excerpts being published or
                on the internet, whatever, without my
                permission, and a lot of the impact
                being, um, blunted, so I'm actually
                anxious to bring it to market sooner
                than I'd planned----I mean, like now, in
                fact----so I was thinking, I know you,
                and you seem to do well, so I was
                wondering if you were happy with your
                publisher. The people you use.

      A long beat.

                                                                 96.


                          SANDY
                You've written a children's book?

                            OSBOURNE
                No! No no, a, a kind of a memoir, but
                ----doesn't your company have an adult
                arm? Or isn't it, uh, the children's
                arm? Of a regular publisher?

                          SANDY
                Pappas & Swain do children's
                literature.

                          OSBOURNE
                Uh-huh. I see. So they don't----
                okay... Are you well?

                          SANDY
                Very well thank you.    And you.

                         OSBOURNE
                Yes. Good. Okay, well, thank you
                Sandy.

                            SANDY
                Yes.    Good talking to you.

      Disconnect.

      Osbourne yanks the rubber band off a bundle of mail.

                            OSBOURNE
                Bitch.


123   INT. RUSSIAN EMBASSY - HALLWAY - DAY                             123

      Two pairs of footsteps echo down a long hallway as Linda
      Litzke is escorted by a solemn Russian staffer.


124   INT. RUSSIAN EMBASSY - ANOTHER ROOM - DAY                        124

      A waiting room.    A long beat; Linda sits waiting.

      A door opens.    Mr. Krapotkin emerges.

      Linda stands to go to the inner office but Krapotkin motions
      her back down.

                          KRAPOTKIN
                Yes, madam. Can we help you?

                                                        97.


                    LINDA
          What kind of Mickey Mouse embassy are
          you running?! I've been waiting here
          for fifty-five minutes, and I'm----

                    KRAPOTKIN
          I am so sorry, madam.   An urgent
          matter.

                    LINDA
          Well this could be urgent too, since,
          you know, Chad has been missing for
          forty-eight hours now and----

                    KRAPOTKIN
          I don't know the whereabouts of Chad,
          madam.

                    LINDA
          Well he was gathering information for
          you when he----

                    KRAPOTKIN
          We're not interested in such
          "information". It was drivel.

Linda is dumbfounded.

A silent beat.

                    LINDA
          ... Dribble!

Krapotkin fishes something from his pocket.

                    KRAPOTKIN
          Would you like your disk back?

                    LINDA
          ... Dribble!

Krapotkin stands with the disk extended toward her.

                    KRAPOTKIN
          I'm so sorry I can't help you.

Linda recovers from her astonishment and is moved to outrage:

                    LINDA
          I'll tell you what's dribble! You
          listen to me, Mr. Krapkin! I am----

125   INT. RUSSIAN EMBASSY - HALLWAY AGAIN                          125

      Looking the opposite way.

      We hear two pairs of footsteps. They approach for several
      beats and then Linda and her escort enter frame and recede,
      footsteps echoing. The staffer's hand is on Linda's elbow.

      As we hold on their backs and they continue to walk, Linda
      jerks her arm away; the staffer regrabs it. She jerks away
      again.

                          LINDA
                Cut it out.

      An exercise show plays on the TV, unwatched. Osbourne sits
      at a little table looking at a notice torn from a windowed
      envelope.

                            OSBOURNE
                ... What?

      He brings the notice close, squints at it.

                          OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
                ... What the fuck?

      He quickly shuffles through the rest of the mail, pulls out
      another envelope, rips it open.

       A MINUTE LATER

       Osbourne paces, drink in hand, staring at another piece of
       mail.

                           OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
                 What the fuck?

       A MINUTE LATER

       Osbourne is back at the table, drink half-consumed, listening
       at the phone.

                           OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
                 ... Yes... No... Yes, I want to know
                 why the check for my slip fee was
                 returned for insufficient funds...
                 Slip fee, for docking my boat, the
                 check was returned... No, m'dam, it's
                 not zero, I have about forty thousand
                 dollars in that account... When? ...
                 When?... But she can't do that----no,
                 yes, technically it may be a joint
                 account but she doesn't use it, it's
                 not her money... No! No! What
                 access, it's not possible! Without my
                 permission? What about the, my, the,
                 our savings account? My savings
                 account?... I don't know the fucking

                No-o-o-o-o-o way.   No way.   Whoa.   No
                way, Linda...

                anything about computers.

          TED
Linda, the whole thing is crazy. It
was crazy the first time, and you want
to do it again? Break into the man's
house? And why would----why would----you
said the Russians didn't even want
this stuff!

          LINDA
My world is bigger than that, Ted.
There's other people. There's the
Chinese.

          TED
Linda, these surgeries----

          LINDA
It's not just the surgeries, Ted!
It's not just the money! We can use
it as leverage! To get Chad back!

          TED
What do you mean "get him back"!

          LINDA
Information is power, Ted!     Hel-lo!

          TED
What do you mean "get him back"!      You
don't know where he is!

          LINDA
Somebody has him.    And we can----

          TED
You ask the police to help you find
missing people! And you----

          LINDA
I can't take it! I can't take it! I
can't take it! You know I can't do
that! We're operating off the map
here, Ted! This is way higher than
the police, it's higher than that!

               TED
Linda, I----

          LINDA
I need a can-do person, Ted! I hate

      Night. Linda is asleep in her bedroom.        The buzz of the in-
      house intercom.

      Linda stirs, wakes and reaches for the bedside phone.

                             LINDA
                Hurrow----

      She removes an appliance from her mouth.

                             LINDA (CONT'D)
                ... Hello?

                          FILTERED VOICE

      Minutes later.   Harry is gazing off, slack-jawed, haunted.

      After a beat:

                          HARRY
                You think a marriage is... and then
                you...

      The thought drifts off.    A sad shake of the head.

                                                           102.


Linda enters, handing him a drink.    She sits opposite.

                    LINDA
          But this was a long time coming.

Harry looks up, surprised.

                      HARRY
          Was it?

He catches himself.   His gaze wanders back to the haunted,
empty spot.

                    HARRY (CONT'D)
          ... Well, yeah... right...

                    LINDA
          You're depressed, Harry.

                    HARRY
              (hollowly)
          I am depressed. I gotta exercise. I
          haven't run in three days... butt-
          crunches... anything... Do you think I
          could stay here for a little while?

Linda starts quietly weeping.

This focuses Harry's attention.    He looks at her as if just
now noticing her.

                      HARRY (CONT'D)
          ... What?    What's wrong, baby?

                    LINDA
          It can't always come from me, Harry!
          I'm not that strong!

Harry moves next to her and puts an arm around her.

                    HARRY
          What's wrong, baby?     Harry's here.

                    LINDA
          You're not here for me! I need a can-
          do person! You're all... defeated!

                    HARRY
          I'm sorry, baby----

                    LINDA
          Chad is the only can-do person I know
          and he's gone, Harry, he's gone.

                                                       103.


                    HARRY
          I'll be good. I'll be better.     I just
          need to exercise. Are there
          pedestrian paths around here?

He squeezes her shoulder, takes a gulp of the drink.

                    HARRY (CONT'D)
          ... Who the fuck is Chad?

                    LINDA
          Could you help me find him?  He's a
          friend from work. You know law
          enforcement people, right? You could
          call, unofficially?

                    HARRY
          Wait a minute, what's his name?   What
          happened?

                    LINDA
          Chad Feldheimer. He just disappeared.
          He hasn't been at work or at home for
          two days.

                         HARRY
          Okay.

                         LINDA
          He----

                    HARRY
          You know his social security number?

                         LINDA
          Huh?     NO!    I----

                    HARRY
          It's okay. That's okay.     What's the
          last place you saw him?

                    LINDA
              (snuffling)
          I don't know! He just disappeared!
          The last place I saw him was the Jamba
          Juice on K Street. And he's gone.

Harry squeezes her shoulder again.

                    HARRY
          Okay baby. We'll find your friend.
          Missing person. Piece of cake.

                                                                 104.


133   INT. PEDIATRIC EXAM ROOM - DAY                                      133

      AN EPIGLOTTIS

      Illuminated by a small light. It quavers.       The tongue starts
      to rise and the mouth starts to close.

                          WOMAN'S VOICE
                No, stay open...

      Wider: a pediatric examining room decorated with colorful
      prints of cartoon characters and clowns.

      Katie Cox, in a white smock, has a tongue depressor in a five-
      year-old's mouth and a light-sight in one hand. She
      withdraws both as the child finishes closing his mouth. The
      child's mother stands by.

      Katie grasps the child by the upper arm.

                          WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                ... You have to let the doctor look in
                your mouth.

      The child keeps his lips pressed together.

                          WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                ... Now you listen to me, young man.
                You do as I say or I'll ask your
                mother to leave the doctor's office
                and the two of us will sort out what's
                what.

      The child looks at her fearfully.

      The wall phone bleeps.

      Katie rolls to it on her castored chair.

                             WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                ... Yes.

      She listens briefly.

                          WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                ... With a patient.

      She hangs up.


134   INT. OSBOURNE'S BOAT - DAY                                          134

      Osbourne, in dressing gown and pyjamas, is barking into the
      phone:

                                                               105.


                          OSBOURNE
                Yeah? The same patient she's been
                with since YESTERDAY? BullSHIT!

                             FILTERED VOICE
                Dr. Cox has suggested you call her
                attorney----

                          OSBOURNE
                Yeah, RIGHT! Tell her I got the new
                fucking keys!

      He slams down the phone.


135   EXT. BOAT DECK                                                  135

      The hatch is thrown open and Osbourne emerges from below.
      There is a large built-in toolbox just by the hatch. He
      yanks it open and pulls out a hatchet.

                          OSBOURNE
                New keys...


136   DOCK                                                            136

      Osbourne strides grimly down the dock in his bathrobe,
      hatchet in hand.


137   INT. "GOOD MORNING, SEATTLE" SET - DAY                          137

      Sandy Pfarrer is sitting in an armchair on a morning show
      living room set surrounded by a dozen eight-year-olds sitting
      on the carpet. Hosts Del and Connie sit next to her in
      swivel chairs.

                            SANDY
                    (reading)
                And it was just then----at that very
                moment----that Oliver sneezed----

                             DEL
                Can    we just----I'm sorry to interrupt
                but    we have to let the folks at home
                see    this illustration! Can we just
                get    a shot of that...

      He is holding the book open, face out on his lap.

                            DEL (CONT'D)
                There----there it is. Oliver.
                Interrupting the filibuster with----

                                                       106.


                    CONNIE
          That's wonderful!

                    DEL
          Wonderful! The book is "Point of
          Order, Oliver!" and the talented
          author is Sandra Pfarrer. We're gonna
          go to a station break and then be
          right back with Bud Fraighling, the
          Sultan of Salad, and Part Two of our
          special interview with Dermot
          Mulroney. So keep it where it is!

Del and Connie and Sandy all wear smiles that stay fixed a
beat too long. Then Del relaxes and turns to Sandy.

                    DEL (CONT'D)
          ...Great segment.

                       SANDY
          Thank you.

                    DEL
          Yeah, you know we thought it might be
          fun if you joined us with Bud
          Fraighling and help make the Fiesta
          Salad, when we move over.

                    CONNIE
          Over on the kitchen set.

                    SANDY
          That wasn't discussed.

                      DEL
          Oh, sure! No! Only if you want to!
          Your segment went great, we just
          thought----

                    SANDY
          I'm sorry, I made plans.

                    DEL
          Okay, great!

                    CONNIE
          Great to see you again, Sandra!

She gives them a cold smile as a technician finishes
unclipping her lavaliere and she leaves.

Connie looks at Del and mouths "Bitch."

                                                               107.


138   EXT. COX TOWNHOUSE - DAY                                        138

      Osbourne's crumple-backed car roars up. It cuts a corner of
      the lawn and squeals to a halt in the drive. Osbourne
      emerges, still in robe and pyjamas, with the hatchet.

      He goes to the front door and bashes at the knob with the
      blunt end of the hatchet.

                          OSBOURNE
                New... fucking... keys... How's this
                for access...

      Hardware starts to fall off and jangle onto the stoop.
      Osbourne tries the sharp end of the hatchet a couple times,
      decides he prefers the blunt end.

                          OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
                ... How's this for motherfucking
                access...

      More things fall off.    The knob wobbles in the door.

      Osbourne pushes the door open.


139   INT. STUDIO - HALLWAY - DAY                                     139

      Sandy Pfarrer is accompanied by a bright young PR woman.

                          PR WOMAN
                That was way out of line. We were so
                unbelievably clear with them: just an
                Oliver segment.

                             SANDY
                It's fine.

                          PR WOMAN
                Del and Connie are such putzes.

                             SANDY
                It's fine.     Thank you.   We're
                finished.

                           PR WOMAN
                Huh?   Well, okay. Great, uh----

      Sandy, entered her dressing room, is already shutting the
      door on her.

                                                              108.


140   INT. STUDIO DRESSING ROOM - DAY                                140

      Inside a man lounges reading a magazine.   He looks a little
      like Harry but younger.

                          SANDY
                Thought that would never be over.

      The man rises and kisses her.

                            MAN
                Mmm.    Me too.

                          SANDY
                Let me scrub this crap off my face.


141   INT. COX TOWNHOUSE KITCHEN - DAY                               141

      Osbourne opens a cabinet, muttering:

                          OSBOURNE
                Just for starters...

      He takes out liquor bottles and starts putting them in a
      packing case on the kitchen counter.


142   EXT. WASHINGTON MALL - DAY                                     142

      People sit on benches eating lunches. Harry Pfarrer is on
      the bench where he and Linda met, once again spitting
      sunflower seeds.

      Linda walks up.    They greet each other with a kiss.

                          HARRY
                Hello there sunshine.    You look great.

                          LINDA
                Well you seem better.

      Harry does indeed seem more like his old self.

                          HARRY
                Yeah, I snuck in a little gym time
                this morning. And our exercise last
                night didn't hurt!

      Linda is shocked but secretly pleased:

                            LINDA
                Harry!

                                                          109.


                    HARRY
          Boy, I am through banging my head
          against the wall. I am gonna start
          doing what's right for me.

                    LINDA
          That's how I believe, also.   You have
          to do what's right for----

                    HARRY
          Yeah! Hell yeah! I mean I had a
          shock recently, and I realized you
          know, life is not infinite. No one's
          immortal.

                    LINDA
          No one's immortal.

                    HARRY
          You have to get from each day its
          full, uh, squeeze the juice from every
          day because there but for the grace of
          God----

                    LINDA
          Exactly. The important thing is to
          maintain a positive outlook. Always
          up. Always ebullient.

                    HARRY
          That's right, don't sweat the small
          stuff...

Linda chimes in:

Linda and Harry

                    HARRY (CONT'D)
          ... and it's all small stuff.

Harry reaches for Linda and she slides closer.     He puts an
arm around her.

                    HARRY (CONT'D)
          This is where we first met.   Remember?

                    LINDA
          Of course I do.

                    HARRY
          You never know what the important days
          are, until... until, um...

                                                          110.


The thought drifts away as his gaze fixes on something.    With
his look still fixed:

                    HARRY (CONT'D)
          ... I told myself I was gonna stop
          being paranoid, but... is that guy
          looking at us?

Linda follows his look.

On a bench a short distance away a middle-aged man with
aviator glasses and hair plugs is staring at them.

                    LINDA
              (hastily)
          No, no.

A slightly overweight woman stops tentatively in front of
the man in the aviator glasses and they start to talk.

Linda turns to Harry.

                    LINDA (CONT'D)
          ... Have you found out anything about
          Chad?

                    HARRY
          Nothing yet, I've made a couple calls.
          I don't think it'll take long.

                    LINDA
          Really?

                    HARRY
          Oh yeah, there are so many data bases
          now it's a joke...

Relaxing now that he sees the man in aviator glasses engaged
in conversation, Harry warms to his theme.

                    HARRY (CONT'D)
          ... Back when I was in PP there was
          still some art to finding people. Not
          any more. And now with the cell
          phones? Pretty soon they're gonna
          know where everyone is. Everyone. At
          any given moment. I mean it's almost
          the reality now. You would be amazed.

                    LINDA
          Uh-huh.

                                                         111.


                      HARRY
          Did he----when you left the Jamba Juice
          ----did Chad say anything about where he
          might be going?

                    LINDA
          Oh, I know where he was going.

                      HARRY
          Oh yeah?

                    LINDA
          A residence in Alexandria.    On
          Hillsboro Drive.

Harry has stopped chewing.    He is staring at her.

Linda feels obliged to fill the silence.

                    LINDA (CONT'D)
          ... 2055 Hillsboro.

Harry stares.    Linda doesn't know what to make of his fixed
stare.

                    LINDA (CONT'D)
          ... It's, um. The residence of a guy
          named Osbourne Cox.

Harry is beginning to look sick.

A long silence.

Then, quietly:

                    HARRY
          Who are you?

Now Linda stares, unsure of what to make of the question.

                    HARRY (CONT'D)
          ... WHO ARE YOU?

Linda's eyes widen.   She is a little frightened.

People nearby turn to look.   It is a scene.

                    HARRY (CONT'D)
          ... WHO DO YOU WORK FOR?

Harry reaches up.    He grabs her by the shoulders and shakes.

                    HARRY (CONT'D)
          ... WHO ARE YOU? REALLY?

                                                                  112.


      Linda is at sea.    She answers in a small voice:

                            LINDA
                  I'm ... just ... Linda Litzke.

      Harry stares at her.

      A long beat.

      He leaps to his feet and looks around in a panic.

      His point-of-view, sweeping the park. Nearby, the man with
      plugs, though talking with his date, is looking at him again.
      Farther away, a man sits in a curbside sedan. Watching?
      Hard to say.

      Harry turns and runs.       Linda gapes.

                                LINDA (CONT'D)
                  ... Harry!


143   INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY                            143

      Osbourne sets the packing box heavily      down on a bureau in the
      upstairs bedroom. The box is a third       loaded up with liquor
      bottles. It also holds a mixed drink       which Osbourne now
      takes out. The ice cubes clink as he       sips, poking through
      things in the bureau.

      One drawer holds scarves and accessories and a large case.
      He opens the case and starts dumping jewelry from it into the
      cardboard box.

      Suddenly:

                                OSBOURNE
                  Ow!   Fuck!

      He yanks his hand back and shakes it.      He looks at the ball
      of his thumb. He sucks it.

      He carefully picks a brooch out of the jewelry case and
      flings it across the room.

      He resumes dumping jewelry into his box.

      He suddenly stops:

      A faint knock.    The front door.

      Osbourne waits.

      The knock repeats.

                                                                113.


      Another beat.

      The front door creaks open.

      Osbourne carefully sets down his drink. He steps quietly to
      the closet and pulls a small cedar chest off a high shelf.


144   EXT. WASHINGTON MALL/INT. LINDA'S CAR - DAY                      144

      Linda flings open the door to her car parked on the street
      bordering the mall. She gets in and turns the ignition.

      Pulling into traffic she checks her rear-view, and her look
      snags on:

      A dark four-door sedan pulling out a few cars back. It falls
      in behind her. Its driver is a man in sunglasses. He
      reaches up and touches fingertips to one ear.

      Linda frowns.   She looks forward, glances again at the
      mirror.

      Another dark car pulls into the lane next to the first.    Its
      driver is also a man in sunglasses.


145   INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                           145

      Downstairs, Osbourne rounds the corner from entryway to
      living room, a handgun at the ready. His drink is in his
      other hand. Ice cubes clink as he moves.

      The living room is empty.

      Osbourne advances cautiously.     A quick sidelong look at the
      kitchen.

      Empty.

      He proceeds to the basement door.


146   INT. LINDA'S CAR/EXT. INTERSECTION - DAY                         146

      LINDA DRIVING

      She gives worried glances at her rear-view.

      The light ahead turns yellow, red.

      Cars ahead stop.   Linda stops.

      A rhythmic thudding sound.    It almost makes her car vibrate.

                                                               114.


      She looks around.   She rolls down her window, sticks her head
      out, looks up.

      A black helicopter hovers overhead, rotors thudding. A black-
      clad body leans partway out. The person seems to be looking
      down.

      Linda draws her head back in.

                           LINDA
                 Oh for Pete's sake.


147   INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - BASEMENT                                    147

      Osbourne is slowly descending the stairs, gun and drink in
      either hand, gun up, ice cubes clinking.

      The basement comes slowly into view.

      Someone stands behind his desk, at the computer.

      Osbourne descends further. He stops on the bottom step and
      stares at Ted Treffon, the soulful manager of Hardbodies.
      Ted stares at him.

      A long silence between the two men.

      Then, quietly:

                           OSBOURNE
                 And you are... my wife's lover.

                            TED
                 No.

                           OSBOURNE
                 Then what are you doing here.

      Silence.

      Osbourne takes the last step down.    He advances slowly, gun
      trained on Ted.

      Osbourne's look, holding on Ted, changes.

                           OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
                 ... I know you. You're the guy at the
                 gym.

      Ted licks his lips.

                           TED
                 I'm not here representing Hardbodies.

                                                       115.


                     OSBOURNE
           I know what you represent. You
           represent the idiocy of today.

Ted shakes his head.

                     TED
           I don't represent that, either.

                     OSBOURNE
           Oh yes. You're the guy when I went to
           ask about that moronic woman.

                      TED
           She's not----

                     OSBOURNE
           You're in league with that moronic
           woman. You're part of a league of
           morons.

                        TED
           No.

                     OSBOURNE
           Yes. You're one of the morons I've
           been fighting all my life. My whole
           fucking life. But guess what. Guess
           what. Today I win.

BANG.

                        TED
           Ah!

Ted is shot in the upper chest.

He grabs a three-hole punch from the desktop and flings it at
Osbourne and charges.

                        OSBOURNE
           Oh!

BANG----another shot goes off.

Ted barrels into Osbourne, knocking him over----

                        OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
           ... Oooph!

----and goes on past him, lumbering up the stairs.

Osbourne gets to his feet.

                                            Pink Revision 8/14/07 116.


                             OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
                ... Stop!     Intruder!


148   EXT. COX TOWNHOUSE - DAY                                           148

      Ted staggers out of the house, a hand pressed to his chest.
      He has reached the front lawn when Osbourne emerges, robe
      flapping, pursuing with the hatchet.

                             OSBOURNE
                Intruder!

      He quickly catches up to Ted and whacks at him.

                             TED
                Oh!

      Osbourne whacks him down.       He keeps whacking at him.


149   INT. CHUBB'S OFFICE - DAY                                          149

      Gardner Chubb is behind his desk.

                             GARDNER CHUBB
                Wait.

      Palmer DeBakey Smith is seated across from him.      He freezes.

      A beat.

      Gardner Chubb rubs his forehead.

                          GARDNER CHUBB (CONT'D)
                ... Wait a minute. Where's the
                treasury guy? Pfarrer?

                             PALMER
                Right now?

                             GARDNER CHUBB
                Right now.

                          PALMER
                In a detention room at Washington
                Dulles.                                                        *

                             GARDNER CHUBB
                ... Why?

                           PALMER
                He was trying to board a flight to
                Venezuela.
                           (MORE)

                                                   117.

                    PALMER (CONT'D)
          We had his name on a hot list, the INS
          pulled him. Don't know why he was
          going to Venezuela.

                    GARDNER CHUBB
          You don't know.

                        PALMER
          No sir.

                    GARDNER CHUBB
          We have no extradition with Venezuela.

                    PALMER
          Oh. Uh-huh. Well----what should we do
          with him?

                    GARDNER CHUBB
          For fuck's sake, put him on the next
          flight to Venezuela!

                       PALMER
          Yes sir.     Okay.

Gardner Chubb is weary.

                        GARDNER CHUBB
          Okay.      So the gym manager is dead.

                        PALMER
          Yes sir.

                    GARDENER CHUBB
          The body is----

                        PALMER
          Gone, sir.

                        GARDENER CHUBB
          Okay----

                      PALMER
          But----there was a, uh... snag...

                        GARDNER CHUBB
          What.

                    PALMER
          Well. This analyst, Cox, was
          attacking the gym guy. It was broad
          daylight, on the street. Our man
          there didn't know what to do. He felt
          he had to step in.

                                                   118.


                      GARDNER CHUBB
          Yes?

                    PALMER
          He, uh... He shot the analyst.      He
          shot Cox.

                      GARDNER CHUBB
          Good!    Great! Is he dead?

                      PALMER
          No sir.

Gardner Chubb grimaces.

                    PALMER (CONT'D)
          ... He's in coma. They're not sure
          whether he'll make it. They think,
          they're pretty sure he has no brain
          function.

                    GARDNER CHUBB
          Okay. Okay. If he wakes up we'll
          worry about it then. Jesus, what a
          clusterfuck. That's it then. No one
          else really knows anything. Okay.

                      PALMER
          Um.     Well sir, there is...

                      GARDNER CHUBB
          What.

                      PALMER
          Um...

                      GARDNER CHUBB
          What.

                    PALMER
          There is the woman.   The gym woman.
          Linda Litzke.

                     GARDNER CHUBB
          Oh yeah.   Fuck. Where is she.

                    PALMER
          We picked her up.    We have her.

                    GARDNER CHUBB
          Can we, uh----

                                                   119.


                      PALMER
          She, she, she says she'll play ball if
          we pay for some... I know this sounds
          odd----some surgeries she wants.
          Cosmetic surgery. She says she'll sit
          on everything.

                      GARDNER CHUBB
          How much.

                    PALMER
          There were several procedures.    All
          together they run to, um----

                      GARDNER CHUBB
          Pay it.

                    PALMER
          Yes sir. Should I pay it out of,
          should it be from----

                    GARDNER CHUBB
          One of the black accounts, I don't
          give a shit. The January fund.
          Whatever.

                      PALMER
          Okay.

                      GARDNER CHUBB
          Jesus.    Jesus fucking Christ.

He shakes his head.

                    GARDNER CHUBB (CONT'D)
          ... What did we learn, Palmer.

                    PALMER
          I don't know, sir.

                    GARDNER CHUBB
          I don't fucking know either. I guess
          we learned not to do it again.

                      PALMER
          Yes sir.

                    GARDNER CHUBB
          Although I'm fucked if I know what we
          did.

                      PALMER
          Yes sir.    Hard to say.

                                                           120.


      We pull back from Gardner Chubb, shaking his head.

                           GARDNER CHUBB
                Jesus.   Jesus fucking Christ.

                 Based on the book "Capote: A Biography" by Gerald Clarke

                

               TITLE UP:         "Western Kansas, 1959"

               EXT. FARMHOUSE - MORNING

               The CAMERA follows a SIXTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL, long hair, pretty 
               Sunday church dress, walking toward a peaceful farmhouse. At 
               the door she lifts the knocker. The door opens slightly. The 
               girl turns and looks past the camera at her MOTHER, sitting 
               in an old Plymouth idling in the driveway. Her mother shrugs, 
               motions for her to go inside.

               INT. FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

               The girl walks through the downstairs rooms. In the kitchen, 
               the PHONE is OFF the hook. The girl looks back toward the 
               open front door. She turns toward the stairs, climbs them.

               INT. FARMHOUSE, UPSTAIRS HALL - CONTINUOUS

               She walks down the hall to a BEDROOM DOOR at the end. The 
               door is slightly ajar. She knocks, then enters the room.

               INT. FARMHOUSE, BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

               The girl's POV: the CAMERA pans across the bedroom of a high 
               school coed. We see the desk, the bureau, the bed. On the 
               bed lies NANCY CLUTTER, her wrists and legs bound in rope, 
               SHOT in the head. There is blood on the wall. The sixteen 
               year-old girl stands immobile. Before she starts to scream,

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Camera follows group of partygoers as they mount the stairs: 
               Truman Capote, Barbara (very tall), Rose, Christopher, 
               Williams.

               INT. SMALL, PACKED NEW YORK APARTMENT/KITCHEN - LATER

               The friends are standing in the crowded kitchen -- people 
               are coming in and out -- talking and drinking and laughing.

                                     TRUMAN
                         So Jimmy Baldwin tells me the plot 
                         of his book, and he says to me: the 
                         writing's going well, but I just 
                         want to make sure it's not one of 
                         those problem novels. I said: Jimmy, 
                         your novel's about a Negro homosexual 
                         who's in love with a Jew -- wouldn't 
                         you call that a problem?

               Laughter.

                                     CHRISTOPHER
                         Susan's father had a minor heart 
                         attack, so she's writing more erotic 
                         poems about death and sex.

                                     BARBARA
                         It's so tiresome.

                                     WILLIAMS
                         Hmm. What rhymes with angina?

               Laughter. We see Truman watching everyone laugh. GRAYSON 
               notices, leans in to him. As the rest of the group continues 
               talking, we come closer, hear their conversation.

                                     GRAYSON
                         How's your writing?

                                     TRUMAN
                         Oh, I've got a million ideas of what 
                         to write next -- I just have to choose 
                         one.

                                     GRAYSON
                         Really?

                                     TRUMAN
                         No.

               Their attention is pulled back into the group as:

                                     BARBARA
                         Who would I want to play me? Natalie 
                         Wood.

               Barbara cracks up, chokes on her drink.

               EXT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE/BACK PATIO - MORNING

               Truman sits with his coffee, reading the New York Times. An 
               article catches his eye. He sits up straight, folds the paper 
               over, reads it.

               INT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, STUDY - DAY

               C/U of article being snipped out of PAGE 39 of the Times, 
               November 16, 1959. As the page gets turned around with each 
               snip, we see a small PHOTO of a middle-aged man wearing 
               glasses, with the caption: "FOUND DEAD: Herbert W. Clutter, 
               a wealthy Kansas farmer..." We read the headline: "WEALTHY 
               FARMER, 3 OF FAMILY SLAIN. Parts of the story: "HOLCOMB, 
               Kan., Nov. 15 (UPI) -- ...wheat farmer, his wife... two young 
               children found shot today..."

                         Adorable one? All of a sudden I know 
                         what article I'm going to write for 
                         you next.

               INT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, STUDY/KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

               Truman on the phone, on a long cord, travels between the 
               study and the kitchen as he talks to William Shawn. We hear 
               pieces of the conversation, and see Truman in different parts 
               of the room as he says each bit.

                                     TRUMAN
                         ...never had anything like this happen 
                         to them before. They're used to 
                         sleeping at night with the doors 
                         unlatched....

                         Yes, we should buy stock in Master 
                         Locks -- all of Kansas will be in 
                         the hardware store tomorrow.

                         They have no idea who the killer is. 
                         But it doesn't matter who the killer 
                         is -- what matters is who the 
                         townspeople imagine the killer is. 
                         That's what I want to write about.

               JACK DUNPHY (strong, Irish-American, ten years older than 
               Truman) -- his longtime boyfriend -- enters the front door 
               with a bag of groceries, stops in the hall. He sees Truman 
               on the phone. Truman looks at Jack, though he's still speaking 
               to Shawn --

               EXT. TRAIN TRACKS, OUTSKIRTS OF NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT

               A train barrels toward us, its headlight bright. The train 
               roars past, away from the city.

               INT. TRAIN, MOVING - NIGHT

               Truman hurries through the train, checking his ticket with 
               the sleeper cabins. His long SCARF trails behind. His longer 
               cashmere COAT practically brushes the floor.

               INT. TRUMAN AND HARPER LEE'S CABIN, TRAIN - CONTINUOUS

               Truman opens the door. Inside the cabin his childhood friend 
               from Monroeville, Alabama, NELLE HARPER LEE (yes, that Harper 
               Lee), is reading. She looks up, deadpan --

                         I figured you'd missed it.

               Nelle is a year younger than Truman, dowdy in dress, but 
               smart, tough, sensible. Truman smiles.

                                     TRUMAN
                         God I'm glad you agreed to come. 
                         You're the only one I know with the 
                         qualifications to be both a research 
                         assistant and personal bodyguard.
                              (then, noticing)
                         Oh, Nelle, you poor thing.

               He tries to spruce up her limp silk scarf.

                                     NELLE
                         Off. Truman. Off.
                              (holds his hands)
                         I'm happy to see you too, but I can 
                         still whip your behind.

               TWO BLACK PORTERS enter, one with an enormous TRUNK 
               (Truman's), the other with a sensible SUITCASE (Nelle's).

                                     PORTER #1

                         Mr. Truman Capote, Miss Nelle Harper 
                         Lee. Where would you like these, 
                         sir?

                         That one up there and that one on 
                         the floor.

               He tips them.

                         to have you with us. If you don't 
                         mind my saying, your last book was 
                         even better than the first --

                              (to Nelle)
                         Ma'am.

               The PORTERS leave. Nelle is stunned. Truman fiddles with the 
               trunk locks, his back to Nelle. Silence, then:

                                     NELLE
                         You're pathetic.

               Truman doesn't answer.

                                     NELLE
                         You're pathetic.

                         What?

                                     NELLE
                         You paid them to say that.

               Truman won't look at her. She whacks him.

                                     NELLE
                         You paid them to say that!

                                     TRUMAN
                              (squealing)
                         How'd you know? How did you know?!

                                     NELLE
                         "Just when you think they've gotten 
                         as good as they can get."

                                     TRUMAN
                         You think that was too much?
                              (laughter)
                         I thought that was a good line.

               More laughter. More smacking of Truman. Then it is quiet.

                                     NELLE
                         Pathetic.

               INT. TRUMAN AND HARPER LEE'S CABIN, TRAIN - MORNING

               Nelle's awake, but still in her bunk, looking out the window 
               at the Kansas plains. Truman's dressing, watching her.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               TRAVELING SHOTS of harvested FIELDS, grazing LIVESTOCK,

               The TRAIN chugs across the Kansas flatlands.

               SHOTS of SIGNS outside Garden City: "World's Largest Free 
               Swimpool" and "Howdy, Stranger! Welcome to Garden City. A 
               Friendly Place. "

               EXT. GARDEN CITY RENT-A-CAR - DAY

               Truman and Nelle rent a car. People stare.

               I/E. RENTAL CAR - DAY

               Nelle drives past the main square, Truman in the passenger 
               seat. Truman looks at a photo in THE GARDEN CITY TELEGRAM.

               Truman and Nelle check in. People stare. Nelle notices.

               Truman and Nelle trot up the COURTHOUSE STEPS.

               INT. FINNEY COUNTY COURTHOUSE, LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

               Truman approaches the GUARD DESK.

               Truman CURTSIES.

               INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAY

               In the reception area, ALVIN DEWEY and the two other KBI 
               AGENTS assigned to the Clutter case are getting their jackets 
               on and straightening their ties. They've completely taken 
               over the office. They are: HAROLD "Brother" NYE (34); and 
               ROY "Curly CHURCH (60 - bald). They all smoke.

               Sheriff WALTER SANDERSON -- 60's, kind, overweight -- is 
               office-less (though he and his wife DOROTHY still live on 
               the fourth floor of the Courthouse.) WALTER lurks in the 
               background, nowhere to go, emptying one of many FILLED 
               ASHTRAYS, BOTHERED by the SMOKE. Truman and Nelle enter as:

                                     CHURCH
                         The wife said no more smoking in the 
                         house. I told her, "Fine. Walter's 
                         got a couch upstairs in his apartment. 
                         I'll stay with him and Dorothy till 
                         we're done here."
                              (to Walter)
                         I've got my bag and a carton of 
                         cigarettes in the car.

               WALTER looks uncomfortable. Dewey shakes his head at Church.

               Dewey stubs out his cigarette.

                         About what?

                              pulls out another 
                              cigarette)
                         I care a great deal if we catch 
                         whoever did this.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Yes --

                                     DEWEY
                         As do a lot of folks around here.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Of course.

               Dewey walks out. Nye and Church start out after him.

                                     NYE
                              (to Church)
                         New Yorker?

                                     CHURCH
                         You have press credentials?

                         What's the New Yorker?

                         Magazine.

                         Magazines don't give out --

                                     CHURCH
                         You can come to the news conference 
                         with the rest of them.
                              (tips his hat to Nelle)
                         Sears and Roebuck.

               Nelle and Truman are left alone.

               INT. SPARE COURTROOM - DAY

               Packed with PRESS from all over the Midwest, as well as local 
               Finney County CITIZENS.

               Dewey's leading the press conference from a FOLDING TABLE 
               set up in front of the Judge's bench, flanked by the two 
               other KBI Agents. He's got a cigarette burning in an ashtray. 
               Truman and Nelle stand in the back.

                                     DEWEY
                         I'll talk facts but I won't speculate. 
                         The main fact here we need to be 
                         clear on is not one, but four people 
                         were killed. A lot of folks say Herb 
                         Clutter had to be the main target 
                         because he was dealt with the most 
                         brutally --

                                     JOURNALIST #1
                         Had his throat cut.

                                     DEWEY
                              (a moment)
                         Yes. We'd all like to know why. But 
                         it could've been any one of the family 
                         they were after. We just don't know --

                                     JOURNALIST #2
                         You've identified the murder weapon?

                                     DEWEY
                         Wounds indicate a shotgun, close-
                         range, but no casings were found.

                                     JOURNALIST #1
                         Twelve-gauge, hunting --

                                     DEWEY
                         Right.

                                     JOURNALIST #1
                         They were all shot in the face?

               Dewey looks at the journalist. Then, evenly:

                                     DEWEY
                         No. Nancy in the back of the head.

                                     JOURNALIST #2
                         Is there any evidence of, I'm sorry, 
                         sexual molestation of the women?

                                     DEWEY
                         No.

                                     JOURNALIST #2
                         Anything else stolen?

                                     DEWEY
                         Kenyon's radio seems to be the only...

                                     JOURNALIST #3
                         The boy was sixteen?

                                     DEWEY
                         Fifteen. Nancy was sixteen.

                                     JOURNALIST #2
                         It's her friend that found them?

                                     DEWEY
                         Laura Kinney.

                                     JOURNALIST #2
                         Spell that?

                                     DEWEY
                         I assume you're okay with the Laura 
                         part. K-I-N-N-E-Y. But, please, leave 
                         her be.

               Lots of folks try to talk at once, one OLD MAN makes himself 
               heard above the rest:

                                     OLD MAN
                         There's talk of a bunch of Mexicans, 
                         a whole bunch of Mexicans...

                                     DEWEY
                              (standing, stubs out 
                              cigarette)
                         George, it's good to see you again. 
                         I do have an opinion whether this 
                         was the work of one man or a whole 
                         bunch, as you said, but it doesn't 
                         matter a whole lot whether it was 
                         Mexicans or Methodists or Eskimos. 
                         We're going to find whoever did this. 
                         Four good people from our community 
                         are dead. Let's remember that. Okay 
                         with you?
                              (holds up a notice)
                         The West Kansas Farm Committee's 
                         offering a thousand dollar reward 
                         for information leading to an arrest. 
                         Please print that.
                              (moving to the exit)
                         Thank you all for coming.

               The room is immediately noisy as Dewey makes his way to the 
               door, pulling a pack of cigarettes from his pocket, followed 
               by Church and Nye. He's about to step out when Truman catches 
               his eye. Dewey exits.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. RENTAL CAR - LATE AFTERNOON

               Nelle drives while consulting a MAP. Truman is leaning back, 
               looking out at the passing farms through the window. He speaks 
               almost to himself.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Mr. Dewey's protective of the 
                         Clutters. I wonder how well he knew 
                         them...

               Nelle glances over at him. He doesn't notice.

                                     TRUMAN
                         He was foxy with that old man.
                              (turns to Nelle)
                         Are you ever gonna let me drive?

                                     NELLE
                         Truman, you're a menace. You can 
                         barely see over the wheel.

               Truman looks back out the window at the farms, leans back.

                                     NELLE
                         This make you miss Alabama?

                                     TRUMAN
                              (rolling window down, 
                              shakes his head)
                         Not even a little bit.

               He leans his head out, closes his eyes.

               EXT. CLUTTER FARM - SUNSET

               Nelle pulls their car to the side of the COUNTY ROAD which 
               fronts the CLUTTER FARM. We recognize the FARMHOUSE as the 
               one in which Nancy Clutter was found dead. A HIGHWAY PATROLMAN 
               (20 years old) sits in a CRUISER parked up the driveway.

               CRIME SCENE TAPE marks the perimeter of the property. Truman 
               and Nelle get out of their car, stand at the foot of the 
               driveway, gazing at the lonely farmhouse.

                                                                  FADE OUT.

               EXT. HOLCOMB HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING

               A gorgeous fall day. Crowds of kids arriving at school. Many 
               are SOMBER. As Truman and Nelle walk toward the kids, some 
               look warily at Truman and give him a wide berth.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Hello.

               Kids back away. Nelle notices. She leaves Truman, walks up 
               to a group of THREE GIRLS.

                                     NELLE
                         Morning.

                                     GIRL #1
                         Hi.

                                     NELLE
                         Can any of you tell me where I'd 
                         find Laura Kinney?

                                     GIRL #1
                         Oh, um...

               The girl glances toward the school entrance where LAURA KINNEY 
               (who found Nancy Clutter's body) walks with DANNY BURKE (tall, 
               17).

                                     NELLE
                              (gently)
                         Is that her? With the tall boy?

                                     GIRL #2
                         Yeah. With Danny Burke.

                                     NELLE
                         Danny Burke?
                              (Girl #2 nods)
                         Thank you.

               As Nelle leaves, Girl #1 turns to her friend:

                                     GIRL #2
                         Oh, quiet yourself, Janice.

               Nelle sees Truman on his way toward Laura, calls out --

                                     NELLE
                         Truman. Truman --

               Truman doesn't hear. She watches Truman approach them. Laura 
               backs away. Danny leads her off. Nelle walks over to Truman, 
               looks at him for several moments.

                                     NELLE
                         These folks live their lives in a 
                         particular way. You need to consider 
                         adapting yourself to that fact.

                                     TRUMAN
                         What --

                                     NELLE
                         -- I'm gonna find out where those 
                         two kids live. Maybe you'll let me 
                         do that alone?

               Nelle leaves. On Truman, as the bell rings and the mass of 
               teenagers starts to enter the school.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MAIN STREET, GARDEN CITY - DAY

               Truman walks alone, sees the Gilbart Funeral Home. He removes 
               his hat, slips past the few people standing outside.

               INT. GILBART FUNERAL HOME - CONTINUOUS

               Warm but slightly tacky. Some people are engaged in hushed 
               conversation at the reception area. Truman slips past, into 
               the back room.

               INT. BACK ROOM, GILBART FUNERAL HOME - CONTINUOUS

               No people, low light. Four CLOSED CASKETS at the back of the 
               room. Truman walks over slowly. After a moment, he checks to 
               make sure he's alone. Then he LIFTS THE TOP of one of the 
               caskets. It's Bonnie Clutter's body, in a long-sleaved navy-
               blue dress; but her head is wrapped in layers and layers of 
               white cotton gauze, and lacquered with a shiny substance -- 
               like an enormous cocoon. Truman stares.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. WALKER HOTEL, TRUMAN'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Truman on the PHONE to Jack in Brooklyn. One of Truman's 
               trunks is open, displaying bottles of liquor, packaged and 
               tinned gourmet food, and stacks of unused yellow legal pads. 
               He drinks, standing at the window.

                                     JACK (OVER PHONE)
                         I think I scared a friend of yours 
                         this morning. He came looking for 
                         you while I was writing.

                                     TRUMAN
                         You hate my friends.

                                     JACK
                         I wouldn't say hate. So long as they 
                         don't knock on my door.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I saw the bodies today.

                                     JACK
                         Which?

                         The Clutters. I looked inside the

                         That's horrifying.

                                     TRUMAN
                         It comforts me -- something so 
                         horrifying it's freeing. It's a 
                         relief. Normal life falls away.
                              (beat)
                         But, then, I was never much for normal 
                         life --

                                     JACK
                         No, you weren't.

                         People here won't talk to me. They 
                         want someone like you, like Nelle. 
                         Me they hate.

                         I can't think of a single quality I 
                         share with Nelle.

                                     JACK
                         Maybe manliness.

                         My point exactly.

                         It's why I left the Midwest in the 
                         first place. I knew I could only 
                         find someone like you in New York 
                         City.

               On Truman, gazing at the EMPTY TOWN SQUARE below.

               EXT. GARDEN CITY, VARIOUS - EARLY MORNING

               A SHOPKEEPER sweeps the sidewalk. There are THANKSGIVING 
               DECORATIONS in his shop window.

               A SCHOOL BUS picks up a SMALL BOY at the intersection of a 
               DIRT ROAD and the paved COUNTY ROAD.

               A SMALL BRIDGE over the Arkansas river. Below them, men are 
               sifting the riverbed with nets, moving slowly downstream.

               INT. WALKER HOTEL, LOBBY - EARLY MORNING

               Nelle waits by the FRONT DESK. The ELEVATOR DOORS open and 
               Truman emerges. He is DRESSED SOBERLY -- NO LONG SCARF, NO 
               LONG COAT. He walks toward Nelle, then TURNS as if he's a 
               runway model, walks away, turns again and walks back. He 
               stops a few feet in front of her. Nelle refuses to smile.

               EXT. HOLCOMB TOWN ROAD - EARLY MORNING

               Danny Burke walks down the road with a bookbag over his 
               shoulder. Nelle approaches him, Truman keeps his distance.

                                     NELLE
                         Danny?
                              (Danny stops)
                         Would you mind terribly if I walked 
                         with you for a bit?

               He shrugs. They walk together.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Laura opens door to Truman and Nelle.

               INT. LAURA KINNEY HOUSE, KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

               Nelle and Laura Kinney sit at the table. Truman stands at 
               the counter.

                                     LAURA
                         I thought you were from the FBI with 
                         your long coat.

                         Is that so?

                                     LAURA
                         That's why I ran off.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I've been getting a lot of that 
                         lately.

               Truman smiles. Laura smiles back, amused, a bit comforted.

                                     LAURA
                         It's fine talking to you all. 
                         Practically nobody around here wants 
                         to talk since what happened.

                              (Laura nods)
                         Nancy was your best friend.

                                     LAURA
                         She was my best friend.

               They're quiet for a few moments.

                         Pretty shattered. Nothing terrible 
                         ever happened to him before. Nancy 
                         just started wearing his ring again 
                         after this huge fight -- Mr. Clutter 
                         was trying to get her to end it 'cause 
                         Danny's Catholic.

                         Methodist. Danny was the last person 
                         at the house that night. That's why 
                         Mr. Dewey's keeps interviewing him -- 
                         they don't think he had anything to 
                         do with it -- just to see if he 
                         remembers anything unusual and all.

                         People in town seem to wonder if he 
                         was involved.

                                     LAURA
                         That's been real hard for Danny.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Oh, it's the hardest -- when people 
                         have a notion about you and it's 
                         impossible to convince them otherwise. 
                         Since I was a child folks have thought 
                         they had me pegged because of the 
                         way I look and the way I talk. They're 
                         always wrong.
                              (looks at her)
                         Do you know what I mean?

               Laura stares at him and nods. He's clearly struck a chord.

                                     LAURA
                         I want to show you something.

               She goes in the door to the GROUND FLOOR APARTMENT. They see 
               her through the LACE CURTAINS getting something from her 
               DESK, which is stacked with books. Truman whispers to Nelle:

                                     TRUMAN
                         Not one person here understands her.

               Laura returns. She hugs a SMALL BOOK to her chest. After a 
               moment, she holds it out to them.

                                     LAURA
                         Maybe you'll get a better picture of 
                         Nancy. And the family.

               Nelle and Truman walk quickly back to the hotel. Nelle has 
               the diary open.

               then writing quickly on one of many YELLOW LEGAL PADS, handing 
               the pages of interview dialogue to Nelle. He's exhausted. 
               Nelle stops typing a moment, looks through the pages Truman

               She turns back to the typewriter. She types. Truman lies 
               there, looking at the ceiling for a few moments. He closes

                              (soberly)
                         Thank you for having us.

                                     MARIE
                              (mock serious)
                         Thank you.
                              (then:)
                         Get yourselves in here.
                              (turns and walks into 
                              the house)
                         Alvin! Get your pants on. They're 
                         here.

               On Nelle and Truman, surprised.

               INT. DEWEY HOME, LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

               A FOOTBALL GAME plays on the television. No one's watching. 
               We can HEAR Alvin on the phone in his study at the back of 
               the house.

               INT. DEWEY HOME, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

               Truman and Marie at the stove. Nelle sits at the kitchen 
               table. Truman has his jacket off and an apron on, as does 
               Marie. They are peering into a POT OF BLACK-EYED PEAS. Marie 
               is shaking in drops of HOT PEPPER TABASCO.

                                     TRUMAN
                         More. More.

                                     MARIE
                         Alvin will hate this.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Yes, but we who know the truth will 
                         love it.

                                     MARIE
                              (laughs)
                         I have to stop.
                              (then)
                         I cannot believe you're from New 
                         Orleans. I miss it so much.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I only lived there for a short while 
                         but my Mama was born and bred.

                                     MARIE
                         You know something -- Alvin pretends 
                         he doesn't know who you are, but the 
                         minute you came to town he read your 
                         books. He had one of his men pick up 
                         "Breakfast at Tiffany's" in Kansas 
                         City 'cause it's banned from the 
                         library here.

                                     TRUMAN
                         What did Mr. Dewey think?

                                     MARIE
                         He liked it more than he's willing 
                         to admit.

                                     TRUMAN
                         How very foxy.

               Marie smiles at that word used to describe her husband.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Mama would've put in half the bottle 
                         by now.

               Beat.

                                     MARIE
                         Alright, one more shake.

               INT. DEWEY HOME, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

               Alvin walks toward the kitchen. He smokes. He looks exhausted. 
               He hears SQUEALS of laughter.

               INT. DEWEY HOME, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

               Alvin enters. They all stop laughing and look at him. nods 
               to Truman and Nelle.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Hello.

                                     NELLE
                         Hi.

               Silence. Marie sips her drink.

                                     MARIE
                         How you doing, foxy?

               She cracks up.

               INT. DEWEY HOME, DINING ROOM - LATER

               The remains of dinner. The kids have left. The bottle of J&B 
               sits on the table, half-empty. Marie's a bit drunk. Everyone's 
               PLATE is clean except for Alvin's, on which sits a MOUND of 
               uneaten black-eyed peas. Truman is mid-story.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I was writing the script as they 
                         were filming, all that time in Italy. 
                         I'd work like mad all day long and 
                         then dash down to the bar around 
                         midnight to hand in the next day's 
                         scenes. Humphrey had just about moved 
                         into the hotel bar --

                                     MARIE
                              (whispers to Alvin)
                         Humphrey Bogart.

               Alvin knows.

                                     TRUMAN
                         -- where he and John drank every 
                         night --

                                     MARIE
                              (to Alvin)
                         John Huston.

               Alvin knows.

                                     TRUMAN
                         -- and I mean drank, like famished 
                         water buffaloes. Well -- I'd only 
                         just handed them the final scene 
                         when the bellhop told me I had a 
                         phone call. It was my stepfather, 
                         Joe Capote, calling to say that my 
                         mother had died. I flew home to New 
                         York -- terribly distraught -- but 
                         when I got to the apartment I could 
                         see that Joe was in even worse shape 
                         than I was. He grabbed my hands and 
                         sat me down at the kitchen table, 
                         and he said to me, "Talk. Talk about 
                         anything, any subject in the world. 
                         Don't worry whether it will interest 
                         me or not. Just talk so I won't break 
                         down." And I did. He couldn't bear 
                         to be alone with his thoughts. It 
                         was too painful.

               It's quiet for a moment, then Marie looks at Alvin.

                                     MARIE
                         It's been a hard couple weeks for 
                         Alvin. He and Herb Clutter were good 
                         friends. From church.

                                     DEWEY
                         Marie --

                                     MARIE
                         Oh come on, Alvin. These are good 
                         people.

               Finally, Dewey looks at Truman and Nelle.

               INT. DEWEY HOME, STUDY - NIGHT

               Alvin shows Truman and Nelle the CRIME SCENE PHOTOS from the 
               Clutter murders. We see the four corpses, BOUND and SHOT, 
               the bloody footprints in the Clutter basement. Truman and 
               Nelle stare at the photos of Nancy and Kenyon. Then, quietly --

                                     TRUMAN
                         Who would put a pillow under the 
                         boy's head just to shoot him? Why 
                         would they tuck Nancy in?

                                     DEWEY
                              (surprised by the 
                              insight)
                         I want to know the same thing.

               Truman hands Nelle one of the photos. She looks at it --

                                     NELLE
                         Twisted notion of tenderness.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. DEWEY HOME - NIGHT

               Truman and Nelle are leaving. Alvin and Marie stand in the 
               front door. Nelle kisses Marie.

                                     NELLE
                         Thank you.

                                     MARIE
                         So many of my friends would love to 
                         meet you.

                                     NELLE
                         That'd be fine --

                                     TRUMAN
                              (to Dewey)
                         You don't have to worry. I'm not 
                         going to write about this until 
                         everything's over.

                                     DEWEY
                         I'm not worried. I know what room 
                         you're in at the hotel. And I know 
                         where you live in Brooklyn.

               Truman smiles.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. GARDEN CITY - VARIOUS - DAY AND NIGHT

               MUSIC: "Have yourself a Merry Little Christmas..." Main 
               Street, CHRISTMAS LIGHTS in the TREES.

               The HARDWARE STORE, with Santa Claus DECORATIONS in the window 
               and a "ONE WEEK LEFT TO BUY YOUR GIFTS..." sign.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. CLUTTER FARM - LATE AFTERNOON

               Truman and Nelle walk with PETE HOLT (70, very frail) on the 
               Clutter property. Apples rot on the ground, the trees are 
               bare, signs of disrepair are beginning to weather the house.

                                     HOLT
                              (re the apples)
                         I'd of picked them up but I haven't 
                         been myself. Mind you, I make the 
                         walk out here every day, check the 
                         house, make sure the pipes don't 
                         freeze -- that sort of item. The 
                         least I can do for Mr. Clutter.

                                     NELLE
                         How long have you worked here?

                                     HOLT
                         1940 -- a lotta years. The wife too, 
                         cleaning the house. Cooking.

                                     NELLE
                         Well, she's marvelous. Lunch was 
                         wonderful.

                                     HOLT
                              (ignoring this)
                         She had a hard job after what all 
                         happened. Cleaning. I burned most of 
                         the rest -- mattresses -- too far of 
                         a mess.
                              (then, looks at them)
                         I've asked around some -- if anyone's 
                         looking for a strong hand.

               They don't know what to say. Finally, he looks away.

                                     HOLT
                         I don't think they'll be able to 
                         sell the place till they catch the 
                         ones that did it.
                              (beat)
                         That's what I hear anyhow.

               Silence as the three of them look out over the barren fields.

               INT. CLUTTER HOUSE, BONNIE'S BEDROOM - DUSK

               Just the bed-frame -- the mattress is gone. Truman and Nelle 
               find her Bible on the bedside table, her bookmark, see the 
               painting of Jesus walking on water. Pete Holt stands off to 
               the side, waiting patiently.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. WALKER HOTEL LOBBY, GARDEN CITY - NIGHT

               Through the front window we see a Christmas tree in the lobby.

               INT. WALKER HOTEL, TRUMAN'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Jazzy Christmas music on the RADIO. Nelle sits in the big 
               armchair with a drink. She laughs. We HEAR Jack on the phone:

                                     JACK
                         You're celebrating.

               We see Truman wearing a YELLOW SILK SHORT ROBE with white 
               lace, bare legs. He's on the phone and walking, for Nelle's 
               enjoyment, back and forth, like a runway model.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Remember Nelle's manuscript she sent 
                         me in New York?

                                     JACK
                         Mockingbird. Killing a Mockingbird. 
                         You said it was good.

                                     TRUMAN
                         And I was right. She just heard 
                         Lipincott wants to publish it.

                                     JACK
                              (pause)
                         Well. Jesus. That's terrific. Tell 
                         her congratulations.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Congratulations.
                              (covers phone, mouths 
                              to Nelle:)
                         Jealous.

                                     JACK
                         Just promise you'll be home by 
                         Christmas.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I can't leave now Jack -- I mean it 
                         was hard at first, but now I'm 
                         practically the mayor.

               He vamps. Nelle laughs.

                                     JACK
                         Alright.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I want to come home -- I do. Though 
                         if they catch whoever did this, who 
                         knows what -- I'll probably be here 
                         til next Christmas.

                                     JACK
                         Right. I'll let you go.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Jack, we'll go away this spring to 
                         write. Maybe Spain...

                                     JACK
                         Alright, Truman.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Bye.
                              (hangs up)
                         The poor boy misses me.

               Goes to the mini-bar to fix a drink.

                         You remember when we were kids?

                                     TRUMAN
                         I was never a kid. I was born fully 
                         formed.

                         I had no idea what a homosexual was. 
                         But I knew whatever they were, you 
                         were one of 'em.

               Truman puts down his drink and marches out of the room, shuts 
               the door. Nelle's unsure whether she really insulted him. 
               From the HALL, we hear a WOMAN SHRIEK, and a MAN saying:

                                     MAN IN HALL (O.S.)
                         Oh. Uh. Oh. Excuse us.

               Truman runs back in, shuts door. They crack up.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. DEWEY HOME - NIGHT, CHRISTMAS EVE, ESTABLISHING

               Tasteful Christmas lights strung on the BUSHES. A WREATH on 
               the FRONT DOOR.

               INT. DEWEY HOME, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Truman, Nelle, Marie and Alvin. Drinks. A FULL ASHTRAY on 
               the coffee table in front of Alvin. He's distracted, smoking. 
               Marie holds a WOMEN'S MAGAZINE, checking what Truman says 
               with what's written there.

                                     TRUMAN
                              (quickly, as if 
                              reciting)
                         -- girdle up -- no extra bulges -- 
                         if you're dressed right for him when 
                         he gets home, the evening should be 
                         smooth sailing. Bon voyage, gals.

                                     MARIE
                         I can't believe you got this whole 
                         page -- I only read it to you once!

                         TRUMAN
                 I've trained myself.

               Truman looks at Nelle.

                         TRUMAN
                 I have 94 percent 
                 recall.

                              (laughing)
                         You cut that out.

               Alvin stubs out his cigarette -- though it still burns. He 
               stands.

                                     MARIE
                         You believe that Alvin?

                                     ALVIN
                         Impressive.

               He walks out. Silence.

                                     MARIE
                         I'm sorry. He's upset.
                              (stubs out cigarette)
                         -- smoking three packs a day.
                              (then)
                         Two men did it. They know who. One 
                         of them used to have a cellmate who 
                         gave him up for the thousand dollar 
                         reward. They passed through Kansas 
                         City last week writing bad checks -- 
                         by the time Alvin's boys got up there 
                         they'd skipped out again.

                                     NELLE
                         Where to?

                                     MARIE
                         They have no idea.

               INT. DEWEY HOME, DINING ROOM - LATER

               Christmas dinner. Truman, Nelle, Marie and Alvin have just 
               sat down. They wait for the Dewey boys -- Alvin Jr. and Paul. 
               We hear them in the living room horsing around.

                                     DEWEY
                         Alvin. Paul. Now.

               It's quiet for a second. Then something crashes and breaks.

                                     DEWEY
                         Damnit.
                              (gets up, goes)
                         Come here.

                         Alvin ...

               Phone RINGS.

                                     DEWEY (O.S.)
                         Alvin Jr. Get over here.

                                     ALVIN JR. (O.S.)
                         Dad, the phone.

                                     DEWEY (O.S.)
                         Paul. Back to the table.

               Dewey returns to the dining room, pushing Paul ahead of him.

                                     DEWEY
                         Sit.

               Alvin Jr. enters.

                                     ALVIN JR.
                         Dad?

                                     MARIE
                         Tell them we're at dinner, Alvin.

                                     ALVIN JR.
                         Dad?

                                     DEWEY
                         Not now, Alvin.

               Alvin Jr. leaves. We hear the PHONE being HUNG UP. Alvin Jr. 
               returns and sits. They all get ready to say grace, then:

                                     ALVIN JR.
                         You need to call the Chief of Police 
                         in Las Vegas when you have a minute.

               Everyone looks at Dewey.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               EXT. COURTHOUSE SQUARE, GARDEN CITY - LATE AFTERNOON

               OVER BLACK SCREEN we hear the voice of a RADIO ANNOUNCER.

                                     RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                         ...This is KERG radio, Garden City. 
                         A friendly broadcast from a friendly 
                         place. Our lead story:

               Slowly, the sounds of a CROWD emerge in the background.

               FADE UP ON: HIGH SCHOOL kids sitting on the hood and front 
               seat of a CHEW parked at the edge of a CROWD of 200 people. 
               Truman watches. It is COLD. A fat, shivering CO-ED reads the 
               headline in the Kansas City Star: "Police Fear Lynch Mob." 
               The CAR RADIO is on.

                                     RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                         ...newsmen from six states have joined 
                         scores of Kansans as they await the 
                         arrival of confessed killers Perry 
                         Smith and Richard Hickock. KBI 
                         officers have been driving the Clutter 
                         family's brutal killers nonstop 
                         from...

               Truman moves from the car into the large crowd. Old ladies; 
               ranchers; local businessmen; moms with kids; journalists 
               INTERVIEWING citizens; photographers lined up at the bottom 
               of the COURTHOUSE STEPS. We hear snippets of conversation as 
               we pass. A CITIZEN is being interviewed by a JOURNALIST; a 
               MOM WITH BABY standing with a FRIEND; a MIDDLE-AGED man in 
               an overcoat CRYING silently.

               Truman approaches Nelle and Marie Dewey, standing together 
               at the curb in front of the courthouse, near the 
               photographers. They are talking quietly, turn to Truman --

                                     NELLE
                         Hey.

               We hear LOUD CROWD NOISE at the south end of the square. A 
               CONVOY of FOUR CARS enters the square. It pulls around to 
               the front of the courthouse. STATE TROOPERS spill out of the 
               lead and rear CARS. Nye gets out of the second car. He opens 
               the back door. The crowd falls SILENT. Two state troopers 
               get DICK HICKOCK -- handcuffed, pale -- out of the car and 
               lead him up the steps. FLASH. FLASH.

               Dewey and Church open the third car's back door. Silence. 
               They retrieve PERRY SMITH. Perry is extremely SHORT, STRONG, 
               ODDLY BEAUTIFUL, with the dark skin and hair of his American 
               Indian mother, and the pug features of his Irish father. As 
               he stands, he has trouble straightening his stubby LEGS, as 
               if they are arthritic. Truman stares.

                                     MARIE
                              (whispers to Truman)
                         Motorcycle accident. He broke them 
                         and they never healed right.
                              (Truman looks at her)
                         Alvin told me.

               Truman watches Perry, transfixed. Perry seems terrified of 
               the crowd, all the faces, like a child. Perry scans the crowd. 
               His eyes fall on Truman. FLASH. FLASH. Truman and Perry look 
               at each other as Perry is led slowly past. At the top of the 
               steps the COURTHOUSE DOORS slam shut.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               EXT. SHERIFF'S RESIDENCE (4TH FLOOR OF COURTHOUSE ) - 
               MORNING

               FADE IN: Truman knocks on the door, a NEWSPAPER, a BOOK, and 
               a PAPER BAG in his hand. On the door it says "SHERIFF'S 
               RESIDENCE - PRIVATE". Dorothy Sanderson opens the door.

                                     DOROTHY
                         Truman Capote.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Dorothy Sanderson. I figured you'd 
                         be left alone this morning by that 
                         hard-working husband of yours.
                              (holds up bag)
                         So I have breakfast.
                              (holds up paper)
                         I have news.
                              (book)
                         And I have literature. My friend 
                         Jack mailed me the book you wanted.

               He presents book. Dorothy, flattered, takes it, reads the 
               inscription inside.

                                     DOROTHY
                         "For the maiden of the Midwest, the 
                         priestess of the plains, the queen 
                         of the kitchen: my first novel. 
                         Truman."

               It is "Other Voices, Other Rooms" and we see on the back of 
               it the INFAMOUS JACKET PHOTO of Truman at 23 draped sexily 
               on a couch. Truman curtsies. The PHONE RINGS.

                                     DOROTHY
                         You're too much. Go on into the living 
                         room, lemme grab that -- it's been 
                         ringing all morning.

               INT. SHERIFF'S RESIDENCE, FOYER - CONTINUOUS

               Truman walks into the residence. To the left is the kitchen; 
               to the right is the living room. Truman looks back at Dorothy -- 
               she's still on the phone. He heads for the kitchen.

               INT. SHERIFF'S RESIDENCE, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

               Truman walks slowly through the doorway of the large kitchen. 
               On the far side of the kitchen is a JAIL CELL. Inside the 
               cell is PERRY SMITH. (Now we know why Truman came here.)

               Truman STARES. Perry doesn't see him -- he's resting his 
               head on a small table, the tip of his THUMB in his mouth. 
               The chair seems too tall for Perry. He looks like a lonely 
               kindergartner, told to take his afternoon nap. After several 
               moments, Dorothy enters, flustered:

                                     DOROTHY
                         Oh. Truman. I meant in there.
                              (points to living 
                              room)
                         I... um...

               Perry sits up quickly, rubs his legs.

                                     DOROTHY
                         It's the women's cell. It's hardly 
                         ever used. But they wanted to, um, 
                         separate... Please. Let's sit in the 
                         living room. I'll set up in the living 
                         room.

               She gathers a tray of Truman's PASTRIES, and COFFEE CUPS.

                                     DOROTHY
                         Come.

               She goes -- Truman starts to follow, then lingers.

                                     TRUMAN
                         They put you in the women's cell.

                                     PERRY
                         Among other indignities.

               Perry's voice is oddly high, whispery -- special words are 
               precisely enunciated.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Well... she's a good cook.

                                     PERRY
                         She's scared of me.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I think so am I. A little bit.

                                     PERRY
                         Are you?
                              (a moment, then:)
                         You have any aspirin? My legs --

               Dorothy's in the doorway.

                                     DOROTHY
                         Um. Truman? All set.

               Truman looks at Dorothy, looks back at Perry.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I'm sorry.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. COURTROOM - DAY

               Judge ROLAND TATE, white-haired, imperious, bangs his gavel. 
               The packed crowd quiets down. Perry and Dick sit at the 
               defense table chewing JUICY FRUIT GUM. Next to them: their 
               aged court-appointed lawyer, Franklin Weeks (70).

               Dick wears a SHIRT AND TIE. Perry wears jeans rolled up at 
               the cuff, his SHIRT OPEN at the collar. He draws on a piece 
               of paper with a STUBBY PENCIL -- a rather good picture of a 
               LARGE PARROT. Truman sits with Nelle, watching Perry --

                                     TRUMAN
                              (murmurs)
                         His feet don't touch the floor.

                                     JUDGE TATE
                         In the matter of the State of Kansas 
                         v. Richard Eugene Hickock and Perry 
                         Edward Smith this Court has been 
                         informed by counsel -- Mr. Weeks -- 
                         that defendants wish to waive their 
                         right to Preliminary Hearing. Mr. 
                         Hickock, is that your wish?

               Hickock looks at Weeks. Weeks nods. Hickock stands.

                                     HICKOCK
                              (unconvincing)
                         Yessir. Yes.

               Hickock sits. Truman whispers to Nelle --

                                     TRUMAN
                         Why are they doing that?

                                     JUDGE TATE
                         Mr. Smith.

                                     PERRY
                              (stands... then:)
                         I ask that the waiver be effectuated.

               Judge Tate looks at him for a moment --

                                     JUDGE TATE
                         So noted.
                              (bangs gavel)
                         We're adjourned.

               Crowd gets up. Much talk. Truman watches Perry and Dick 
               through the forest of bodies. They are led away in handcuffs. 
               Franklin Weeks stands slowly, then begins gathering his things -- 
               he's old and it takes him ages to collect his papers. Truman 
               watches.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SHERIFF'S RESIDENCE - AFTERNOON

               Truman knocks. He holds a PIE. Dorothy answers.

                                     DOROTHY
                         Mr. Capote.

                                     TRUMAN
                              (offers pie)
                         Madame Sanderson.

                                     DOROTHY
                         Is that for the two of us to share? 
                         Or for me to eat alone while you 
                         talk to our guest?

               Truman is caught. He smiles.

               INT. SHERIFF'S RESIDENCE, KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

               Truman sits near the bars of the cell. Perry draws on a scrap 
               of paper at the small table. Dorothy watches from the door 
               to the living room. The BOOK Truman gave to Dorothy lies on 
               the floor next to Perry's meticulously made bed.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Was it your choice to waive the 
                         hearing?

               Perry doesn't answer. Dorothy checks her watch, leaves. Truman 
               takes a bottle of BAYER ASPIRIN out of his pocket.

                                     TRUMAN
                         You still need some?
                              (Perry doesn't move)
                         Give me your hand.

               Perry extends his hand through the bars. As Truman shakes 
               some aspirin into it --

                                     PERRY
                         I could kill you if you got too close.

               Perry puts the aspirin in his mouth, CHEWS THEM, holds out 
               his hand for more. Truman gives him more, which Perry puts 
               in his pocket for later.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Would you like some water?

               Perry shakes his head. Silence.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Mrs. Sanderson lent you my book --

                                     PERRY
                         He said we'd curry favor with the 
                         Judge if we waived our rights.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Who did?

                                     PERRY
                         The lawyer.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Okay.

               Truman nods, not wanting to push this any further. Perry 
               picks up the book, holds it out through the bars.

                                     PERRY
                         Your picture's undignified. People 
                         recall first impressions.

                                     TRUMAN
                         What's been your first impression?

                                     PERRY
                         You want something.

                                     TRUMAN
                         From you?

               Dorothy pokes her head in from the living room.

                                     DOROTHY
                         Truman. Walter's gonna be home soon.

                                     TRUMAN
                              (to Perry)
                         I just want permission to talk.
                              (then)
                         Has anyone else visited?

               Perry doesn't answer.

                                     DOROTHY
                         Truman --

                                     TRUMAN
                         Will you tell me if you need anything? 
                         I can have whatever you want sent 
                         from New York.
                              (no answer)
                         Will you do that?

               On Perry, considering whether to trust this man.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         I'm writing a book. It's too much 
                         for a single article -- this town, 
                         the killers most of all -- you will

               INT. HICKOCK'S JAIL CELL - DAY

               Perry has been placed in an adjoining cell for the afternoon. 
               He COMBS his greased hair in a mirror. A camera FLASHES.

               Nelle and Truman sit outside the cells. Franklin Weeks dozes 
               off to the side. RICHARD AVEDON -- small, dark, wiry, 
               flamboyant -- is snapping photos of a bare-chested Hickock 
               in the next cell, particularly his TATTOOS, while Hickock 
               chatters away.

                                     HICKOCK
                         Perry, honey. You look terrific...

               Perry is embarrassed, glances over at Truman. FLASH.

                                     HICKOCK
                         Calm yourself down, sweetheart.

               Perry glances at Nelle. She MOTIONS to him that his SHIRT is 
               buttoned wrong. Perry fixes it, looks back at her.

               Hickock notices Truman gazing at his tattoos -- the one on 
               his CHEST: the word PEACE, with a cross radiating rays of 
               light.

                                     HICKOCK
                         Be patient, Capote. Maybe later 
                         they'll send you my skin.

                         I have the perfect place for it, 
                         over the hearth.

               Hickock smiles. FLASH. Truman looks over at Perry, sitting 
               alone. Truman starts to remove his TIE.

               PHOTOS, in quick succession: Of Hickock pulling up his sleeve 
               to reveal his tattoos. Of Perry combing his HAIR. FLASH. The 
               GRINNING CAT on Hickock's hand. FLASH. Perry looking directly 
               at the camera. FLASH.

               Series of shots in and around the courthouse:

               TITLE UP:             "One month later"

               An officer approaches down a long hallway. A janitor cleans 
               the basin of the water fountain. Spectators are drawn into 
               the courthouse. The officer opens the courtroom doors. A 
               crescendo of sounds.

               INT. COURTROOM - DAY

               Spectators take seats. The jury files back into the box. 
               Perry and Dick chew gum. Perry wears TRUMAN'S TIE, and draws

               Truman shrugs. Nelle raises her eyebrows. Judge Tate GAVELS 
               loudly, looks to the jury.

                                     JUDGE TATE
                         Members of the jury. Have you reached 
                         a verdict?

                                     FOREMAN

               Perry and Dick stand. Judge Tate turns back to the Foreman.

                         of the crime of murder in the first

                         What is your verdict?

                                     FOREMAN
                         Guilty. On all counts.

                                     JUDGE TATE
                         Have you unanimously reached a 
                         sentence.

                         What is the sentence?

                                     FOREMAN
                         Death.

               Judge nods, the foreman sits. Judge turns to Perry and Dick.

                                     JUDGE TATE
                         Perry Edward Smith and Richard Eugene 
                         Hickock. You've been found guilty of 
                         four counts of murder in the first 
                         degree. You will be taken to the 
                         state penitentiary at Lansing. No 
                         later than midnight, May 13 of this 
                         year, nineteen hundred and sixty, 
                         each of you will be hanged by the 
                         neck until dead. So ordered.

               He GAVELS. Perry and Dick are set upon by Sheriff's Deputies 
               and led out. Photographers crowd them. Dick turns to Perry.

                                     HICKOCK
                         Alright, partner. Least now we're 
                         not the only killers in Kansas.

               Perry looks at him, utterly lost. FLASH.

               Nelle sits at the window, smoking. Truman in the armchair, 
               holding a drink. They've been up all night. Their bags are 
               packed. Also -- a few packed boxes of written -- in yellow 
               notepads and many typed pages. Truman glances at his watch.

                         You think he slept at all?

               Nelle looks over at him.

                         I need to see him before we go.

                         Lansing today. You'll have to make 
                         sure to put me on the visitor's list.

                         find you a proper lawyer. You need a 
                         serious lawyer for an appeal.

                         He hasn't written a word yet, though 
                         he says it's the nonfiction book of 
                         the decade...

               We HEAR Truman before we see him:

                                     TRUMAN (O.S.)
                         He's little, but terrifying --

               We see Truman in the corner entertaining a small group. Jack 
               Dunphy stands off to the side. Nelle settles next to Jack.

                                     TRUMAN
                         He's as short as I am. And almost as 
                         pretty. I'd be with him right now 
                         but he's being given new 
                         accommodations --

               Guests laugh.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Most people assume he's a monster. I 
                         don't see him that way. The book I'm 
                         writing will return him to the realm 
                         of humanity -- it's the book I was 
                         always meant to write...

               Nelle and Jack stand back, watching.

                                     JACK
                         Watch out. This is the start of a

                         last week. I had to break it to her 
                         that, of the four Matisses hanging 
                         on her wall, two were upside down.

               The REPORTER laughs. A waiter passes. Truman taps his glass.

                              (to reporter)
                         To answer your question, I'm following 
                         "Breakfast at Tiffany's" by blazing 
                         a different path -- by inventing an 
                         entirely new kind of writing: the 
                         non-fiction novel.

                         You have a subject?

               Truman takes a last sip of his drink -- utterly serious now.

                                     TRUMAN
                         On the night of November 14, two men 
                         broke into a quite farmhouse in Kansas 
                         and murdered an entire family. Why 
                         did they do that? It's been suggested 
                         that this subject is tawdry -- it's 
                         not worthy of literature. I disagree. 
                         Two worlds exist in this country -- 
                         the quiet conservative life, and the 
                         life of those two men -- the 
                         underbelly, the criminally violent. 
                         Those worlds converged that bloody 
                         night. I spent the past three months 
                         interviewing everyone in Kansas 
                         touched by that violence. I spent 
                         hours talking to the killers -- and 
                         I'll spend more.

                         Researching this work has changed my 
                         life, altered my point of view about 
                         almost everything. I think those who

                         their attorney was incompetent -- 
                         that he never raised the issue of 
                         temporary insanity.

                         They're facing execution in six weeks, 
                         Jack. They need someone to argue 
                         whether or not that's right.

                         If you met him you'd understand. 
                         It's as if no-one's ever asked him a 
                         single question about himself. He's 
                         so... damaged -- and strange --

                         night. I need to hear him say it.

                                     YOUNG PRISON GUARD
                         Warden Krutch will see you now.

               INT. KSP, WARDEN'S OFFICE - DAY

               Wood-paneled walls, government-issue desk. On the wall behind 
               the desk is a CHART -- a racial accounting of the current 
               inmate population. It reads: WHITE - 1405, COLORED - 360, 
               MEXICANS - 12, INDIANS - 6.

               WARDEN MARSHALL KRUTCH is fat, coarse, sweaty even in winter. 
               And it's spring. He's running for Congress -- there are 
               "KRUTCH FOR CONGRESS" bumper stickers laying around the 
               office. He's enjoying a chance at a little publicity. The 
               YOUNG PRISON GUARD stands quietly by the wall.

                                     KRUTCH
                         We do well by our boys. Showers once 
                         a week. Feed em good. We'll be feeding 
                         Perry Smith in the infirmary soon if 
                         he don't eat. Get the food in through 
                         his arm.

                                     TRUMAN
                         What are you talking about?

                                     KRUTCH
                         Hasn't eaten in a month. But it's 
                         not his right to kill himself. It's 
                         the People's right. The People of 
                         this State. And that's who I work 
                         for, the People. You can write any 
                         of this down.

                                     TRUMAN
                         No one told me.

                                     KRUTCH
                         Yah. Won't eat.

                                     TRUMAN
                         When can I see him?

                                     KRUTCH
                              (checking desk calendar)
                         How about you come back Thursday?

                                     TRUMAN
                         No. That's no good. I need to see 
                         them now, then whenever I want for 
                         as long as I want.

                                     KRUTCH
                         Not how we do things here.

               Pause.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I see.

               Truman glances at the campaign stickers, the young prison 
               guard, then back at Krutch.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I understand what a burden unlimited 
                         visitation might be -- on this 
                         institution, and on the People who 
                         pay for it. I want to be clear that 
                         I don't expect the citizens of 
                         Leavenworth County to have to shoulder 
                         that burden.

               Truman reaches into his jacket, pulls from it an ENVELOPE 
               STUFFED with CASH. He lays it on the desk.

                                     TRUMAN
                         To be dispensed as you see fit.

               Krutch is stone-faced as he regards the money. Finally:

                                     KRUTCH
                         I didn't know where to count your 
                         boy -- being half-Indian. I did him 
                         a favor though.
                              (points to race chart)
                         Counted him White.

                                     TRUMAN
                         You're a kind and generous man.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW - DAY

               The second floor of a small building in the corner of the 
               prison complex. Decrepit. The one hall is lit by mesh-covered 
               BARE BULBS in the ceiling. Twelve cells -- six on each side. 
               Each is 7 by 10 feet, with one small, high WINDOW covered by 
               bars and wire. The YOUNG PRISON GUARD opens the heavy GATE 
               at the end of the hall and shows Truman in.

               They walk down the row of cells. In one of them we notice 
               Lowell Lee Andrews (20, white, spectacled, ENORMOUSLY FAT) 
               peering at his own face 4 inches from a mirror.

               Dick is leaning against the bars of his own cell. He smiles.

                                     HICKOCK
                         My hero.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Hello.

                                     HICKOCK
                         Thanks for your help with the lawyer.

                                     TRUMAN
                         That's fine.

                                     HICKOCK
                         You must be desperate for a story to 
                         come all the way out here.

                                     YOUNG PRISON GUARD
                         Mr. Capote. You're entitled to go 
                         in. You may, um, go in. If you wish.

               Truman hesitates for a second.

                                     HICKOCK
                         You want to see Perry. Go ahead.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Thank you.

               Truman walks to the next cell.

                                     HICKOCK
                         Ask me, he's just trying to prove 
                         the insanity defense.

               Truman sees Perry, gaunt, lying on his cot, almost comatose. 
               Perry's rather striking drawing of a LARGE YELLOW PARROT 
               sits propped on his table. An UNEATEN LUNCH TRAY lies on the 
               floor -- a cockroach runs over it. Truman watches, disturbed.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT

               Camera follows Truman as he walks down an aisle with a small 
               WICKER BASKET. He stops, looks at a shelf.

               INT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT

               Truman waits in the check-out line behind a MOM paying for 
               her groceries. Her SON (3) stands next to her legs, wearing 
               a little cowboy hat and cradling a TOY GUN to his chest. He 
               sucks his thumb. Truman and the boy look at each other.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - DAY

               Truman sits on the chair, his WICKER BASKET on the table. He 
               has spread out a cloth napkin. A GUARD watches from outside 
               the cell. Perry lies completely still on the cot. Truman 
               takes out jars of BONNET BABY FOOD, inspects the labels.

                                     TRUMAN
                              (to Perry)
                         I don't care what your plans are for 
                         yourself...

               He decides on the CUSTARD jar. He opens it, takes a plastic 
               BABY SPOON from the basket.

                                     TRUMAN
                         But you're gonna wake up enough to 
                         tell me what you did with my tie.

               He spoons a bit into Perry's mouth. The GUARD walks away. 
               Truman leans close to Perry, whispers:

                                     TRUMAN
                         It's okay. It's Truman. It's your 
                         friend.

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - LATER (LATE AFTERNOON)

               Perry sleeps. Truman stands against the wall watching him. 
               He has cleaned up the basket of food. He walks over to Perry's 
               desk, sees two handwritten notebooks on it: THE PRIVATE DIARY 
               OF PERRY EDWARD SMITH and PERSONAL DICTIONARY. Next to them, 
               he sees a pencil SELF-PORTRAIT Perry drew. It's very good. 
               Truman touches it.

               INT. KSP DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - LATER (EVENING)

               Perry sleeps. Truman sits on the chair watching, waiting. 
               Perry opens his eyes, looks at Truman.

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - LATER (NIGHT)

               Perry is sitting up a bit, Truman helps him sip a cup of 
               water. Perry lies back down. He's looking at Truman.

                                     TRUMAN
                         How'd you learn to draw like that?

               Perry closes his eyes.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CAR, DRIVING - AFTERNOON (NEXT DAY)

               Truman drives through the KANSAS STATE PENITENTIARY gate, 
               waves to the Guard.

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - EVENING

               Perry sits on the bed, cleaned up, wet hair neatly combed, 
               looking at a few OLD SNAPSHOTS he has saved in a handkerchief. 
               Truman sits in the chair across from him. Perry hands him a 
               photo of his mother. Perry speaks quietly.

                                     PERRY
                         Before she had us. Before she started 
                         drinking.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Who took care of you as a child?

                                     PERRY
                         Orphanage. Me and Linda.

                                     TRUMAN
                         That's your sister?

               Perry nods. Truman waits for more. It doesn't come.

                                     TRUMAN
                         We're not so different as you might 
                         think. I was abandoned repeatedly as 
                         a child. My mama'd drag me along to 
                         some new town so she could take up 
                         with another man she'd met. Night 
                         after night she'd lock me in the 
                         hotel room -- Mama'd turn the latch 
                         and tell the staff not to let me out 
                         no matter what. I was terrified -- 
                         I'd scream my head off -- till finally 
                         I'd collapse on the carpet next to 
                         the door and fall asleep. After years 
                         of this she just left me with 
                         relatives in Alabama.

                                     PERRY
                         Who raised you up?

                              (Perry nods)
                         That's when I met Nelle -- she lived 
                         next door.
                              (looks again at the 
                              photo, hands it back)
                         Your mother was Indian?

                         No tolerance for him either.

               Truman's laughs, surprised by the joke, though it's unclear 
               whether Perry meant it as one. He stares at Perry.

                                     TRUMAN
                         What I can't decide is if you 
                         understand how fascinating you are.

               Perry doesn't respond, then --

                                     PERRY
                         I'm sorry about your tie. They took 
                         it away from me because we're all on 
                         suicide watch. It's why the lights 
                         stay on at night.

                         I hope we're past that now. You had 
                         me worried.

                                     PERRY
                         Okay.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I don't care about the tie. It's 
                         just a pity because it looked so 
                         good on you.

               Perry leans in, motions toward Dick's cell, lowers his voice --

                                     PERRY
                         Be careful of Ricardo. I think he 
                         wants you all to himself.

                         Alright --

                                     PERRY
                         But he's naturally mendacious -- not 
                         to be trusted -- if he had a hundred 
                         dollars he'd steal a stick of chewing 
                         gum.

                                     TRUMAN
                         You wouldn't.

               Perry shakes his head. Then, Truman nods toward Perry's 
               notebooks.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I want to take your notebooks with 
                         me -- I want to read them.

               Perry hesitates.

                                     TRUMAN
                         If I leave here without understanding 
                         you, the world will always see you 
                         as a monster. I don't want that -- I 
                         don't see you that way.

               A moment, then Perry reaches for the NOTEBOOKS, hands them 
               to Truman. Then he hands Truman the DRAWING he did of himself.

                                     PERRY
                         I tracked my father down in Alaska. 
                         I was 14. One day I said to him, 
                         "Mom's dead." I could see it. A week 
                         later we got the news. She finally 
                         drunk herself to death.

               Truman regards Perry. Then he looks at the drawing --

                         This is remarkable.

                                     PERRY
                         Sometimes you see a thing -- how it 
                         really is.

               On Truman holding the drawing, looking at Perry.

               EXT. KANSAS STATE PENITENTIARY PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               Truman walks quickly to his car, holding Perry's DRAWING and 
               NOTEBOOKS. At the car, he looks back at the dark jailhouse.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HOTEL ROOM, KANSAS CITY - LATE NIGHT

               Truman at the desk, PERRY'S TWO BOOKS next to a LEGAL PAD 
               already filled with notes. He's on the PHONE with Nelle, 
               paging through the PERSONAL DICTIONARY captivated by it.

                                     TRUMAN
                         He trusts me -- that's why he gave 
                         it to me. He's given me absolutely 
                         everything.
                              (paging through Diary)
                         You should see his drawings, Nelle, 
                         how good he is. He wants so badly to 
                         be taken seriously, to be held in 
                         some esteem.

               INTERCUT with Nelle, in pajamas, sitting on the porch of her 
               home in Monroeville, smoking.

                         Well... he's a gold mine. I mean 
                         he's told me his entire life, and 
                         now it's all here for me to write 
                         down -- All of the history I need. 
                         His entire life in this Diary. His

                         thing?

                                     TRUMAN
                         I tell him everything. We've been 
                         talking our heads off the past month. 
                         Sometimes, when I think how good my 
                         book can be, I can hardly breathe.

                         Huh.

                              (finds what he wants)
                         Here's what I wanted to read to you: 
                         "If Called Upon to Make a Speech:" -- 
                         this is exactly what I was talking 
                         about -- a speech just in case he's 
                         ever recognized for an achievement: 
                         "If Called Upon to Make a Speech: I 
                         can't remember what I was going to 
                         say for the life of me. I don't think 
                         ever before have so many people been 
                         so directly responsible for my being 
                         so very, very glad. It's a wonderful 
                         moment and a rare one. Thank you!"
                              (beat)
                         There's an exclamation point on the 
                         end of that thank you, in case you 
                         didn't catch it...

                         Where'd you go?

               We hear Nelle exhale her cigarette.

               EXT. KANSAS CITYSCAPE - VARIOUS (TWO WEEKS ELAPSE)

               INT. DINER, DOWNTOWN KANSAS CITY - MORNING

               Truman is eating breakfast with Alvin Dewey. A WAITRESS 
               refills their coffees.

                                     DEWEY
                              (to waitress)
                         Thanks.

               She leaves. An uncomfortable silence. Then:

                                     DEWEY
                         You're nothing if not hard-working.

                                     TRUMAN
                         You look good, healthy again.

                                     DEWEY
                         Not a chance.

               Dewey taps a cigarette out of his pack.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I've decided on a title for my book. 
                         I think you'll like it -- very 
                         masculine. "In Cold Blood."

                                     DEWEY
                              (lights the cigarette)
                         That refers to the crime or the fact 
                         that you're still talking to the 
                         criminals?

                                     TRUMAN
                         The former, among other things.

                                     DEWEY
                         I see.

               They eat for a moment. Then:

                                     TRUMAN
                         I've been wanting to ask if you'll 
                         let me look at your investigation 
                         notes.

                                     DEWEY
                         That lawyer you helped find for your 
                         friends got them a hearing at the 
                         Kansas Supreme Court --

                                     TRUMAN
                         I heard this morning.

                                     DEWEY
                         -- on the issue of inadequate counsel.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Alvin. Do you not want me to look at 
                         your notes? You are permitted to say 
                         no.

                                     DEWEY
                              (rises, takes out 
                              wallet)
                         I'll tell you what: if those boys 
                         get off, I'm coming to Brooklyn to 
                         hunt you down.

               Truman can't decide whether Dewey is kidding or not. Dewey 
               puts money on the table.

                                     DEWEY
                         I have to be in court at nine o'clock.

               He walks away. Over his shoulder:

                                     DEWEY
                         Call Roy Church. He'll show you what 
                         you want to see.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW - DAY

               Truman walks down the hall. He passes Dick's cell. Dick is 
               lying in bed. Dick rises and smiles widely at Truman.

                                     HICKOCK
                         Hey, hey...

               Truman smiles, puts HIS FINGERS TO HIS LIPS, continues past. 
               He stops outside Perry's cell. Perry (looking MUCH HEALTHIER) 
               is drawing at his table -- a picture of the HUGE YELLOW PARROT 
               swooping down from the sky. Truman watches for a few moments, 
               then Perry looks at him.

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - MOMENTS LATER

               The Guard locks Truman inside with Perry.

                                     PERRY
                         Thank you.

               Truman looks at the Guard -- he leaves.

                                     TRUMAN
                         It was as much for me as for anyone. 
                         I couldn't bear the thought of losing 
                         you so soon.

                         I haven't written a word yet.

               Beat.

                         I had hoped --

                                     PERRY
                         What are you calling it?

                              him)
                         I have no idea.

               Pause.

                                     TRUMAN
                         If I'm going to write about you -- 
                         if I'm going to determine how to 
                         write about you -- you need to tell 
                         me about that night at the Clutter 
                         house.

               Perry just looks at him.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Perry.

               Perry shakes his head.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Why? Do you worry what I'll think?

               Perry looks away. A long moment.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Is that it?

               Silence. Then:

               Truman gives up for now. Sees the PICTURE OF THE YELLOW BIRD

                         yet they're more desperate than ever. 
                         I prefer to be here with you.

                                     PERRY
                              (looks at Truman; 
                              evenly)
                         I was ten, I wet the bed, the nuns 
                         at the orphanage hated the smell. 
                         First month one of them found me 
                         shivering -- just trying to get 
                         through the night. The Sister pulled 
                         back the covers and shined her 
                         flashlight to see what I'd did. The 
                         sheets were wet. She hit me so many 
                         times with that flashlight she broke 
                         it.
                              (he shrugs)
                         That night I dreamed about the yellow 
                         bird. Tall. Yellow like the sun. It 
                         picked me up and it clawed the Nun's 
                         eyes and it lifted me into the sky.

               They look at each other.

               EXT. BAR, DOWNTOWN K.C. - NIGHT

               Truman on the street outside the club at a PAY PHONE. He 
               talks with Jack in Brooklyn.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I'm just missing this one piece, 
                         Jack. Be patient with me.

                                     JACK
                         How long is that gonna take? Why 
                         don't you try leaving him alone for 
                         a while? Come to Spain. You can always 
                         visit him later.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I don't know.

                                     JACK
                         Well, I'm off. I've got my own writing 
                         to do.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Do it in Brooklyn. Wait for me.

                                     JACK
                         Too many people around.
                              (beat)
                         I'll leave the address on the kitchen 
                         table. Truman, what do you do there 
                         when you're not with him? -- It must 
                         be awful.

               Truman's watching a YOUNG GUY standing outside the bar, 
               looking at him.

                                     JACK
                         Think about what I said. Join me 
                         when you can.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I will. I will. Bye.

               Truman follows the YOUNG GUY into the bar.

               INT. HOTEL ROOM, KANSAS CITY - LATE NIGHT

               Truman sleeps. He OPENS HIS EYES in bed. Turns to the bedside 
               table to see the drawing of Perry looking at him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. KANSAS CITY - DAWN

               A young drifter stands alone on an empty street corner. He 
               checks a pay phone for a coin. It's empty.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - DAY

               Perry is lying on his cot reading an ADVENTURE MAGAZINE -- 
               something to do with finding buried treasure off the coast 
               of Mexico -- and sucking on the tip of his thumb. After a 
               moment he STARTLES and looks up.

               Truman stands outside his cell. He holds a stack of books: 
               Perry's PERSONAL DICTIONARY and DIARY, and a new WEBSTER'S 
               DICTIONARY and THESAURUS.

                                     PERRY
                         I didn't see you. Jesus, you...
                              (stands, tucks in 
                              shirt)
                         Come in. Where's the guard?

                                     TRUMAN
                         I can't. I brought you some things, 
                         but I have to fly back East.

                                     PERRY
                         When?

                                     TRUMAN
                         An hour. I'm sorry.

                                     PERRY
                         You can't.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I'm sorry.

                                     PERRY
                         Who are you going there to see --

                                     HICKOCK (O.S.)
                              (from next cell)
                         Capote, get it straight in your book -- 
                         we never intended on killing that 
                         family --

                                     PERRY
                         I told him that.

                                     HICKOCK (O.S.)
                         No premeditation --

                                     PERRY
                         I told him!

               Perry searches the cell for something else to give to Truman 
               to keep him there. Then, he stops. He has nothing left to 
               give, and is unwilling to talk about that night at the 
               Clutters. He becomes very still. Truman speaks gently --

                                     TRUMAN
                         Your writings are magnificent. I 
                         hope these help you do more.

               No response. Truman places the books on the floor just outside 
               Perry's cell -- Perry's writings in one stack and the new 
               dictionaries in another right next to it.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I have so much material -- from the 
                         trial, from our visits, your journals. 
                         I have to organize it all, and I 
                         have to start the process of writing.
                              (no response)
                         I'll visit soon. Perhaps this fall.
                              (backing away)
                         I miss you already. Write me every 
                         five minutes.

               He turns and goes. We stay with Perry as Truman leaves. We 
               hear Dick speak to Truman.

                                     HICKOCK (O.S.)
                         Be good now.

               Hear Truman's footsteps receding. Then, a long shot of the 
               hallway as the Guard lets Truman out the gate at the end of 
               the row. Silence.

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL

               Perry looks down at the books sitting on the floor outside 
               his cell. He crouches, puts his hand through the bars and 
               touches the cover of the new dictionary. He's alone.

                                                                  FADE OUT.

               Over black -- the sound of a JET airplane -- loud, then 
               passing.

               EXT. BEACH - DAY

               FADE IN: BRIGHT WHITE SKY. Sounds of seagulls. Ocean, sand, 
               cottage houses in greenery set back from the beach.

               EXT. RENTED COTTAGE HOUSE - DAY

               The house Jack rented. Jack types on the upstairs deck. Truman 
               pulls up in an OLD TAXI. Jack looks out over the railing to 
               the street. Jack emerges on the FRONT PORCH as Truman walks 
               up the path with his bags. They look at each other. Then 
               Truman looks around at the incredible garden, the ocean in 
               the background, and starts to LAUGH.

                                                                  FADE OUT.

               Title up:              "January, 1962"

               Sound of a MANUAL TYPEWRITER over black.

               EXT. RENTED COTTAGE HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

               FADE IN on the peaceful outside of the house. Sound of TYPING.

               INT. RENTED COTTAGE HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

               More typing. A PHONE rings. CAMERA tracks slowly through the 
               pretty, tiled living room, toward a DOOR at the far end.

               INT. BEDROOM, RENTED COTTAGE HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

               Truman at his DESK, surrounded by piles of filled YELLOW 
               PADS, NOTE CARDS, an open TRUNK of random notes. He is at 
               the MANUAL TYPEWRITER. The phone is on the floor, ringing. 
               He types. The phone rings. Exasperated, he picks up.

                                     TRUMAN
                         What.

                         ago -- I have not been able to tear 
                         myself away from your book. It's 
                         that good. It's not good, it's 
                         astonishing. This first half is 
                         astonishing. If the second half lives 
                         up to this it, -- it -- how much is

                         of the killings to me. I was planning

               Truman at the stove watching his tea water heat up. Jack 
               enters with a HUGE BASKET of WINE and GROCERIES.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Plums. Thank god. We have nothing in 
                         the house.

               He takes one from the basket. Jack starts to unpack food.

                         I knew you couldn't be depended on 
                         to stock the kitchen.

               Truman looks at him blankly.

                                     JACK
                         What would we feed our famous guest?

                                     TRUMAN
                         Oh, Jesus. I completely forgot.

               He helps Jack put away the groceries. Then:

                                     JACK
                              (utterly nonchalant)
                         Plus -- I finished my novel yesterday.

               Truman looks at Jack, smiles widely.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Truman, Jack and Nelle. A BONFIRE, a wind-up Victrola playing

                         man...

                                     JACK
                         You said that.

                                     TRUMAN
                         You are the hardest worker, the most 
                         unsung talent I know. As Nelle passes 
                         by on her way to London to sell her 
                         book which needs no selling, may a 
                         little of her success rub off on 
                         both of us.

               Jack laughs.

                                     JACK
                         Here, here!

               Nelle tries to smack Truman but can't catch him. The song 
               changes to a slow one. Jack and Truman dance sweetly together. 
               Nelle sits on the sand and watches.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Breakfast. Truman and Nelle are sitting -- Nelle has a small 
               envelope in her hand. Truman is obviously uncomfortable. As 
               Jack delivers a platter of omelettes to the table:

                                     NELLE
                              (to Truman)
                         When was the last time you wrote 
                         back to him?

                                     TRUMAN
                         I don't know.

                                     JACK
                         What's this?

                                     NELLE
                         A letter for your boyfriend I was 
                         asked to deliver.

                         From Perry.

                                     JACK
                         Let's have it.

               Jack sits. Nelle opens the letter, reads:

                         "Dear Friend Truman. Where are you? 
                         Read this item in a medical 
                         dictionary: "Death by hanging is 
                         caused by asphyxia, by fracture of 
                         the cervical vertebrae, by laceration 
                         of the trachea." Not too comforting 
                         as we lost our appeal. Missing you -- 
                         alone and desirous of your presence.

               Pause.

                         Mr. Shawn told me about the court 
                         decision yesterday.

                                     JACK
                         I was wondering why you were in such 
                         a good mood. Surely, I thought, it's 
                         not because I finished my little 
                         book.

                                     TRUMAN
                         That's a terrible thing to say.

               Jack looks out at the ocean.

                                     TRUMAN
                              (to no one in

                         I used to write him all the time. 
                         I've been so focused lately on the 
                         book.

               Truman and Nelle carry her bags down the front walk toward a 
               waiting TAXI.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Jack says I'm using Perry, but he 
                         also thinks I fell in love with him 
                         when I was in Kansas. How both of 
                         those things can be true is beyond 
                         me.

                         I don't know how to answer that... 
                         It's as if Perry and I started life 
                         in the same house. One day he stood 
                         up and walked out the back door while 
                         I walked out the front. With some 
                         different choices, he's the man I 
                         might have become.

               Truman shrugs, doesn't answer. Nelle kisses him.

                         Be nice to Jack. Sometimes I think 
                         he's what I like about you best.

               Nelle gets in the taxi, then leans her head out the window.

                         Truman. Honestly. Are you going back 
                         to Kansas because you care about 
                         Perry or because you need information 
                         before he's killed?

                         No. I don't think it can be.

               She drives away. Truman watches her go. He turns back up 
               toward the house, stops a moment to pick a FLOWER from the 
               bushes at the front gate.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW - DAY

               A Guard walks down the corridor carrying a SINGLE FLOWER. He 
               delivers it to Perry, then walks off. Perry is confused. He 
               hears FOOTSTEPS approaching, but can't see who it is.

                                     HICKOCK (O.S.)
                         Hey, buddy. Thanks.

               More footsteps. CAMERA on Perry as the footsteps finally 
               arrive outside his cell. He's shocked.

               REVERSE onto Truman, looking tanned, healthy, very blond. He 
               holds a STACK OF BOOKS with a BOW on top. He smiles.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               LONG SHOT of dimly lit corridor, light spilling out from 
               each cell. A ROW GUARD walks the hall. We hear voices 
               murmuring.

               SIX MORE GUARDS arrive at the top of the stairs. The ROW 
               GUARD walks over, unlocks the GATE to let them in.

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - NIGHT

               Perry is looking at the cover of a BOOK -- "WALDEN POND." 
               Other books sit next to Perry on the cot. Among them -- WILLA 
               CATHER's "MY ANTONIA", also "GREAT EXPECTATIONS" --

                                     PERRY
                         What was he in jail for?

                         They said it was not paying his taxes. 
                         But really for being an outsider -- 
                         refusing to go along.

               Perry nods, looks at the other books.

                                     TRUMAN
                         You don't have to read any of these 
                         if you don't want to. But I thought 
                         you'd like something decent. You're 
                         much too smart for adventure 
                         magazines.

               Through the bars of Perry's cell, we can see the SIX GUARDS 
               enter Lowell Lee Andrew's cell (diagonally across the 
               corridor). The ROW GUARD appears at Perry's cell.

                                     ROW GUARD
                         Lock-down while Lowell goes to

                              (to Truman)
                         You want in or out?

               Truman looks at Perry, then back to the Guard.

               The SIX GUARDS start to pack up Andrews cell while he sits 
               on the cot and watches.

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - LATER

               Perry and Truman talk very QUIETLY. (Throughout this scene, 
               we see in the background, across the corridor, the mostly 
               obscured cell of Andrews. We see his incredibly FAT LEG being 
               shackled, his belongings being packed in boxes.)

                         Everyone says he's a genius. I don't 
                         think he's a genius. He's rich and 
                         he went to college -- like any of us 
                         would've if we got the chance. He 
                         came home for Christmas and shot his 
                         parents --

               The ROW GUARD opens the cell door. Andrews is led out, arms 
               and legs shackled, into the corridor.

               Andrews is led past Perry's cell. He looks in at Perry.

               Andrews shuffles down the hall. Perry watches him go. On 
               Truman watching Perry. We hear the GATE slam shut.

               Nelle is embarrassed, mostly for Baron, to have the issue of 
               money brought up publicly.

                                     NELLE
                         Well...

               Baron moves past, Nelle smiles politely, whispers to Shawn.

                                     NELLE
                         What a gentleman.

               INT. THEATER, BACKSTAGE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

               Truman sits alone. In the background, we can HEAR the noise 
               of the huge crowd gathering in the theater. Truman wears his 
               MOST STYLISH LITERARY OUTFIT: a gorgeous dark green Knize 
               SUIT over a black cashmere turtleneck sweater, and horn-rimmed 
               GLASSES (which we've never seen him wear before).

               He's frozen with anticipation, nervousness. After several 
               moments a THEATER ASSISTANT opens the door.

                                     YOUNG ASSISTANT
                         Mr. Capote. Can I get you anything?

                                     TRUMAN
                         No.
                              (clears his throat)
                         Thank you.

               The assistant leaves. We hear the crowd quiet down. Truman 
               rises slowly, walks through the door to the backstage area. 
               We hear William Shawn on stage.

                                     SHAWN (O.S.)

               INT. WINGS/STAGE - NIGHT

               Shawn pauses briefly for a laugh that doesn't come. Truman 
               continues walking toward the backstage curtains.

                                     SHAWN (O.S.)
                         Thank you for coming to the first 
                         public reading, the first offering 
                         of any kind, of Truman Capote's new 
                         work "In Cold Blood." Our magazine --

               Truman walks on stage. Loud applause. Shawn sees him, slinks 
               back to his seat. Truman walks over to the podium, takes in 
               the enormous crowd. Once it is completely quiet:

                                     TRUMAN
                         Hello. My name is Truman Capote.

               People laugh and applaud loudly.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - SAME TIME, NIGHT

               Perry, eating dinner alone at his table, looks up. We HEAR a 
               LOUD ENGINE revving outside.

               EXT. KSP, THE CORNER WAREHOUSE - SAME TIME

               A FRONT-LOADER TRACTOR drives into the warehouse. A PRISON 
               POLICE CAR parks outside the warehouse. Guards get the 
               enormous Lowell Lee Andrews, shackled, from the back seat, 
               walk him inside.

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - NIGHT

               C/U on Perry, now standing on his chair and watching out the 
               tiny window.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         Perry Smith's voice was both gentle 
                         and prim -- a voice that, though 
                         soft, manufactured each sound exactly -- 
                         ejected it like a smoke ring issuing 
                         from a parson's mouth.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Perry watches through his window. From inside the warehouse 
               we hear the gallows TRAP DOOR spring and CLATTER. On Perry,

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         The village of Holcomb stands on the 
                         high wheat plains of western Kansas, 
                         a lonesome area that other Kansans 
                         call "out there." Until one morning 
                         in mid-November 1959, few Americans -- 
                         in fact, few Kansans -- had ever 
                         heard of Holcomb. Like the waters of 
                         the [Arkansas] river, like the 
                         motorists on the highway... 
                         exceptional happenings had never 
                         stopped there.

               EXT. KSP, DEATH ROW BUILDING - SAME TIME

               We see the outside wall with Perry and Dick's faces peering 
               out through their tiny windows.

               EXT. KSP, THE CORNER WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

               The TRACTOR emerges through the warehouse doors. It carries 
               in its FRONT SHOVEL the enormous, dead BODY of ANDREWS covered 
               by a BLACK CLOTH.

                         The four coffins, which quite filled 
                         the small, flower-crowded parlor, 
                         were to be sealed at the funeral 
                         services -- very understandably, for 
                         the effect... was disquieting. Nancy 
                         wore her dress of cherry-red velvet, 
                         her brother a bright plaid shirt; 
                         the parents were more sedately 
                         attired, Mr. Clutter in navy-blue 
                         flannel, his wife in navy-blue crepe; 
                         and -- and it was this especially 
                         that lent the scene an awful aura -- 
                         the head of each was completely 
                         encased in cotton, a swollen cocoon 
                         twice the size of an ordinary blown-
                         up balloon, and the cotton, because 
                         it had been sprayed with a glossy 
                         substance, twinkled like Christmas-
                         tree snow.

                         Imagination, of course, can open any 
                         door -- turn the key and let terror 
                         walk right in. [One] Tuesday, at 
                         dawn, a carload of... strangers, 
                         ignorant of the local disaster -- 
                         were startled by what they saw as 
                         they crossed the prairies and passed 
                         through Holcomb: windows ablaze, 
                         almost every window in almost every 
                         house, and, in the brightly lit rooms, 
                         fully clothed people, even entire 
                         families, who had sat the whole night 
                         wide awake, watchful, listening. Of 
                         what were they frightened? "It might 
                         happen again."

               He closes his manuscript. Several moments of SILENCE, then 
               thunderous APPLAUSE.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Truman's dressing room. Packed with well-wishers drinking 
               from bottles of CHAMPAGNE, smoking, toasting, shouting to be 
               heard. Truman in the corner with Christopher Isherwood, BEN 
               BARON others, laughing. A LITERARY ENTHUSIAST approaches, 
               leans in.

                                     LITERARY ENTHUSIAST
                         Your portrait of those men was 
                         terrifying. Terrifying.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Thank you.

               Truman and Isherwood watch him walk away.

                                     ISHERWOOD
                         Your hairpiece is terrifying.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I was going to say the same thing!

               Truman laughs loudly. We SEE Nelle look over from across the 
               room at her friend having the time of his life.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         Tennessee loved it.

                         Of course he did.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Should we do more? I was terrified, 
                         but --

                                     SHAWN
                         No, Now we get to withhold while 
                         everyone else talks. Let them do the 
                         work.

               Truman is barely able to suppress his excitement.

                         This book is going to change

                         I think so. You know they're scheduled 
                         for next month?

                         Hanging. Yes. I'll commit as many 
                         issues as it takes to publish. Three. 
                         As many as it takes.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I'm flying to Kansas tomorrow. I'll 
                         get Perry to talk --

                         Honestly, what's he got to lose?

               Truman smiles at the joke, then stops himself.

                                     TRUMAN
                         It really is too awful. 
                         Institutionalized sadism.

               Shawn nods.

                                     SHAWN
                         You'll be able to finish now.

                         As strange as it may sound to you, 
                         I'm going to miss him.

                                                                  FADE OUT.

               Over black -- the sound of a JET airplane -- loud, then 
               passing.

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - DAY

               Truman, flushed, out of breath, stands outside Perry's cell. 
               He's just arrived. He holds a FOLDED-UP NEWSPAPER. Perry 
               sits at his table reading LEGAL DOCUMENTS.

                         When did you hear?

               Perry looks up, mistaking Truman's state for shared 
               enthusiasm. He smiles widely.

                                     PERRY
                         Two days ago.

               The Guard opens the cell for Truman. Perry holds up one of 
               the DOCUMENTS.

                                     PERRY
                         It's what we've been waiting for. A 
                         stay of execution to make a federal 
                         appeal.

               Truman enters. Perry goes to him and hugs him tightly.

                                     PERRY
                         All thanks to you.

               On Truman, shocked, being hugged.

                         stop sending him those trashy books. 
                         I won't even mention the pornography.
                              (getting up)
                         I realize he might have trouble 
                         grasping the literature you gave me, 
                         but those books only exacerbate the 
                         problem -- only 'heighten' or 
                         'intensify' it. Maybe we should start 
                         him on a program...

                                     PERRY
                         Give him the simple novels first --

                         Perry.

               Perry stops.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I know what exacerbate means.

                                     PERRY
                         Okay. I thought in case...

                                     TRUMAN
                         There is not a word, or a sentence, 
                         or a concept, that you can illuminate 
                         for me. There is one singular reason 
                         that I keep coming here --

                                     PERRY
                         Truman --

                                     TRUMAN
                         ...November 14th, 1959. Three years 
                         ago. Three years. That's all I want 
                         to hear from you.

               Pause.

                                     PERRY
                         I've asked you not to --

                                     TRUMAN
                              (stands up)
                         This is ridiculous.
                              (to the Guard)
                         I'm ready.
                              (to Perry)
                         I have a plane to catch. I found 
                         your sister in Tacoma. Maybe she'll 
                         talk to me about something useful.

                                     PERRY
                         Don't go out there.

               The Guard lets Truman out of the cell.

                                     PERRY
                         Please don't go out there.

               The Guard shuts the door.

                                     TRUMAN
                         This is my work, Perry. I'm working. 
                         When you want to tell me what I need 
                         to hear, you let me know.

               He walks off down the hall. The GATE slams shut.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PERRY'S SISTER'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY

               Cheaply built ranch house. LINDA MURCHAK (30) walks in the 
               kitchen back door, shuts it.

                                     MRS. MURCHAK
                         They'll play outside a while longer.

               Mrs. Murchak looks like a female Perry, dark and small, 
               attractive and nervous. Through the window, we see THREE 
               LITTLE CHILDREN playing on a DECREPIT JUNGLE GYM in the yard. 
               Truman sits at the table, leafing through a PHOTO ALBUM.

                                     MRS. MURCHAK
                         I don't want them to see that.

                                     TRUMAN
                         They've never seen these pictures?

                                     MRS. MURCHAK
                              (shakes her head)
                         Too many questions.

               She joins Truman again at the table.

               We see an OLD PHOTO of the SMITH FAMILY -- Linda at age 8, 
               Perry (5); their older sister, June; their brother Frank; 
               and the parents: Florence (American Indian) and John (Irish) -- 
               in front of their rundown truck on a desolate road.

                                     MRS. MURCHAK
                         June's dead. Frank shot himself. Now 
                         Perry's did what he did. I suppose 
                         I'm next. Some ruination will visit 
                         me.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I don't think life works that way.

                                     MRS. MURCHAK
                         It does in this family.

               Truman turns the page. A PICTURE of Perry (3) and Linda 
               HOLDING HANDS and splashing in a big mud-puddle in the rain. 
               Linda is smiling at Perry, who is naked, laughing.

                                     MRS. MURCHAK
                         I used to love him. He was my little 
                         doll.

               He turns the page. A PICTURE of Perry (6) and Linda sitting 
               on the back steps of a shack, poking with a stick at something 
               in the dirt. After a moment, she gets up, clears coffee cups.

                                     MRS. MURCHAK
                         He scares me now.

                                     TRUMAN
                         When was the last time you saw him?

                                     MRS. MURCHAK
                         Ten years.

               She picks up the album to put it away.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Do you think I could borrow one of 
                         those pictures?

                                     MRS. MURCHAK
                              (hands it to him)
                         Take the whole thing. I don't want'em 
                         anymore.
                              (then)
                         Just... Perry doesn't know where I 
                         live. He thinks we're still in 
                         Portland. Please don't tell him we're 
                         not.

                                     TRUMAN
                              (he already has)
                         Alright.

                                     MRS. MURCHAK
                         Don't be taken in by my brother. 
                         He's got this sensitive side he'll 
                         show. You believe he's gentle, so 
                         easily hurt. But he'd just as soon 
                         kill you as shake your hand. I believe 
                         that.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW - NEXT DAY

               Truman slows for a moment as he passes Hickock's cell.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Hello handsome.

               Hickock just stares at him. Truman, unnerved, moves on to 
               Perry's cell.

               INT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - CONTINUOUS

               Perry doing pushups. He sees Truman and stops. He stands. 
               The Row Guard approaches.

                                     ROW GUARD
                         You want to go in?

               Truman regards Perry for a few moments, then:

                                     TRUMAN
                         Yes

               The Guard unlocks the door. Perry STARTS TO MOVE toward it. 
               The Guard SLAMS it shut.

                                     PERRY
                         What's the name of your book?

               No response. Perry can barely control his anger.

                                     PERRY
                         What's the name of your book?

                                     TRUMAN
                         I don't...

                                     PERRY
                         What's the name of your book?

                                     TRUMAN
                         I don't know what you're talking 
                         about.

               Perry picks up a cut-out ARTICLE from the NY Times from his 
               desk. He reads.

                                     PERRY
                         "Truman Capote read last night before 
                         a packed audience from his non-fiction 
                         book IN COLD BLOOD."

               He looks at Truman.

                                     PERRY
                         More?
                              (reads)
                         "The true-crime novel tells of killers 
                         Richard Hickock and Perry Smith, who

                         three years ago."

                         Who sent that to you?

               Perry doesn't answer.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Who sent that to you?

                                     PERRY
                         That's not your goddamn business.

                                     TRUMAN
                         It is my business, because it's not 
                         true. The organizers of the reading 
                         needed a title. They picked one -- a 
                         sensational one, I admit -- to attract 
                         a crowd.

                                     PERRY
                         They picked it.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Yes.

                                     PERRY
                         That's not your title.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I haven't chosen one yet.

               Perry stares at him, not believing.

                                     TRUMAN
                         How could I choose --

                                     PERRY
                         You pretend to be my friend...

                                     TRUMAN
                         How could I choose a title when you 
                         still haven't told me what happened 
                         that night? How could I? I couldn't 
                         possibly.

               Long pause. Truman reaches in his breast pocket and extracts 
               a PHOTO (the one of Perry and Linda splashing in the puddle.)

                                     TRUMAN
                         I have something from your sister.

               He hands it through the bars to Perry. Perry takes it.

                                     TRUMAN
                         She misses you.

               Perry looks at the photo. After a few moments, Truman turns 
               to the Guard.

                                     TRUMAN
                         It's alright. I'll go in.

               The Guard unlocks the cell. Truman enters. The Guard locks 
               up, walks away. Perry is still looking at the PHOTO.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I'm sorry. I should have told you 
                         what they made me call the book.
                              (touches Perry's arm)
                         I couldn't pretend to be your friend. 
                         The truth is, I can't help wanting 
                         to be.
                              (silence, then:)
                         You don't have to tell me anything 
                         if you don't want to.

               Perry looks at the photo of himself and his sister for a 
               long time.

                                     PERRY
                         Look at my belly.

               Perry sits on the bed. Then, almost to himself:

                                     PERRY
                         There must be something wrong with 
                         us. To do what we did.

               Truman waits him out, sitting on the chair. Finally, Perry 
               looks at him. When Perry speaks, it is quietly, completely 
               matter-of-fact.

                                     PERRY
                         We heard there was ten thousand 
                         dollars in that house. Once we'd 
                         tied up everybody and searched all 
                         over, I knew the guy who told us 
                         about it was wrong. There wasn't any 
                         money. But Dick wouldn't believe it. 
                         He went tearing through the house 
                         again, banging on the walls, looking 
                         for a safe. He said when he was done, 
                         he was going to come up to Nancy's 
                         room and have his way with her. I 
                         wouldn't allow it. I told him that. 
                         I sat with Nancy.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Perry and Nancy. Perry sits quietly on the edge of Nancy's 
               bed. A SMALL BEDSIDE LAMP softly illuminates a portion of 
               the room. We hear Dick banging around downstairs.

                         It was nice in there.

               The scene is almost sweet, until we see that Nancy's legs 
               and hands are TIED and her mouth is TAPED.

                         Dick came to get me and we turned 
                         out the lights and went down to the 
                         basement, where we had Mr. Clutter 
                         and the boy. Dick kept saying "No 
                         witnesses." I figured if I just waited 
                         him out he'd give up and leave them 
                         tied up there. We'd drive all night, 
                         they'd never find us. Mr. Clutter's 
                         wrists were tied to a pipe over his 
                         head. He looked like he was hurt, so 
                         I cut him down.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         We put a box there on the floor so 
                         he'd be more comfortable. He asked 
                         if his wife and daughter were alright 
                         and I said they were fine, they were 
                         ready to go to sleep. I told him it 
                         wasn't long till morning when somebody 
                         would find them.
                              (beat)
                         He was looking at me. Just... looking 
                         at me. Looking at my eyes. Like he 
                         expects me to kill him -- expects me 
                         to be the kind of person who would 
                         kill him. I was thinking -- this 
                         nice man, he's scared of me. I was 
                         ashamed. I mean, I thought he was a 
                         kind man, a good... a gentleman. I 
                         thought so right up to the moment I 
                         cut his throat. I didn't realize 
                         what I'd did till I heard the sound.

                         off, but he wouldn't do it. We 
                         couldn't leave Mr. Clutter like that, 
                         so I got the shotgun.

               Perry and Dick enter Nancy's room, shine the flashlight on

               moment, she TURNS HER FACE to the wall, as if she knows what 
               is coming and doesn't want to watch it. Perry AIMS the shotgun

               page on top which reads: IN COLD BLOOD. Truman lifts the 
               HUGE STACK, places the SMALL STACK under it. He smooths out

               We hear a DOORBELL. We hear Jack walk down the hall, answer 
               the door, shut the door. Jack enters with a TELEGRAM.

                                     JACK
                         I don't know how you can eat that. 
                         Perhaps if you weren't drinking so 
                         much you wouldn't have to.

               No response. Jack turns down the television, opens the 
               telegram.

                         from you in such a long while. Please 
                         help find new lawyer. If not, Dick

               Truman stares back. Finally, he turns back to the television.

                         Put it with the others.

               Jack goes to the DESK and places the telegram on top of a 
               LARGE PILE OF TELEGRAMS, all from Perry -- all, we should 
               assume, unanswered.

               Jack walks out. Truman sips his drink.

               Truman at the desk, still in PAJAMAS, typing. Jack enters 
               wearing a TUXEDO, reads over Truman's shoulder. We see:

                         You tried?

               Truman extracts the page from the typewriter, folds it, and 
               puts it in an envelope. He takes a sip of his BOURBON.

                                     JACK

               The limo turns a corner and we see an ENORMOUS CROWD in front 
               of a THEATER. On the marquee it says: "Opening tonight - TO

               turn to her saying: "Congratulations"; "Wonderful". She finds 
               Truman sitting at the BAR, receiving a new drink.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Nelle.

               She looks UNCOMFORTABLY DOLLED UP for the premiere of her 
               movie.

                                     NELLE
                         I thought I'd find you here.

                                     TRUMAN
                              (to the bartender)
                         Please, another.

               He hands Nelle his drink, receives another. After a moment:

                                     NELLE
                         How are you?

                                     TRUMAN
                         Terrible.

               Beat.

                                     NELLE
                         I'm sorry to hear that.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Well. It's torture. Torture...
                              (he drinks)
                         ...what they're doing to me.

                                     NELLE
                         Uh-huh.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Now the Supreme Court. Can you believe 
                         it? If they win this appeal I will 
                         have a complete nervous breakdown. I 
                         may never recover. Just pray things 
                         turn my way.

                                     TRUMAN
                         It's torture. They're torturing me.

                                     NELLE
                         I see.

               Nelle regards him for a moment.

                                     NELLE
                         And how'd you like the movie, Truman.

               She puts her drink down on the bar and walks away. Truman 
               turns back to the bartender, shrugs.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I frankly don't know what the fuss 
                         is about.

               On Truman, alone at the bar.

                                                                  FADE OUT.

               EXT. STREET, OUTSIDE TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

               FADE UP on a PAPER BOY riding his BIKE down the street. New 
               buds are on the trees. It is SPRING. The BOY wears a NEW 
               YORK TIMES bag slung over his chest and is tossing copies of 
               the paper. One of them lands on Truman and Jack's stoop.

               INT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - MORNING

               Phone RINGING. Truman asleep.

               INT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, JACK'S TINY OFFICE - SAME TIME

               Jack is writing, longhand, at his desk. PHONE is ringing. 
               Jack notices that his door is slightly ajar. He kicks it 
               shut. The ringing is much quieter. He keeps writing.

               INT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - SAME TIME

               Truman asleep. PHONE ringing. He wakes up, groggy, answers.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Hello.

                         Mr. Smith, you're on the line.

               Now Truman's awake. We hear a series of CLICKS, then:

                         Hello.

               Truman can't bring himself to speak.

                              the cradle, then:)

                         They let me make a couple phone calls 
                         before I go down to Holding... You 
                         heard the Supreme Court rejected the 
                         appeal.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I didn't... I hadn't heard that.

                                     PERRY
                         Yeah.

               Pause.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I'm sorry.

                                     PERRY
                         Yeah. They let me make two phone 
                         calls.

               Truman doesn't know what to say.

                         come visit?

                                     TRUMAN
                         I don't know if I can. I'll try.
                              (beat)
                         I don't know if I can.

               We hear over the line a GUARD in the background:

               CLICK. Truman sits very still, the phone in his hand.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Perry and Dick being shackled, their belongings packed into 
               boxes. One of the GUARDS in Perry's cell CLANGS the bars 
               with his STICK.

                                     GUARD

               INT. KSP, CONFINEMENT CELL - ONE WEEK LATER, NIGHT

               Perry lies alone on his cot. The DOOR opens, KRUTCH enters 
               with a GUARD.

                                     KRUTCH
                         Perry.

               Perry sits up. Krutch sits on the one chair. The Guard stands 
               by the door, takes out a PAD and STUBBY PENCIL.

                                     KRUTCH
                         You're allowed three names of people 
                         you'd like to witness tomorrow. If 
                         there's anybody you want, tell me 
                         now.

                         Truman Capote.

               Krutch nods to the Guard who writes the name down. Krutch 
               waits, then:

                                     KRUTCH
                         Anybody else?

               Perry SHAKES HIS HEAD.

               INT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

               In a chair near the window, Truman sits awake in his pajamas, 
               unable to sleep, completely unable to decide what to do. He 
               watches Jack sleep. A long time -- then Truman walks to the 
               closet, gets out a travel bag, starts to pack.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PLANE, FIRST CLASS SECTION - DAY

               Truman sits next to William Shawn, who looks exhausted. The 
               STEWARDESS is approaching with the DRINKS CART. She collects 
               an empty BABY CUSTARD JAR from Truman's tray.

                                     SHAWN
                         You want anything?

               Truman shakes his head.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Perry sits alone. The door opens and a Guard brings in his 
               LAST MEAL: three hot dogs, french fries, an ice cream sundae, 
               a strawberry soda. The Guard sets it down on the chair.

                                     PERRY

               a custard jar. Truman lies curled in a fetal position on the 
               BED. Shawn walks the floor, exasperated.

                         That's him again.

                         to him.

               Shawn gives up, PICKS UP the phone.

               INT. KSP, CONFINEMENT CELL - NIGHT

               Krutch and Guard enter Perry's cell. Perry hasn't touched 
               his meal.

                         You got a telex.

               Perry nods. Krutch reads:

               Krutch hesitates a moment, then SHAKES his head.

                                     NELLE (ON PHONE)
                         Mr. Shawn? It's Nelle... I just got 
                         this telegram, has he seen it?

               INTERCUT with William Shawn on the phone in Truman's hotel 
               room. A TELEGRAM lies on the DESK. Truman lies on the bed.

               INT. MUEHLEBACH HOTEL ROOM, KANSAS CITY - NIGHT

                                     SHAWN (ON PHONE)
                         He won't look at it.

                                     NELLE
                         Would you put him on please?

                                     SHAWN
                         He won't talk.

                                     NELLE
                              (calmly)
                         Mr. Shawn, if you have to hold him 
                         down and put the phone on his ear, I 
                         need to speak to him.

               Shawn, terrifically uncomfortable, walks over to Truman and 
               holds the phone out to him.

                                     SHAWN
                         It's Nelle.

               A moment, then Truman takes the phone. On Truman's face. We 
               hear, through the receiver, Nelle:

                                     NELLE (OVER PHONE)
                         Truman.

               Truman finally breathes out.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KSP, HOLDING CELL - SAME TIME

               Perry is led, SHACKLED, into a holding cell on the ground 
               floor of the Death Row Building. Dick is already there, 
               seated, shackled. We HEAR PERRY'S VOICE:

                         brief word prior to necktie party...

               The CLOCK reads 11:05pm. Through the WINDOW, we see activity 
               in the Gallows Warehouse across the yard.

               Perry makes eye contact with the Guard, who CHEWS GUM. The 
               Guard checks through the SMALL WINDOW in the door, then 
               approaches Perry, places a STICK OF GUM in Perry's mouth. 
               Perry CHEWS.

                                     PERRY (V.O.)

               Truman opens the door to the other part of the suite, where 
               William Shawn is waiting. Truman is fully dressed and ready. 
               Perry's VOICE:

                                     PERRY (V.O.)

               EXT. KANSAS STATE PENITENTIARY - NIGHT

               TAXICAB pulls up to the prison gates. Perry's VOICE:

                         I have become extremely affectionate

                         Adios amigos. Your friend, Perry."

               INT. KSP, WAITING ROOM OUTSIDE CELLS - NIGHT

               Clock reads 11:35pm. Truman sits with Shawn. Truman is looking 
               at the TELEGRAM from Perry. He folds it, puts it in the breast 
               pocket of his jacket. Krutch approaches.

                                     KRUTCH
                         I didn't think I'd be seeing you 
                         again.
                              (then)
                         You can visit for a few minutes.

               Truman stands, turns to Shawn, still seated.

                                     SHAWN
                         No.

                         Come with me.

                         Truman. No.

               Truman goes alone.

               INT. KSP, HOLDING CELL - NIGHT

               Perry, Dick, a Guard. Krutch lets Truman in.

                                     KRUTCH
                         Five minutes.

               He exits, closes the door. Truman doesn't know what to say.

                                     HICKOCK
                              (without rancor)
                         He returns. Long time.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I don't know what you must think of 
                         me.

                                     HICKOCK
                         You haven't been foremost on my mind 
                         lately. As you can imagine.

               Dick looks at Perry and smiles. Perry chews his gum and smiles 
               back, then looks to Truman who seems upset.

                                     PERRY
                         You got the letter?

                                     TRUMAN
                         Yes.

                                     PERRY
                         It's true. I mean I understand why 
                         you didn't want to come. I wouldn't 
                         be here either if I didn't have to.

                                     HICKOCK
                         You got that right.

               Silence.

                                     PERRY
                         You know Ricardo donated his eyes to 
                         science? Next week, some blind man 
                         will be seeing what Dick used to 
                         see.

                                     HICKOCK
                              (laughs)
                         He'd be better off the way he was. 
                         What I've seen hasn't been so nice 
                         to look at -- but I guess it's better 
                         than nothing.
                              (he shrugs, to Truman)
                         They came around with a form.
                              (beat)
                         Hey. You'll be walking down the street 
                         one day in Denver, wherever -- and 
                         suddenly these eyes will be staring 
                         at you. Wouldn't that be something?

                                     TRUMAN
                              (quietly)
                         It would be.

               Krutch opens the door.

                                     KRUTCH
                         Time.

               Truman looks at the clock: 11:50pm. Truman turns to Perry 
               and Dick. Perry stands.

                                     PERRY
                         You'll be watching?

                                     TRUMAN
                         I don't know. Do you want me to?

                                     PERRY
                         I'd like to have a friend there.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Okay. Then I will.

               Truman looks down, starts to cry.

                                     PERRY
                         It's alright.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I did everything I could.

                                     PERRY
                         Okay.

                                     TRUMAN
                         I truly did.

                                     PERRY
                         I know.

               Truman nods, wipes his eyes.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Goodbye, Perry.

                                     PERRY
                         You're not rid of me yet. I'll see 
                         you in a few minutes.

               Truman goes. On Perry watching him leave.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CORNER WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

               Huge. Dirt floor. Wooden gallows. TWENTY MEN stand around, 
               some smoking. Some are silent. Some whisper quietly.

               Journalists. Also, Alvin Dewey and the KBI men: Church and 
               Nye. Krutch in front of the gallows with a CHAPLAIN. At the 
               foot of the gallows steps, the EXECUTIONER -- thin, older, a 
               too-large pin-striped suit and stained cowboy hat. Truman. 
               William Shawn.

               HEADLIGHTS, then a PRISON CAR enters, stops. Dick is extracted 
               from the back seat. He stands, looks at the CROWD, then at 
               the GALLOWS. The Guards nudge him forward.

               INT. KSP, HOLDING CELL - A FEW MINUTES LATER

               CLOCK reads 12:05pm. Perry sits alone looking at his hands. 
               We HEAR A TRAP DOOR SPRING and CLATTER. Perry looks up.

               INT. PRISON CAR - NIGHT

               Light rain outside. Perry in the back seat being driven across 
               the yard. He looks out his window, sees a PICKUP TRUCK drive 
               out of the Corner Warehouse. On it: a BODY covered by a BLACK 
               CLOTH.

               INT. CORNER WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

               The PRISON CAR enters, stops. Perry is removed from the back 
               seat. He stands, looks at the assembled men, looks at Truman. 
               He's nudged forward. As he passes DEWEY, he extends his hand:

                                     PERRY
                         Nice to see you.

               Dewey is caught off-guard so shakes his hand. Perry is led 
               to the base of the gallows.

                                     KRUTCH
                         Perry Edward Smith.
                              (reads)
                         "For the crime of murder in the first 
                         degree, by order of the Court of 
                         Finney County and the Supreme Court 
                         of the sovereign State of Kansas, 
                         you are sentenced to hang until you 
                         die."
                              (then)
                         You can say something if you want.

                                     PERRY
                              (quietly, to Krutch)
                         Is there anybody from the family 
                         here?

                                     KRUTCH
                         No.

               Perry is disappointed by this information.

                                     PERRY
                         Well. Tell them...
                              (he look out at 
                              everyone)
                         I can't remember what I was going to 
                         say for the life of me...

               He stops. Several moments.

               Krutch can't tell if he's done. Finally, Krutch nods to the 
               Guard. Perry is led up the STEPS. The Chaplain follows.

                                     CHAPLAIN
                         Though I walk through the valley of 
                         the shadow of death, I will fear no 
                         evil, for thou art with me.

               The Executioner puts the NOOSE around Perry's neck. Perry 
               chews his gum. Executioner opens a BLACK CLOTH SACK.

               Perry looks at the Chaplain reading prayers, looks at the 
               crowd, at Truman.

                                     CHAPLAIN
                         Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort 
                         me.

               The BLACK SACK goes over Perry's head. Truman watches. He 
               stands next to Alvin Dewey.

                                     CHAPLAIN
                         Thou preparest a table before me in 
                         the presence of mine enemies. Thou 
                         annointest my head with oil.

               The Executioner pulls the handle, Perry drops.

                                     CHAPLAIN
                         My cup runneth over.

               On Truman. Then a WIDE SHOT of the inside of the Warehouse: 
               twenty men watching Perry Smith hang, the Chaplain reading.

                                                                  FADE OUT.

               OVER BLACK:

               The SOUND of a TELEPHONE RINGING, as heard through the 
               receiver. We HEAR the CLICK of the phone being PICKED UP, 
               then, after a moment, a VOICE:

                                     NELLE
                         Hello.

               FADE UP:

               INT. HOTEL ROOM, KANSAS CITY - EARLY MORNING

               Truman sits on the edge of the bed in his WET OVERCOAT, as 
               if he'd walked in the rain.

                                     TRUMAN
                         Someday I'll tell you about it. For 
                         the moment, I'm too shattered.

               Pause.

                                     NELLE
                         They're dead, Truman. You're alive.

                                     TRUMAN
                         It was a terrible experience and I 
                         will never get over it.
                              (then)
                         There wasn't anything I could have 
                         done to save them.

               We hear Nelle light a cigarette.

                                     NELLE
                         Maybe not.

               We hear her exhale slowly.

                                     NELLE
                         But the fact is, you didn't want to.

               On Truman,

                                                                  FADE OUT.

               FADE IN: BRIGHT WHITE. AIRPLANE NOISE. COLORS RESOLVE INTO:

               INT. FIRST CLASS SECTION, AIRPLANE - DAY

               Truman, seated on the aisle, next to William Shawn. After a 
               long silence, he extracts from his leather briefcase a PACKAGE 
               wrapped in BROWN PAPER. Hands it to Truman.

                                     SHAWN
                         It came to the hotel this morning. I 
                         told them I'd give it to you.

               The package says KANSAS STATE PENITENTIARY and is addressed 
               to Truman. Truman opens it.

               He takes out PERRY'S NOTEBOOKS -- the DIARY and PERSONAL 
               DICTIONARY. He opens the Diary. Toward the end, he finds 
               Perry's final entry. He READS silently. We hear Perry's VOICE:

                                     PERRY (V.O.)
                         Did we not know we were to die, we 
                         would be children. By knowing it, we 
                         are given the opportunity to mature 
                         in spirit...

               Truman turns the page. It's BLANK. He closes the Diary.

               We CONTINUE to hear Perry's VOICE as Truman takes out a 
               SNAPSHOT -- the one of Perry (at age 3) and Linda splashing 
               in the puddle.

                                     PERRY (V.O.)
                         Some take that opportunity. I hope I 
                         have...

               Truman takes out a PENCIL DRAWING Perry did of him. It's 
               very good, though Truman looks old and weary in it.

                                     PERRY
                         Life is only the father of wisdom. 
                         Death is the mother.

               Truman finds, at the bottom of the package, his TIE. He takes 
               it out, clutches it.

               Truman grasps for William Shawn's HAND, finds it, holds on 
               tightly. Shawn sits stoically, hoping no one will notice.

               The CAMERA pulls back, up the aisle. Truman clutches the 
               tie, and holds on to Shawn's hand, for dear life.

                                                             FADE TO BLACK.

               TITLE UP: (each title fades up in succession)

               In Cold Blood made Truman Capote the most famous writer in 
               America.

               He never finished another book.

               The epigraph he chose for his last published work reads: 
               "More tears are shed over answered prayers than unanswered 
               ones. "

               He died in 1984 of complications due to alcoholism.

EXT. RESTAURANT PARKING LOT, LAS VEGAS, 1983 - DAY

SAM 'ACE' ROTHSTEIN, a tall, lean, immaculately dressed man 
approaches his car, opens the door, and gets inside to turn 
on the ignition.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          When you love someone, you've gotta 
          trust them. There's no other way. 
          You've got to give them the key to 
          everything that's yours.  Otherwise, 
          what's the point? And, for a while... 
          I believed that's the kind of love I 
          had.

Suddenly, the car explodes. Flames, smoke and metal rise 
into the sky covering the view of the Las Vegas casinos and 
their signs.

Music in: J.S. Bach - 'St Matthew Passion'.

Ace's body comes flying in - extreme slow motion. His body 
twists and turns through the frame like a soul about to tumble 
into the flames of damnation.

MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE.

INT. TANGIERS CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT

Vignette of ACE through rippling flames, we move in on ACE 
ROTHSTEIN overseeing the casino. He lights a cigarette.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Before I ever ran a casino or got 
          myself blown up, Ace Rothstein was a 
          hell of a handicapper, I can tell 
          you that. I was so good, that whenever 
          I bet, I could change the odds for 
          every bookmaker in the country. I'm 
          serious. I had it down so cold that 
          I was given paradise on earth. I was 
          given one of the biggest casinos in 
          Las Vegas to run, the Tangiers...

INT. SAN MARINO ITALIAN GROCERY/BACK ROOM, KANSAS CITY - 
NIGHT

Vignette of MOB BOSSES sitting at a table surrounded by food 
and wine like the gods of Olympus.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...by the only kind of guys that can 
          actually get you that kind of money: 
          sixty-two million, seven-hundred 
          thousand dollars. I don't know all 
          the details.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Matter of fact...

INT. BAR, LAS VEGAS - NIGHT

Vignette of NICKY SANTORO standing at a bar with DOMINICK 
SANTORO, his brother, and FRANK MARINO, his right-hand man.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...nobody knew all the details, but 
          it should'a been perfect. I mean, he 
          had me, Nicky Santoro, his best 
          friend, watching his ass...

INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

Vignette of GINGER MCKENNA a dazzling thirty-one-year-old 
blonde seated by a small fiery pool.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...and he had Ginger, the woman he 
          loved, on his arm.  But in the end...

INT. TANGIERS SPORTSBOOK/ACE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

ACE looks over the casino he rules.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...we fucked it all up. It should'a 
          been so sweet, too.  But it turned 
          out to be the last time that street 
          guys like us were ever given anything 
          that fuckin' valuable again.

EXT. LAS VEGAS - NIGHT

Aerial shot coming down out of the clouds over the brightly 
lit Vegas Strip and off into the blackness of the desert 
night.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          At that time, Vegas was a place where 
          millions of suckers flew in every 
          year on their own nickel, and left 
          behind about a billion dollars. But 
          at night, you couldn't see the desert 
          that surrounds Las Vegas...

EXT. DESERT - DAWN

Aerial shot swooping along the desert floor, then rising 
above the mist to reveal mountains in the distance.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          But it's in the desert where lots of 
          the town's problems are solved.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Got a lot of holes in the desert, 
          and a lot of problems are buried in 
          those holes. Except you gotta do it 
          right. I mean, you gotta have the 
          hole already dug before you show up 
          with a package in the trunk.  
          Otherwise you're talkin' about a 
          half-hour or forty-five minutes of 
          diggin'. And who knows who's gonna 
          be comin' along in that time? Before 
          you know it, you gotta dig a few 
          more holes. You could be there all 
          fuckin' night.

EXT. LAS VEGAS STRIP, 1973 - NIGHT

TITLE IN: 'THE STRIP', 'LAS VEGAS', 'TEN YEARS EARLIER'

ACE is greeted by a casino exec and walked through the 
brightly lit entrance to the Tangiers Casino.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Who could resist? Anywhere else in 
          the country, I was a bookie, a 
          gambler, always lookin' over my 
          shoulder, hassled by cops, day and 
          night. But here, I'm 'Mr Sam 
          Rothstein'. I'm not only legitimate, 
          but running a casino. And that's 
          like selling dreams for cash.

INT. TANGIERS CASINO - NIGHT

We see ACE enter alone. He is greeted by BILLY SHERBERT. 
They are joined by top executives RICHIE and RONNIE in suits 
and ties. They walk through the casino, past crowded and 
noisy craps tables, spinning roulette wheels, blackjack 
tables, poker-faced players at poker tables, and elegant, 
cordoned-off, black-tie, baccarat tables.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          I hired an old casino pal, Billy 
          Sherbert, as my manager and I went 
          to work.

                      SHERBERT
               (Introducing the EXECS 
               to ACE)
          ...And this is Ronnie, who takes 
          care of the card room...

                      ACE (V.O.)
          For guys like me, Las Vegas washes 
          away your sins. It's a morality car 
          wash. It does for us what Lourdes 
          does for humpbacks and cripples. 
          And, along with making us legit...

INT. TANGIERS/HARD COUNT ROOM - NIGHT

Dolly back from a wall of money. An employee pours a bucket 
full of coins into a trough. Camera follows progress as 
numerous coins move on a conveyor system, through a sorting 
machine. Camera reveals several rolls of coins on a lower 
conveyor as they move up a ladder towards an employee's hands, 
who then places the rolls on a rack.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...comes cash. Tons of it. I mean, 
          what do you think we're doing out 
          here in the middle of the desert?  
          It's all this money. This is the end 
          result of all the bright lights and 
          the comped trips, of all the champagne 
          and free hotel suites, and all the 
          broads and all the booze. It's all 
          been arranged just for us to get 
          your money. That's the truth about 
          Las Vegas.

INT. TANGIERS/FLOOR/SOFT COUNT ROOM - DAY

Camera follows JOHN NANCE carrying a small suitcase and 
walking through the casino to a door leading to the cashier's 
cage. The sign on the door reads 'Authorized Personnel Only'. 
He walks through the cage, to another door: 'Notice - Keep 
Out'.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          We're the only winners. The players 
          don't stand a chance. And their cash 
          flows from the tables to our boxes 
          ...through the cage and into the 
          most sacred room in the casino ...the 
          place where they add up all the money 
          ...the holy of holies ...the count 
          room.

He opens the door. We see inside the count room from NANCE'S 
point of view.

It looks like the area behind a teller's cage in a bank. A 
large room, windowless, decor-free. One side is a mesh cage, 
opened to reveal stacks of cash boxes. Several COUNTERS in 
white shirts are gathered around a glass table counting and 
sorting paper money.)

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Now this place was off limits.

                      COUNTER #1
          Verify two thousand.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Even I couldn't get inside, but it 
          was my job to keep it filled with 
          cash. That's for sure.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          They had so much fuckin' money in 
          there, you could build a house out 
          of stacks of $100 bills. And the 
          best part was that upstairs, the 
          board of directors didn't know what 
          the fuck was going on.

At one end of the room the clerks empty the metal boxes and 
rapidly count the cash at a counting table. The camera follows 
a cash 'drop box' being lifted from the stack by a clerk. He 
pours the cash on to the table and shows the empty box to a 
video camera. COUNTER #2 rapidly counts the cash and 
announces:

                      COUNTER #2
          Five thousand.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          I mean, to them everything looked on 
          the up and up. Right? Wrong.

The first counter recounts the cash.

                      COUNTER #1
          Verify five thousand.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          The guys inside the counting room...

Stacks of bills lie nearby. The camera pans across the room 
to another table manned by a COUNT ROOM EXECUTIVE who repeats 
the figure and writes it down on a master list.

                      COUNT ROOM EXEC
          Five thousand.

We move back to NANCE opening a cabinet full of stacks of 
$100 bills. He opens his suitcase and begins to fill it with 
cash. As he does this, the workers studiously look in other 
directions.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...were all slipped in there to skim 
          the joint dry.  They'd do short 
          counts, they'd lose fill slips. They'd 
          even take cash right out of the drop 
          boxes. And it was up to this guy 
          right here [NANCE], standin' in front 
          of about two million dollars, to 
          skim the cash off the top without 
          anybody gettin' wise ...the IRS or 
          anybody.

                      COUNTER #1
          Verify two hundred.

NANCE closes the case and walks out. One of the counters 
dumps another container of money on the table.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Now, notice how in the count room 
          nobody ever seems to see anything. 
          Somehow, somebody's always lookin' 
          the other way. Now, look at these 
          guys [COUNTERS]. They look busy, 
          right?  They're countin' money. Who 
          wants to bother them? I mean, God 
          forbid they should make a mistake 
          and forget to steal. Meanwhile, you're 
          in and you're out.

NANCE exits the count room and proceeds through the lobby of 
the casino, passing ACE and SHERBERT, to a side exit door.

                      NICKY
          Past the jag-off guard who gets an 
          extra c-note a week just to watch 
          the door.  I mean, it's routine. 
          Business as usual: in, out, hello, 
          goodbye. And that's all there is to 
          it. Just another fat fuck walkin' 
          out of the casino with a suitcase. 
          Now, that suitcase was goin' straight 
          to one place: right to Kansas City 
          ...which was as close to Las Vegas 
          as the Midwest bosses could go without 
          gettin' themselves arrested.

NANCE leaves the casino and gets into a cab parked at the 
curb.

EXT. KANSAS CITY AIRPORT - DAY

NANCE arrives. He is greeted by ARTIE PISCANO, a gray-haired 
sixty-year-old underboss.

TITLE IN: 'KANSAS CITY'

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          That suitcase was all the bosses 
          ever wanted ...and they wanted it 
          every month.

                      PISCANO
          Hey, John, how are you? How was your 
          ride?

EXT. SAN MARINO ITALIAN GROCERY, KANSAS CITY - DAY

NANCE, with suitcase, and PISCANO leave the car and enter 
the produce market.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Now this old Mormon fuck here...

              CUT TO: NANCE, AS HE GETS OUT OF PISCANO'S CAR

INT. SAN MARINO ITALIAN GROCERY, KANSAS CITY - DAY

NANCE and PISCANO walk through the grocery store, through 
the warehouse, past various employees to a doorway leading 
into the back room, where they are greeted by five older men 
around a large wooden table with bowls of macaroni and old 
jelly glasses filled with red wine.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...he had to fly in with suitcases 
          once a month, nice and easy.

                      NANCE
          Somethin' smells good.

                      PISCANO
          Yeah, they made us somethin' to eat.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          The bosses would come from all over 
          the place: Detroit, Cleveland, 
          Milwaukee. All over the Midwest.  
          And they would meet in the back of 
          this produce market in Kansas City. 
          I mean, nobody even knew.

NANCE shakes hands with AMERICO CAPELLI, sixty-eight, a bald, 
affable Milwaukee entrepreneur and ARTHUR CAPP, his thirty-
year-old yuppie lawyer son.

Camera continues to pan around the room.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          One of the guys made his mother do 
          all the cooking.

On VINCENT BORELLI, seventy-year-old Kansas City boss.

                      BORELLI
          Did you ever see that guy Jerry 
          Steriano?

On VINNIE FORLANO, mid-seventies, an old-timer who once drove 
for Capone and is now Remo Gaggi's right-hand man.

                      FORLANO
          Jerry Steriano?

                      BORELLI
          Yeah.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Now, these old greaseballs might not 
          look it, but believe me, these are 
          the guys who secretly controlled Las 
          Vegas.

PISCANO joins his MOTHER and DAUGHTER by a stove.

                      PISCANO'S MOTHER
          That man's here again.

Piscano dips a piece of bread into a pot of tomato sauce.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Because they controlled the Teamsters' 
          Union, and that's where you had to 
          go if you wanted to borrow money to 
          buy a casino.

                      BORELLI (O.S.)
          When you've finished with him, I 
          want him.

                      PISCANO'S MOTHER
               (Carrying a plate of 
               food to the table 
               where BORELLI and 
               FORLANO are seated.)
          Here you are, gentlemen.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          And nobody got a Teamsters' loan, 
          unless the guys in this room knew 
          they were gonna get their little 
          suitcases.

FORLANO gets up from the table and walks toward NANCE.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Guys like this antique here [FORLANO], 
          out of Detroit. Or especially guys 
          like Remo Gaggi, the outfit's top 
          boss.

NANCE embraces REMO GAGGI who's seated on a couch, and sits 
across from him.

                      GAGGI
          You got a round figure on it?

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Definitely the most important guy in 
          this room.

                      NANCE
               (Picking up the 
               suitcase)
          About twenty pounds.

                      GAGGI
          So?

                      NANCE
          That's around seven hundred thousand.

                      GAGGI
          Uh-huh, good.

NANCE opens the case to reveal the money.

                      ANDY STONE
               (Off-screen, from 
               following scene)
          I know it's a little early for Las 
          Vegas...

INT. TANGIERS EXECUTIVE OFFICE PRESS CONFERENCE/BANQUET ROOM - 
DAY

Camera tilts down a model of the Tangiers Hotel and Casino, 
then reveals the cover of Business Week magazine with a 
drawing of PHILIP GREEN, a young corporate type, smiling out 
under the headline: 'Philip Green, Vegas Wunderkind'.

                      STONE (O.S.)
          ...but I do want to welcome the ladies 
          and gentlemen of the gaming industry.

On ANDY STONE, a middle-aged man at a podium giving a speech 
while GREEN, seated at a table, looks on. PHOTOGRAPHERS flash 
their cameras. ACE and SHERBERT, sitting next to GREEN, also 
watch the photo op ceremony.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          As far as the world was concerned 
          Andy Stone, the head of the Teamsters' 
          Pension Fund, was a legitimate guy.

                      STONE
          This is a very auspicious occasion.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          A powerful man.

                      STONE
          Philip, if you would rise.

Green stands up.   

                      ACE (V.O.)
          He even played golf with the 
          President.

                      STONE
          On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension 
          Fund, it is my pleasure to present 
          to you . . .

                      ACE (V.O.)
          But Andy also took orders. And when 
          he was told to give a pension fund 
          loan to Philip Green...

                      STONE
               (Handing GREEN a large 
               cardboard facsimile 
               'check')
          ...this check for $62,700,000 for 
          the new Tangiers.

                      GREEN
          Thank you.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...he did what he was told.

PHILIP GREEN, who is now the head of the Tangiers Hotel and 
Casino Corporation, is standing at the podium giving a speech.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Now here was the perfect front man. 
          I mean, what the fuck else could he 
          be?  He didn't know too much. He 
          didn't want to know too much, 
          especially that the bosses made the 
          Teamsters lend him the money. He 
          wanted to believe the Teamsters gave 
          him all that fuckin' money 'cause he 
          was smart.

An exploding flash bulb fills the screen.

                      GREEN
          ...I say that, knowing full well 
          just how much competition we have in 
          this great city.

EXT. CHEAP MOTEL OFF HIGHWAY - DAY

We see a MAN and a WOMAN swimming underwater. Camera reveals 
that they are in a motel swimming pool with glass portholes.  
Expensive cars are parked outside one of the rooms. Hoods 
stand around outside the door.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          And where they got Green from - who 
          the fuck knows?  All I know is that 
          Green was an Arizona real estate 
          hustler, who barely had enough gas 
          money to come and pick up his own 
          fuckin' check...

INT. TANGIERS EXECUTIVE OFFICE PRESS CONFERENCE/BANQUET ROOM - 
DAY

We return to the press conference. Photographers snap away. 
In the background are six-foot blow-ups of the Business Week 
cover. The camera moves past GREEN, CAPP and several other 
men, past SHERBERT, to ACE.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Now, all they needed was somebody 
          they could trust to run the casino. 
          And who better than Ace?  I mean, he 
          was already in Vegas a couple of 
          years and he had the fuckin' place 
          clocked.

FREEZE FRAME ON ACE.

INT. TANGIERS SWIMMING POOL - DAY

Camera looks straight down from the top of a hotel to a large 
pool area.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          But typical Ace...

INT. TANGIERS SWIMMING POOL/POOLSIDE - DAY

STONE, in a bathing suit and robe, sits on a lounge chair 
with a telephone. ACE, in sports clothes, sits on another 
chair.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...give him a shot at runnin' a casino 
          and he tries to talk you out of it.

                      ACE
          You know, I don't know if I could do 
          this even if I wanted to. The Gaming 
          Commission would never give me a 
          license. I have at least two dozen 
          gambling and bookmaking pinches on 
          me.

                      STONE
          You don't have to have a license to 
          work in a casino. All you gotta do 
          is apply for one. The state law says 
          you can work in a casino while they're 
          processing your application. They 
          got a ten-year backlog.

                      ACE
          But what happens when they do find 
          out?

                      STONE
          Why would they want to find out? 
          We're puttin' a hundred million into 
          this desert here. Why would they 
          want to lock us out?  And besides, 
          they'll never find out. All you gotta 
          do is keep changing your job title. 
          Like, uh, from Casino Executive to 
          Food and Beverage Chairman. And what 
          happens it, they take your 
          application, they put it at the bottom 
          of the pile. I know guys workin' 
          there for thirty years, don't have a 
          license.

                      ACE
               (Exhales)
          It's a tough proposition, Andy. You, 
          you know, if I did it, I'd have to 
          run it my way.

                      STONE
          You got it.

                      ACE
          I'm serious. No interference.

                      STONE
          Nobody's gonna interfere with your 
          running the casino. I guarantee it.

Stone lights a cigarette.

INT. TANGIERS CRAPS PIT - NIGHT

ACE blows on a die.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          And that's how that got Ace to take 
          over.

ACES's hands place the die into a micrometer.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
           
          They wanted him because Ace ate, 
          slept and breathed gambling.

Camera swish tilts up to ACE, then swish pans to boxman, 
dealers and players watching him, trying to act calm.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          They worked out a real cute job title 
          too.

We see the die in the micrometer.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Tangiers Public Relations Director.

Satisfied the die is not loaded ACE sets it on the craps 
table, the camera cranes up to reveal the Tangiers Casino 
floor.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          But the only thing he ever directed 
          was the casino. He made his first 
          bet when he was fifteen years old, 
          and he always made money. But he 
          didn't bet like you or me.

A DEALER is sliding chips, tossing them on to a craps table.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          You know, havin' some fun with it, 
          shit like that.

                      ACE
               (Approaching the DEALER)
          Where the hell did you learn how to 
          deal?
               (He reaches down, 
               stacking and arranging 
               the chips.)

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.

                      ACE
               (To the chastised 
               DEALER)
          Place the checks properly. That's 
          the way you do it.

                      DEALER
          Yes, sir.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          He had to know everything, this guy.

Direct overhead tracking shot as ACE walks between two rows 
of gaming tables.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          He'd find out the kind of inside 
          stuff nobody else knew, and that's 
          what he'd put his money on.

INT. GYM/BOOKIE JOINT, BACK HOME, PRE-SEVENTIES - DAY

ACE walks past two boxers sparring in a ring, through a 
doorway into a room where several gamblers are seated around 
a table.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Even back home, years ago, when we 
          were first hangin' out together...

TITLE IN: 'BACK HOME, YEARS AGO'

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...he'd know if the quarterback was 
          on coke.

ACE is looking at the odds board for college football games. 
The bookie, LUCKY LARRY, is waiting for ACE to hand in his 
picks.

                      ACE
          I'll take Columbia for twenty.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          If his girlfriend was knocked up.

                      LUCKY LARRY
          Twenty dimes on Columbia . . .

As soon as ACE bets, a man erases a number from the chalkboard 
and replaces it was a '6', changing the odds. Two GAMBLERS 
saunter from the room.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          He'd get the wind velocity so he 
          could judge the field goals. He even 
          figured out the different bounce you 
          got off the different kinds of wood 
          they used on college basketball 
          courts, you know?

EXT. GYM/BOOKIE JOINT PUBLIC PHONES - DAY

The two GAMBLERS we saw sauntering out of the bookie joint 
are racing to the nearest public phones. Another GAMBLER has 
already beaten them to it.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          He'd be workin' on this shit day and 
          night. There was nothin' about a 
          game he was gonna bet that he didn't 
          know.

                      GAMBLER #1
               (Into phone)
          Ace got down at six.

                      GAMBLER #2
               (Into phone)
          Charlie, hey. Rothstein got six.

INT. GYM/BOOKIE JOINT, SEVERAL DAYS LATER - DAY

A bookie hands a stack of money to another bookie, who hands 
the money to ACE.

ACE removes several bills from the top of the stack of 
winnings and holds them out to the BOOKIES.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Season after season, the prick was 
          the only guaranteed winner I ever 
          knew. But he was so serious about it 
          all that I don't think he ever enjoyed 
          himself.  But...

ACE exits.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...that's just the way he was.

INT. MOB SOCIAL CLUB BACK ROOM - NIGHT

The room has an espresso machine and a saint's day calendar. 
Assorted hoods are listening to NICKY at the bar. Camera 
dollies to REMO GAGGI, at the rear table playing gin rummy 
with OLD MAN CAPO and losing. Every time the CAPO picks up a 
card, he's able to knock or get gin, sending GAGGI into a 
fit bemoaning his bad luck.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          But back then the bosses didn't give 
          a fuck about whether he enjoyed 
          himself of not. To them, he was a 
          cash register. All they had to do 
          was ring the bell and take the money. 
          Especially Remo, who was a fuckin' 
          degenerate gambler who always lost.

                      GAGGI
               (Slams down his cards 
               and curses at his 
               losing hands)
          Ma che cazzo!

[Italian-American slang for 'What a prick.'] All those fuckin' 
sweeps.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          I mean, unless Ace made his bet.

                      GAGGI
          That's enough now!

                      OLD MAN CAPO
          I can't contest the cards.

                      GAGGI
          Va fa 'n culo! [Italian-American 
          slang for 'Fuck off'] 
               (Summoning a young 
               man.)
          Johnny!

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Ace made more money for them on a 
          weekend than I could do heisting 
          joints for a month.

ACE enters and walks to GAGGI's table.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Whatever Ace picked up on the street 
          he told Remo.

                      NICKY
               (Walks over to ACE 
               and whispers)
          Hey, did you bring that thing?

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          You know, I mean fixed fights, doped 
          horses, crooked fuckin' zebras... 
          locked-in point spreads. He told 
          fuckin' Remo everything. And to tell 
          you the truth. I don't blame him.

GAGGI stands up and shakes ACE's hand.

                      GAGGI
          Ace.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Keepin' Remo happy with money was 
          the greatest insurance policy in the 
          world.

GAGGI beams as ACE takes out an envelope filled with cash 
and hands it over to him. GAGGI sits back down and ACE, 
knowing his place, smiles and is about to leave.

                      GAGGI
          Son-of-a-bitch. How the hell did you 
          get Oklahoma-Michigan?  Nobody ever 
          had Oklahoma-Mi... How the hell'd 
          you do it?

                      ACE
          Well, that's why they paid so well.

                      GAGGI
          You see?
               (Chuckles.)
          Never tells me nothin'. Ace, what do 
          we got on for next week?

                      ACE
          Well, it's a little too early. I'd 
          say Thursday would be good. I'll 
          know by then. Is that all right?

                      GAGGI
          Okay. You come by the house?

                      ACE
          I'll come by.

                      GAGGI
          Seven o'clock?

                      ACE
          Seven o'clock.

GAGGI gets up and kisses ACE as NICKY and OLD MAN CAPO look 
on.

                      GAGGI
          Good job, my boy. Keep it up. Okay, 
          Ace?

ACE nods in agreement and leaves the room.

                      GAGGI
               (To NICKY)
          Hey, Nick. Vien acca. [Italian-
          American slang for 'Come here']

                      NICKY
               (To ACE)
          I'll be right out.

                      GAGGI
          T'aggia parla. [Italian-American 
          slang for 'I've got to talk to you'] 
          Nicky... See that guy?
               (pointing to the off-
               screen ACE)

                      NICKY
          Mm.

                      GAGGI
          Keep a good eye on him. He's makin' 
          a lot of money for us. And he's gonna 
          continue makin' a lot of money for 
          us, so keep a good eye on him.

                      NICKY
          Mm.

                      GAGGI
          Not like your fuckin' friends out 
          there, that... without brains.  Okay?

                      NICKY
          All right.

                      GAGGI
          Uh-huh. Mi raccomando. [Italian-
          American slang for 'I'm counting on 
          you']

                      NICKY
          Yeah.

                      GAGGI
          Fine.

                      NICKY
               (Reaching down to 
               touch GAGGI's money, 
               joking with him.)
          Want me to take this for you?
               (He walks out.)

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          So, now, on top of everything else, 
          I gotta make sure that nobody fucks 
          around with the Golden Jew.

INT. BACK HOME BAR - NIGHT

We move past JOE, a guy at the bar entertaining a BRUNETTE 
and a BLONDE, to NICKY and FRANK MARINO at the other end. 
There are other bar patrons in the background.

                      JOE
               (To the BARTENDER)
          Chase, couple of shooters for the 
          ladies.

                      BARTENDER (O.S.)
          All right.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Yeah, we made a great pair. I made 
          book and Nicky made sure we always 
          collected. The old men loved us. And 
          why not? They all made money with 
          us.

                      NICKY
               (To MARINO)
          They payin'?

                      ACE (V.O.)
          How did Nicky collect?

                      MARINO
          They pay every week, like they're 
          supposed to.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Don't ask. 

                      NICKY
          Then where the fuck is the money? I 
          don't see the money.

ACE enters, and greets the two girls.

                      ACE
          Hi, Melissa. Heidi.

                      BLONDE
          Hi, Sam.

                      JOE
               (To the GIRLS)
          Who's this guy?

                      MARINO
               (To NICKY)
          Get the fuck out of here. It was 
          nine. I laid nine.

ACE approaches NICKY and MARINO.

                      NICKY
          It was eight.  Ace... tell him the 
          line on the Bear's game.

                      ACE
          Eight.

                      NICKY
          If he don't know, nobody knows. Told 
          you it was eight.

                      MARINO
          Well, how come I laid nine?

                      NICKY
          'Cause you're a jag-off. I would 
          have fuckin' made you lay ten...

ACE notices a pen lying on the bar. He taps JOE on the 
shoulder.

                      ACE
               (To JOE)
          Excuse me.

                      JOE
          What?

                      ACE
               (He holds up the pen)
          Is this yours? Your pen?

                      JOE
          Yeah, that's my pen. Why?

                      ACE
          I ju- Well, it's a nice pen. I just 
          didn't know whose it was. I thought 
          it was yours. I didn't want it to 
          get lost.

                      JOE
          Well, thank you. Why don't you take 
          that fuckin' pen and shove it up you 
          ass, you fuckin' jag-off?

NICKY looks over.

                      ACE
          Well, I was just offering you the-

NICKY moves towards JOE.

                      JOE
               (Turning his back to 
               talk to the girls, 
               referring to ACE)
          This fuckin' asshole.

NICKY grabs the pen out of ACE's hand.

                      MAN #1
               (To JOE)
          Look out!

Before ACE can react, NICKY grabs JOE and starts stabbing 
him in the neck with the pen.

                      MAN #1
          Joe! Look out, Joe! Look out!

NICKY grunts while JOE gasps and groans. The BLONDE screams 
while NICKY's hand continues to plunge the pen into JOE's 
throat. JOE tumbles to the floor.

NICKY pounces on him, still stabbing and now kicking. JOE 
whimpers.

                      NICKY
          What's that? You hear? You hear a 
          little girl, Frankie? You hear a 
          little girl, Ace? Is that a little 
          fuckin' girl?!  What happened to the 
          fuckin' tough guy?  Told my friend 
          stick it up his fuckin' ass?! Huh?! 
          Huh?!

                      ACE
               (Over whimpers and 
               pants)
          Wait a sec, Nicky, Nicky, Nicky. Ta-
          take it easy.

ACE looks stunned. NICKY's still holding the bloody pen.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          While I was tryin' to figure out why 
          the guy was sayin' what he was sayin', 
          Nicky just hit him. No matter how 
          big a guy might be, Nicky would take 
          him on. You beat Nicky with fists, 
          he comes back with a bat. You beat 
          him with a knife, he comes back with 
          a gun. And you beat him with a gun, 
          you better kill him, because he'll 
          keep comin' back and back until one 
          of you is dead.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Listen...

INT. TANGIERS CASINO FLOOR, 1972 - NIGHT

Camera swoops from a woman cheering as she wins at a slot-
machine to a blackjack table, then to a roulette table and 
over to a craps table.

Montage of very short cuts of chips being picked up, dice 
thrown, money being poured from a bucket, stacks of money.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...with me protecting Ace, he made a 
          fortune for the bosses. I mean that's 
          what got him to Vegas. He was a money 
          machine. A tremendous earner for 
          these guys.  As soon as he took over, 
          he doubled the fuckin' drop. With 
          Ace the casino never saw so much 
          money. And the bosses, they couldn't 
          be happier.

INT. TANGIERS CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT

Camera moves in on ACE as he looks out over the casino. 
Dealers deftly stack chips, scoop up losses and pay off 
winners. Chips and money are everywhere.

In extreme close-up slow motion a die falls on to a table.

INT. TANGIERS CASINO SLOT-MACHINE AREA - NIGHT

ACE and SHERBERT are walking down a casino aisle by the slot-
machines. Dealers immediately snap to attention at their 
approach.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          In Vegas, I had to keep a few juiced-
          in local cowboys working. They were 
          close to the, you know, good old 
          boys.

                      ACE
               (To SHERBERT)
          Pay him six hundred a week, tell him 
          to walk around and look smart.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          I mean, without us, these guys, they'd 
          still be shovellin' mule shit.

ACE points at paper cups, empty glasses and the debris of 
silver dollar wrappings on the floor. DON WARD, the Slots 
Manager in Western garb, immediately starts picking up the 
debris. ACE looks at WARD sternly.

                      ACE
          Ward, you gotta keep a cleaner 
          station. If you need 'Mr Clean', 
          page him, all right?

WARD bends down and picks up some trash.

                      WARD
          It won't happen again, Sam.

                      ACE
          Mr Rothstein.

                      ACE
               (To SHERBERT)
          Is this guy just another dumb fuckin' 
          white man, or what? What's his story?

                      SHERBERT
          We need this guy.

                      ACE
          We can't get rid of him?

                      SHERBERT
          He's juiced in. He's the County 
          Commissioner's cousin.

                      ACE
          I wouldn't give the bum a mop job.

They exit.

INT. TANGIERS BACCARAT TABLES - NIGHT

A card shoe slides across the baccarat table. A state SENATOR, 
a little drunk, tips the dealer, kisses the blonder HOOKER 
with him, fills his pockets with his winnings and walks over 
to see ACE.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          These yokels ran the state.

                      DEALER #1
          Thank you very much, Senator.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          They passed the laws, they owned the 
          courts.

                      SENATOR
          Hi, Ace.

                      ACE
          Hello, Senator.

They shake hands.

                      SENATOR
               (To ACE)
          Hey, I need a room. Need a room.

                      ACE
          Good to see ya.
               (To SHERBERT)
          William would you...

The SENATOR shakes hands with SHERBERT as the HOOKER joins 
them.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          I had dozens of politicians and state 
          officials comin' through that place 
          every week.

                      SHERBERT
          Nice to see you, Senator.

                      ACE
               (To SHERBERT)
          Help the Senator, give him whatever 
          he wants.

                      SHERBERT
          Certainly.
               (Leads the way.)
          Senator.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Why not make them happy?

                      SHERBERT
          We have some nice penthouses you'll 
          enjoy. Maybe the Presidential Suite.

INT. TANGIERS PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - DAY

The SENATOR unzips the HOOKER's dress, kisses her and walks 
through the bedroom doorway, looking over his shoulder to 
her as she takes off her dress and walks out of his sight.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          For politicians...

INT. TANGIERS BACCARAT TABLES - DAY

ACE smoking a cigarette by the baccarat tables.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...like our state senator up there, 
          everything was on the house.

INT. TANGIERS PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - DAY

The SENATOR opens a bureau drawer and takes out a small velvet 
pouch and pours black $100 into his palm.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          These guys won their comped life 
          when they got elected. So, hey, why 
          not take advantage of it? Still, the 
          politicians come cheap. We could 
          handle them.

INT. TANGIERS, ICHIKAWA LUXURY SUITE - DAY

K. K. ICHIKAWA a Japanese businessman, and a male associate 
pick up towels and soap from about the bedroom of their suite. 
A blonde woman checks herself in the mirror.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          It's a whale like K. K. Ichikawa, 
          who plays thirty thousand dollars a 
          hand in baccarat. That's the one you 
          really gotta watch.

ICHIKAWA and his associate walk into the the suite's living-
room and join a Japanese woman seated on a couch.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          He plays fast and big and he has the 
          cash and the credit to turn out your 
          lights. About a year ago, he cleaned 
          out a couple of casinos in the Cayman 
          Islands.

They begin to stuff Tangiers soap and towels into their 
luggage.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Downstairs, he takes us for two 
          million... and upstairs he takes 
          free soap, shampoo and towels. Another 
          billionaire cheapskate who loves his 
          free rooms...

EXT. TANGIERS JET, LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DAY

The Tangiers jet with the Tangiers logo on its side as 
ICHIKAWA shakes ACE's hands before boarding. SHERBERT follows 
him and his associates aboard.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...free private jets, and two million 
          of our money.

                      ACE
          Nice to see you again.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          But we got him back. I had our pilot 
          tell him the plane was on the fritz.

EXT. TANGIERS JET, STILL IN THE SAME SPOT - NIGHT

SHERBERT apologizes to ICHIKAWA and his entourage as they 
all get off the jet.

                      SHERBERT
          Ken, I don't know what the hell went 
          wrong. I'm awfully sorry.

                      ICHIKAWA
          This is a big problem. Big problem.

                      SHERBERT
          I can't understand it. These 
          mechanical things, you know, they 
          happen. Hey, be-better here than
               (gesturing to the sky)
          up there, you know what I mean?

INT. LAS VEGAS AIRPORT RESERVATION DESK - NIGHT

SHERBERT arguing with TICKET AGENT as ICHIKAWA and entourage 
look glum.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Then he missed the commercial flights 
          connecting with Japan.

                      AGENT
          I'm so sorry. There's a convention 
          in town, and all flights are booked.

                      SHERBERT
          A convention?
               (Turning to ICHIKAWA)
          I can't believe that there's a 
          convention. It's never... ?

                      ICHIKAWA
          What can I do?

EXT. TANGIERS CASINO - NIGHT

A smiling ACE greets ICHIKAWA and his entourage as they drive 
up and get out of Tangiers limos.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          We got him back ...with a whole floor 
          of rooms for himself.

                      ACE
          I'm sorry you missed the plane.

                      ICHIKAWA
          You want to get my money back, right?
               (Chuckles)

                      ACE
          No, no, no. No gambling. No.

INT. TANGIERS BACCARAT TABLES - NIGHT

ICHIKAWA, with the Japanese woman, picks up some chips and 
places them on the table. ACE and SHERBERT watch from behind 
a barrier.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          He bet one thousand a hand instead 
          of his usual thirty thousand a hand.

A dealer's hands slide two cards on the table.

                      DEALER
          The bank wins a natural eight over a 
          five.

Another dealer's hands place two chips on a table. ICHIKAWA 
looks on.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          But I knew, the trick with whales 
          like Ichikawa was that they can't 
          bet small for long. He didn't think 
          of it as winning ten thousand, he 
          thought of it as losing ninety 
          thousand.

ICHIKAWA places a larger bet.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          So, he upped his bets...

A dealer picks up some chips from a rack and places them on 
the table.

ICHIKAWA is now seated with stacks of chips in front of him.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...until he dropped his winnings 
          back and gave up a million of his 
          own cash.

                                                DISSOLVE TO:

ICHIKAWA, hours later, his chips depleted. ACE and SHERBERT 
still watch from behind the barrier as millions in chips are 
back in the dealer's racks.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          In the casino, the cardinal rule is 
          to keep them playing...

          In the end, we get it all.

INT. TANGIERS CASINO - NIGHT

ACE, with pit bosses next to him, looks out over the huge 
casino where hundreds of thousands of dollars are being poured 
into machines.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          In Vegas, everybody's gotta watch 
          everybody else.

Camera reveals the DEALER at a craps table.

                      DEALER
          Six, an easy way. Six! All right, 
          who's gonna give me... 

The DEALER places some chips on the table.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Since the players are looking to 
          beat the casino...

THE CAMERA IS ON THE DEALER.

                      DEALER
          ...both dice must hit that back wall 
          each and every roll. All right, make 
          a six!

CAMERA PANS TO A WOMAN AND A MAN AT THE TABLE. THE WOMAN 
TOSSES SOME DICE.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...the dealers are watching the 
          players.

                      WOMAN
          Gimme a six!

                      DEALER
          Come on, baby, make a six!

A BOX MAN, seated mid-table is watching the DEALER.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          The box men are watching the dealers.

               every roll.)

CAMERA PANS TO A FLOOR MAN, STANDING DIRECTLY BEHIND THE BOX 
MAN.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          The floor men are watching the box 
          men.

THE FLOOR.

          men.

SWISH PAN TO A SHIFT BOSS SURVEYING THE CASINO.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          The shift bosses are watching the 
          pit bosses.

SWISH PAN TO SHERBERT.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          The casino manager is watching the 
          shift bosses.

SWISH PAN TO ACE.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          I'm watching the casino manager.

CAMERA SWISH PANS AND TILTS UP TO A VIDEO CAMERA MOUNTED 
INSIDE A GLASS DOME HANGING FROM THE CEILING.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          And the eye-in-the-sky is watching 
          us all.

SWISH PAN TO:

INT. TANGIERS-EYE-IN-THE SKY MONITOR ROOM - NIGHT

Video monitors show a dealer fanning a row of bills. Swish 
pan to ACE and SHERBERT watching the monitor. ACE lights a 
cigarette.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Plus...

SWISH PAN TO SURVEILLANCE CATWALKERS ADJUSTING CAMERAS AND 
SPYING ON PLAYERS BELOW WITH BINOCULARS.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...we had a dozen guys up there, 
          most of them ex-cheats, who knew 
          every trick in the house.

INT. TANGIERS CRAPS TABLE - NIGHT

Ginger squeals as she throws the dice across the table.

                      HIGH ROLLER
          Come on, come on.

She rolls a winner.

                      GINGER
          Yes!

                      HIGH ROLLER
          Thank you. Very nice.

                      GINGER
               (Chuckles)
          I told you I was hot tonight.

INT. TANGIERS EYE-IN-THE-SKY MONITOR ROOM - NIGHT

Sound out: The monitor shows GINGER and the HIGH ROLLER 
cheering, she throws her arms around him. The crowd goes 
crazy.

SWISH PAN TO ACE LOOKING ON INTENTLY.

On screen, GINGER's hand sneaks a chip from the rack and 
subtly moves it towards her purse.

INT. TANGIERS CRAPS TABLE - NIGHT

Sound in: GINGER slips the chip quietly into her bag.

                      HIGH ROLLER
               (Off-screen)
          Let's go. This is for Ginger. Come 
          on. This is for Ginger.

The HIGH ROLLER notices GINGER's hand on her purse. She 
pretends to have taken out her lipstick.

                      GAMBLER #1
          Let me have a hundred on the hard 
          ten. Thank you.

                      GAMBLER #2
          Hard ten. One hundred.

INT. TANGIERS EYE-IN-THE-SKY MONITOR ROOM - NIGHT

ACE continues to look at the monitor. SHERBERT and a security 
man seated at a video console also look on.

INT. TANGIERS CRAPS TABLE - NIGHT

A craps stick pushes some dice towards GINGER. She rolls 
again, only this time she craps out. Gamblers groan, then 
applaud her. She's made so much money for the table that the 
winners toss chips in her direction.

                      HIGH ROLLER
          I'm sorry.

                      GINGER
          Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
               (To the table)
          Thank you very much. Thank you very 
          much.

ACE and two casino execs are now on the floor watching her.

                      GINGER
          Thank you, sir, I appreciate that. 
          Everybody, thanks. Gives some chips 
          as tips to the dealer and box man. 
          Thanks. Take care, Steve. Take chances 
          and drive fast.

                      HIGH ROLLER
          Ginger, honey.

                      DEALER
          Thank you very much, now.

                      HIGH ROLLER
          Ginger, honey, this is for you love. 
          Thanks for your time.

She turns to the HIGH ROLLER, who is handing her a thin stack 
of chips worth about $2,000.

                      GINGER
               (Chuckles)
          Come on.

                      HIGH ROLLER
          What's the matter?

                      GINGER
          What do you mean, 'What's the matter?' 
          I made a lot of money for you. I 
          want my cut.

                      HIGH ROLLER
          What money? I've seen you stealing 
          from me.

                      GINGER
          What money?  Look at this stack of 
          chips. Don't give me that shit. I 
          want my end.

                      HIGH ROLLER
          Ginger, I've been watching you all 
          night. You've been stealing from me.

                      GINGER
          Don't give me that shit. I want my 
          money.

                      HIGH ROLLER
          That bag's full of fuckin' chips you

                      GINGER
               (Interrupts)
          What do you mean 'stole'? I didn't 
          steal anything from you.

ACE watches the argument heat up.

                      HIGH ROLLER
          Get lost, Ginger! Get lost!

                      GINGER
          Get lost?

                      HIGH ROLLER
          Yes.

                      GINGER
          Get lost?

                      HIGH ROLLER
          Yes.

GINGER knocks the chip rack out of his hands.

                      GINGER
          Well, how 'bout that?

                      HIGH ROLLER
          Come on!
               (He bends down to 
               pick them up.)

Gamblers and dealers shout and yell. She picks up another 
rack of chips and tosses them into the air, then another, 
and another. Chips fly all over the casino. Everyone starts 
diving for chips. Dealers. Players. Security guards.  
Waitresses. Pit bosses. Bedlam.

ACE and the two execs with him are the only ones not diving 
for chips. He looks at GINGER. She looks at him.

FREEZE FRAME ON GINGER.

Slow motion: GINGER smiles at ACE and walks off.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          What a move. I fell in love right 
          there.

INT. COCKTAIL LOUNGE - NIGHT

GINGER and ACE are seated on a banquette. Close up of his 
hand attaching a diamond and ruby pin to her dress. Tilt up 
to GINGER's smiling face beaming at ACE.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          But in Vegas, for a girl like Ginger, 
          love costs money.

They kiss.

                      GINGER
          I'm going to go powder my nose.
               (ACE hands GINGER a 
               single $50 bill. She 
               smiles coyly. He 
               hands her another 
               fifty.)

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Ginger's mission in life was money.

                      GINGER
          I'll be right back.

                      ACE (O.S.)
               (from following scene)
          See you, Ginger.

FLASHBACK - EXT. CASINO ENTRANCE - NIGHT

GINGER waves goodbye to the DOORMAN and walks towards two 
VALET PARKERS who greet her warmly. She gets a bottle of 
pills from one of them and slips some cash into his hand in 
return.

                      GINGER
          Okay, thank you for asking.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          She was a queen around the casino. 
          She brought in high rollers and helped 
          them spread around a lot of money.

                      GINGER
               (To VALET PARKERS)
          Hello.

                      VALET PARKER
          Hey, Ginger, how you doin'?

                      GINGER
          Great.
               (Handing the VALET 
               some money.)
          And I have something for you. You 
          got me covered?

The VALET PARKER places a vial of pills in her hand.

                      VALET PARKER
          Yes. Something for you, there.

                      GINGER
          And you do. Thank you very much.

                      VALET PARKER
          Take care of yourself.

FLASHBACK - INT. HOTEL SUITE BATHROOM - NIGHT

GINGER hands the pills to HIGH ROLLER #2 in his hotel 
bathroom, where he is washing his face and trying to energize 
himself.

                      GINGER
          I got some lucky pills for you, honey.

                      HIGH ROLLER #2
          Oh, yeah?

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Who didn't want Ginger? She was one 
          of the best-known, best-liked and 
          most respected hustlers in town.  
          Smart hustlers like her could keep a 
          guy awake for two or three days before 
          sending him home broke to the little 
          woman and his bank examiners.

INT. COCKTAIL LOUNGE - NIGHT

GINGER comes back from the ladies room. She kisses ACE.

                      ACE
          Any change?

                      GINGER
               (Chuckles)
          I hit a few... uh, games on the way 
          back.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          That was all bullshit. She just 
          pocketed the cash.

FLASHBACK - INT. TANGIERS CASHIER'S CAGE - NIGHT

GINGER converts her chips into a pile of $100 bills.

                      GINGER
               (To CASHIER)
          How you doin' tonight?

                      CASHIER
          Good. How are you?

                      GINGER
               (Sighing)
          Oh, beat.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Ginger had the hustler's code.

                      CASHIER
          Okay.

                      GINGER
          Take one for you.

                      CASHIER
               (While she counts out 
               the cash)
          Thank you.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          She knew how to take care of people. 
          And that's what Vegas was all about.

                      CASHIER
               (As she pushes a stack 
               of $100 bills across 
               the counter)
          Sixty-eight hundred.

                      GINGER
          Thanks

She picks up the cash.

                      CASHIER
          You're welcome.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          It's Kickback City.

                      GINGER
          You have a good night.

                      CASHIER
          Thank you. You too.

Close-up of GINGER folding a $100 bill and placing it in her 
palm. She slips the folded bill deftly into the palm of a 
floor manager.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          She took care of the dealers...

                      GINGER
          Hey, Mitch.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...pit bosses, floor managers.

                      GINGER
          Thank you.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          But mostly...

EXT. TANGIERS ENTRANCE - NIGHT

GINGER, on her way out of the casino, passes a folded $100 
bill to a smiling older SHIFT BOSS.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...she took care of the valet parkers, 
          the guys who could get you anything 
          and take care of anything.

                      GINGER
          Thanks a lot.

                      SHIFT BOSS
          Thank you, Ginger.

EXT. TANGIERS ENTRANCE - NIGHT

GINGER exits and gets into her car, slipping a VALET PARKER 
a $100 bill.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Ginger took care of the parkers 
          because they took care of the security 
          guards, who took care of the metro 
          cops, who let her operate.

                      VALET PARKER #3
          Thank you, Ginger.

                      GINGER
               (Getting into her car)
          I need that stuff tonight.

                      VALET PARKER #3
          No problem.

                      GINGER
          You're a doll.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          The valet parking job was such a 
          money-maker that they had to pay off 
          the hotel manager just to get the 
          concession.

INT. GINGER'S APARTMENT - DAY

GINGER enters the room with $25,000 in her hands. She taps 
LESTER DIAMOND's leg with it and he turns to her.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          But one thing I could never 
          understand, was that she could have 
          everything under control, except for 
          her old pimp boyfriend, Lester 
          Diamond.

                      LESTER
          Look, Gin, you know I got other people 
          in this. I got partners. But I want 
          you to understand that I am lookin' 
          out for you in this thing.  Okay?  
          You're going to get yours back...   
          and you're gonna get it back first. 
          Okay?

                      GINGER
          All right.

                      LESTER
          Okay?

                      GINGER
          Yeah.

                      LESTER
          Where are you goin'? Where are you? 
          You're in that place. Where are you?

                      GINGER
          I'm here.

                      LESTER
          No, you're not. Where are you? Where 
          are you?

                      GINGER
          I'm always here for you.

                      LESTER
          You are.

                      GINGER
          I am.

He hastily kisses GINGER and slips out the door.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          The Ginger I knew wouldn't even look 
          at this creep.

                      GINGER
          Good luck.

                      LESTER
          Yeah.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          He was a moocher, a card cheat, a 
          country-club golf hustler. A 
          scumbag... chasing dentists for a 
          few bucks.

                      GINGER
          Careful.

GINGER looks out of the window and sees LESTER get into a 
convertible and drive off.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          I mean, the guy was always broke, he 
          always had a story. And somehow, she 
          could never turn him down. The way 
          Ginger saw it, I guess, was that 
          Lester was just an unlucky guy. 
          Somebody had to take care of him.

INT. BACK HOME AIRPORT/CUSTOMS - DAY

NICKY, his wife JENNIFER, with a beehive hairdo, and their 
eight-year-old son LITTLE NICKY, are detained while their 
luggage is searched by a customs agent.

TITLE IN: 'BACK HOME'

                      ACE (V.O.)
          But nobody had to take care of Nicky.

                      NICKY
               (To customs agent)
          You find any cash in there, we'll 
          whack it up with you.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          I mean, he took care of himself only 
          too well. And that's why every badge 
          back home wanted to nail him.

                      JENNIFER
               (To customs agent)
          Excuse me, but I folded these things 
          beautifully and I would appreciate a 
          little respect. Jesus Christ!

                      NICKY
          Don't look at me, pal. I gotta live 
          with her.

We see MARINO waiting for NICKY outside the customs area. 
Two COPS push past him.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Even after a little vacation, they 
          hassled him at the airport.

                      COP #1
               (To MARINO)
          Excuse me.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          I mean, Frank Marino was there to 
          meet him, but so were the cops. This 
          time they wanted to pinch him for 
          some diamond burglary in Antwerp.

CAMERA DOLLIES IN ON JENNIFER'S BEEHIVE.

                      JENNIFER
          Oh, yes. Will you help me fold these, 
          please?

                      ACE (V.O.)
          They were ready to blame him for 
          anything, no matter where it happened.

FLASH FORWARD - INT. NICKY'S HOUSE/BACK HOME - DAY

NICKY, JENNIFER, LITTLE NICKY and MARINO walk in.

                      JENNIFER
               (To LITTLE NICKY)
          You go and put your things away.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          And they were usually right.

NICKY, JENNIFER and MARINO are gathered around the kitchen 
table. JENNIFER leans over and starts to shake her hair.

                      MARINO
          Whoa, whoa, whoa.

                      NICKY
          Hold it, hold it. Here.

NICKY places a red towel down on the table. JENNIFER leans 
over again, tugs and shakes her hair until diamonds begin to 
fall out of her beehive.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Because Nicky enjoyed being a 
          gangster, and he didn't give a damn 
          who knew it.

                      JENNIFER
          Come on. There we go. Look at that. 
          Beautiful.

Diamonds fall on the red towel in slow motion.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          I mean, that's what worried me, 'cause 
          it turns out Nicky was about to be 
          sent to Vegas.

                      JENNIFER
          All right, we're clear.

                      NICKY
          There's more!

                      JENNIFER
          I think that's it.

                      NICKY
          There's more! There's a couple stuck 
          in there. I know there's more.

                      JENNIFER
          God, I'm telling you, they're out!

                      NICKY
          Come on, damn it. Don't get so 
          defensive. It could be stuck in your 
          hair, you know.

NICKY grasps JENNIFER's hair.

                      JENNIFER
          Look, there aren't...
               (A diamond falls out 
               of her beehive.)
          There aren't but...

                      NICKY
          Oh, there aren't?
               (Showing her the 
               diamond.)
          What's that?
               (Slaps her.)
          Huh? What's that.
               (FRANK chuckles.)
          There's no more. Thanks, hon.

INT. BACK HOME AIRPORT/CUSTOMS - DAY

ON NICKY.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          I couldn't wait to get my hands on 
          Vegas. But the bosses didn't send me 
          out there to have a good time.

NIGHT

Mob bosses FORLANO, CAPELLI, GAGGI, BORELLI and PISCANO seated 
around the back room table eating and talking as in the 
opening vignette.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          They sent me out there to make sure 
          that nobody fucked with Ace and...

INT. ACE'S TANGIERS PENTHOUSE, LAS VEGAS - DAY

ACE opens the door to NICKY and JENNIFER.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...nobody interfered with the fuckin' 
          skim.

                      ACE
               (Opening door)
          Hey.

                      JENNIFER
          Hey, how you doin'?
               (Kisses ACE.)

                      NICKY
          Hey. Hey, Sammy, how are you?

JENNIFER and NICKY take in ACE's spectacular Vegas-style 
penthouse.

                      JENNIFER
               (Whispering)
          Wow.

                      NICKY
          Boy, look at this place, huh?

                      JENNIFER
          Incredible.

                      NICKY
          All right.

                      ACE
          Welcome to Vegas.

CAMERA TILTS UP TO REVEAL A SWEEPING VIEW OF THE LAS VEGAS 
SKYLINE.

                      NICKY
          Okay, Sammy.

                      ACE
          Somethin', huh?

                      NICKY
          Yeah.

                      ACE
               (Calling her over)
          Ginger.

GINGER emerges from the bedroom. NICKY and JENNIFER are both 
stunned by her beauty.

                      NICKY
               (To ACE)
          Holy shit, what've you been doin' 
          out here?

                      ACE
          Honey, come here.

She walks to them

                      ACE
          This is Jennifer and Nick. They're 
          dear friends of mine.

                      JENNIFER
               (Shaking hands)
          Good to meet you.

                      GINGER
          Hi, Jennifer.

                      NICKY
          Pleasure.
               (Grasping GINGER's 
               hand and kissing it.)
          Very nice to meet you.

                      GINGER
          Hi, how are you?

                      NICKY
          Okay, Sammy.

INT. ACE'S CAR, LAS VEGAS STRIP - NIGHT

ACE and NICKY are driving through town, the neon lights of 
Vegas reflected in the windshield.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          After we ate, we left Jennifer and 
          Ginger alone and we took a ride to 
          talk. And then... he hit me with it.

                      NICKY
          What do you think about me movin' 
          out here?
               (ACE looks away.)
          What's the matter? You got a problem 
          with that?

                      ACE
          No, of course not.

                      NICKY
               (Playfully)
          You mean, I have your permission?

                      ACE
          Sure, you have my permission. But I - 
          I just gotta tell you it's no joke 
          out here. It's no joke, you know?  
          You gotta keep a low profile. It's 
          not like back home. Right off the 
          bat, they don't like guys like us. 
          And this sheriff's a real cowboy. 
          Even the coppers aren't afraid to 
          bury people out in the desert here.

                      NICKY
          I don't care. I want to get away 
          from back home for a while. I'm tired 
          of that shit back there.
               (Referring to the 
               Vegas lights.)
          Look at this place. It's made of 
          money. You know what the best part 
          is? Nobody's gonna know what we're 
          doin'! There's nobody here to see 
          us! Everybody's back home.

                      ACE
          Nick, I gotta tell you, I got pinched 
          twice for no reason. You really gotta 
          be careful. I'm running a licensed 
          place. Everything's legit.

                      NICKY
          Don't worry about it. I'm not gonna 
          do anything. What am I gonna do?  
          I'm especially not gonna involve you 
          in anything.

ACE gives NICKY a look.

EXT./INT. LAS VEGAS SPORTSBOOK - NIGHT

NICKY and MARINO pull up in their car and get out.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Ace saw Vegas one way.

                      NICKY
          You call this guy and tell him I'm 
          comin'?

                      MARINO
          Of course.

They walk into the sportsbook, past numerous bar patrons and 
gamblers to TONY, the bookie at a betting counter.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          But I saw it another. I saw it as 
          untouched. I mean, they had bookies, 
          pimps and drug dealers I could shake 
          down. Who the fuck were they gonna 
          run to?  So, I started getting 
          everybody in line. Best of all, for 
          the first time in my life, I figured 
          out a way not to lose.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Yeah, he had a fool-proof scheme, 
          all right. It wasn't very scientific 
          but it worked. When he won, he 
          collected. When he lost, he told the 
          bookies to go fuck themselves. What 
          were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky?
               (Chuckles.)
          Nicky was the muscle.

NICKY grabs TONY by the back of his neck.

                      NICKY
          Tony.

                      TONY
          Hey.

                      NICKY
          How you doin'?

                      TONY
          How you doin'?

                      NICKY
          All right, yeah. You got that thing 
          for me?

                      TONY
          What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought 
          you was layin'.

                      NICKY
          I was layin'? No, no, I'm taking it. 
          I was takin' it.

                      TONY
          You sure?

                      NICKY
          I'm positive.

                      TONY
          Well, I'm a little confused here.

                      NICKY
          You're a little confused?

                      TONY
          Yeah.

                      NICKY
               (Pointing to a window, 
               above a counter with 
               a tiny opening to 
               talk through)
          Maybe if I stick your fuckin' face 
          through this window over here like, 
          you know, you'll - you'll get 
          unconfused. Give me the fuckin' money!

TONY takes some money out of his coat pocket.

                      TONY
               (Groaning)
          I'm sorry, Nicky. I didn't mean 
          anything by it.

                      NICKY
          Yeah, I know, that's why you had it 
          ready. You thought I was fuckin' 
          layin' it?!

He smacks the bookie on the head with the wad of money.

                      TONY
               (Gasps)
          My fuckin' head.

                      NICKY
          Your fuckin' head, huh? Don't fuck 
          around, Tony.

                      MARINO
               (Pointing to TONY)
          Smarten up.

                      NICKY
               (Walking out)
          You jag-off.

INT. CATHOLIC SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

NICKY and JENNIFER stand in the background with other parents 
listening to a NUN school teacher. LITTLE NICKY and other 
youngsters are seated at small children's desks.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          But still, it was nice and quiet for 
          a while. Ginger and I presented Nicky 
          and Jennifer all over town, like 
          regular Ozzie and Harriets.

                      LITTLE NICKY
          ...typical Virginia farmhouse.

EXT. LITTLE LEAGUE FIELD - DAY

NICKY and DETECTIVE BOB JOHNSON are coaching their sons. 
JOHNSON pats LITTLE NICKY on the back and with encouraging 
words sends him running on to the field.

                      DETECTIVE JOHNSON
               (To LITTLE NICKY)
          Beautiful. You got a beautiful swing.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Ace got my son, little Nicky, involved 
          with Little League, and it was great.

                      DETECTIVE JOHNSON
          Now, I want you to get out there and 
          get me singles and doubles, okay?  
          'Cause that's what's gonna win this 
          game.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Turned out to be one of the other 
          coaches was a fuckin'...  

                      DETECTIVE JOHNSON
          Now go out there and show your dad 
          what you can do.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...metro intelligence cop. But it 
          didn't matter. I mean, it was all 
          about the kids, you know.

                      DETECTIVE JOHNSON
          You know, he's gotta realize 
          everything can't be a home run that 
          he does.

                      NICKY
          Yeah, well, that's exactly what I 
          keep tellin' him, but that's the 
          kind of kid he is ever since he's 
          born.

                      DETECTIVE JOHNSON
          It's instinctive, you know.

                      NICKY
          He tries to do everything...

LITTLE NICKY hits the ball, NICKY and DETECTIVE JOHNSON 
applaud.

                      NICKY
          Ohh!

                      ACE (V.O.)
          And, Nicky being Nicky, he made his 
          presence known.

INT. TANGIERS CASHIER'S CAGE CREDIT WINDOW - NIGHT

NICKY saunters through the casino and up to EDDY and JERRY, 
two well-dressed hoods who are signing papers at the cashier's 
credit window near ACE and SHERBERT.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Especially at the casino, where he 
          definitely did not work, people got 
          the message.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Me? That's why the bosses sent me 
          out here. They wanted me to make 
          sure none of the other crews robbed 
          the joint. Like these two fuckin' 
          balloon-heads over here [EDDY and 
          JERRY]. They were gonna try and bang 
          us out of two hundred fuckin' grand?
               (Chuckling.)
          Yeah, right, I'm sure.

                      JERRY
               (Shakes NICKY's hand)
          Hey, Nicky. How are you?

                      NICKY
          Hey, Eddy.

                      EDDY
          Hey, Nicky, how are you? What are 
          you doin' here?

                      NICKY
          I'm over here now.

                      JERRY/EDDY
               (In unison)
          You're over here?

                      JERRY
          You're over here?

                      NICKY
          Yeah, I'm over here with him.

SWISH PAN TO ACE WITH SHERBERT OFF TO THE SIDE.

                      EDDY
          Oh.

                      JERRY
          Oh.

                      EDDY
          We're waiting on Carmine.

                      JERRY
          Yeah, we're lookin' for Carmine.

                      NICKY
          Carmine? He was here before. I saw 
          him. He had a suitcase and everything, 
          and then he left.

                      EDDY
          Carmine left?

                      NICKY
          Uh-huh.

                      JERRY
          Carmine left?

                      EDDY
          He's gone?

                      JERRY
          He's not here?

                      EDDY
          Carmine's gone.

                      NICKY
          I think, you know, maybe he went 
          across the street or somewhere else 
          or somethin'. I don't know.

                      EDDY
          Well, listen, uh... Good luck with 
          the joint, huh?
               (Shakes hands with 
               NICKY.)

                      NICKY
          Oh, thanks, Eddy.

                      JERRY
               (Shakes NICKY's hand)
          Yeah, lots of luck. Lots of luck.

                      NICKY
          Hey, great, Jerry.

They walk away.

                      NICKY
          Good luck to you too.

                      CREDIT CLERK
               (To NICKY from behind 
               the cage)
          Hey, they forgot to sign their papers.

                      NICKY
          What?

                      CREDIT CLERK
          They forgot to sign their papers.

                      NICKY
          Yeah, they don't need those anymore.

He looks over to ACE and SHERBERT. NICKY smiles.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Out of respect, guys from other crews 
          got away with a warning.

ACE taking a drag off his cigarette, nods an 'okay'.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Everybody else: watch out.

INT. TANGIERS CASINO/BLACKJACK TABLES - DAY

A blackjack WINNER, who looks like a school teacher, with 
over $100,000 in chips before him has gathered a crowd.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Like these yokels here who never 
          heard of Nicky or the bosses back 
          home, 'cause they're the morons who 
          give you the most trouble. Even after 
          we'd catch 'em, they'd try sneakin' 
          back with beards and wigs and fake 
          noses.

ACE and SHERBERT walk up to watch the WINNER who is playing 
all six hands at the blackjack table.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          You can spot these assholes by 
          watching the way they bet. Like this 
          guy. He's bettin' lavender chips at 
          five hundred each with only one little 
          problem. He's always guessed right.  
          If he wasn't so fuckin' greedy, he'd 
          have been tougher to spot. But in 
          the end, they're all greedy.

ACE walks around the WINNER's table, past the crowd, to the 
pit. Behind him are more blackjack tables, dealers and 
players. ACE bends down and ties his shoelace.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          I saw that the dealer was weak, but 
          he wasn't in on it.

The DEALER's hands lift the corner of his hole card a half 
an inch to determine the casino's hand against the WINNER. 
The slightly exposed hole card is a six of clubs.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          He just wasn't protecting his hand. 
          He was lifting his hole card way to 
          high.

ON ACE'S FACE THEN TO HIS POV OF THE CARD, PAST A PIT BOSS, 
PANNING TO THE SIGNALER AT THE BLACKJACK TABLE TO THE RIGHT. 
THE SIGNALER IS SLUMPED DOWN IN HIS SEAT, TOSSING DOWN SOME 
CARDS AND SNEAKING LOOKS AT THE DEALER'S HAND AT THE WINNER'S 
TABLE.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Now, here's this guy...

OVERHEAD PAN FROM THE SIGNALER SLUMPED IN HIS SEAT.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...reading the dealer's hole card...

PAN CONTINUES PAST ACE TO REVEAL THE WINNER'S TABLE.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...and signaling his buddy [the 
          WINNER] at this table.

OVERHEAD DOLLY IN ON SIGNALER WHO APPEARS TO BE NERVOUSLY 
TAPPING HIS THIGH.

We see through his trousers, that he is tapping a copper 
transmitter with a battery pack attached.

Back at the WINNER's table we see inside his pant leg where 
a device strapped to his leg is receiving the impulse signal - 
buzz - buzz - buzz - from the SIGNALER.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          And that's just what these hustlers 
          look for. They cruise from casino to 
          casino, lookin' for weak dealers the 
          way lions look for weak antelope.

ACE starts to get up.

                      ACE (O.S.)
               (From following scene)
          Operator?

INT. TANGIERS BLACKJACK TABLES/TELEPHONE - DAY

ACE is on the house phone right near the SIGNALER's table.

                      ACE
          This is Mr R. Get me Armstrong and 
          Friday over at pit two right away.

He hangs up, and fixes his tie in the mirrored panel above 
the phone.

OVERHEAD VIEW OF THE SIGNALER'S TABLE. VARIOUS SECURITY GUARDS 
SLOWLY BEGIN TO GATHER AROUND IT.

ACE, waiting, lights a cigarette. ARMSTRONG joins ACE. They 
look towards the SIGNALER's table.

                      ACE
               (To ARMSTRONG)
          BJ nineteen, second base, the beard 
          [Blackjack table number 19, second 
          position, man with the beard]

                      ACE
               (Picks up the phone 
               again.)
          Operator... I need Mr Happy, loud.

On ACE's signal, WAITRESSES, one carrying a cake with a 
sparkling candle, start singing 'Happy Birthday', attracting 
the crowd's attention.

                      WAITRESSES
               (In unison)
          Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday 
          to you. Happy Birthday, dear Jeff. 
          Happy Birthday to you.

Gamblers cheer and applaud.

ACE nods and ARMSTRONG lets a long metal object drop out 
from under his jacket sleeve and moves in close behind the 
SIGNALER, as though looking at the game.

He presses the object - a cattle prod - under the SIGNALER's 
arm near his heart. The SIGNALER instantly goes into 
convulsions, falling to the floor gasping and groaning. 
Several SECURITY GUARDS grab the SIGNALER as he falls.  
ARMSTRONG walks away.

                      SECURITY GUARD #1
          Man down!

The WINNER sees what happened to his partner.

                      SECURITY GUARD #1
          Notify medical! We got a cardiac 
          arrest here!

                      SECURITY GUARD #2
          He's fine, folks. Just give us some 
          room, please!

ACE watches the scene. The guards lift the stunned SIGNALER 
to his feet and help him away from the table. Play is 
immediately resumed.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Watch it now.

The WINNER hurriedly places his chips into racks.

                      SECURITY GUARD #1 (O.S.)
          Stand back!

                      ACE (V.O.)
          They never know what hit them. And 
          if and when...

SECURITY GUARDS drag the SIGNALER out.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...they do find out they just got 
          zapped by a cattle prod...

SHERBERT follows the WINNER as he rushes away.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...they wish they really did have a 
          heart attack.

ACE exits behind the GUARDS and the SIGNALER.

INT. BASEMENT MAINTENANCE ROOM - NIGHT

A grim, windowless utility room with tools on racks along 
the walls, some plain wooden chairs, and a workbench table.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Turns out this guy and his fuckin' 
          pals, they were knockin' this place 
          dead for years.

                      SECURITY GUARD #1
          He's got a wire on him.

The SIGNALER is roughly shoved into the room. A SECURITY 
GUARD tears his trousers down revealing the signaling device 
strapped to his leg.

                      SIGNALER
          Hey, hey, what are you doin', man?

                      SECURITY GUARD #2
               (Exposing the device)
          There it is! On the table!

                      SECURITY GUARD #1
          Cheater's justice!

The SIGNALER is slammed down face first on the bench and the 
two GUARDS spread his arms out on the table.

                      SIGNALER
               (In pain)
          Oh, God! Oh!

Another GUARD starts up a power saw and approaches the 
SIGNALER who is now pinned to the table. He starts to scream.

                      SIGNALER
          Hey, no! No! No!

ACE walks toward the table, gesturing for the GUARD to turn 
off the saw.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          We had to make an example of these 
          pricks that the party was over.

                      ACE
               (To relieved SIGNALER)
          I'm just curious. I saw you shuffling 
          your checks with your right hand. 
          Can you do that with both hands?

                      SIGNALER
          No.

                      ACE
          Can't do it with both hands?

                      SIGNALER
          No, Sir.

                      ACE
          Can you do it with your left hand?

                      SIGNALER
          Well, I... I never tried.

                      ACE
          So, you're a righty?

                      SIGNALER
          Ye-yeah.

ACE nods to one of the GUARDS. Instantly a large rubber mallet 
smashes onto the man's right hand four times to the sound of 
screams. ACE watches.

                      ACE
          Now, you're gonna have to learn with 
          your left hand.

                      SIGNALER
          God!
               (He moans and sits 
               back.)

                      WINNER (O.S.)
               (From following scene)
          It's a hundred...

INT. CASINO CASHIER'S CAGE AREA - NIGHT

The WINNER has been standing outside the cashier's cage 
waiting for his $110,000 in chips to be cashed. SHERBERT 
walks up behind him.

                      WINNER
          ...a hundred ten.

                      CASHIER
          Yes, it is.

                      WINNER
          I think.

                      CASHIER
          Yes.

                      WINNER
          Okay.

                      SHERBERT
          Hiya. That's a lot of money to be 
          counting out in public.

                      WINNER
          Yeah.

                      SHERBERT
               (To CASHIER)
          Why don't I take him over to the 
          office and verify it, huh?

                      CASHIER
          Yes.

                      SHERBERT
          A little privacy. And, by the way, 
          send over a... nice bottle of 
          champagne on ice, huh?

                      CASHIER
          Sure will.

                      SHERBERT
          Real special.  Somethin'...
               (To WINNER.)
          By the way...  I'm Billy Sherbert, 
          your casino manager.

He shakes hands with the WINNER.

                      WINNER
          Hi.

                      SHERBERT
          Having a good time?

SHERBERT leads him away from the cage.

                      WINNER
          Yes, uh...

                      SHERBERT
          You'll want to count the money in 
          privacy. You know, you don't need...

                      WINNER
          Uh, I have a plane to catch to 
          Cleveland...  Can I get my winnings?

INT. BASEMENT MAINTENANCE ROOM - NIGHT

The WINNER is pushed through the door by two GUARDS followed 
by SHERBERT and sees his pal moaning in pain and holding his 
broken hand.

                      SIGNALER
          Look what they did to my hand, man!

                      ACE
               (Walks over to the 
               WINNER)
          All right, I'm gonna give you a 
          choice. You can either have the money 
          and the hammer or you can walk out 
          of here. You can't have both. What 
          do you want?

SHERBERT stands next to the WINNER

                      WINNER
          I just wanna get out of here.

                      ACE
          And don't forget to tell your friends 
          what happens if they fuck around in 
          here. You understand?

                      WINNER
          I'm sorry. I made a bad mistake.

                      ACE
          You're fuckin' right, you made a bad 
          mistake. 'Cause if you come back 
          here - we catch either one of you - 
          we're gonna break your fuckin' heads 
          and you won't walk out of here. You 
          see that fuckin' saw?  We're gonna 
          use it. You don't fuck around in 
          this place. You got it?

                      WINNER
          Yeah.

                      ACE
          Get out of here.

                      WINNER
          Thank you.

The GUARDS usher the WINNER out of the room.

                      ACE
               (To the GUARDS, 
               referring to the 
               SIGNALER)
          Throw him out in the alley.  And 
          just tell the cops he got hit by a 
          car.

INT. ACE'S TANGIERS PENTHOUSE

ACE and GINGER are alone in the living room. The apartment 
looks out on the glittering neon signs of the Strip.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Within no time, everything was set 
          in place. We got rid of the freelance 
          scamsters. The per was way up.  The 
          gods were happy, or as happy as the 
          gods can ever be.  And I, I decided 
          to complicate my life. For a guy who 
          likes sure things, I was about to 
          bet the rest of my life on a real 
          longshot.

                      ACE
          We're not getting any younger. Don't 
          you think it's time? Aren't you 
          gettin' tired of all this shit? 
          Bangin' around, hustlin' around?

                      GINGER
          What, are you trying to handicap me?

                      ACE
          I'm gonna do you one better. I'm 
          trying to marry you. You want to 
          marry me?
               (GINGER looks doubtful.)
          I'm serious. I mean, I - I want to 
          settle down. I want a family.

                      GINGER
               (Sighs, laughing)
          You got the wrong girl, Sam.

                      ACE
          I know I'd be a good father. I know 
          you'd be a good mother.

                      GINGER
          You don't know me. What, you've known 
          me, two, three months. What do you 
          know?

                      ACE
          I'm forty-three years old. I don't 
          want to wait. I know you well enough 
          to know that I really love you very 
          much.  And I can't think of anybody 
          better to be with. And I don't feel 
          like waiting anymore.

                      GINGER
          You know a lot of happily married 
          people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.

                      ACE
          Yeah, I know all that.

                      GINGER
          I care about you, a - But I just 
          don't have those kind of feelings 
          for you. I'm sorry. I'm not in love 
          with you.

                      ACE
               (Brushing cigarette 
               ash off his dressing 
               gown)
          I - I - I...

                      GINGER
          Understand?
               (Pause)
          I'm sorry.

                      ACE
          No, I - I... mean...  that can grow 
          as I - as long as there's a mutual 
          respect... that kind of thing can 
          grow. I'm realistic. I can accept 
          that. But, you know, what is...  
          What is love anyway?  It's a... it's 
          a mutual respect. It's - it's a 
          devotion. It's a... it's a caring 
          from one person to another. And if 
          we could set up some kind of 
          foundation...  based on that mutual 
          respect...  I feel that eventually 
          you would care enough about me... 
          that I could live with that.

                      GINGER
          If it doesn't work out. You know, if 
          it doesn't play out, then what happens 
          to me?

                      ACE
          You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm 
          gonna do even better. And so, whatever 
          happens, if it doesn't work out 
          between us, I'm gonna make sure you're 
          okay for the rest of your life. And 
          if there are kids, especially, you 
          know, I'll take care of you better 
          than you'd ever imagine.

                      GINGER
               (Interrupts)
          What're you... what're you pitching 
          me, here?

                      ACE
          Just what I said. You'll be set up 
          for the rest of your life. That I 
          can promise you.
               (Pause)
          Want to take a chance?

She looks at him. ACE is holding her hand tightly.

INT. RIVIERA BALLROOM MARRIAGE - NIGHT

ACE and GINGER are seated at a banquet table with various 
guests, drinking champagne. AMY, their six-month-old child 
is in a cradle. NICKY and JENNIFER are hovering around the 
baby with LITTLE NICKY and are blissfully happy. It is an 
elegant affair.  City Officials, politicians and gaming 
officials are there, plus, SHERBERT and Ace's boss, PHILIP 
GREEN. A photographer takes pictures of the guests.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          When I married Ginger I knew all the 
          stories, but I didn't give a fuck. 
          'I'm Sam Rothstein,' I said. 'I can 
          change her.'

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          It was typical Ace. He invited the 
          biggest people in town and he knew 
          they'd show. Because he knew they 
          all wanted somethin' from him.  With 
          Ace, nobody ever got a free ride. 
          Even Ginger. With her -

We see AMY in the cradle.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          - he still covered his bets. They 
          had to have the baby first, before 
          they got married. Even made Jennie 
          and me watch Amy for a few days when 
          they went on their honeymoon. But I 
          didn't mind, we loved the kid.

IN SLOW MOTION CAMERA MOVES IN ON ACE AND GINGER, STANDING 
NEXT TO A LARGE WEDDING CAKE. THEY ARE KISSING. NICKY, 
SHERBERT AND OTHER GUESTS LOOK ON.

CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSER AS THEY KISS, THEN PAST THEM TO THE 
BRIDE AND GROOM FIGURINES ON THE CAKE.

LESTER's and GINGER's telephone conversation is heard in 
voice-over this scene.

                      LESTER
               (Over telephone)
          Can you feel my eyes on you? Can you 
          feel me look into your heart?  Can 
          you feel me in the pit of your 
          stomach? Can you feel me in you? In 
          your heart?

We see a wide view of the elaborate wedding, guests mill 
about the banquet hall.

                      LESTER
          Don't make me come there. Answer me.

                      GINGER
               (Over telephone, 
               sobbing)
          I love you.

INT. LESTER DIAMOND'S LOS ANGELES APARTMENT - NIGHT

LESTER DIAMOND is talking on the phone softly, cutting up 
cocaine on a piece of glass.

                      LESTER
               (Into telephone)
          Bub-ut, baby, do you know that I 
          love you too?

                      GINGER
               (Over telephone)
          No, Lester.

                      LESTER
               (Into telephone)
          Do you know that?

                      GINGER
               (Over telephone)
          Yeah. This is the best thing I can 
          do for my life right now.

                      LESTER
               (Into telephone)
          That's right.

INT. RIVIERA BALLROOM CORRIDOR - NIGHT

GINGER is sitting alone on the phone. She's crying.

                      LESTER
               (Over telephone)
          So, it's gonna be okay, isn't it?

                      GINGER
               (Sobbing, into 
               telephone)
          Promise?

                      LESTER
               (Over telephone)
          God... I wish you...

INT. LESTER DIAMOND'S LOS ANGELES APARTMENT - NIGHT

There is a beautiful scantily dressed blonde girl in the 
apartment with him. She bends down to the table in front of 
him, snorts some cocaine, then walks away.

                      LESTER
               (Into telephone)
          ...all the luck in the world.

                      GINGER
               (Over telephone)
          You do?

                      LESTER
               (Into telephone)
          Yeah, I do. I mean, it's - it's the - 
          it's the best thing you can do right 
          now. I mean this. And you'll have 
          real security.  Sweetheart... you're 
          gonna be situated just right in Vegas.

INT. RIVIERA BALLROOM CORRIDOR - NIGHT

ACE enters from the ballroom and sees GINGER on the phone. 
He walks towards her, listening to her conversation.

                      LESTER
               (Over telephone)
          Come on, this is great for us. You 
          know I'm gonna be here for you. I 
          ain't going no place. Huh?  I'm 
          lookin' at you right now. I'm seein' 
          you for the very first time, right 
          this minute. I'm seein' you, and I 
          can feel my heart click. I see you 
          fourteen years old. I see you the 
          first second I ever saw you. I see 
          you, long-legged little colt -

GINGER notices ACE behind her.

                      LESTER
          - with stupid braces on your teeth.

                      GINGER
               (Into telephone, 
               sniffing, trying to 
               cut him off)
          Okay, then.

                      LESTER
               (Over telephone)
          Every time I ever see you, that's 
          what I see.

                      GINGER
               (Into telephone)
          Uh, talk to you later.  Bye.
               (She hangs up the 
               phone quickly.)

                      ACE
          You all right?

                      GINGER
               (Drinking some 
               champagne, wiping 
               away tears)
          Yeah.

                      ACE
          Why're you crying?

                      GINGER
               (Laughs)
          I'm not crying.
               (Sniffs.)

ACE walks up behind GINGER.

                      ACE
          Maybe you shouldn't drink so much.

                      GINGER
          I'm okay. I just -
               (Sniffs)
          You just have to understand. I've 
          been with Lester since I was a kid. 
          I just wanted to say goodbye. I - I 
          just...  I don't... I think I have a 
          right to do that. Okay?

                      ACE
          It's all right. That part of your 
          life is over with. Right?

                      GINGER
          Yeah.

                      ACE
          You're with me now.

                      GINGER
          Yeah.

                      ACE
          Right?

                      GINGER
          Uh-huh.

                      ACE
          You sure?

                      GINGER
          Yeah. Yeah.

They are reflected in a mirror behind the telephone.

                      ACE
          Want to go? Let's go back in.

                      GINGER
               (Sniffs)
          Okay.

ACE's hands pick up a white rose and GINGER's gloves from 
the desk.

EXT. ACE'S HOUSE - DAY

ACE and GINGER drive up to an expensive house which backs on 
to a country-club golf course.

INT. ACE'S HOUSE - DAY

ACE takes GINGER inside. It is fancy and lush.

                      GINGER
          Oh...

Through sliding glass doors, we see a patio and a pool area.

                      GINGER
               (Sighing)
          It's great.

The living-room has exposed white brick along the walls, 
bronze ostrich figurines, a white baby grand piano, and a 
zebra print rug surrounded by a few couches.

                      GINGER
          Oh, it's great.

INT. ACE'S BEDROOM CLOSET - DAY

ACE takes GINGER past the bedroom to their huge room-sized 
closet. There are racks and racks of clothes.

                      GINGER
               (Running into the 
               closet)
          Oh! It's all my stuff. Oh, my God.

ACE presents her with a long chinchilla coat.

                      GINGER
          You brought all my stuff. I can -

She sees the coat.

                      ACE
          Try it on. It's yours.

He puts it on her.

                      GINGER
               (Whispering)
          You're kidding? My God. What is it?

                      ACE
          It's chinchilla.

                      GINGER
               (Looking at herself 
               in the mirror)
          Oh, it's so soft.

                      ACE
          It's nice isn't it?

                      GINGER
          Oh...

ACE Kisses her.

                      GINGER
          No one's ever been so nice to me.

They kiss and embrace.

INT. ACE'S HOUSE/BEDROOM - DAY

ACE's hand opens a leather case full of gold Bvlgari jewelry.

                      GINGER
               (Gasps)
          Oh, my God.

INT. ACE'S HOUSE/BEDROOM - DAY

ACE and GINGER lie on the bed, surrounded by jewelry. GINGER 
is swathed in the chinchilla coat. Ace watches as a transfixed 
GINGER tries on gold necklaces, rings, bracelets and earrings.

                      GINGER
          So, do you think it's too much if I 
          wear these in the same day?

                      ACE
          You do whatever you want. Do I keep 
          my promises, or do I keep my promises?

ACE kisses GINGER.

                      GINGER
          You're so wonderful. The jewelry's 
          not so bad, either.

                      ACE
          The only thing is... you shouldn't 
          keep this in the house. We gotta put 
          it in a bank.

                      GINGER
               (Putting on a gold 
               bracelet)
          Come on. Can I keep this one in the 
          house?

                      ACE
          Now look,
               (gently holding her 
               face, gathering her 
               total attention)
          pay attention to me. What I'm gonna
           tell you is very important.

                      GINGER
          Okay.

                      ACE
          All this stuff doesn't mean anything. 
          Money, this, doesn't mean anything 
          without trust. I have to be able to 
          trust you with my life.

EXT. BURBANK PRIVATE AIRPORT - DAY

TITLE IN: 'LOS ANGELES'

ACE and GINGER get off the Tangiers jet carrying two 
suitcases. ACE gives a chauffeur the luggage and follows 
GINGER into a brown Rolls Royce.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          With over a million in cash and jewels 
          tucked in a bank in Vegas only for 
          Ginger, she was secure and happy.

INT. BEVERLEY HILLS BANK - DAY

ACE and GINGER walk into the bank lobby carrying the 
suitcases.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          She loved that shit. But a guy in my 
          line of work has to have a lot of 
          pay-off cash around.

INT. BEVERLEY HILLS BANK/VAULT - DAY

There are several safe deposit boxes filled with cash. ACE 
and GINGER are closing a large box so crammed with cash that 
ACE has to lean on it for the clasp to lock.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Crooked cops and kidnappers, they 
          don't take checks.

                      GINGER
          Need a little help with that, Mr 
          Collins?

                      ACE (V.O.)
          So, I put two million in cash in a 
          Los Angeles bank under the name of 
          Mr and Mrs Tom Collins. This was 
          strictly my shakedown and kidnapping 
          money.

ACE and GINGER struggle to push the crammed box into a slot 
in the wall.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          And, since I'd either be in jail or 
          locked in a closet when I needed the 
          money the most...

The BANK PRESIDENT joins them, and he and ACE simultaneously 
double-lock the outer safe box door with two separate keys, 
after which, ACE gives GINGER his key.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...I gave Ginger the only key to the 
          cash that could get me back alive.

INT. BANK PRESIDENT'S OFFICE - DAY

GINGER is on the other side of a glass wall, signing papers.

                      BANKER
          Now this is just a signature card.

                      ACE
          So, once she signs those papers, 
          she'll be the only person to have 
          total access to the box?  No one 
          else, including myself?

                      BANKER
          That's right.

We see GINGER looking at ACE.

                      BANKER
          That's the way you wanted it, right?

ACE nods

                      BANKER
               (Quietly.)
          Sam, let me ask you a question. You 
          must really trust your wife.

                      ACE
               (Quietly)
          Yeah, sure I do. Why?

                      BANKER
          No, tha-that's good. It's just 
          unusual. To tell you the truth, so 
          many of my clients don't.

                      ACE
          Well...

ACE looks over to GINGER, smiles and winks. She looks back 
at him.

INT. TANGIERS LOUNGE - NIGHT

JERRY VALE sings to a seated audience. ACE sits alone at a 
table.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          With Ginger and the money in place, 
          I felt covered, and to play it safe 
          I switched job titles again and made 
          myself, um, Food and Beverage 
          Director. This way nobody would bother 
          me about a license. I mean, Vegas 
          was like a dream for me. Trouble 
          was...

NICKY is seated at another table with MARINO, peeling off 
money and giving it to MIKE, a crooked dealer.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...Nicky was dreamin' his own kind 
          of Vegas.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          To begin, I put money out on the 
          streets, chargin' three points a 
          week. You know - juice to the fuckin' 
          dealers.

                      MARINO
               (To MIKE)
          Don't make us come lookin' for you.

                      MIKE
          Oh, you won't have to look for me. I 
          appreciate it. Thanks, Nicky.

                      NICKY
          All right, Mike.

MIKE gets up from the table.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          They were degenerate gamblers, coke 
          freaks. In no time, I had half the 
          dealers in the Tangiers in my pocket.  
          Then...

INT. TANGIERS POKER TABLE - NIGHT

NICKY is at a table with his gang of card sharks: SLIM, ROCKY, 
MOOSH and COWBOY, all secretly signaling each other, 
sandbagging a mark. MIKE, the crooked dealer from the previous 
scene, deals NICKY a winning hand.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...the next thing I did, I started 
          bustin' out high-stakes poker players.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          It was so obvious. I mean, all of 
          Nicky's half-assed mechanics, they 
          were real signal happy.

                      MOOSH
               (Scratching his arm)
          I'm gonna open for five hundred.

                      ROCKY
          Moosh, you open?
               (Taps his fingers on 
               some chips before 
               picking them up.)

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Signaling back and forth.

                      CARD SHARK
          I bet thirty-five hundred.

NICKY wiggles a toothpick back and forth in his mouth.

                      DOCTOR DAN
          I've been losing for three days 
          straight, non-stop.

Another shark pulls on his ear.

                      ROCKY
          Oh, why're you crying, with three 
          loaves of bread under your arm?

ACE watches their signals with concern.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Nicky thought nobody was watching 
          him. But he was wrong.

We see two undercover gaming agents, looking like tourists, 
sneaking looks at NICKY's table.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          And I didn't want any of those agents 
          near my place.

                      NICKY
          Four aces, Doc.

His hands spread five cards on the table, showing four aces.

                      NICKY
          What do you got?

                      DOCTOR DAN
               (Getting up in disgust)
          Jesus Christ. I can't believe it.

COWBOY, the card shark with the cowboy hat, rakes in a large 
pot toward his side of the table.

                      DOCTOR DAN
          If I didn't have bad luck, I wouldn't 
          have any luck. I'm out of here, you 
          understand?

                      ACE (V.O.)
          I mean, I wished to God Nicky and 
          his whole crew would just get lost.

He walks towards NICKY's table.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          What am I gonna do? Go back home and 
          start a war?

ACE leans down to talk to NICKY.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          I mean, Nicky's a made guy and I'm 
          not. I can't do that.

                      ACE
               (Whispering in NICKY's 
               ear)
          Be careful. Gaming agents are all 
          over the place.

                      NICKY
          So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to 
          get lucky in this place?

                      ACE
          You been lucky all week. They're 
          lookin' to nail ya.

ACE walks away. NICKY looks over at the gaming agents.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Ace was so fuckin' worried about his 
          casino, he forgot what we were doin' 
          out here in the first place.

INT. TANGIERS CASINO - NIGHT

Security people are pulling apart a husband and wife who are 
fighting. Camera picks up ACE as he passes by them.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          A million times I wanted to yell in 
          his fuckin' ear: 'This is Las Vegas!  
          We're supposed to be out here robbin', 
          you dumb fuckin' Heeb.'

INT. TANGIERS CASINO POKER TABLE - NIGHT

Closeup of the COWBOY's white-socked feet with no shoes on a 
poker table.

                      ACE
               (To SHERBERT, referring 
               to COWBOY)
          I don't give a shit who he's connected 
          to. Tell him to take his fuckin' 
          feet off the table. What's he think 
          this is, a goddamn sawdust joint?

SHERBERT approaches COWBOY.

                      SHERBERT
          Sir, would you mind taking your feet 
          off the table and putting your shoes 
          on, please?

                      COWBOY
               (Sighs)
          Yeah, I would mind. I'm havin' a bad 
          night.

COWBOY remains the same with his feet on the table.

                      SHERBERT
               (Returning to ACE)
          Fuckin' asshole won't budge.

                      ACE
          Call security.

ACE approaches COWBOY.

                      ACE
          How are you?

                      COWBOY
          Good. How are you?

                      ACE
          Good. You want to do me a favor? You 
          want to take your feet off the table 
          and put your shoes back on?

                      COWBOY
          Fuck you.

ACE walks to nearby SECURITY GUARDS.

                      ACE
               (To GUARDS)
          I want you to exit this guy off the 
          premises, and I want you to exit him 
          off his feet and use his head to 
          open the fuckin' door.

Three SECURITY GUARDS approach COWBOY.

                      SECURITY GUARD #1
          Sir, you're gonna have to leave. You 
          mind accompanying us outside?

                      COWBOY
          Bullshit, I ain't goin' anywhere 
          with you!

                      SECURITY GUARD #1
          Bullshit, you're out of here, cowboy!

SECURITY GUARD #1 knocks his feet off the table, as GUARDS 
#2 and #3 lift him off his seat.

                      COWBOY
          Fuck you! Fuck you!

                      SECURITY GUARD #1
          Yeah?

                      COWBOY
          You know who you're fuckin' with?! 
          Huh? Do you?!

                      SECURITY GUARD #1
          Now move along.

                      COWBOY
               (Screaming at ACE who 
               follows him)
          You fuckin' faggot! Do you know who 
          you're fuckin' with?

The GUARDS carry him out and forcefully shove him towards a 
side exit.

                      COWBOY
          Leave me alone!

                      SECURITY GUARD #1
          Here we go!

                      COWBOY
               (Grunting)
          You've gotta be kidding me!
               (Groans.)

The GUARDS lift him off his feet and, holding him like a 
battering ram, smash his head into the door.

                      ACE (V.O.)
               (As COWBOY is thrown 
               out the door)
          Sure enough, an hour later, I get 
          the call.

INT. VEGAS BAR - NIGHT

NICKY is on a public wall-phone talking to ACE. MARINO is 
staring at the disheveled COWBOY.

                      NICKY
               (Into telephone)
          Ace, what happened over there? I 
          mean, did you know that guy you threw 
          out was with me?

INT. TANGIERS CASINO - NIGHT

ACE is on a Tangiers house phone. SHERBERT looks on.

                      ACE
               (Into telephone)
          No, I didn't know that. But you know 
          what he did?

                      NICKY
               (Over telephone)
          No.

INT. VEGAS BAR - NIGHT

NICKY gives COWBOY a look.

                      ACE
               (Over telephone)
          He insulted Billy. And then I walked 
          over to him politely...

INT. TANGIERS CASINO - NIGHT

                      ACE
               (Into telephone)
          ...and he tells me to go fuck myself.

                      NICKY
               (Over telephone)
          What?

                      ACE
               (Into telephone)
          Then he called me a faggot.

INT. VEGAS BAR - NIGHT

                      ACE
               (Over telephone)
          So what do you think I do? I threw 
          that cocksucker out.

                      NICKY
               (Into telephone)
          What? Ho-
               (He puts down the 
               phone; to COWBOY:)
          Hey, come here.

COWBOY walks up to him.

                      NICKY
          You called my friend a faggot? You 
          tell him to go fuck himself?

                      COWBOY
          Nicky, I did -

                      NICKY
          Is that what you did?

                      COWBOY
          I did - I didn't -

                      NICKY
          Tell him to go fuck himself? You 
          fuckin' hick!  Fuckin'...

NICKY hits him on the head with the phone. COWBOY falls back, 
groaning.

INT. TANGIERS CASINO - NIGHT

ACE listens to the noise of NICKY roughing up COWBOY.

                      NICKY
               (Over telephone)
          ...you big fuckin' hick, you. Come 
          here. Come here. Get him up. Come

ACE LOOKS AT SHERBERT.

               (Over telephone)
          Get up.

          Get up.

                      NICKY

EXT. TANGIERS CASINO - DAY

A tiger leaps towards the camera, which pans over to two 
showgirls and then to ACE's hand holding the key to a Rolls 
Royce. He gives it to JONATHAN and DAVID as reporters rush 
in to photograph the moment.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          You know, Ace could be a very touchy 
          guy, especially when he got bigger 
          and bigger in town. Like when he 
          hired that Jonathon and David and 
          their tigers away from the Palace by 
          buildin' them a new stage and then 
          givin' them a silver Rolls Royce.

INT. BACKSTAGE TANGIERS THEATER - DAY

ACE and SHERBERT watch as a STAGE MANAGER weighs in the 'Femme 
Fatale' Showgirls.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          But I'll tell you, he knew how to 
          bring in the crowds. He knew all the 
          fuckin' angles. He brought over the 
          whole 'Femme Fatale' show from Paris. 
          But he forgot how lazy them European 
          dancin' broads can get. I mean, he 
          had to weigh 'em in once a week to 
          make sure they didn't blow up like 
          fuckin' balloons.

                      ACE
               (To SHOWGIRL)
          You're still eight pounds over.
               (To MANAGER.)
          What's the reason for this?

                      STAGE MANAGER
          Mr Rothstein, sir, let me put her on 
          suspension.

          Well, sir, I was just...

                      ACE
          Why is she eight pounds over?

          ...position...

                      ACE
          'Mr Rothstein' is good enough.

                      STAGE MANAGER
          Mr Rothstein... well, sometimes, 
          when you reach that pressure point, 
          when you put that pressure point on 
          them, you know, it shows...

                      ACE
          She could at least lose half a pound 
          or a quarter.  Listen...

                      STAGE MANAGER
          ...and she doesn't always -

                      ACE
          ...all you do is give me answers. 
          Just - just give me the right answer.

                      STAGE MANAGER
          But, sir. Well, I don't know why. I 
          guess, maybe, because she's frightened 
          that if she doesn't lose the weight 
          she may even get fired.

                      ACE
          That's right. She will get fired. In 
          fact, I want you to send her back to 
          Paris.

                      STAGE MANAGER
          It's always been our policy -

                      ACE
          No. Just stop everything.

SHERBERT and ACE walk away across a huge stage.

                      SHERBERT
               (To ACE)
          This woman's an institution.

                      ACE
          I don't care what she is. She's an 
          institution, that's the problem. 
          She's lazy.

INT. TANGIERS CASINO SPORTSBOOK - NIGHT

ACE standing in a large space surrounded by giant TV screens 
showing sports events. Around him, long rows of bettors are 
seated at betting stations, lined up at windows, or wandering 
around at the bar. It's like a NASA control room on launch 
day.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Hey, I gotta give the guy credit. He 
          does the most obvious thing. This is 
          the only town in the country where a 
          bookie joint is legit, so, why not 
          take advantage, right?  So... he 
          took bookie joints off the street 
          and then opened them up inside the 
          casino. Well, within a few years, by 
          doin' all of this, he had every casino 
          on the Strip trying to copy off him.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Between...

EXT. BACK ALLEY - NIGHT

NICKY, with MARINO, punching and kicking a man next to the 
open door of his luxury car.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...my innovations...

The man falls to the ground.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...and Nicky's dedication to his 
          job...

NICKY starts kicking him.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...I soon had the best operation on 
          the Strip.

NICKY lifts an empty trash can and shatters the car's 
windshield.

INT. TANGIERS CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT

ACE and NICKY are standing on the casino floor near the slot-
machines. Gamblers are milling about behind them.

                      ACE
          You better watch yourself. There's a 
          lot of heat on you already.

                      NICKY
          Why, somebody's complaining?

                      ACE
          I'm - I'm hearin' things from 
          security. They're all ex-cops. The 
          Sheriff's lookin' to bust your balls. 
          They want to put you in the Black 
          Book.

                      NICKY
          That Black Book is a bunch of 
          bullshit. They got two names in there 
          for the whole country and one of 
          them is still Al Capone.

                      ACE
          Bullshit or no bullshit, they put 
          you in that book, you're gonna be in 
          a lot of trouble. You will not be 
          able to walk into the casino. I'm 
          tellin' you.

                      NICKY
          What am I doin' out here? I'm tryin' 
          to make a livin', that's all.

                      ACE
          I'm just tellin' you. Don't say I 
          didn't warn you.

                      NICKY
          All right.

INT. VEGAS VALLEY COUNTRY CLUB, 1974 - NIGHT

Tight on the filaments of a flash bulb as they ignite.

TV news crews and still photographers are taking pictures of 
ACE and GINGER surrounded by clusters of celebrities and the 
Vegas power elite, including SHERBERT and GREEN, at a black 
tie event.

                      PHOTOGRAPHER #1
          Mrs Rothstein, look straight ahead. 
          Very nice. Thank you.

                      PHOTOGRAPHER #2
          Thank you.

                      PHOTOGRAPHER #1
          Yes, nice smile.

                      PHOTOGRAPHER #3
          Just look right at the camera. Hold 
          that pose.

We hear GREEN making a speech over flashing cameras and freeze 
frames of himself, SHERBERT, ACE and GINGER.

                      GREEN (O.S.)
          Considering all of his hard work and 
          dedication and the new lifeblood he 
          has instilled in Las Vegas...

We now see GREEN at a mike speaking in front of the seated 
club members.

                      GREEN
          Sam has established himself as an 
          indispensable member of the gaming 
          community. As the head of the Tangiers 
          Gaming Corporation, it's my pleasure 
          to welcome Sam Rothstein to the Vegas 
          Valley Country Club.

Members cheer and applaud as GREEN hands ACE a framed 
citation. It reads: 'This Certificate of Appreciation. Sam 
Rothstein. Charitable Foundations of Greater Las Vegas'. 
They shake hands for the photographers.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Back home, they would have put me in 
          jail for what I'm doing. But out 
          here, they're givin' me awards.

                      ACE
               (Into the microphone)
          It's with great pleasure that I accept 
          this certificate of appreciation 
          from the...

CAMERA TILTS UP TO A MOUNTED PLAQUE ON THE WALL, READING: 
'CHARITABLE FOUNDATIONS OF GREATER LAS VEGAS'.

INT. VEGAS VALLEY COUNTRY-CLUB BANQUET ROOM - NIGHT

A dazzling GINGER moves charmingly about the room chatting 
up top executives, lawyers, judges, bankers and their wives. 
ACE, standing with GREEN and an elderly man, watches her 
work the room.

                      COUNTRY-CLUB WOMAN #1
          Congratulations, sweetheart.

                      GINGER
          Thank you.

                      COUNTRY-CLUB WOMAN #2
          Sam raised more than we've ever raised 
          before.

                      GINGER
          He worked so hard.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          But my greatest pleasure was watchin' 
          my wife, Ginger, work the room.

                      COUNTRY-CLUB MAN #1
          Thank you for everything.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          They all loved her. How could you 
          not live her?

                      GINGER
               (To COUNTRY-CLUB WOMAN 
               #3)
          Hi. Nice to see you.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          She could be the most charming woman 
          you ever saw. People loved to be 
          around her.

                      COUNTRY-CLUB WOMAN #3
          Listen, you've got to bring Amy to 
          Sasha's birthday party because he'd 
          love to have her there.

                      GINGER
          Thanks.

                      COUNTRY-CLUB WOMAN #3
          We'll see you three o'clock Saturday.

                      GINGER
          Thanks. Yes, all right.

                      COUNTRY-CLUB WOMAN #3
          Great.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          She made everybody feel good.

GINGER joins ACE. He smiles proudly.

INT. VEGAS VALLEY COUNTRY-CLUB BANQUET ROOM - NIGHT

GINGER and ACE are off alone by a dining-room table, talking 
intently. A young casino EXECUTIVE interrupts them.

                      EXECUTIVE
          Congratulations, Sam.

                      ACE
               (Shaking his hand)
          Oh, thanks.

The flirting EXECUTIVE looks at GINGER.

                      EXECUTIVE
          Hello, Mrs Rothstein.

                      GINGER
          Hi.

                      EXECUTIVE
          How are you?

                      GINGER
          Oh.

GINGER gives the flirting EXECUTIVE her hand, he kisses it.

                      EXECUTIVE
          You're one of the most gorgeous women 
          I've ever seen. You're a lucky man 
          Mr Rothstein.

ACE watches as GINGER flashes one of her dazzling smiles, 
but he's not sure whether she's flirting. He looks at the 
young man and back at his wife.

                      ACE
          Thank you. Thanks for that compliment.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          He was a young kid from the casino... 
          nice kid...  bright boy. What balls 
          on this fuckin' kid! The next day I 
          fired him.

Freeze frame on ACE smiling at GINGER.

INT. VEGAS BANK VIEWING ROOM - DAY

GINGER, with two-year-old AMY in a stroller, is seated on a 
bench going through large bank vault boxes containing her 
jewels.

                      GINGER
               (To AMY)
          Hey, do you want to see this one? 
          Daddy gave me all this jewelry because 
          he loves me so much. (She places a 
          gold bracelet on AMY's hand.) Put 
          your arm in there.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          But as much as they loved her...

                      GINGER
               (To AMY, wearing the 
               bracelet)
          Oh, fabulous.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...they didn't know what really moved 
          her.

She holds up a necklace to the light.

                      GINGER
          Look at this. Look at this.

CAMERA PULLS AWAY FROM THE DOOR LEADING TO THE VIEWING ROOM 
REVEALING A BANK MANAGER SEATED AT A DESK. WE HEAR GINGER 
AND AMY BEHIND THE DOOR.

                      GINGER (O.S.)
               (From the viewing 
               room)
          Daddy gave me this pin when we were 
          dating.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          And with Ginger happy, I was able to 
          concentrate on what I knew best.

INT. TANGIERS CASINO, SLOT-MACHINES - NIGHT

ACE is talking to DON WARD.

                      WARD
          Loose machines are right back over 
          there.

                      ACE
          What are they doin' way back there? 
          Bring 'em up here where they belong.  
          You can't even see 'em over there.

                      WARD
          Okay, I'll -

                      ACE
          What about the progressives with the 
          high jackpots? Where are they? These 
          machines are hidden.

                      WARD
          Well...

                      ACE
          These are our best machines. They 
          bring all the action. No wonder the 
          drop is off.

                      WARD
          Yeah, okay.

                      ACE
          The action is in the front, not in 
          the back. Bring 'em up front.

                      WARD
          All right, I will, I will.

                      ACE
          Listen to me very carefully. There 
          are three ways of doing things around 
          here. The right way, the wrong way, 
          and the way I do it. You understand?

                      WARD
          I do understand that. I'll get right 
          on it. And thank you.

                      ACE
          Don't thank me, just do it. You're 
          the Slots Manager. I shouldn't have 
          to tell you this.

                      WARD
          Dang, you are right, Mr Rothstein, I 
          am so sorry.

INT. CLASSY RESTAURANT - NIGHT

GINGER follows a snooty MAITRE D' to JENNIFER, already seated 
at a table.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          So, I ended up workin' what? Eighteen-
          hour days?  Ginger was the one who 
          wound up enjoying the best of Vegas.

                      MAITRE D'
               (To JENNIFER)
          Come with me, please. I have a better 
          table for you.  Sorry.

He shows the two of them to the best table in the place.

                      JENNIFER
               (Sitting down next to 
               GINGER)
          So, what'd you say to that fuckin' 
          jerk anyway?

                      GINGER
               (Smiling)
          I told him I was Mrs Sam Rothstein.

                      JENNIFER
               (Chuckles)
          Well, you might as well get somethin' 
          out of it.

GINGER lights a cigarette.

EXT. IDLE SPURS DESERT DINER - DAY

Wide overhead of roadhouse cafe isolated in the middle of 
the desert with a sign out front that reads '60 miles to 
Vegas'.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Well, it wasn't long before what I 
          was afraid was gonna happen, happened. 
          Nicky managed to get himself banned 
          from every casino in Las Vegas, and 
          from then on, I couldn't be seen 
          talkin' to him anywhere in Vegas, or 
          even near it.

                      NICKY
               (From inside the diner)
          What the fuck is that supposed to 
          mean?

INT. IDLE SPURS DESERT DINER - DAY

ACE and NICKY are seated at a table in the empty diner.

                      NICKY
               (Reading from a 
               document)
          ' ...detrimental to gaming. And he 
          will be ejected from any casino in 
          Las Vegas...  and the casinos can be 
          fined as much as a hundred thousand 
          every time he shows up.'
               (He waves the document.)
          Do you believe this shit?

                      ACE
               (Smoking a cigarette)
          Yeah, I believe it. You got banned.

NICKY hisses.

                      NICKY
               (Reading)
          'Who is of notorious and unsavory 
          reputation...'

He angrily wads the document and tosses it across the table.

                      NICKY
          Motherfucker.  Unsavory fuckin'... 
          Is there any way around this?

                      ACE
          Nope, there's no way.

                      NICKY
          Let's say... for instance... I want 
          to go in the restaurant which happens 
          to be in the casino... to get one of 
          those sandwiches I like?

                      ACE
          Forget it. You can't even set foot 
          in the parking lot. That's how serious 
          it is.

                      NICKY
          In other words, I'm fucked.

                      ACE
          In so many words, yes.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          It just didn't sink into his head 
          about the Black Book and what it 
          meant. Not being able to go into a 
          casino is just one thing, but being 
          in this book etched your name into 
          the brains of every cop and FBI agent 
          in the state. I mean, you're listed 
          in there with Al Capone. But Nicky 
          didn't care.

                      NICKY
          I gotta do somethin'. I gotta do 
          somethin'. They ain't gettin' rid of 
          me. They're not gettin' rid of me. 
          I'm staying here. Fuck 'em. Fuck 
          'em.

EXT. GOLD RUSH JEWELER'S - DAY

WE MOVE PAST THE SKULL OF A STEER MOUNTED ON AN EXTERIOR 
WALL AND A WOODEN CIGAR STORE INDIAN STATUE, TO REVEAL 
DOMINICK SANTORO (WHO LOOKS A LITTLE LIKE HIS BROTHER NICKY) 
AND MARINO WHO ARE WAITING INSIDE THE GOLD RUSH. CAMERA COMES 
TO REST ON EXTREME CLOSE-UP OF NICKY'S EYES AS HE STANDS ON 
THE OUTSIDE PORCH.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          So, once they pulled that shit, I 
          started doin' my own things in Vegas 
          nobody ever thought of doin'. To 
          keep an eye on things, I brought in 
          my kid brother Dominick... and some 
          desperadoes from back home and started 
          knockin' over high rollers, casino 
          bosses, bookmakers, anybody, right 
          here in town. I had a good fuckin' 
          crew goin' for me, I'll tell you 
          that.

SAL FUSCO, JACK HARDY and BERNIE BLUE are getting out of a 
car and walking into the jewelry store which is designed to 
replicate an old-fashioned Western town with peaked roofs, 
wooden planked sidewalks and hitching posts. The camera tracks 
by each man as they're introduced.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          I had Sal Fusco, a great second-story 
          guy. Jack Hardy, he worked for a 
          safe company after he did a six-year 
          bit. And then there was Bernie Blue. 
          This guy could bypass any alarm for 
          me. And I opened up my own jewelry 
          store, too: 'The Gold Rush'.

INT. BEDROOM OF LUXURY HOME - NIGHT

NICKY places some jewelry from a vanity table into a sack 
and turns over some family photos. MARINO and HARDY are 
struggling with a safe.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Sometimes I used to go along on a 
          heist just for the fun of it. But I 
          didn't like the people I was rippin' 
          off lookin' at me, so I used to turn 
          their fuckin' pictures around.

                      NICKY
               (To MARINO and HARDY)
          What's takin' so long over there?

                      MARINO
          This peter's a motherfucker.

                      HARDY
               (Grunting)
          It's workin'. Just keep workin' it. 
          It's comin'.

                      NICKY
          Gotta learn how to open these fuckin' 
          things so you won't have to take 
          'em.

INT. GOLD RUSH BACK ROOM - DAY

NICKY is looking at diamonds with MARINO, HARDY and BLUE.

                      NICKY
          Frankie, some of these stones got a

          And they all...

EXT. WAREHOUSE/JEWELRY STORE - NIGHT

HARDY and a hood are in a van parked in front of a warehouse 
next door to a jewelry store.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...got a piece of the score.

                      HARDY
               (From inside the van, 
               into a walkie-talkie)
          Car's comin'.

We move past the van to a larger truck parked in an alley. 
Unseen, the truck has an open side door abutting the jewelry 
store's wall. SAL FUSCO and BERNIE BLUE are inside the truck 
drilling into the wall using a heavy-duty battery-powered 
drill. The drill is muffled with sheets of insulation 
material.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          They were always very careful. And 
          they always bypassed the alarms, or 
          else... if not, they'd drill enough 
          holes to knock through the walls 
          with a sledgehammer...

BLUE widens the hole with a hammer muffled with insulation.

EXT. JEWELRY STORE WALL - DAY

A flashbulb explodes.

Cops and detectives are photographing and inspecting holes 
drilled in the wall of the shop, through which the thieves 
have come and gone. The camera moves in through the hole.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Nobody out there was expecting a guy 
          like him.

INT. JEWELRY STORE - DAY

The stunned STORE OWNER looks at the rubble and the empty 
jewelry boxes.

Detectives collect evidence.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          For Nicky, Las Vegas was the fuckin' 
          Wild West.

                      STORE OWNER
               (Leading a detective 
               to his showroom)
          I just got a shipment of diamonds 
          from Israel...

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          But what the fuck they expect from 
          me? I had to earn, didn't I?

INT. PALM SPRINGS JEWELRY STORE - DAY

MARINO stands above two IRANIANS who are looking at the stolen 
gems.

                      IRANIAN #1
          You know, this diamond has flaws in 
          it.

                      MARINO
          No, no, there's no flaws in it.

                      IRANIAN #2
          Don't tell me. I'm doing this for 
          twenty-five years.

                      MARINO
          You better clean your fuckin' loupe. 
          'Cause there's no flaws in these 
          diamonds.

The two IRANIANS speak to each other in Farsi.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Whenever we got local merch, we'd 
          usually send it to Palm Spring or 
          Arizona... LA. I had a couple of 
          sand niggers out there. You know, 
          Arabs.

                      MARINO
          What, are you gonna have a fuckin' 
          meeting here, or are you gonna buy 
          some diamonds?

                      IRANIAN #2
               (Chuckling)
          No, no. I know his language. I'm 
          talking with him.

                      MARINO
          Forty thousand dollars, you can buy 
          the whole package.

                      IRANIAN #1
          Twenty thousand, and that's my final 
          offer and...

                      MARINO
               (To IRANIAN #2)
          All of a sudden he talks English, 
          now.
               (To IRANIAN #1.)
          Let's talk turkey here, how 'bout 
          twenty-five thousand?

IRANIAN #1 laughs.

INT. NICKY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

NICKY and MARINO sneak into the house past JENNIFER who is 
asleep on the sofa in front of a TV set. NICKY takes out a 
key and opens the metal door into his bedroom.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          I actually turned my bedroom into a 
          bank vault where I kept the choice 
          stuff.

                      MARINO
               (Referring to JENNIFER 
               as they pass the 
               kitchen)
          She asleep?

                      NICKY
          Every night, on the couch.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          I couldn't leave it at the Gold Rush 
          in case we got raided by the cops... 
          or if my crew got cute.

Opening the metal door to his bedroom.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          I had the only key.

INT. NICKY'S BEDROOM/CLOSET - NIGHT

Camera pans across bedroom to closet door.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Jennifer didn't give a fuck. She 
          used to fall asleep on the couch 
          watchin' television every night. 
          This stuff was all mine. I didn't 
          send any of this back home.

NICKY opens the closet door. He and MARINO walk in and bend 
down to lift up a small square of carpet to reveal a floor 
safe.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Actually, I couldn't because I wasn't 
          even supposed to be doin' it. The 
          bosses were makin' so much fuckin' 
          money with the casinos
               (unlocking the safe)
          that they didn't want anybody makin' 
          any waves for them.

In the floor safe, there are several handguns and silencers.

FRANK hands NICKY a roll of money.

                      NICKY
          Give all the guys in your crew a 
          piece of that?

                      MARINO
          I took care of everybody.

                      NICKY
          Yeah?  

He searches MARINO's jacket.  

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          That's why there was no real organized 
          street stuff in Vegas before I came 
          here.

NICKY throws the cash in the safe and closes the lid.

INT. NICKY'S HOUSE - DAY

NICKY is being shown papers by CHARLIE CLARK, a heavy-set 
banker with a moustache. They're both seated at a table in 
the living-room.

                      CHARLIE CLARK
          Yeah, that works out.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          But how much cash could I bury in my 
          closet, right?

                      CHARLIE CLARK
          You need to understand, and I - I'm 
          sure you do... that in a venture of 
          this kind, you have to be prepared 
          to take some kind of loss.

                      NICKY
          Oh, listen, I understand that there's 
          always a risk... you know, I might 
          have to take a loss somewhere.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          So I put some of the money into 
          legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. 
          He was Ace's banker.

                      NICKY
          I mean, you will try to push it 
          through, won't you, Mr Clark?

                      CHARLIE CLARK
          Yes.

                      NICKY
          Well, you gotta understand, I'm giving 
          you fifty thousand cash.

CHARLIE CLARK chuckles

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Then I put some more of the money...

INT. LEANING TOWER RESTAURANT, KITCHEN - NIGHT

A prosciutto sandwich is being prepared on a kitchen counter.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...in some legitimate places, like 
          my restaurant.

                      DOMINICK
               (To COOK preparing 
               sandwich)
          Is that the last one?

                      COOK
          Yeah.

He hands the sandwich to DOMINICK who spits in it.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          I had my kid brother, Dominick, run 
          it for me.

                      DOMINICK
               (Spits)
          Fuckers!

DOMINICK wraps it in plastic and puts it into a brown paper 
bag.

INT. LEANING TOWER RESTAURANT - NIGHT

DOMINICK sets the bag with the wrapped sandwich in it on top 
of pizza boxes being held by two uniformed Vegas COPS.

                      DOMINICK
          Here you go, guys.

                      COP #1
          All right. Thanks, a lot.

                      DOMINICK
          Yeah... yeah, enjoy.

                      COP #2
          Yeah.

He shakes COP #2's hand before heading back into the 
restaurant.

                      DOMINICK
          Have a good time.
               (Muttering to himself.)
          Choke on it, ya motherfucker!

                      MAN #1
               (Passing DOMINICK on 
               his way out)
          Hey, Dom.

                      DOMINICK
          Hey, how you doin'?

DOMINICK walks over to some patrons in the bar area. NICKY 
enters, kissing his brother.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants. He 
          was a real restaurant buff. And over 
          the years, he always made money with 
          them.

                      NICKY
               (Looking at one of 
               the patrons)
          Hey, Rich.

THE CAMERA FOLLOWS NICKY AROUND THE RESTAURANT PAST LAS VEGAS 
TYPES - DEALERS, LOUNGE ACTS, SHOWGIRLS, TV AND MOVIE 
CELEBRITIES, WAITRESSES AND BARMEN - WHO USE THE JAMMED PLACE 
AS THEIR HANGOUT.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          In Vegas, he had The Leaning Tower. 
          It was a very popular spot. He had 
          politicians, showgirls and movies 
          stars hangin' out all over the place.

NICKY walks up to STEVE ALLEN and JAYNE MEADOWS seated at a 
table, he whistles their theme tune as he approaches from 
behind.

                      NICKY
          Listen, that show over at the Flamingo 
          gets better and better.

                      STEVE ALLEN
          By the way, Sammy said whenever you 
          have a minute, give him a call.

                      NICKY
          Made a messenger out of you too, 
          huh?

                      STEVE ALLEN
               (Laughs)
          I'll do anything for a buck.

                      NICKY
          He does it. He does it to everybody. 
          Enjoy your dinner.

                      JAYNE MEADOWS
               (Chuckles)
          Thanks.

                      STEVE ALLEN
          Okay, thanks.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          But I gotta tell you, the thing Nicky 
          liked the most was the showgirls, 
          naturally. I mean, to them, Nicky 
          was the movie star.

NICKY walks across the room to MARINO and two showgirls, 
SHELLY and STACY.

                      NICKY
               (To MARINO)
          You walk past me?

                      MARINO
          Hey. This is Shelly.

                      NICKY
          Hey, Shelly.
               (Kisses her hand.)

                      SHELLY
          Hi.

                      NICKY
          How are you? Nice to meet you.

                      MARINO
               (Pointing to STACY)
          And this is Stacy.

                      NICKY
          Stacy.
               (Kisses her hand.)

                      MARINO
               (To the SHOWGIRLS)
          This is Nick.

                      NICKY
          Pleasure.

                      STACY
          Hi, Nick.

                      MARINO
          We're gonna have dinner. Come on.

                      NICKY
          All right, uh,
               (To SHELLY)
          Let's just check the kitchen first. 
          Excuse us one second. Come on, I'll 
          show you.

He takes SHELLY's hand and leads her out.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
               (From following scene)
          'Cause I fly stuff in fresh every 
          day.

INT. LEANING TOWER RESTAURANT, PARKING LOT - NIGHT

NICKY and SHELLY walk across the parking lot and get into 
his two-tone, red and white car.

                      NICKY
          I get bread from back home. I get 
          fish from California. And you can 
          always tell a great kitchen like 
          ours because of the milk-fed veal. 
          That's the secret.

Opening the car door from the passenger's side, she gets in.

                      NICKY
          See, milk-fed veal is pure white. 
          Out here, they got that pink veal. 
          Slide over, honey.

She slides over, he gets into the passenger's seat and closes 
the door.

                      NICKY
          Now, pink veal, you can pound that 
          shit for two days and it'll never 
          get tender, you know what I mean?

SHELLY's head disappears into NICKY's lap.

INT. LEANING TOWER RESTAURANT - NIGHT

FRANK and DOMINICK are at the bar watching as NICKY chastises 
AL, a gambler. The restaurant is empty except for a waiter 
milling around in the background, setting a few tables.

                      AL
          When I left here with the money...

                      NICKY
          Mm.

                      AL
          ...I got muscled on the street.

                      NICKY
          Mm.

                      AL
          A couple of guys, I owe them. So, 
          that's what I did. I gave 'em the 
          money.  That's what I did.

                      NICKY
          Yeah?

                      AL
          Yeah.

                      NICKY
          You call yourself a man? You know 
          you're a lyin', low-life, 
          motherfuckin' gambling degenerate 
          prick? You know that's what you are?  
          Two small kids at home. I gave you 
          money to pay the fuckin' rent and 
          buy groceries, put the heat on. You 
          know your wife called Frankie and 
          told him the fuckin' heat's off?

AL glances over to MARINO.

                      NICKY
          Huh? And you didn't gamble that 
          fuckin' money? You're gonna stand 
          here and tell me that?

He shakes his head 'no'.

                      NICKY
          No, no? You didn't?

                      AL
          I didn't give 'em the m-

                      NICKY
          Don't fuck with me, Al! Don't make a 
          fuck out of me! You want to embarrass 
          me and make a fool out of me?!  You 
          didn't gamble?! Tell me you gambled 
          the fuckin' money, I'll give you the 
          fuckin' money to put the fuckin' 
          heat on! Did you gamble?! Huh?!

The chastised gambler nods 'yes', bowing his head in shame.

                      NICKY
          Fuckin' degenerate, you.

NICKY takes some money from his coat pocket and starts 
counting out some bills.

                      NICKY
          Fuckin' kids at home!  Here.
               (Giving him the money.)
          Get the fuck out of here.

                      AL
          Thanks, Nick.

                      NICKY
          Yeah, thanks.

AL walks out.

                      NICKY
          Let me find out you fucked up, I'll 
          leave you wherever I find you.

INT. NICKY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY

NICKY, worn out from the night before, is making pancakes 
for LITTLE NICKY.

                      NICKY
               (To LITTLE NICKY)
          How many of these you gonna eat, 
          huh?

                      LITTLE NICKY
          Two.

                      NICKY
          Two?

                      ACE (V.O.)
          But around six-thirty in the morning 
          when he finished his day -

NICKY hugs and kisses his son.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          - no matter where he was or what he 
          was doing, he always went home to 
          make breakfast for his son, Nicky-
          Boy.

                      NICKY
               (Pouring some syrup 
               on his son's pancakes)
          Here, let's put a little of this on 
          for you. I know you like this. A 
          little butter, right, not a lot?

                      LITTLE NICKY
          Mm-hm.

                      NICKY
          You know why, right?

                      LITTLE NICKY
          Yeah.

                      NICKY
          Why?

                      LITTLE NICKY
          'Cause it clogs up your heart.

                      NICKY
          What a smart kid you are!
               (Kisses him.)
          Okay, eat.

INT. ALL-AMERICAN GAS STATION, BACK HOME - DAY

MARINO walks through an office past a few hoods.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Every couple of weeks I used to send 
          Marino back to the bosses with a 
          piece of what I made.

TITLE IN: 'BACK HOME'

MARINO walks out of the office and through the garage.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Not a big piece, but fuck them, what 
          did they know? They were fifteen 
          hundred miles away...

EXT. ALL-AMERICAN GAS STATION, BACK HOME - DAY

Wide shot of gas station. There is snow on the ground. The 
cloudy, Midwestern skyline of warehouses and skyscrapers can 
be seen behind the gas station sign: 'All-American Gas'.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...and I don't know anybody who can 
          see that far. Their drop was a truck 
          stop/garage where...

INT. ALL-AMERICAN GAS STATION, GAGGI'S BACK OFFICE - DAY

REMO GAGGI is seated in a chair as MARINO walks in. CURLY, 
one of Gaggi's men, and two of the bosses are there.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...Remo and the guys used to hang 
          out and count their millions.

                      MARINO
          Remo.

He bends down and kisses him.

                      GAGGI
          Hey, Frankie.

                      MARINO
          How are you?

                      GAGGI
          Fine, fine.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          I mean, the cops knew, but they didn't 
          give a fuck. I mean, you know, they 
          all worked it out together.

                      MARINO
          Nicky sends his warmest regards.

MARINO unzips a small sack and hands GAGGI a thick stack of 
cash. GAGGI inspects it before handing it over to one of his 
men.

                      GAGGI
          Uh-huh. Good.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          But I knew how to keep the bosses 
          happy. Whenever they gave me little 
          jobs to do, you know, to send a 
          message, I would carry things out...

                      GAGGI
          And how are things going down there?

                      MARINO
          Fine. Everything's goin' good.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...to a tee. Like the time Tony 
          Dogs...

INT. OUTSKIRTS OF VEGAS BAR - NIGHT

Flash cut of TONY DOGS and two men shooting up a bar with 
automatics hitting the owner, bartenders and a waitress.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...who was supposed to be the new 
          maniac tough guy in town, shot up 
          one of Remo's bars. Here's a fuckin' 
          guy, kills two of Remo's guys and a 
          poor fuckin' waitress, who was just 
          workin' on her night off, of all 
          things.

SLOW MOTION ON TONY DOGS.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          I mean, this guy's just beggin' to 
          be made an example of.

The men and the waitress lie dead on the floor. The bar is 
left in shambles.

                      GAGGI (V.O.)
               (From his office)
          Frankie...

INT. ALL-AMERICAN GAS STATION, GAGGI'S BACK OFFICE - NIGHT

An enraged GAGGI gives MARINO orders.

                      GAGGI
          ...I want all the names of all the 
          other people he had with him. And I 
          don't care what you have to do to 
          him to get 'em. You understand?

                      MARINO
          I'll take care of it, Remo.

                      GAGGI
          E mo va! [Italian-American slang for 
          'Now, go!']

INT. SLOT-MACHINE SHOP, LAS VEGAS - NIGHT

MARINO and BLUE are dragging TONY DOGS, who is beaten to a 
pulp, across the floor towards a workshop table. NICKY follows 
them.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          To be truthful with you, I had to 
          admire this fuckin' guy.  He was one 
          of the toughest Irishmen I ever met.

                      NICKY
          This fuckin' guy, he got some stamina, 
          don't he?

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          This son-of-a-bitch was tough.

                      NICKY
          Personally, I don't give a fuck who 
          was with him anyway. As long as he 
          gives me a name I could give to them.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          For two days and two fuckin' nights, 
          we beat the shit out of this guy. I 
          mean, we even stuck ice-picks in his 
          balls.

                      NICKY
          You better hope he gives me a fuckin' 
          name soon, or I'm gonna give him 
          yours, Frank.

MARINO and BLUE lay DOGS on the table and put his head in a 
vise. They're exhausted from beating him.

                      MARINO
               (To NICKY)
          Yeah, thanks a lot.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          But he never talked.

                      NICKY
               (To MARINO)
          I know you would have ratted by now.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          In the end, I had to put his fuckin' 
          head in a vise.

                      NICKY
          Dogs. Dogs, can your hear me, Dogs?

DOGS gasps and mumbles.

                      NICKY
          Listen to me, Anthony. I got your 
          head in a fuckin' vise. I'm gonna 
          squash your fuckin' head like a 
          grapefruit if you don't give me a 
          name. Don't make me have to do this, 
          please. Come on. Don't make me be a 
          bad guy. Come on.

                      TONY DOGS
               (With what strength 
               he as left)
          Fuck you!

                      NICKY
               (To MARINO and BLUE)
          This motherfucker, do you believe 
          this? Two fuckin' days and nights!
               (To DOGS.)
          Fuck me?

NICKY begins to tighten the vise.

                      NICKY
          Fuck me, you motherfucker?
               (Turning the vise.)
          Fuck my mother? That's what you 
          fuckin' tell me?

NICKY angrily keeps spinning the vise handle until suddenly 
one of DOGS's eyes bulges out of the socket.

                      NICKY
          Huh? You motherfucker, you, huh?

MARINO and BLUE are horrified by the sight. Everybody freezes.

                      NICKY
          Oh, God! Give me the fuckin' name!

                      TONY DOGS
          Ch-Charlie M!

                      NICKY
          Charlie M?

                      TONY DOGS
               (Blood streaming out 
               of his mouth)
          Charlie M.

                      NICKY
               (Screaming)
          Charlie M? You make me pop your 
          fuckin' eye out of your head to 
          protect that piece of shit? Charlie 
          M? You dumb motherfucker!

                      TONY DOGS
               (Pleading)
          Kill me, you fuck, kill me.

                      NICKY
          Kill you,
               (unwinds the crank)
          You motherfucker you!
               (To MARINO.)
          Frankie, do him a fuckin' favor.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          The word got around that finally...

MARINO places a knife against DOGS's neck.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...there was a real gangster in town. 
          Nicky was the new boss of Las Vegas.

We hear DOGS gasp as the knife slices his throat.

                      NICKY
          Charlie M!

INT. TANGIERS CASINO - DAY

Extreme close-up of a slot-machine. Four reels with sevens 
across. Suddenly, the power goes out. Lights die down.. 
Machine 'waaaooows' down to a dead stop.

Security guards, on their hands and knees, are pulling the 
plugs on the three giant $15,000 progressive machines, as 
ACE talks to DON WARD.

                      ACE
          Four reels, sevens across, three 
          fifteen-thousand-dollar jackpots? Do 
          you have any idea what the odds are?

                      WARD
          Shoot, it's gotta be in the millions, 
          maybe more.

                      ACE
          Three fuckin' jackpots in twenty 
          minutes? Why didn't you pull the 
          machines? Why didn't you call me?

                      WARD
          Well, it happened so quick. Three 
          guys won. I didn't have a chance to 
          call you.

                      ACE
          You didn't see the scam? You didn't 
          see what was goin' on?

                      WARD
          Well, there's no way to determine 
          that, Sam.

                      ACE
          Yes, there is. An infallible way! 
          They won!

                      WARD
          Well, it's a casino. People gotta 
          win sometimes.

                      ACE
          Hey... Ward, you're pissin' me off. 
          Now, you're insulting my intelligence. 
          What do you think, I'm a fuckin' 
          idiot? You know goddamn well somebody 
          had to get into those machines and 
          set those fuckin' reels.

SHERBERT enters, stands next to ACE.

                      ACE
          The probability on one-four-reel 
          machine is a million and a half to 
          one. On three machines in a row, 
          it's in the billions.  It cannot 
          happen... would not happen, you 
          fuckin' momo! What's the matter with 
          you!  Didn't you see you were bein' 
          set up on the second win?

                      WARD
          I really think you're -

                      ACE
               (Interrupts)
          You - Wait! You didn't see that you 
          were being set up on the second win?

                      WARD
          I really think you're overreacting 
          in this whole -

                      ACE
               (Interrupts)
          Listen, you fuckin' yokel, I've had 
          it with you. I've been carryin' your 
          ass in this place ever since I got 
          here. Get your ass and get your things 
          and get out of here.

                      WARD
          You're firin' me?

                      ACE
          I'm firin' you? No, I'm not firin'
               (mocking WARD)
          I'm firin' you, you -

Gives SHERBERT a look.

                      WARD
          You might regret this, Mr Rothstein.

                      ACE
          I'll regret it even more if I keep 
          you on.

                      WARD
          This is not the way to treat people.

                      ACE
          Listen, if you didn't know you're 
          bein' scammed, you're too fuckin' 
          dumb to keep this job. If you did 
          know, you were in on it. Either way, 
          you're out!  Get out! Go on.
               (To SHERBERT.)
          Let's go.

ACE and SHERBERT walk off, WARD turns to leave.

INT. TANGIERS CASINO, AKU-AKU LOUNGE - DAY, AN HOUR LATER

ACE and GREEN are seated having coffee and muffins in the 
Hawaiian lounge by the casino floor.

                      ACE
          I mean, the guy is history as far as 
          I'm concerned. History.

                      GREEN
          But you can't just fire him. Webb's 
          his brother-in-law. He's County 
          Commissioner.

                      ACE
          So what? Everybody out here with 
          cowboy boots is a fuckin' county 
          commissioner or related to a county 
          commissioner. I'm fuckin' sick of 
          it.

          This is his state. His uncle's Chief 
          Judge. His brother-in-law runs the 
          County Commission. I don't know how 
          many other relatives he's got in 
          town.  There's gotta be a way to 
          work him back in.

          Phil, I can understand. You're in 
          the finances, you're upstairs, but 
          you are not on the floor. I got 
          thousands of players. I got five 
          hundred dealers.  They're all lookin' 
          to rob me blind, twenty-four hours a 
          day. I have to let them know I'm 
          watching all the details, all the 
          time; that there is not one single 
          thing I will not catch as I am over 
          here.

Green's.

                      ACE
          Look at yours.

                      GREEN
          What?

                      ACE
          Look at that. Look at this. There's 
          nothin'... look how many blueberries 
          your muffin has and how many mine 
          has. Yours is falling apart. I have 
          nothing.

                      GREEN
          What are you talking about?

                      ACE
          It's like everything else in this 
          place. You don't do it yourself, it 
          never gets done.

GREEN follows ACE to the kitchen.

          Where you goin'?

INT. TANGIERS KITCHEN - DAY

ACE, GREEN and the BAKER are gathered around the BAKER's 
counter surrounded by muffin tins and batter.

                      ACE
               (Handing the BAKER 
               the two muffins)
          From now on I want you to put an 
          equal amount of blueberries in each 
          muffin. An equal amount of blueberries 
          in each muffin.

                      BAKER
          You know how long that's going to 
          take?

                      ACE
          I don't care how long it takes. Put 
          an equal amount in each muffin.

ACE leaves, GREEN looks on in amazement as the BAKER holds 
the muffins. GREEN follows ACE out.

INT. ACE'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY

ACE, seated at the kitchen table, is feeding AMY in a high 
chair. The nanny is in the background.

                      ACE
          Come on, honey, just a little. That 
          a girl, that a girl. Oh, boy, look.

GINGER enters and goes to the sink.

                      ACE
               (To AMY, who is sobbing 
               and mumbling)
          Okay, want to go with Mommy?

                      ACE
          What do you need?

                      GINGER
               (Giving AMY to the 
               NANNY)
          You get her?  Okay.
               (To ACE.)
          Well, I need a lot. I need more than 
          usual.

                      ACE
          Well, why don't you take it out of 
          your account? There's a lot there.

                      GINGER
          Well, I would, you know, Sam. It's 
          just that... well, I need more than 
          that. I need twenty-five thousand.

She sits down at the table next to him.

                      ACE
          Twenty-five thousand? For yourself?

                      GINGER
               (Picking up an empty 
               carton of milk)
          Yeah.

                      ACE
          Why do you need that much?

                      GINGER
          Well, what's the difference? I just 
          need it.

                      ACE
          Well, I mean... you know, I gotta 
          ask you. That's a lot of money.  
          You're not asking for a box of 
          popcorn, you know. I mean...

                      GINGER
          I'm aware of that. We don't have to 
          turn this into a big deal.
               (Getting up to the 
               refrigerator.)
          Okay? We don't have to have a fight. 
          It was important to me. But forget 
          it. Just something I wanted to do 
          for myself.

                      ACE
          Who's fighting? I mean, I'm, you 
          know, tell me what it's for.

GINGER, annoyed, closes the refrigerator door.

                      ACE
          Why can't you tell me what it's for?

She stirs her coffee.

                      ACE
          Huh?
               (Pause)
          Well, you know what? Now, I want you 
          to tell me. I mean, my wife comes to 
          me and asks me for twenty-five 
          thousand. I mean, what do you want? 
          Do you want a coat?

                      GINGER
          No.

                      ACE
          Well, if you want a coat, you got 
          it. You know that. It's not the money, 
          it's just why do you want it?  That's 
          all I'm askin'. Am I not entitled to 
          that?

                      GINGER
          Look - Sam, I've been independent my 
          whole life. I never had to ask anybody 
          for anything. Now you're making me 
          beg you for this.

                      ACE
          What are you talkin' a- ?

                      GINGER
               (Interrupting)
          Okay? And you're embarrassing me. 
          Why do want to make me feel so bad?

                      ACE
          You're askin' me for twenty-five 
          thousand. I'm not out to make you 
          feel bad. I want to just be able to 
          trust you. You now, it's about trust. 
          I have to be able to trust you with 
          my life. Do you understand? Can I 
          trust you?
               (She doesn't answer.)
          Can I trust you?... Can I trust 
          you?... Answer me. Can I trust you?

                      GINGER
               (Quietly)
          You can trust me.

                      ACE
          Good, so then you could tell me what 
          the money is for.

GINGER gives him a look and leaves.

INT. VEGAS BANK VAULT - DAY

GINGER takes about two inches of $100 bills out of a safe 
deposit box and slips it in an envelope.

EXT. VEGAS/BANK/PUBLIC PHONE - DAY

NICKY is on a phone watching GINGER leave the bank.

                      NICKY
               (Into telephone)
          Yeah, she's leavin' the bank now. 
          All right, I'm gonna follow her.

INT. SALVADORAN DINER BOOTH - DAY

GINGER is in a booth with LESTER DIAMOND, handing him the 
envelope filled with money.

                      LESTER
          What does that mean? No, I know that 
          look. What does that mean?

                      GINGER
          It means I got the money.

                      LESTER
          You got money. That's a - That's a 
          good look.

SWISH PAN TO ACE ENTERING, FOLLOWED BY A HOOD. HE SITS DOWN 
AT THE BOOTH WITH LESTER AND GINGER.

                      ACE
          How you doin', Les? It's Lester, 
          right? Sam.

Extends his hand to LESTER, who shakes it.

                      ACE
          From my recollection, aren't you the 
          card shark... the golf hustler...  
          the pimp from Beverly Hills?

LESTER gives GINGER a 'how did you fuck this up?' Look.

                      ACE
          If I'm wrong, please correct me, 
          'cause I never knew you to be a heist 
          man.
               (LESTER sighs.)
          But if you are, you know what... 
          here, take mine too.

ACE takes some money out of his coat and puts the thick wad 
of bills on the table.

                      ACE
          Go ahead, take it. 'Cause you already 
          have hers.

LESTER turns and sees two HOODS standing by the front and 
back doors of the diner.

                      ACE
          She's my wife.
               (To LESTER.)
          Look at me. You did know that, didn't 
          you? You knew that she's my wife? 
          Huh? Hey, look at me.

                      LESTER
          Yeah, yeah. I know that.

                      ACE
          You do? Yeah? Well, if you ever come 
          back again... ever... to take her 
          money... next time bring a pistol.  
          That way you got a chance. Be a man, 
          don't be a fuckin' pimp. Now, you 
          want to do me a favor? Get out of 
          here. I want to be alone with my 
          wife. Get the fuck up and get out of 
          here.

After stammering for a moment, LESTER gets up and begins to 
move towards the back door.  

                      LESTER
               (Quietly)
          Okay.

                      ACE
          You fuckin' piece of shit.

                      LESTER
          Hey, that's just fuckin' - That's 
          bullshit. You know, you know, what 
          the fuck?

The thugs follow him out of the back door. GINGER freezes.

                      ACE
          You remember when you called him 
          that night? When you said goodbye to 
          him?  He didn't say, 'Don't get 
          married, I'll be right down, we'll 
          get married.'  He didn't say that to 
          you, did he?

                      GINGER
               (Whispering)
          No, he didn't.

                      ACE
               (Picks up the money)
          Didn't. No, instead, what did he 
          say? 'Fuck him. Take him for 
          everything he's got.'

ACE takes GINGER by the arm to the rear of the diner where 
they can see the parking area through a glass door.

                      ACE
          Come here, I want to show you 
          somethin'.

EXT. REAR OF SALVADORAN DINER, PARKING LOT - DAY

Three HOODS rush LESTER who is running towards his car. GINGER 
bursts through the doors, trying to get to LESTER. ACE holds 
her back. They struggle. LESTER groans and gasps as the HOODS 
start to beat him up.

                      HOOD #1
          You fuckin' shit.

                      GINGER
          No! No! No! Don't!

ACE restrains her.

The HOODS punch LESTER in the face and stomach.

                      GINGER
          Make them stop it!
               (Sobbing.)
          No! No! No! It's not his fault! It's 
          my fault!

NICKY watches from a car in a parking lot across the street, 
out of GINGER's sight.

ACE forces GINGER into the car as the HOODS finish the 
beating.

                      GINGER
               (Sobbing)
          No! No!

The HOODS toss LESTER into his car.

                      LESTER
               (Falling into the 
               front seat on his 
               back.)
          Fuck!

NICKY watches as the HOODS walk away from LESTER's car.

                      LESTER
          Fuck you!

                      HOOD #2
          You piece of shit.

ACE pulls out of the parking lot with a wailing GINGER.

LESTER groans, trying to sit up.

                      LESTER
               (As ACE and GINGER 
               drive off down the 
               street)
          Couldn't do it yourself, you 
          chickenshit cocksucker!

INT. GOLD RUSH BACK ROOM - DAY

GINGER and NICKY are in the back room. NICKY is sitting on a 
couch while GINGER stands by a mirror with a curling iron.

                      GINGER
               (Throwing the iron on 
               the counter)
          He's such a prick. He had some guy 
          from the hotel beat him up. He didn't 
          want to do it himself. Oh, no, he 
          didn't want to get his own hands 
          dirty.

She takes a pill with a drink.

                      GINGER
          So, why'd he have to do that, huh?

She walks towards NICKY, who is sitting on a couch across 
the room.

                      GINGER
          Tell me.

                      NICKY
          I know it wasn't a nice thing to do 
          but -

                      GINGER
               (Interrupts)
          Yeah, no shit.

She sits down next to NICKY.

                      NICKY
          Well, you gotta understand it. He 
          doesn't know if this guy is shaking 
          you down or taking advantage of you.

                      GINGER
          No! No! I told him all about the guy 
          before we ever got married. This is 
          no fuckin' surprise.

                      NICKY
          Oh, you did? I didn't know that.

                      GINGER
          Yeah. He's just a friend of mine I 
          was trying to help, so... so what?

                      NICKY
          You know... the first time I ever 
          saw your guys together... I never 
          saw him so happy. I mean, I know 
          he's a crazy Jew fuck and everything, 
          but...

She smiles.

                      NICKY
          I never see - You know, I never seen 
          him act like that with anybody else.  
          I think he's crazy about you. I mean, 
          he really loves you. He does.

                      GINGER
          Oh, come on. I went into this with 
          my eyes open, you know. I knew the 
          bottom could drop out at any time. 
          I'm a working girl, right?  You don't 
          think I'm gonna go into a situation 
          like this if I don't think I'm gonna 
          get covered on the back end.

                      NICKY
          Sure.

                      GINGER
          Am I right?

                      NICKY
          I can see that. Sure.

                      GINGER
          So, he put aside some jewelry for 
          me. A lot of jewelry.

                      NICKY
          You mean, like a lot of expensive 
          jewelry? About how much?

                      GINGER
          Mm, you want to steal it?
               (Cracking a smile.)

                      NICKY
          No. I - I'm just curious, you know. 
          I was wonderin' how much he would 
          put into a thing like that. That's 
          all.

                      GINGER
          I'm told it's worth about a million 
          dollars, maybe more. 
               (Sniffs.)

                      NICKY
          Well, there you go. But what does 
          that tell ya? A million dollars in 
          jewelry. Does that tell you the guy 
          is crazy about you, or what?

                      GINGER
          I should have never married him. 
          He's a Gemini. A triple Gemini...  
          duality.
               (Breaking down.)
          Gemini's the snake. You know you 
          can't trust the snake.
               (Sniffs.)
          I mean it.

                      NICKY
          I know what you mean.

He moves closer to her.

                      NICKY
          Listen, Ginger... you know, this is 
          probably not... I don't have the 
          answers anyway... and this is probably 
          not what you want to hear right now, 
          because you're a little upset with 
          Ace.

                      GINGER
          I do.

                      NICKY
          I understand that. But, you know, I 
          think you should try to make the 
          best of it now. Go slow, you know. 
          See what happens.

                      GINGER
          He could have killed him! Okay? He 
          could have killed him. 

She gets up and walks to the counter by the mirror.

                      GINGER
          He didn't have to hit him. It's not 
          exactly like I'm sleepin' with the 
          guy! And he makes me sneak around to 
          see my own friends! What the fuck is 
          that all about?

                      NICKY
          Well, I guess it's 'cause he loves 
          you so much. He's jealous and worried.

                      GINGER
               (Sighs, her voice 
               starts to crack)
          He gives a fuck what I do?

                      NICKY
               (Getting up)
          Look, I'll try to find out what the 
          hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll 
          talk to him.

                      GINGER
          Okay.

                      NICKY
          All right?

                      GINGER
          Yeah.
               (Walking over to him, 
               smiling.)
          Thanks.

Towering over NICKY, holding a drink in one hand and his 
shoulder in the other, she leans down and kisses him.

                      GINGER
          Thanks for puttin' up with me.

NICKY takes the drink out of her hand.

                      NICKY
          And take it easy with this shit, 
          will you? I mean, this can only make 
          matters worse.

                      GINGER
          Oh, come on.

                      NICKY
          You're a beautiful girl. You don't 
          want to ruin your looks. I've seen a 
          lot of girls get shot to hell from 
          this stuff.

                      GINGER
               (Fidgeting with his 
               jacket, then holding 
               his face in her hands, 
               smiling.)
          You're so nice.
               (She begins to cry.)

                      NICKY
          Come on, now, I don't want to see 
          you unhappy.

She kisses him.

                      GINGER
               (Tenderly strokes his 
               head)
          Thanks.

                      NICKY
          Yeah.

She embraces NICKY, wrapping her arms around him.

                      GINGER
               (Through tears)
          Thank you.

                      NICKY
               (Feeling a little 
               awkward with the hug)
          It's all right.

She kisses him again. NICKY doesn't move, holding back.

INT. ACE'S OFFICE - DAY

Pull back from a sign, with a tiny 'yes' on top of a gigantic 
'no', leaning on a window overlooking the sportsbook. We see 
ACE, behind his desk, taking a swig of Mylanta. His SECRETARY 
telephones.

INT. ACE'S OUTER OFFICE, SECRETARY'S DESK - DAY

We see past PAT WEBB's cowboy hat down onto Ace's SECRETARY 
on the phone.

                      SECRETARY
               (Into telephone)
          Mr Rothstein? County Commissioner 
          Pat Webb is here to see you.

                      ACE
               (Over telephone)
          Okay...

          ...give me a minute.

                      SECRETARY
               (Over telephone)
          Okay.

ACE hangs up the phone.

INT. ACE'S OUTER OFFICE, SECRETARY'S DESK - DAY

                      SECRETARY
               (To WEBB)
          It'll just be a minute.

INT. ACE'S OFFICE - DAY

ACE gets up from his desk and we see he is in his boxer 
shorts. He opens the closet and carefully puts on the trousers 
hanging inside.

INT. ACE'S OUTER OFFICE - DAY

A very patient WEBB is leaning against some double doors 
across from Ace's SECRETARY.

                      SECRETARY
          Mr Webb...  Can I get you anything?

                      WEBB
          Oh, no.
               (Cordially tipping 
               his hat.)
          No, thank you, little lady.

INT. ACE'S OFFICE - DAY

                      ACE
               (Into telephone)
          Okay, send him in and call me four 
          minutes after.

WEBB walks in. He is big, tough and western, wearing a 
Stetson, tooled boots, jeans, an elbow-patched jacket and a 
turquoise bear claw string-tie. His headband contains a 
rattlesnake head. Ace's SECRETARY shuts the door on her way 
out.

                      WEBB
          Mr Rothstein...
               (With hand outstretched 
               to ACE.)
          I'm Pat Webb.

                      ACE
          How do you do?

They shake hands.

                      WEBB
          Hey, it is my pleasure.

                      ACE
          Yeah, I heard a lot about you.

                      WEBB
          Oh, thank you, sir.

Looking out Ace's office picture window overlooking the 
sportsbook.

                      WEBB
          Hey, house is doin' well.
               (Chuckling.)
          Hey, all that money is rollin' in. I 
          appreciate you takin' the time to 
          see a poor ol' civil servant.

                      ACE
          No, that's quite all right.

TILT UP FROM WEBB'S SNAKESKIN COWBOY BOOTS AND ACE'S BLUE 
SHOES AS THEY CONTINUE TALKING.

                      ACE
          Why don't you have a seat?

                      WEBB
          Hm? Oh. Thank you, sir.

WEBB sits down in a chair in front of ACE's desk.

                      WEBB
          Uh, I come here personally to kind 
          of smooth over a fracas about a 
          certain matter. See, uh, maybe you 
          didn't know it, but, uh, Don Ward is 
          a very well-liked man in this town.  
          He's got lots of friends here. Now, 
          his family and their money go back 
          many, many years. Now, friends vote... 
          family and money votes. That's 
          important to me... and you. And if 
          you'll think about our little problem 
          along them lines...  and you forgive 
          me for sayin' it, maybe he did not 
          deserve to be fired.

                      ACE
          I'm sorry, but he knew about our 
          gettin' hit on three big machines in 
          a row and he did nothing about it.  
          That means either he was in on it 
          or, forgive me for saying this, he 
          was too dumb to see what was going 
          on. Either way, I cannot have a man 
          like that workin' here.

                      WEBB
          Before we point the dirty end of the 
          stick at 'ol Don, uh, we better be 
          sure we can prove them charges.

                      ACE
          Believe me, if I could prove it, he 
          would be under arrest.

                      WEBB
          Are, uh -
               (Clears throat.)
          - are we certain that you want the 
          Gamin' Control Board eyeballin' your 
          record and your gangster pals like 
          Nicky Santoro?

                      ACE
          I think you're way out of line talkin' 
          to me like that. What you're sayin' 
          is libelous, and you're in no position 
          to challenge my expertise. I went 
          way out of my way to be very helpful 
          and courteous to that kid. He's weak, 
          he's incompetent. He jeopardizes the 
          whole place. There's not much more I 
          can do for him.

                      WEBB
               (Chuckling)
          You have got me there. Old Don is as 
          useless as tits on a boar.
               (Chuckles.)
          But, he is my brother-in-law, and I 
          would look on it as a personal favor 
          if you'd think some more on hirin' 
          him back.

                      ACE
          I can't do that. And I appreciate 
          the fact that he's your brother-in-
          law, and I do want to help you and I 
          like to do favors, and I know who 
          you are, but I cannot do that.

                      WEBB
          Well, could there be any position... 
          further down the trough?

                      ACE
               (Pause)
          I'm sorry, I can't do anything. He's 
          too incompetent. And the bottom line 
          is, he cannot be trusted.

The telephone rings. ACE picks it up.

                      ACE
               (Into telephone)
          Okay, thanks.
               (To WEBB.)
          Um... you know, that's it. I'm sorry.

                      WEBB
          Mr Rothstein. Your people never will 
          understand the way it works out here. 
          You're all just our guests. But you 
          act like you're at home. Let me tell 
          you somethin', partner... you ain't 
          home. But that's where we're gonna 
          send you if it harelips the Governor.
               (Pause.)
          Thank you for your time.

                      ACE
          No problem.
               (Getting up and shaking 
               hands.)
          Sorry.

                      WEBB
               (Smiles slightly)
          You bet.

INT. ACE'S HOUSE, BATHROOM/BEDROOM - DAY

ACE, in pain from his ulcer, opens a bottle of pills in his 
bathroom and sees that it is almost empty.

                      ACE
          What happened to my pills?

He leaves the bathroom and walks into the bedroom where GINGER 
is stretched out on their imperial bed.

                      GINGER
          Huh?

                      ACE
               (Waving the pill bottle)
          Isn't it bad enough you're drinkin' 
          too much, you're takin' all my pills 
          too?

                      GINGER
          I didn't take your pills.

                      ACE
          Look - for my ulcer, I take a half a 
          one of these, a half a one of these.  
          And that's when I have extreme pain. 
          I had a three-month supply. What'd 
          you do with 'em?

                      GINGER
               (Sobbing)
          You didn't have to beat him up!

                      ACE
               (Walking back to the 
               bathroom)
          What?

ACE puts the bottle into the medicine cabinet.

                      GINGER
               (Sobbing)
          I was just tryin' to help him. It's 
          not like I'm sleeping with the guy!

                      ACE
          Yeah, how do I know?

                      GINGER
               (Sobbing)
          You can't make me stop caring...

                      ACE
          What? What?!

                      GINGER
          I said, you can't make me stop caring 
          about people.

She starts to cry.

                      ACE
               (Trying to calm her)
          Listen.
               (Stepping up to the 
               bed.)
          Ginger. I'm tryin' to make the best 
          of everything here, you know?  I 
          mean, you're my wife, for chrissakes. 
          Uh, I mean... people look up to you 
          in this town. I don't know what to 
          think -

                      GINGER
               (Interrupts)
          You know what, Ace? I don't give a 
          shit! I'm gettin' out of here.
               (Crying.)
          I am.

She sits up woozy, and tries to pull on her trousers.

                      ACE
               (Walking around the 
               bed to her)
          It's okay.  Look...
               (holding her face, 
               gently)
          ...you gotta get a hold of yourself.

                      GINGER
          Okay.

                      ACE
          If not for me, at least for Amy.

                      GINGER
               (Sobbing)
          Okay, okay.

                      ACE
               (Gently)
          You understand? Your drinking's 
          gettin' way out of hand. I'm gonna 
          get you into a program. They got 
          plenty of good ones.

                      GINGER
          I don't need one.

                      ACE
          Yes, you do. It's very discreet. 
          There's no names in the papers. You 
          don't have to worry about any of 
          that stuff.

                      GINGER
          That's all you care about.
               (Collapsing on the 
               edge of the bed.)
          You don't care about me at all.

                      ACE
               (Bending down to her)
          Yes, I - yes, I do.

                      GINGER
          No, you don't.

                      ACE
          How could you say that?  You're a 
          beautiful woman. You're destroying 
          yourself. You don't need that stuff. 
          You don't need that fuckin' leech 
          livin' off you. I know you better 
          than you know yourself. You're a 
          tiger, you're stronger than I am.  
          And when you set your mind on doing 
          something, you do it better than 
          anybody.
               (Strokes her hair. 
               Then, quietly:)
          You can do it.
               (Kissing her.)
          You can do it.

                      GINGER
               (Sobbing)
          Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay.  Okay... 
          I'll try. I'll try.

She sits up and puts her arms around ACE's waist. He strokes 
her head.

                      GINGER
          I'll try. I will. Don't be mad at 
          me, okay... I will.

INT. TANGIERS HARD COUNT ROOM - DAY

Move in on a door that reads: 'Notice - No Admittance - 
Caution - Hearing Protection Must Be Worn In This Area'. 
NANCE opens it with a key to reveal the hard count room. 
Coins tumble of a conveyor belt.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          No matter what the problems were 
          outside the count room, it was all 
          worth it. The cash kept rollin' in. 
          And the...

EXT. CASINO REAR LOADING PLATFORM - DAY

NANCE, dumping two large suitcases in the trunk of a car.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...suitcases kept comin' and goin'. 
          And let me tell ya, the fuckin' bottom 
          line here is... cash.

The trunk lid is shut.

INT. TANGIERS SOFT COUNT ROOM - DAY

The counters sort through a pile of cash on a table. The 
camera moves on one counter as he pockets some cash.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          The only problem was that, after a 
          while, the bosses noticed that the 
          suitcases were gettin' a little light.

FREEZE FRAME ON THE COUNTER POCKETING A $100 BILL.

INT. SAN MARINO ITALIAN GROCERY/BACK ROOM, KANSAS CITY - DAY

NANCE is seated at a table eating with FORLANO, CAPELLI, 
CAPP, BORELLI, PISCANO and GAGGI.

                      BORELLI
          Aspett'. [Italian-American slang for 
          'Wait'] Wait a minute. You mean to 
          tell me that the money we're robbing 
          is bein' robbed? That somebody's 
          robbing from us?  We go through all 
          this fuckin' trouble, and somebody's 
          robbin' us?

                      GAGGI
               (To NANCE)
          Eh?

                      NANCE
          Like I said, you know, i-it's part 
          of the business. I-it's considered 
          leakage.

                      BORELLI
          Leakage, my balls. I want the guy 
          who's robbin' us.

INT. TANGIERS HARD COUNT ROOM - DAY

NANCE enters through a door and walks past a man picking up 
a bucket of coins and dumping them into a trough. A clerk, 
seated at a coin weighing scale, places a ticket into a small 
tray. NANCE reads the printout of the machine.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Even John Nance, that's the guy who 
          ran the skim, he knew there wasn't 
          much you could do about it. You gotta 
          know that a guy who helps you steal, 
          even if you take care of him real 
          well, I mean, he's gonna steal a 
          little bit extra for himself. Makes 
          sense, don't it? Right? Well, you go 
          try and make these hard-headed old 
          greaseballs understand that.

INT. SAN MARINO ITALIAN GROCERY/BACK ROOM, KANSAS CITY - DAY

                      BORELLI
          What's the point of skimming if we're 
          being skimmed? Defeats the whole 
          purpose of what we're doin' out there.

                      GAGGI
               (To NANCE)
          Huh?

                      NANCE
          You know, they take this money because 
          they're my guys. So you gotta give 
          'em some leeway.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          But the bosses never believed in 
          leeway, so listen to what they do: 
          they...

INT. SAN MARINO ITALIAN GROCERY/BACK ROOM, KANSAS CITY - DAY

BORELLI is talking to PISCANO, his underboss.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...put Artie Piscano, the underboss 
          of KC, in charge of making sure nobody 
          skimmed the skim.

                      BORELLI
          What the hell have you been doin' 
          out there?

                      PISCANO
          I was out there with my cumma [Italian-
          American slang for 'girlfriend'.]

                      BORELLI
          Your cumma? What are you doin' with 
          your cumma?

                      PISCANO
          What else? I gave her a schaff 
          [Italian-American slang for 'tap'.]

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          The only trouble was, Piscano was a 
          disaster. This guy could fuck up a 
          cup of coffee.

                      BORELLI
          Artie, what the hell have you been 
          doin' out there, Artie?

                      PISCANO
          I'm out there more than I'm here.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          And little did anybody know where 
          this would all lead. If they did, 
          they would have been better off makin' 
          fuckin' novenas.

                      BORELLI
          You gotta go back there and talk to 
          that guy.

                      PISCANO
          Come on, go back there? I never got 
          paid my expenses for the last trip.

                      BORELLI
          What expenses?

                      PISCANO
          Well, I'm goin' all over, layin' 
          money out of my own pocket, and I 
          never get anything back. What the 
          hell's goin' on?

                      BORELLI
          You gotta go back out there.

                      PISCANO
          Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna 
          start keepin' records.

                      BORELLI
          Artie, no records, Artie. What are 
          you gonna do with records? Pay taxes?

                      PISCANO
          Well, I keep layin' out my own fuckin' 
          dough for these trips and nothin' 
          ever comes back. I mean, what hell's 
          goin' on? What are we doin' over 
          here?

                      BORELLI
          You're goin' out to Las Vegas, you're 
          havin' a good time at my expense. 
          What the fuck? I mean, after all, 
          you're the one having a good time, 
          not me.

INT. TANGIERS, GREEN'S OFFICE - DAY

GREEN is arguing with ANNA SCOTT, a fifty-year-old no-nonsense 
businesswoman.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...was gonna stop what came up next 
          at the casino.

                      GREEN
          I can't believe you're doing this.

                      SCOTT
          We made a deal. You came to me, 
          remember?

                      GREEN
          Yes, I appreciated your advice...

                      ACE (V.O.)
          It turned out Phil Green, Mr 
          Integrity, had a partner nobody knew 
          about... and when she showed up and 
          started demanding some money from 
          the Tangiers...

                      GREEN
          Why are you doing this to me?

                      SCOTT
          Because you're wrong.

                      GREEN
          I'm not wrong.

                      SCOTT
          Yes, you are.

                      GREEN
          No, I am not wrong.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...Green tried to stonewall her.

                      SCOTT
          And you're not going to get away 
          with this! I will see to it that you 
          do not get away with this!

She walks out.

          So...

INT. COURT-ROOM - DAY

A JUDGE is seated at his bench. SCOTT and GREEN, surrounded

          Thank you, Judge.

As the JUDGE pounds his gavel, we see ANNA SCOTT and a grim 
GREEN.

          Green has to open up the books... 
          has to show how he got the financing. 
          And, hey, that's - that's not good.

INT. ALL-AMERICAN GAS STATION, GAGGI'S BACK OFFICE, BACK

GAGGI, holding a cigarette, snaps his fingers in disgust, 
grunts, and slams down the phone. He men watch in silence.

          Shit.

CURLY takes the phone away.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          She was doin' pretty good with her 
          lawsuit, but before she could start 
          countin' her money, the boys back 
          home decided to settle the case out 
          of court instead.

INT. ANNA SCOTT'S HOME, KITCHEN, LAS VEGAS - DAY

SCOTT, alone, is sitting at her kitchen table.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          So, they send me.

NICKY swiftly enters the room, grabs SCOTT around the neck, 
and fires three shots into her head.

He leans SCOTT back against the chair, then gently, while 
stroking her hair, sets her head to the side. Blood flows 
from her mouth on to her pink robe.

NICKY grabs his gun and leaves.

Reporters are heard shouting 'Mr Green'.

EXT. LAS VEGAS PRIVATE AIRPORT - MORNING

GREEN gets off the Tangiers corporate jet and is assaulted 
by questions about the Scott murder. GREEN is stunned.

                      REPORTER #1
          Can you comment on the murder of 
          Anna Scott?

                      GREEN
          What are you talking about?

                      REPORTER #1 (O.S.)
          She was found last night, shot in 
          the head.

                      REPORTER #2 (O.S.)
          Was this just a real-estate 
          partnership?

                      REPORTER #3 (O.S.)
          Her lawyer said you were partners.

                      GREEN
          We were - We were involved in minor 
          real estate deals many years ago.  
          It was never a partnership.

Reporters chase CHASE as he walks down the ramp and across 
the tarmac to his white limousine.

                      REPORTER #1
          Police are calling this a mob-style 
          killing.

                      REPORTER #2
          Did you ever hear of the twenty-two-
          caliber killer?

                      GREEN
          I'm a little in shock, quite 
          frankly...

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Now, instead of the cops only lookin' 
          at Nicky, they started looking at

INT. ACE'S OFFICE - DAY

ACE is being interviewed by a female Business Week REPORTER.

desk.

          start giving interviews to make sure 
          everybody knew the casino was on the

                      REPORTER
          So, actually, how often do you really 
          fill in for him?

ACE looks at SHERBERT.

                      SHERBERT
               (to REPORTER, who 
               looks his way.)
          Green's here about two or three times 
          a month, and he's busy -
               (REPORTER glances 
               back at ACE.)
          - with other real-estate deals and - 
          and things, you know.

                      REPORTER
               (To ACE)
          So, in Green's absence, then, you're 
          the boss.

                      ACE
          I serve at the pleasure of the 
          chairman of the board and... my, uh, 
          responsibilities are to run the day-
          to-day operations.

                      REPORTER
          So, day-to-day, then, you're the 
          boss?

                      ACE
          Well, in a sense, you could say 
          that... I am the boss, when Mr Green 
          is away. You could say that.

          new hundred-million-dollar Tangiers 
          Casino empire.'
               (To DUPREY and AUSTIN)
          You believe that?

                      DUPREY
          Did he really say that?

                      WEBB
          Why, of course, he really said that. 
          It's right here. Has that man even 
          filed for his license yet?

                      AUSTIN
          I don't know. We'll have to check 
          the files.

                      WEBB
          Well, without gettin' your shorts in 
          a knot, would you do that? And kinda 
          check closely, 'cause we may have to 
          kick a kike's ass out of town.  Thank

          the Tangiers Casino?  And can the 
          integrity of state gaming laws be 
          jeopardized by a boyhood friendship?

ACE walks over to GINGER at the bar.

                      ACE
               (Quietly)
          Why don't you take it easy with that 
          stuff? Huh?  Come on. Let me help 
          you. Come on. We're talkin' about 
          some stuff.

                      NEWSCASTER
               (On television)
          State officials say 'yes' when that 
          relationship and those connections 
          are with anyone as notorious as Nicky 
          Santoro.

ACE takes GINGER's arm and leads her out of the room toward 
the stairs.

          Just go downstairs.  Just... go downst-

She struggles to break away from his firm grip, gives him a 
look and starts to walk down the stairs.

          Promise to be financially secure? 
          Money Time can help you keep those 
          promises.

ACE looks down on GINGER as she slips on the stairs.

                      CHARLIE CLARK
          You can't let this concern you, Ace. 
          Don't worry about that stuff.

Outside the glass door NICKY arrives via the stairs from the 
golf course.

                      CHARLIE CLARK (O.S.)
          It's just a political witch hunt.

ACE opens the sliding glass door and NICKY enters.

                      NICKY
          Hey, Ace.

                      ACE
          Hey.

NICKY walks over to CHARLIE CLARK.

                      ACE
          Want something to drink? Charlie you 
          want a refill?

                      CHARLIE CLARK
          Yeah, refill'd be great.

                      NICKY
               (Approaching CHARLIE)
          No, I don't want one.
               (Smiling, extends his 
               hand.)
          Hey, Mr Clark, how you doin'?

                      CHARLIE CLARK
               (Shaking hands)
          Hi. Good.

                      NICKY
               (Sitting down with 
               him on a couch)
          I've been trying to reach you.
          You're tougher to get than the 
          President.

                      CHARLIE CLARK
          Well, I've been busy.
               (Chuckles.)

                      NICKY
          Yeah, least you could do is return 
          my phone calls, though.

                      CHARLIE CLARK
          Listen... Nicky... we talked about 
          this... and, uh, I explained to you 
          that there was the possibility you 
          might have to take some kind of loss.

                      NICKY
          Yeah.
               (Pause.)
          I think I want my money back.

                      CHARLIE CLARK
               (Chuckling)
          What're you gonna do? Strong-arm me?

                      NICKY
          You know... I think that you've gotten 
          the wrong impression about me. I 
          think in all fairness, I should 
          explain to you what it is that I do. 
          For instance, tomorrow morning I'll 
          get up nice and early, take a walk 
          down over to the bank and walk in 
          and see you, and, uh... if you don't 
          have my money for me, I'll crack 
          your fuckin' head wide open in front 
          of everybody in the the bank. And 
          just about the time that I'm comin' 
          out of jail, hopefully, you'll be 
          comin' out of your coma. And guess 
          what?  I'll split your fuckin' head 
          open again. Because I'm fuckin' 
          stupid. I don't give a fuck about 
          jail.  That's my business. That's 
          what I do. And we know what you do, 
          don't we, Charlie? You fuck people 
          out of money and get away with it.

                      CHARLIE CLARK
               (As he puts a notepad 
               in his briefcase)
          You can't talk to me like...

                      NICKY
               (Grabbing CHARLIE by 
               his jacket)
          Hey, you fat Irish prick. You put my 
          fuckin' money to sleep. You go get 
          my money, or I'll put your fuckin' 
          brain to sleep.

                      CHARLIE CLARK
               (To ACE, panting)
          Sam?

                      NICKY
          Never mind fuckin' Sam. This is 
          personal.
               (Walking with CHARLIE 
               to the stairs.)
          I'll be there in the morning. You 
          can fuckin' try me, fatso.

A frightened CHARLIE hurries down the stairs.

                      NICKY
          You fuckin' try me.

He turns to ACE who's behind the bar.

                      NICKY
          You think he got the point?

                      ACE
               (Walking to NICKY)
          What're you doin'? He's a square 
          guy, for chrissakes.  You can't treat 
          him like that. He's gonna run to the 
          FBI.

                      NICKY
          Fuck the FBI! That prick's been 
          dodging me for three weeks. And what 
          is it with you?  All of a sudden, 
          you're tryin' to tell me what to do 
          all the time.

                      ACE
          I'm not tryin' to tell you what to 
          do. But you were way out of line, 
          Nick. What're you doin'? Where's 
          your head?

                      NICKY
          Where's my head? Where's your fuckin' 
          balls? Huh? You know I'm tryin' to 
          put somethin' really big together 
          out here. You know what I'm talkin' 
          about, huh? You know!  If you're 
          actin' like this now, how can I depend 
          on you?  There's a lot of things 
          gonna change out here. And if you 
          wanna be there with me, Sammy, you're 
          gonna have to go my fuckin' way.

                      ACE
          Listen, Nick, you gotta understand 
          my situation. I'm responsible for 
          thousands of people. I got a hundred 
          million a year goin' through the 
          place.  It's all over, I'm gonna 
          tell you, it's all over, if I don't 
          get that license.  And believe me, 
          if it goes bad for me, it's gonna go 
          bad for a lot of people, you 
          understand?

                      NICKY
          Yeah, forget about your fuckin' 
          license. I plant my own flag out 
          here, you ain't gonna need a fuckin' 
          license.
               (Pause.)
          You know, I don't know what it is, 
          Sammy, but the more I talk to you, 
          the more I feel like you just don't 
          wanna go along with me, is that it?

                      ACE
          No, I don't wanna come -

                      NICKY
          You should say so.

                      ACE
          I don't wanna come along with you.

                      NICKY
          Just say so.

                      ACE
          I'll be honest with you.

                      NICKY
          All right, fine.

                      ACE
          I don't wanna be involved in anything 
          you're talkin' about...

                      NICKY
          Fine.

NICKY walks to a table and flips through Business Week 
magazine.

                      ACE
          ...okay? I just wanna run a square 
          joint. That's it. I just want my 
          license. I want everything nice and 
          quiet. That's it.

                      NICKY
               (Holding up the 
               magazine)
          You mean, quiet like this: 'I'm the

                      ACE
          That's all taken out of context. 
          Okay.

                      NICKY
          Yeah, that's out of context. Okay.

                      ACE
          I have no control over that. Ronnie 
          and Billy were right there. They'll 
          tell you exactly what happened.

                      NICKY
          Well, back home they don't know about 
          fuckin' control. That looks bad.

          I lost control?

                      ACE
          Yeah.

                      NICKY
          You know, I didn't want to bring 
          this up, but you have treating a lot 
          of people with a lot of disrespect. 
          Even your own wife.

                      ACE
          My wife?

                      NICKY
          Yeah.

                      ACE
          Now, what does she have to do with 
          all this?

                      NICKY

          upset about a lot of things, 
          especially that whole fuckin' Diamond - 
          that Lester Diamond incident.

                      ACE
          All of a sudden, you're the shoulder 
          to cry on? Did you at least tell her 
          about your little role in that whole 
          situation?

                      NICKY
          No, I didn't. What good would that 
          do? That's not the fuckin' point.

                      ACE

                      NICKY
               (Interrupting)
          The point is that she's upset. She's - 
          and you got a fuckin' problem.

                      ACE
          I - I would appreciate it if you'd 
          stay out of my personal life, okay?  
          You wouldn't like it if I did it to 
          you.

          Okay?

                      NICKY
          And I - what was I supposed to do, 
          throw her out?

                      ACE
          Ju-just stay away from her. It's 
          none of your business, okay? There 
          are certain things you don't do, and

          It's none of my business?

                      NICKY
          A week ago it was my business, now 
          it's none of my business. In other 
          words, when you need me to take care

          me.

          me to vouch for you as a citizen and 
          get you out of one of your jams. I'm 
          gonna have to straighten out what 
          you just did with this guy.

NICKY starts to walk out.

                      ACE
          This guy is gonna run to the FBI.

          than your casino. That's your problem, 
          pal.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          I knew what he wanted, and I didn't 
          want any part of it.

                      NICKY
               (Walking to the glass 
               doors leaving ACE 
               standing there)
          Fuckin' walking around with a big 
          head. You better check yourself...

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Nicky wanted to take over. He wanted 
          to go after Gaggi, go after the skim, 
          go after everything and everybody.

NICKY shuts the door behind him and walks down the stairs to 
the golf course.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Plus, he had stopped askin' permission 
          from back home for every little thing.

          Nicky was questioned in two dozen

          him go. There were never any 
          witnesses.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          The coppers blamed me for everything 
          that went wrong out here, and I mean 
          every little fuckin' thing too.

                      NICKY
               (To photographer)
          Watch yourself. You're gonna get 
          runned over there.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          If a guy fuckin' tripped over a 
          fuckin' banana peel, they'd bring me 
          in for it.

                      NICKY
               (To reporters)
          Come on, huh. That's enough now. Be 
          nice, huh? Be nice.

INT. ALL-AMERICAN GAS STATION, GAGGI'S BACK OFFICE, BACK 
HOME - DAY

MARINO walks through a doorway to GAGGI's office. CURLY pats 
him on the back. He shakes BEEPER's hand, then FORLANO's, 
who is on the phone.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          And the bosses were no better. I 
          mean, they complained day and night 
          because things don't run smooth. 
          Well, in my line of work, things 
          don't run so smooth, I'm sorry. I 
          mean, I'm dealing with degenerate 
          animals out here. But the bosses, 
          what do they give a fuck? They're 
          sittin' on their asses, drinkin' 
          anisette. Meanwhile, I'm the guy in 
          the trenches. Fuckin' bosses, they 
          think it's a fuckin' free lunch out 
          here.

MARINO hands a brown-paper bag filled with $100 bills to 
GAGGI.

                      GAGGI
               (Ignoring the money)
          Frankie... they found a guy's head 
          in the desert. Do you know about 
          that?

                      MARINO
          Yeah, I heard, yeah.

                      GAGGI
          Yeah. Everybody's talkin' about it. 
          They're makin' a big deal out of it.

                      MARINO
          I know.

                      GAGGI
          It's in all the papers.

                      MARINO
          What're you gonna do?

                      GAGGI
          And I mean... that's no good.

                      MARINO
          I know.

                      GAGGI
          You gotta tell him... to take care 
          of things a little better.

                      MARINO
          I'll tell him, Remo.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Fuckin'...

EXT. VEGAS STRIP BUS STOP BENCH - DAY

NICKY is talking quietly to MARINO. They are surrounded by 
people waiting for the bus.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...bosses. I mean, they're smokin' 
          their Di Nobilis and they're eatin' 
          a trippa [Italian-American slang for 
          'tripe'.] and fuckin' suffritt', you 
          know, fried pigs guts? While, if I 
          wanna talk private, I gotta go to a 
          fuckin' bus stop.

                      NICKY
               (To MARINO)
          But, hey, what do they care, as long 
          as I keep sendin' money back.

                      MARINO
          Yeah, but they're complaining.

                      NICKY
          Let 'em complain. I'm the one who's 
          here.

The bus arrives, obscuring our view of them.

                      NICKY
          I do all the work. Somebody don't 
          like it, fuck him.

                      MARINO
          It's up to you.

                      NICKY
          They want a fuckin' war, I'm ready.

When the bus departs it reveals NICKY and MARINO alone on 
the bench, talking.

                      NICKY
          I know one thing. All I gotta do is 
          take care of four or five of those 
          fuckin' guys, the rest will fall 
          right into place. Believe me.

INT. GOLD RUSH - DAY

NICKY is watching a police surveillance car with two agents 
through binoculars.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Peekaboo, you fucks, you.

                      NICKY
          I see you, you motherfuckers.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          The problem was, Nicky was not only 
          bringin' heat on himself, but on me 
          too. The FBI watched every move he 
          made. But he didn't care. He just 
          didn't care.

THE CAMERA MOVES PAST NICKY TO REVEAL MARINO, SEATED IN FRONT 
OF TV SECURITY MONITORS ON THE PARKING AREA IN FRONT AND 
BEHIND THE GOLD RUSH.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          If they're gonna watch me, fuck 'em, 
          I'm gonna watch 'em right back. I 
          spent a few dollars. Top dollar, who 
          gives a shit?

HARDY, seated next to MARINO, is adjusting a knob on one of 
the may police radio scanners. There are a couple of cameras 
on the table next to him.

A debugging expert is going over the walls with a metal 
detector.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          I got the latest anti-buggin' 
          equipment from the same places that 
          sell to the fuckin' CIA. I had all 
          the special police frequency radios, 
          FBI descramblers, cameras that see 
          in the dark, and because of that, 
          the miserable sons-of-bitches that 
          they are, they never once caught me 
          doin' anything I couldn't handle.

DOMINICK and FUSCO are at a table arguing.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          I got my job...

EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY

NICKY swings a gold club. MARINO, and two men, are with him.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...on the line and this guy's out 
          havin' the time of his life. He has 
          every cop in the state watchin' him, 
          and he's out playin' golf.

                      NICKY
          Practice enough this week, you prick?

                      ACE (V.O.)
          And at the...

EXT. ACE'S PATIO - DAY

ACE is with the Control Board investigators AUSTIN and DUPREY. 
They are all pouring over legal files and record books out 
on a table by the swimming pool.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...worst possible time for me.

                      AUSTIN
          A record of the arrests...

                      ACE (V.O.)
          I had my license hearing coming up 
          and I didn't wanna leave anything to 
          chance.

                      ACE
          That was nineteen years ago, and 
          they were simple gambling pinches.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          I mean, if I can't work in Vegas, 
          where am I gonna go?

                      AUSTIN
          You've been very open with us. I 
          mean, uh, your books and papers and...  
          that - that's gonna mean something 
          when you go before the Commission.

                      ACE
          Well, that's all I ask, gentlemen, a 
          fair hearing.

                      DUPREY
          Well, this kind of honesty will 
          guarantee that fair hearing.

                      ACE
          Good.

                      AUSTIN
          All right, well, we'll move on to -

Suddenly a sputtering airplane flies right over Ace's house.

                      AUSTIN (O.S.)
               (As he looks at the 
               plane)
          I wanted to hear something about...  
          Kansas City.

EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY

                      NICKY
               (Looking at the 
               airplane)
          What the fuck is this? Where's this 
          fuckin' guy gonna land, on the 
          fairway?

EXT. ACE'S PATIO - DAY

ACE and the board investigators follow the plane as it lands 
on the fairway. ACE has taken off his sunglasses to get a 
better look. Two men in suits get out.

EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY

                      NICKY
               (To MARINO)
          They're fuckin' agents, Frankie. 
          Look at this.

EXT. ACE'S PATIO - DAY

The AGENTS run across the golf course, past ACE and the 
investigators, who look on open-mouthed.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          The Feds were watchin' Nicky play 
          golf for so long, they ran out of 
          gas. Just what I needed. Right in 
          front on the Control Board.

The agents run behind the hedges by ACE's pool. AUSTIN and 
DUPREY stare at ACE as if he had something to do with it.

EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY

                      NICKY
          A hundred dollars, whoever hits the 
          plane.

NICKY, MARINO, and the other men swing their clubs.

EXT. ACE'S PATIO - DAY

                      ACE (V.O.)
               (putting his sunglasses 
               back on)
          And, as if things weren't bad 
          enough...

EXT. SAN MARINO ITALIAN GROCERY, KANSAS CITY - DAY

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...in comes Piscano, the Kansas City 
          underboss. He ran that little grocery 
          store in Kansas City where they 
          brought the suitcases.

INT. SAN MARINO GROCERY, KANSAS CITY - DAY

PISCANO and his MOTHER are at the counter of his elderly 
BROTHER-IN-LAW's store.

                      PISCANO
          They're fightin' over those suitcases 
          again. You know what that means, 
          right? You know what that means, 
          right? That means I gotta take another 
          trip out to Vegas, and it's gonna 
          cost me another couple of grand.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          He ran it with his brother-in-law, 
          but mostly what he did was complain, 
          complain about his trips to Vegas, 
          to his brother-in-law and to his 
          mother, all the time.

                      BROTHER-IN-LAW
               (Seated)
          You gotta lay down the law. Otherwise 
          they're gonna make a fool out of 
          you.

                      PISCANO
          They're not gonna make a fool out of 
          me. I write it all down in this book,
               (holding up a notepad)
          every fuckin' nickel that goes down. 
          Right here, receipts...

                      PISCANO'S MOTHER
               (Chastising her son)
          Hey! Oh!

                      PISCANO
          Oh, sorry -

                      PISCANO'S MOTHER
          What's the matter with you?

                      PISCANO
          Receipts and bills and... everything's 
          here.

                      PISCANO'S MOTHER
          Since when do you talk like that?

                      PISCANO
          I'm sorry.

                      PISCANO'S MOTHER
          There's a lot of people here.

                      PISCANO
          Nance gives me trouble and I'll tell 
          him... screw around with those 
          suitcases and I'll take the eyes out 
          of his frickin' head.

                      PISCANO'S MOTHER
          Again!

                      PISCANO
          I didn't curse. I said 'frickin' 
          head'.

                      PISCANO'S MOTHER
          That's enough.

                      PISCANO
          I'm sorry.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          And what happens next?

THE CAMERA TILTS UP TO THE CEILING AIR VENT TO A TINY 
MICROPHONE AND TRANSMITTER AT ITS BASE.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          You can't believe it. I mean, who 
          the hell would believe that the FBI 
          had a wire in the place lookin' for 
          some information about some old 
          homicide about some guy who was 
          whacked-out, God knows when, over 
          God knows what?

                      PISCANO
          Plus, what's to prevent him with the 
          suitcases, that he can take what he 
          wants?  Fuckin' Nance, he brings us 
          back two suitcases from the Tangiers, 
          and what about three or four?

                      PISCANO
          We got nobody in the room to watch. 
          That's the law. You know, we can't 
          even go into the count room to watch 
          our money? Could you believe this 
          cowboy bullshit?

His MOTHER shakes her head.

                      PISCANO
          And sure he's got his people in there. 
          But how do you know? They could all 
          be in on it together, those miserable 
          fucks.

His MOTHER reacts to his language.

                      PISCANO
          I'll find out and, if it's Green 
          himself, I'll bury that bastard.

          I feel, I'll hit the two of them in 
          the head with a fuckin' shovel.

                      PISCANO'S MOTHER
          All right, take it easy now, take it 
          easy.

               (Tapping the counter)
          I know, but that's enough.

          You know - You know - You know what 
          they're doin' to me?

          I know it, I know it.

          I can't take this no more. Back and 
          forth, back and forth.

                      PISCANO'S MOTHER
          Take it easy, though.

                      PISCANO
          All right, all right. But I - I -

                      PISCANO'S MOTHER
          You'll get a heart attack like that.

                      PISCANO
          You know, I - I'm too upset right 
          now. And - An end has to be put to

Behind a window overlooking the grocery store are two FBI

INT. GAMING CONTROL BOARD HEARING ROOM, LAS VEGAS 1980 - DAY

ACE is in the court with OSCAR GOODMAN, his lawyer, facing 
the Control Board's Chairman and six COMMISSIONER MEMBERS.  
The Chairman is the SENATOR we saw earlier in the casino 
suite taking chips out of the bureau drawer. The room is jam-
packed: GREEN, GINGER, SHERBERT, as well as WEBB, reporters 
and other spectators. ACE's secretaries carry in legal papers. 
There are piles of briefs and law books on OSCAR's and ACE's 
table.

                      OSCAR
          Mr Chairman and members of the 
          Commission. Mr Rothstein is pleased 
          to be here today.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          And when the day finally came, I was 
          ready. I felt so confident that all 
          I had to do was present my case.

                      OSCAR
          ...evidence... and we have documents, 
          one of which is a report by retired 
          FBI agents, which completely absolves
               (holding up a large 
               file folder)
          Mr Rothstein from any wrongdoing. 
          I'd like this marked, please, Mr 
          Chairman.

                      SENATOR
               (Into microphone)
          Pardon me, counselor. Before you 
          continue...

                      OSCAR
          No, I want to have this marked, Mr. -

                      SENATOR
               (Into microphone)
          ...this, uh, this Commission is 
          prepared to act on a motion denying 
          the Rothstein application.

                      OSCAR
          Denying?

                      SENATOR
               (Into microphone)
          Do I hear a motion seconded?

                      OSCAR
          Mr. Chairman -

                      CONTROL BOARD MEMBER #1
               (Into microphone)
          Mr. Chairman, I second the motion.

                      SENATOR
               (Into microphone)
          Do I have a vote on the motion?

                      OSCAR
          Mr. Chairman -

The COMMISSIONERS quickly repeat:

                      CONTROL BOARD MEMBER #2
               (Into microphone)
          Aye.

                      CONTROL BOARD MEMBER #3

          Aye.

                      SENATOR
               (Into microphone)
          The ayes have it. This hearing is 
          adjourned.

The CHAIRMAN bangs his gavel and prepares to leave. The 
COMMISSIONERS hurriedly pack up their papers. An enraged ACE 
rises and approaches the SENATOR.  TV CAMERAS ROLL.

                      ACE
               (Getting up)
          You guys have to be kidding.

The SENATOR picks up his briefcase.

                      ACE
          Adjourned! What do you mean, 
          adjourned?

                      OSCAR
          Mr. Chairman, please.

                      ACE
          Mr. Chairman...

The SENATOR picks up his folder.

                      ACE
          Senator, you promised me a hearing.

We see WEBB seated in the first row, watching.

                      ACE
          You won't allow me a hearing? You 
          didn't even look at the FBI reports.

A reporter holds a microphone up to the SENATOR.

                      ACE
          When you were my guest, Mr. Chairman, 
          Senator, at the Tangiers Hotel, did 
          you not promise me that I would have 
          a fair hearing -

The SENATOR bends down to a microphone.

                      SENATOR
               (Interrupting, into 
               microphone)
          I was never - I was never your guest 
          at the Tangiers.

          You were never my guest?!

                      SENATOR

          That's right.

                      ACE
          I never comped you?! I don't comp 
          you at least two or three times a 
          month at the Tangiers?!

                      SENATOR
               (Into microphone)
          Uh, I - I'd... I'd like to answer - 
          answer that at this time.

          Liar.

                      SENATOR
               (Into microphone)
          Mr Rothstein is being very typical 
          to this point.

                      ACE
          He's lying.

WEBB starts to leave.

                      SENATOR
          The only time I was at the Tangiers 
          was when I had dinner with Barney 
          Greenstein.

                      ACE
          Was I at that dinner? Just tell me -

                      SENATOR
          You were wandering around.

          You were in the m- You were in the 
          building.

                      ACE
          I was in the building!

GREEN, embarrassed by ACE's behaviour, starts to get up.

                      ACE
          You know damn well I was at that 
          dinner, and you swore to me that I 
          would have a fair hearing at that 
          dinner! Did you not?! Did you not?!
               (Pause, ACE looks at 
               OSCAR.)
          Well, tell me I was at least at the 
          dinner! A-allow me that much.
               (Pause.)
          Give me that much at least!

                      SENATOR
               (Hesitates)
          Yes, you were.

The SENATOR starts to walk out.

          There was nothing to it.

INT. TANGIERS, GREEN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

GREEN and ARTHUR CAPP are solemnly watching another episode 
of Ace's TV show with an elderly juggler guest.

                      GREEN
          Ace, don't do it.

ACE begins to juggle.

                      GREEN
          Oh, no, no. No, no. Oh, Jesus... 
          he's juggling!

The audience cheers him on.

          Let's not take County Commissioner 
          Pat Webb too seriously.

INT. TANGIERS SPORTSBOOK/ACES HIGH - NIGHT

WE MOVE PAST TWO TELEVISION CAMERAS TO ACE BEHIND HIS DESK 
AT ANOTHER TAPING OF HIS SHOW. TRUDY IS AT HIS SIDE.

                      ACE
               (Into microphone)
          I recently challenged him to a debate 
          on this program and he declined. 
          What are you worried about, Pat?  
          You don't have to send me any 
          questions. You can ask me anything 
          you want.

                      STONE (O.S.)

          He's on all night, screamin' about 
          how he's gonna take his damn lawsuit 
          all the way to the Supreme Court. He 
          really must be crazy. He's gonna go 
          to Washington with this? 
               (Chuckles.)
          He's out of his fuckin' mind.

          Andy, go see him. Tell him maybe 
          it's time he should quit.

EXT. MIGHTY MART CONVENIENCE STORE, REAR PARKING LOT, LAS 
VEGAS - NIGHT

SHERBERT and ACE pull up beside another parked car. ACE gets 
out of his car in a robe and pajamas and gets into STONE's 
car.

INT. STONE'S CAR - NIGHT

                      ACE
          First of all, what they did was 
          totally unconstitutional. We're 
          already on the list to be heard before 
          the Supreme Court of the United States 
          later this year.

                      STONE
          These guys back home don't give a 
          fuck about the Supreme Court and any 
          of this bullshit! They want things 
          to quiet down. They want you to walk 
          away from -

                      ACE
          Walk away? Andy, you can't be serious. 
          How can I walk away? Don't you see 
          what's goin' on here? Don't you see 
          what's at stake?

                      STONE
          The old man said, 'Maybe your friend 
          should give in.'  And when the old 
          man says 'maybe', that's like a papal 
          bull. Not only should you quit, you 
          should run!

                      ACE
          Know what my problem is? Every time 
          they mention my name in the papers, 
          these cocksuckers, they mention Nicky, 
          too. How the fuck does that help?  I 
          mean, the heat he brought down is 
          murder!  We had a police department 
          who was cooperative. He's pissed 
          them off so much now that nobody can 
          make a move anymore. I mean, what do 
          you do about that?

                      STONE
          What do you propose?

                      ACE
          I don't know, he doesn't listen to 
          me. Maybe he should...  get lost for 
          a while. Take a vacation. Would that 
          be so bad?

                      STONE
          They ain't sendin' Nicky nowhere.

                      ACE
          All right, look, if he took a break, 
          it would just give everybody some 
          time to maneuver. That's all I'm 
          saying. It's all that I'm saying.

                      STONE
          I would forget about the maneuver. I 
          would just get out.

                      ACE
               (Sighs)
          I can't do that.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...as soon as Andy got back home, 
          Nicky heard about our talk in the

                      ACE (V.O.)
          But just getting a call from Nicky 
          wasn't easy anymore. Even the codes 
          didn't work. So, we figured out 
          another act.

INT. FBI STAKEOUT POST, MOTEL ACROSS THE FROM THE GOLD RUSH - 
DAY

Through a windows of a motel room across the street from The 
Gold Rush, an FBI AGENT watches NICKY and MARINO exit the 
jewelry store, get into a parked car and rive away.

IRIS OUT.

                      FBI AGENT (O.S.)
               (Into a radio)
          Okay, he, uh, he's out. It's the 
          ant, uh, Brown unit. And he's with, 
          uh, bogie. I think it's Frankie.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Nicky started out before me because 
          it wasn't that easy...

SWISH PAN TO THE FBI AGENT LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW TALKING 
INTO A RADIO.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...for him to get around anymore.

                      FBI AGENT

          Okay, pulled out...

SWISH PAN TO NICKY AND MARINO DRIVING DOWN THE STREET.

                      FBI AGENT (O.S.)
               (Into radio)
          ...pretty fast. He's headed upstream.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Nicky couldn't even go for a ride 
          without changing...

SWISH PAN TO FBI CAR TRAILING BEHIND.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...cars at least six times before he 
          could shake all his tails.

INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE #1 - DAY

NICKY's car with MARINO driving pulls in; NICKY jumps out 
and gets in another car.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          And because of all the planes, he 
          had to use underground garages.

MARINO drives off.

EXT. DESERT SCENE - DAY

A solitary ACE waiting in the vast desert, looking around. 
ACE looks at a sage brush and sand and a few rocks on the 
desert floor. This could be a hole meant for him. He steps 
away from it.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Meeting in the middle of the desert 
          always made me nervous.

It's a scary place. I knew about the holes in the desert, of 
course, and everywhere I looked, there could have been a 
hole.

EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY

Aerial shot of NICKY driving.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Normally, my prospects of comin' 
          back alive from a meeting with Nicky 
          were ninety-nine out of a hundred.  
          But this time, when I heard him say, 
          'A couple a hundred yards down the 
          road', I gave myself fifty-fifty.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

ACE still standing in the desert. NICKY's car suddenly appears 
as a reflection in ACE's sunglasses, shaking ACE out of his 
desert-induced reverie. NICKY's car pulls up by ACE. He gets 
out and storms up to him.

                      NICKY
          Where the fuck you get off talkin' 
          to people about me behind my back?  
          Goin' over my head?

                      ACE
          What people?

                      NICKY
          What people! What'd you think, I 
          wasn't gonna find out?

                      ACE
          I don't even know what you're talkin' 
          about, Nick.

                      NICKY
          No? You said I'm bringin' heat on 
          you?! I gotta listen to people because 
          of your fuckin' shit?! You're ordering 
          me out?! You better get your own 
          fuckin' army, pal!

                      ACE
          I didn't do anything. I mean, I didn't 
          order you or anybody...  I only told 
          Andy Stone that you had a lot of 
          heat on you, and that was a problem.

                      NICKY
          You want me to get out of my own 
          fuckin' town?!

                      ACE
          Yeah, I said I - let the bullshit 
          blow over for a while so I can run 
          the casino. Anything goes wrong with 
          the casino, it's my ass. It's not 
          yours, it's my ass.

                      NICKY
          Oh, I don't know whether you know 
          this or not, but you only have your 
          fuckin' casino because I made that 
          possible!

          I'm what counts out here! Not your 
          fuckin' country clubs or your fuckin' 
          TV shows! And what the fuck are you 
          doin' on TV anyhow?!

                      ACE
          What are you -

                      NICKY
               (Interrupting)
          You know I get calls from back home 
          every fuckin' day?!  They think you 
          went batshit!

                      ACE
          I'm only on TV because I gotta be 
          able to hang around the casino. You 
          understand that. You know that. Come 
          on.

                      NICKY
          Your fuckin' ass! You could have had 
          the food and beverage job without 
          goin' on television!  You wanted to 
          go on TV.

                      ACE
          Yeah, I did want to go on TV. That 
          way I have a forum. I can fight back.  
          I'm known. People see me. They know 
          they can't fuck around with me like 
          they could if I was an unknown. That's 
          right.

                      NICKY
          You're makin' a big fuckin' spectacle 
          of yourself.

                      ACE
          Me?! I wouldn't even be in this 
          situation if it wasn't for you. You 
          brought down so much fuckin' heat on 
          me. I mean, every time I meet somebody 
          here, the big question is do I know 
          you.

                      NICKY
          Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your 
          fuckin' license on me, is that it?

                      ACE
          No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked 
          me if you could come out here, what 
          did I tell you? I mean, you asked 
          me, and I knew you were going to 
          come out no matter what I said, but 
          what did I tell you? Do you remember 
          what I told...

          wiseguy - a drunken bum] around'll 
          take a piece of your fuckin' Jew 
          ass! Then where you gonna go?!  You're 
          fuckin' warned! Don't ever go over 
          my fuckin' head again! You 
          motherfucker, you!

NICKY drives off, leaving an angry and frustrated ACE to 
ponder the desert and the holes.

INT. JUBILATION NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

Overhead of ACE, OSCAR, SHERBERT, TRUDY and showgirls walking 
down the zebra pattern carpet of the nightclub. They are 
escorted to their table.

NICKY, MARINO and DOMINICK are seated at another table in 
the rear of the club so no one can hear their conversation.

                      MARINO
          Well, we got company.

ACE avoids looking at NICKY.

                      NICKY
          Do you see that? Dumb Jew 
          motherfucker. Grew up together and 
          he's actin' like he don't even know 
          me. I know we're supposed to avoid 
          each other, but, you know, there's 
          ways to do things and there's ways 
          not to.

                      DOMINICK
          Yeah. Fuck him.

SHERBERT and the others make a toast.

                      SHERBERT
          To Abraham Lincoln.

                      ACE
          L'chaim. [Yiddish for 'to life']

                      SHERBERT
          Here we go. Good luck.

NICKY watches ACE's entourage.

                      DOMINICK
          Forget about it, Nick. Don't let it 
          bother you.

                      NICKY
          Why, does it look like it's bothering 
          me? What do I give a fuck?  Fuckin' 
          Oscar too. All the fuckin' money 
          I've given that prick, he don't even 
          look over here. What's his problem?

                      MARINO
          Mm.

                      NICKY
          Fuckin' Jews stick together, don't 
          they?

                      MARINO
          They're havin' a good time too.

                      NICKY
          So are we.

NICKY, MARINO and DOMINICK are isolated and alone at their 
table.

INT. ACE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

ACE sleeping. A hot line to the casino rings as a red light 
blinks.

                      ACE
               (Into telephone)
          Yeah?

INT. TANGIERS CASINO SPORTSBOOK - NIGHT

SHERBERT is calling ACE.

                      SHERBERT

          Sam, we got a problem.

                      SHERBERT
               (Over telephone)
          The little guy. He's half in the 
          bag, and nobody told him he was eighty-
          sixed from the joint, so we...

          ...all turned our heads and made out 
          like we didn't know who he was. He's 
          over at the twenty-one table with 
          his...

INT. TANGIERS BLACKJACK TABLE - NIGHT

NICKY is betting every spot on the blackjack table. MARINO 
is standing behind him. The DEALER is nervous.

                      SHERBERT
          ...nose wide open. He took the money 
          out of his own kick. His nose is 
          open for about ten thousand.

SHERBERT and the pit boss look on.

                      SHERBERT (O.S.)
          Now, he's really pissed.

INT. ACE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

                      ACE
               (Into telephone)
          Oh, no.

Sits up and throws off the bed covers.

INT. TANGIERS SPORTSBOOK - NIGHT

                      SHERBERT
               (Into telephone)
          He wants a fifty-thousand marker.

INT. ACE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

                      ACE
               (Into telephone)
          No, just - just give him, give him 
          ten. That's it. Ten.  I'll be right 
          down.

INT. TANGIERS BLACKJACK TABLE - NIGHT

                      SHERBERT
               (To NICKY)
          He's gonna come up with ten thousand, 
          just the way you wanted.

                      NICKY
          Ten thou? No, no, no.

                      SHERBERT
          ...give you ten thousand -

                      NICKY
               (Grabbing SHERBERT's 
               lapel)
          Fifty! I said fifty!

                      SHERBERT
          Look, take -

                      NICKY
               (Pushing him away and 
               walking back to the 
               blackjack table)
          Fuckin' fifty thousand!  Go get it. 
          I don't give a fuck where you get 
          it.
               (To FEMALE DEALER.)
          Fuckers!  They take it, but they 
          don't want to give it back.

NICKY turns up another bad card and looks at the dealer. She 
smiles as she slides the house winnings over to her side of 
the table.

                      NICKY
          How the fuck can you grin? How the 
          fuck could you grin?

The FEMALE DEALER looks to her PIT BOSS for help. He steps 
up to a MALE DEALER at a neighboring table.

                      NICKY
          You know how much I'm stuck? You 
          give a fuck?

The MALE DEALER walks up to the FEMALE DEALER and taps her 
on the shoulder.

                      NICKY
          Do ya?!

She lays down some cards, claps her hands to show the Eye-in-
the-Sky that they are empty, and exits.

                      NICKY
               (To departing FEMALE 
               DEALER)
          Yeah. Give yourself a hand right 
          across your fuckin' mouth.

The MALE DEALER takes her place behind the table.

                      NICKY
          Look at this fuckin' beaut they put 
          in now. Sherbert send you in here to 
          rob me now? Been fuckin' knockin' 
          everybody's dick in all night? Huh?  
          You been beatin' all the customers 
          tonight, motherfucker?

We see the PIT BOSS lock up the chip tray from the table the 
dealer has just left. NICKY has a diminished stack of chips 
and an upturned ten and a two.

                      NICKY
          Huh, jag-off? Hit me.

The card is a king or a 'paint', a picture card, meaning 
that NICKY has lost.

Everyone freezes in fear. NICKY takes the paint and flicks 
it at the DEALER's chest where it sticks to his shirt.)

                      NICKY
          Take this stiff and pound it up your 
          fuckin' ass! Hit me again.

The DEALER looks to the PIT BOSS who nods 'okay'. He turns 
over a card. It's another paint, a queen. NICKY flicks the 
card to the DEALER's face.

                      NICKY
          Take this one and stick it up your 
          sister's ass! Hit me again.

The DEALER looks to the PIT BOSS again.

                      NICKY
          That's it, keep lookin' at him, you 
          fuckin' dummy. If you had any fuckin' 
          heart at all, you'd be out fuckin' 
          stealin' for a livin'.
               (Tossing the card at 
               the DEALER.)
          Hit me again.

The DEALER looks at the PIT BOSS.

                      NICKY
          What the fuck you keep lookin' at 
          him for, huh, you fuckin' pu-

The DEALER deals him another paint.

                      NICKY
          Look at this, twenty fuckin' paints 
          in a row. Hit me again!

ACE enters the casino with SHERBERT.

                      MARINO
               (To NICKY)
          He's here.

                      NICKY
               (To the DEALER)
          You should pay as fast as you collect, 
          you know.

NICKY gets up to go over to ACE, glowering at SHERBERT as he 
walks past.

ACE and NICKY are partially hidden behind a pillar by the 
slot-machines.

                      ACE
          What are you doin'? You gotta get 
          out of here!

                      NICKY
          Hey, Sammy, tell this Jew motherfucker 
          over here to pay that marker.

                      ACE
          Nicky, Nicky, you're not listenin' 
          to me. I'm here to help you. What's 
          the matter with you?  You're gonna 
          bury us both.

                      NICKY
          Just give me the money. Fuckin' give 
          me the fuckin' money, Sammy.

                      ACE
          I'm gonna okay you ten and get you 
          even, and that's it. Then you got to 
          get out of here before the cops and 
          the newspapers are all over you.

To the PIT BOSS, holding up ten fingers.

                      ACE
          Ten and that's it.

He makes a throat cutting gesture with his hand. ACE leaves. 
NICKY turns to walk back to the table. He sees SHERBERT 
standing right behind him.

                      NICKY
          What are you starin' at, you bald-
          headed Jew prick?!

Before SHERBERT can answer, NICKY grabs the receiver off a 
wall phone and hits him across the face and back. SHERBERT 
falls to the floor. NICKY pulls the cradle off the pillar 
and tosses it down on his back. He and MARINO walk back to 
the table, SHERBERT winces on the floor in shock.

                      NICKY
          Sue me, you Jew fuck!

                      MARINO
          Let's get out of here.

                      NICKY
          What? Get out of here? I got a marker 
          comin'.

He puts some chips down on the table.

                      NICKY
               (To DEALER)
          Deal.

INT. OSCAR, THE LAWYER'S OFFICE - DAY

ACE and GINGER are seated across from OSCAR, their lawyer.

                      OSCAR
          I know, but everything's changed 
          now. You're talking about a divorce.  
          You're even asking for alimony 
          payments and... child support... and 
          now custody.

                      GINGER
          I just want what any divorced woman 
          would get.

                      ACE
          I mean she's only sober about two 
          hours a day. It's usually from eleven 
          in the morning until one in the 
          afternoon. And if I gave her her 
          money and her jewels now, you know 
          what she's gonna do? She's gonna 
          piss it all away in about a year, 
          and then where will she be?
               (To GINGER.)
          Where would you be then? Comin' right 
          back to me, right back to me.
               (To OSCAR.)
          Or finding some other excuse to come 
          and I - I -

                      GINGER
               (To ACE)
          We had a deal. Remember that?
               (To OSCAR.)
          He said if it didn't work out between 
          us, that I could get my things and I 
          could leave.

                      ACE
               (To GINGER, leaning 
               closer to her)
          Look in my eyes. Look in my eyes.

GINGER turns to him.

                      ACE
          You know me. Do you see anything in 
          these eyes that makes you think I 
          would ever let someone in your 
          condition take my child away from 
          me?
               (Pause.)
          Do you?  You know that won't happen.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          And after all this time... and as 
          hard as I tried, as much as I 
          wanted...

INT. ACES HIGH BACKSTAGE CORRIDOR/SHOWGIRLS' DRESSING-ROOM - 
DAY

ACE, with Kleenex sticking out of his collar to protect his 
shirt from his television make-up, walks back to the dressing 
room with TRUDY. She pecks his cheek before exiting to her 
own room. A security guard opens the door for ACE.

We follow him past numerous showgirls and costumes.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...I could never reach her. I could 
          never make her love me. I always 
          felt she should have gone for all 
          that money... being somebody for the 
          first time in her life, a home and a 
          kid. But that's not what happened. 
          It just didn't work out that way.

                      ACE
               (To the showgirls)
          Everything all right?

                      ACE
          I mean, what could we do? After a 
          while, we'd just take breathers from 
          each other. You know, little 
          separations. At that time, I remember 
          Ginger took Amy and went to Beverly 
          Hills. She was gonna spend a week or 
          so shopping.

ACE picks up the phone at a make-up table.

          know, assure her that she's gonna be 
          all right, she'll come back.

          He got his twenty-five.

EXT. LAS VEGAS PRIVATE AIRPORT - NIGHT

ACE sees GINGER and AMY coming off the Tangiers private jet. 
GINGER wobbles a little as she comes down the ramp.

                      GINGER
               (Waving brightly)
          Hi, Sam.

ACE picks AMY up and hugs her, ignoring GINGER. They walk to 
the car and drive off.

INT. ACE'S CAR - NIGHT

AMY looks on from the back seat.

                      ACE
          So, what'd ya do with it?

                      GINGER
          With what?

                      ACE
          With the money.

                      GINGER
          He needed some clothes.

                      ACE
               (Sighs)
          Twenty-five thousand for clothes.

                      GINGER
          He wanted a watch, too.

                      ACE
          Twenty-five thousand for clothes and 
          a watch.

                      GINGER
          Mm-hm.

                      ACE
          Mm-hm.

                      MAITRE D' (O.S.)
               (From following scene)
          Mr. R...

INT. VEGAS RESTAURANT - NIGHT

ACE and GINGER, dressed for dinner just like any other couple, 
walk towards a table overlooking the colorful lights of 
downtown Vegas.

                      MAITRE D'
          ...good evening. Signora.

                      GINGER
          Gino.

                      MAITRE D'
          This way.

                      ACE (V.O.)
               (as they are led to 
               their table)
          The good part was, I had Amy back. 
          So, we went home, had the housekeeper 
          stay over, put the kid to bed, I 
          calmed myself down and we went to 
          dinner. I tried to keep things nice 
          and civil, you know.  But... hey, 
          twenty-five thousand for three suits? 
          That doesn't make much sense.

                      ACE
               (Seated across from 
               GINGER at a booth)
          First of all, he's not gonna wear f- 
          thousand-dollar suits. But let's say 
          he did, which he won't. How you gonna 
          get fitted for twenty-five suits in 
          three days?  I, um, I mean, how could 
          you get fitted that fast? I can't 
          get fitted that fast, and I pay twice 
          as much.

                      GINGER
          I bought him a watch too.

                      ACE
          Yeah.

                      GINGER
          Yeah.

                      ACE
          But even if you bought him a watch, 
          a really nice watch, one that he 
          thought was nice - and he doesn't 
          know what the fuck a good watch is - 
          so, you go, five, ten, twelve grand?

                      GINGER
          Yeah.

                      ACE
          At the most, which is impossible for 
          him.

She glances to the table behind them.

                      ACE
          Plus, at the most, three suits, a 
          thousand apiece. That still leaves 
          what?  Around ten thousand?

                      GINGER
               (Staring down at her 
               plate, trying to 
               restrain herself)
          Would you knock it off, Sam?

                      ACE
          I'm just tryin' to figure it out.

                      GINGER
          There's nothin' to figure out. I'm 
          home... we're workin' it out.

She lights a cigarette.

                      ACE
          Yeah, but I've been told that before, 
          'We're workin' it out.' You think 
          that you're home... after what you 
          just put me through with Amy, is a 
          favor to me?

She looks at ACE.

                      ACE
               (Pause)
          So, counting the watch, let's say 
          another four thousand for expenses 
          over the weekend... of which you 
          must have had a good time. I know he 
          did.  That's for sure. I know that... 
          fuckin' piece of shit had a good 
          fuckin' time. On my money. You might 
          as well have fucked him, which you 
          probably did anyway.

GINGER glares at him.

                      ACE
          You're lookin' at me a certain way. 
          You - you're teary-eyed, huh? You're 
          upset. You're a good actress, you 
          know that?  Good fuckin' actress. 
          You can fuckin' get that pity out of 
          people. I'm not a john, you 
          understand?  You always thought I 
          was, but I'm not. And I'm not a 
          sucker. That fuckin' pimp cocksucker. 
          He's lucky I didn't kill him last 
          time. Lucky he's fuckin' livin'.  
          And if you would've stayed with Amy... 
          and you would've ran away... you 
          would've been fuckin' dead.

GINGER scoots out of the booth and leaves.

                      ACE
          Both of you. Dead. Dead.

INT. ACE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Wide overhead of ACE alone in bed. Off-screen, we hear GINGER, 
a little drunk, on the phone.

                      GINGER (O.S.)
               (Whispering into 
               telephone)
          I cannot do it anymore. I can't 
          fuckin' live like this. It's not 
          right.

ACE's point of view as he moves towards the sound of GINGER's 
voice. He enters frame and stops to listen.

                      GINGER (O.S.)
          What are you? Yes, of course - He 
          doesn't come home at night.  What is 
          the big fuckin' deal? I go - Yes, 
          and I just - I can't fuckin' take 
          it. Why should I fucking take it? 
          That wasn't the deal. He acts like...  
          like I'm the only one around here 
          with a fuckin' past. He'll never let 
          me live it down.  Well... well, I 
          mean, I tried. What the fuck do you 
          think I came back here for? No, I'm 
          not!

ACE slips into the foyer where he can see GINGER's reflection 
in a glass door as she talks on the phone in the living-room.

                      GINGER
               (Whispering into 
               telephone)
          I want to have him killed. Yes, I 
          want him killed.  I've fuckin' had 
          it.

INT. ACE'S HOUSE, LIVING-ROOM - NIGHT

GINGER is on the phone.

                      GINGER
               (Into telephone)
          So, are you with me on this?

ACE steps up behind her. She gasps, still holding the phone.  
Petrified.

                      ACE
          You want to get rid of me? Here I 
          am. Go ahead, get rid of me
               (ACE grabs the phone.)
          Hello.

He hears nothing and throws the phone down near her.

GINGER rises and attacks ACE.

                      GINGER
               (Grunting)
          Yes! I fuckin' hate you! I can't 
          take it anymore!

ACE grapples with GINGER.

                      GINGER
          Yes, I want to kill you! I hate your 
          fuckin' guts!

                      ACE
          You hate my guts? I want you to come 
          with me now.

He drags her by her arms across the living-room hallway, 
into the bedroom.

                      GINGER
          Get off of me! Stop it!

                      ACE
          Come with me now! Come with me now. 
          Come with me now. I want you out of 
          here.

GINGER screams.

INT. ACE'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - NIGHT

                      ACE
          I want you out of here! I want you 
          out of here!

                      GINGER
               (Starting to get up)
          Let go of me! Let go of me!

INT. ACE'S HOUSE, BEDROOM CLOSET - NIGHT

He pushes her against the closet wall, and throws an overnight 
bag at her.

                      ACE
          Take your
               (kicking the bag)
          fuckin' bag and get out of here!

                      GINGER
          I'll go, but I want my money right 
          now!

ACE tosses clothes at her.

                      ACE
          You'll get your money! Don't worry.

GINGER squats down and starts to gather her stuff.

                      GINGER
          The arrangement is over!

                      ACE
               (Tossing clothes)
          No kidding. NO KIDDING!

                      GINGER
          And I still get my money. I need 
          some cash right now. You can't just 
          put me in the street.

                      ACE
          I'll get your cash. You haven't been 
          straight with me ever since I met 
          you! You never loved me in the first 
          place!  I need eyes in the back of 
          my fuckin' head with you, you fuckin' 
          bitch!

ACE walks past her to his side of the large walk-in closet. 
Racks and racks of her clothes are still hanging.

                      GINGER
          Love you?!

She tosses a pair of red shoes at him.

                      GINGER
          How could I love you?! How can I 
          love you?! You treat me like I'm 
          your fucking dog!

ACE leans down and opens a shoe box filled with money. He 
grabs as much cash as he can hold.

                      ACE
          You're lower than a dog!

                      GINGER
          Fuck you!

He walks up to her.

                      ACE
               (Shoving the bundles 
               of cash in her face)
          Here. Here. Is this enough money?! 
          Huh?  Will it last you two fuckin' 
          days? Take it, greedy bitch.
               (Stuffing the money 
               in her bag.)
          Take the fuckin' money you fuckin' 
          want.

                      GINGER
          I'm going to the bank and I'm getting 
          my jewelry too!

She puts on a white fur coat.

                      ACE
          Yeah, no kidding. Good! It opens at 
          9 a.m. Be there!

                      GINGER
          And don't send your guys down there 
          to stop me! I mean it.

She bends down to pick up her bag, but ACE insists on carrying 
it.

                      ACE
          I guarantee you, I will not stop 
          you.

INT. ACE'S HOUSE, BEDROOM/FOYER - NIGHT

GINGER and ACE walk through their bedroom to the front door. 
He's carrying her suitcase.

                      GINGER
          Stop! You aren't getting rid of me 
          with one fuckin' suitcase!

                      ACE
          You'll come back tomorrow and get 
          the rest. Just get out of here.

                      GINGER
          Fine.
               (Sniffs, walking back.)
          I'm takin' Amy.

                      ACE
               (Stopping her)
          You're not takin' Amy.

                      GINGER
          I am. I'm wakin' her up right now.

                      ACE
          You're stoned. You're a junkie. Get 
          out of here.

He opens the door and tosses her suitcase out.

                      GINGER
          I am not! She's my daughter too! 
          Goddamn you!

                      ACE
          Get out of here!

He shoves her out the door.

                      ACE
          Send my lawyers a letter.
               (Slamming the door 
               behind her.)
          God-fuckin'-damn you!

He locks the door, and peers through the peep-hole.

                      GINGER (O.S.)
               (Through the doors as 
               ACE walks away)
          You're not getting away with this! 
          You're not gonna fuck me out of my 
          end!

EXT. ACE'S HOUSE, FRONT YARD - NIGHT

GINGER is furious. She picks up the suitcase and walks up to 
her sportscar.

                      GINGER
          Fucker!
               (Sobs.)

She drives off.

INT. ACE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT, LATER

ACE is lying awake in bed smoking a cigarette, watching the 
casino's Eye in the Sky surveillance monitors. He hears a 
car turn into his driveway. He sees the car's headlight beams

                      ACE (V.O.)
          The funny thing was, that after all 
          that... I didn't want her to go. She 
          was the mother of my kid. I loved 
          her. And later... I realized I didn't 
          want to give her the money, because 
          if I did... I knew I'd never see her 
          again.

ACE reaches over to take GINGER's hand - she slowly takes 
hold of his.

INT. ACE'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY

GINGER is getting AMY ready for school. ACE enters as AMY is 
on her way out. He holds her face in his hands and kisses 
her.

                      ACE
               (Affectionately)
          Oh. Have a good day at school.

                      AMY
          Okay.

Amy exits.

                      ACE
          Okay? Okay, angel.

ACE walks over to GINGER who turns sullenly to look at him.

                      ACE
               (Clears throat.)
          From now on, I have to know where 
          you and Amy are at all times.

He takes a beeper out of his coat pocket and holds it up to 
GINGER.

                      ACE
               (Gently)
          Now, here's a beeper. I want you to 
          keep it on you. It's very light.  So 
          I can call you whenever I have to.

GINGER reluctantly takes the beeper.

                      ACE
               (Pause.)
          Okay?

She nods silently. He looks at her and turns, leaving her 
alone in the kitchen.

EXT. CONSTRUCTION TRAILER - EVENING

A very large trailer is in the middle of an empty construction 
site. GINGER's and NICKY's cars are parked outside.

                      NICKY (O.S.)
               (From trailer)
          Well, what are you supposed to do? I 
          mean, what do you want to do?  Do 
          you want to stay the way you are? 
          You want to stay like this?  You 
          can't do that.

INT. CONSTRUCTION TRAILER - EVENING

GINGER and NICKY are alone in the large trailer. They are 
sitting close together on a couch.

                      NICKY
          I mean, listen, two people don't get 
          along, at some point you gotta call 
          it... I mean, it's none of my 
          business, but I ... I think that's 
          what you gotta do. You gotta take it 
          somewhere -

                      GINGER
               (Smoking a cigarette)
          Oh, you're right, I know.  It's... 
          well, I was just -

                      NICKY
          What? What?

                      GINGER
          Nothin'.

                      NICKY
          What were you gonna say? Go ahead.

                      GINGER
          I don't -
               (Sighs.)

                      NICKY
          Tell me what you were gonna say. Go 
          ahead.

                      GINGER
          Yeah?

                      NICKY
          Yeah.

                      GINGER
          Well, I was thinkin', maybe... you 
          know somebody at the bank...  could 
          help me get my jewelry out?  There's 
          a lot of money in there. Lot of money 
          in there, and I'd be willing to take 
          care of anybody who helped me out.

                      NICKY
               (Pauses)
          Let me think about that.

                      GINGER
          Okay.

                      NICKY
          See who I got in there. Gotta get 
          somebody I can trust.

                      GINGER
          Mm-hm.

                      NICKY
          You know?

                      GINGER
          Yeah. 'Cause, you know,
               (leaning her head 
               back)
          He's never gonna give me my jewelry.

                      NICKY
          Hm.

                      GINGER
          He holds that key so tight, he's 
          probably got it stuck up his ass.

                      NICKY
               (Chuckles)
          Yeah, right. That's Sammy. And he's 
          probably got it there too.

Takes a sip of his drink.

                      GINGER
          He's so fuckin' lucky. I could have 
          buried him. I could have gone to 
          Europe and taken the baby. And then 
          he'd've tracked me down and he'd've 
          killed me.

                      NICKY
          No, he wouldn't. I would have.
               (GINGER chuckles.)
          And he'd've been right, too. I mean, 
          seriously.
               (She cuddles closer 
               to him.)
          Well, there's one thing you don't 
          do. You don't take a guy's kid and 
          then take off.

                      GINGER
               (Quietly)
          I didn't.
               (Chuckles.)
          I didn't. I mean, I did, but then I 
          did exactly what you told me to do, 
          and I came right back.

                      NICKY
          You did. You're right.

                      GINGER
          Exactly.

NICKY embraces her.

                      NICKY
          You did. I like that. I like that. 
          That's what I like about you. You 
          did the right thing.

                      GINGER
               (Playing with his 
               jacket)
          I did what you told me to.

                      NICKY
          Yes, you did.

                      GINGER
          'Cause you always tell me the right 
          thing to do.

                      NICKY
          Yeah.
               (Pause, with his arm 
               around her.)
          Boy, he really fucked himself up out 
          here -
               (She caresses his 
               face.)
          - didn't he?

                      GINGER
          Sure did.

                      NICKY
          Everything went to his head.
               (He sighs, rubbing 
               her neck.)

                      NICKY/GINGER
               (In unison)
          Changed.

                      NICKY
          He did. He ain't the same person, 
          right?

                      GINGER
               (Whispering)
          No, he's not.

                      NICKY
          He really thinks who the fuck he is, 
          I'll tell you that.

                      GINGER
               (Holding back tears)
          Exactly.
               (Sighs.)
          He hates me.

She rests her head on NICKY's shoulder, starting to weep.

                      GINGER
          He hates my fuckin' guts.

                      NICKY
          Come on, come on, you're a toughie. 
          You can take this.
               (Runs his hand down 
               her cheek.)
          Don't cry.

                      GINGER
               (Crying)
          I'm not as tough as you think I am.

                      NICKY
          Yes, you are.

                      GINGER
               (Sobbing)
          I'm not and he scares the shit out 
          of me. I never know what he's gonna 
          do.

                      NICKY
               (Whispering)
          Come on. Don't be scared.

                      GINGER
               (Softly, through tears)
          I need some help. I do. I need some 
          help.
               (Strokes his chest.)
          You gotta help me. I need a new 
          sponsor, Nicky.

GINGER's sobs subside a little and her hand starts to stroke 
NICKY's neck.

                      GINGER
               (Whispering)
          I do. I need a new sponsor.

                      NICKY
               (Quietly, cheek to 
               cheek)
          Is that what you want?

                      GINGER
          Yeah.

                      NICKY
          A sponsor.

                      GINGER
          Yeah.

                      NICKY
          Mm... okay. Don't worry about it. 
          Nobody'll fuck with ya anymore.  
          I'll take care of ya.

                      GINGER
               (Whispering)
          Nicky, please...

                      NICKY
          Yes, I will. It's what you want, 
          isn't it? Huh?

                      GINGER
               (Sobbing)
          Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

                      NICKY
          It's what you want?

                      GINGER
          Yeah. Uh-huh -

NICKY interrupts and kisses her. She kisses him back. He 
pushes her head down to his lap.

EXT. CONSTRUCTION TRAILER - NIGHT

NICKY opens the door to the trailer and peers out to make 
sure no one is watching.

EXT. FBI SURVEILLANCE CAMPER - NIGHT

We see past a chain-link fence to a camper. We hear the sound 
of photos being taken with a high-speed camera.

EXT. CONSTRUCTION TRAILER - NIGHT

We see GINGER and NICKY slip out of the trailer in the 
deserted work site.

                      FBI AGENT #1 (O.S.)
          You see that?

EXT. FBI SURVEILLANCE CAMPER - NIGHT

FBI MEN with long-lens cameras are recording the event on 
film.

                      FBI AGENT #1
          That's Ace's wife.

INT. ACE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

ACE is waiting for GINGER. He hears a car pull into the drive-
way, he gets up and looks out the sliding glass door. It's 
GINGER. He sits back down, motionless with a glass of milk. 
She walks in with a sack of groceries and some dry cleaning.

                      GINGER
          Hi.

She puts her purse and the groceries down on the kitchen 
counter, and hangs up the dry cleaning.

                      ACE
          Hi. You didn't answer your beeper.

                      GINGER
          I threw it away.

                      ACE
          You threw it away?

                      GINGER
               (As she puts some 
               items away)
          Look, I tried to do this thing. I 
          know that you want me to, but it's 
          just - You know, I'm driving down 
          the freeway and the fuckin' thing's 
          'beep-beep-beep-beep'. You know, I'm 
          in a restaurant and it's - it's 
          embarrassing. I don't want to do it 
          anymore.
               (Stopping suddenly.)
          Where's Amy?

                      ACE
          I put her to bed.

                      GINGER
          Oh.
               (Walking away towards 
               their bedroom.)
          I got your cigarettes.

INT. ACE'S HOUSE, BATHROOM - NIGHT

GINGER sets some items down on her dressing-table, in front 
of a mirror.

                      GINGER
          Oscar wants you to call him.

                      ACE
          So, who'd you go to lunch with?

                      GINGER
          With Jennifer.

                      ACE
          And where'd you go?

                      GINGER
          To the Riviera.

                      ACE
               (Pause)
          What'd you have?

                      GINGER
          I had a... salad.

                      ACE
          What did Jennifer have?

                      GINGER
               (Turning to ACE)
          She had the same.

                      ACE
               (Pause)
          Okay. I want you to call Jennifer 
          and I want you to tell her to tell 
          you what she had for lunch, and I'm 
          gonna listen in on the other line.

                      GINGER
          Why do you want to do that?

                      ACE
          You know why I want to do it. Just 
          do it.

                      GINGER
          Fine.
               (Walking out and down 
               the hall.)
          Just gonna get the bowl for my thing.

                      ACE
          Mm.

INT. ACE'S HOUSE, LIVING-ROOM - NIGHT

GINGER is on the hall phone, dialing. We hear a phone ring 
through the earpiece.

She waits a few seconds and hangs up.

                      GINGER
          The line's busy. There's nobody there.

She starts to walk away. ACE stops her, picks up the phone 
and dials. We hear JENNIFER answer.

                      JENNIFER
               (Over telephone)
          Hello.

                      ACE
               (Into telephone)
          Hello, Jennifer, it's Sam -

TIGHT ON GINGER'S FINGERS CUTTING OFF THE CALL.

                      GINGER
          All right... I didn't have lunch 
          with Jennifer.

                      ACE
               (Hanging up)
          Who were you with?

                      GINGER
               (Quietly)
          I was with somebody.

                      ACE
          I know you were with somebody. Who 
          was it?
               (Pause.)
          I just hope it's not someone who I 
          think it might be.
               (Sighs, then whispers:)
          I just hope it's not them.

                      ACE (V.O.)
               (Quietly)
          I knew she fucked around.
               (Sighing.)
          You know...

INT. ACE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

The two of them are seated separately. GINGER is on the floor 
leaning against a chair, crying softly.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...she did what she did and I did 
          what I had to do. But, Jesus, Nicky 
          was the worst thing she could've 
          done.

                      ACE
          What if he won't stop?

                      ACE (V.O.)
          I mean, it could get us both killed.

                      GINGER
          I can back him off.

ACE sighs.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          She was very convincing...

EXT. LA CONCHA MOTEL - DAY

A neon signs reads: LA CONCHA MOTEL.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...when she wanted to be.

WE SEE A CANTED ANGLE OF A ROOM AND BALCONY WITH DRAWN 
CURTAINS.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          And... this... this is how she backed 
          him off.

INT. LA CONCHA MOTEL - DAY

GINGER and NICKY are making love on the bed, panting, grunting 
and gasping.

INT. LA CONCHA MOTEL - DAY

They have finished making love. NICKY is zipping up his pants. 
GINGER still sits on the bed smoking a cigarette.

                      NICKY
          Hey, Ginger... don't forget, if you're 
          challenged, you know, if he asks 
          anything, deny everything.
               (He walks up to her.)
          Do you understand? I don't want him 
          bringin' beefs back home ... 'cause 
          that could be a problem. You gotta 
          be careful. He's not dumb, you know? 
          You hear what I'm sayin', right?

Her arm and thigh are bruised.

                      GINGER
          I know. You don't have to tell me 
          that. What do you think, 
               (chuckling)
          I'm stupid?

She takes a drag off her cigarette.

                      NICKY
          Do I think you're stupid? No, I think 
          you're beautiful.
               (He bends down and 
               kisses her.)
          But I gotta go.

He exits.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          By this...

EXT. ALL-AMERICAN GAS STATION, BACK HOME - DAY

A car moves into the station and stops at a gas pump.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...time, Nicky had things so fucked 
          up on the streets, that every time 
          Marino went back home, the...

INT. ALL-AMERICAN GAS STATION, OFFICE AND GARAGE - DAY

Slow motion of MARINO walking through the front office past 
a few men. He tosses his cigarette butt and puts it out with 
his shoe. He looks nervous.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...packages got smaller and smaller. 
          It got...

INT. ALL-AMERICAN GAS STATION, GAGGI'S BACK OFFICE - DAY

MARINO takes a small stack of cash out of his coat. A seated 
GAGGI nods for one of his men to take the money.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...to the point when he walked into 
          the place... he didn't know whether 
          he was gonna be kissed or killed.

GAGGI's man takes the money.

                      GAGGI (O.S.)
          Frankie, I want to ask you something.

                      GAGGI
          It's private... but I want you to 
          tell me the truth.

                      MARINO
          Of course, Remo.

                      GAGGI
          I want you to tell me the truth, 
          mind you.

                      MARINO
          I always tell you the truth, Remo.

                      GAGGI
          Frankie... the little guy, he wouldn't 
          be fuckin' the Jew's wife, would he? 
          Because if he is... it's a problem.

FREEZE FRAME OF MARINO.

                      MARINO (V.O.)
          What could I say? I knew if I gave 
          the wrong answer, I mean, Nicky, 
          Ginger, Ace, all of 'em could've 
          would up gettin' killed.

FREEZE FRAME OF GAGGI.

                      MARINO (V.O.)
          Because there's one thing about these 
          old timers: They don't like any 
          fuckin' around with the other guy's 
          wives. It's bad for business.

ON MARINO'S FREEZE FRAME.

                      MARINO (V.O.)
          So, I lied... even though I knew 
          that by lyin' to Gaggi, I could wind 
          up gettin' killed too.

UNFREEZE - LIVE ACTION CONTINUES.

                      MARINO
               (To GAGGI)
          No. I ain't see anything like that.

                      GAGGI
          Are you sure?

                      MARINO
          I'm positive.  Remo... things are 
          very fucked up down there, you know?

                      GAGGI
          Yeah, I know. That's why I'm asking. 
          You see, my main concern is Nicky.

                      MARINO
          Hm.

                      GAGGI
          I want to know... if he's doin' all 
          right. If he's okay.

                      MARINO
          He's good. He's fine.

                      GAGGI
          I'm askin' you, Frankie, to keep an 
          eye on Nicky. Do it for me.

                      MARINO
          No problem.

                      GAGGI
          You see... I wouldn't want to be 
          jeopardizing anything for people who 
          are our friends. You understand?

                      MARINO
          I understand.

                      GAGGI
          Okay.
               (Pause.)
          Frankie, you're a good boy.

Pats MARINO's hand.

                      MARINO
          Thanks, Remo.

GAGGI drinks from his espresso cup. So does MARINO, looking 
over cautiously at the old man.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          By now, Nicky and his crew had already 
          hit rock bottom. I mean, Vegas really 
          got to him.

EXT. BAR PARKING LOT, LAS VEGAS - NIGHT

NICKY is punching a man who is leaning against a car. They 
are surrounded by MARINO, FUSCO, BLUE and HARDY. The man 
remains erect.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          The booze, the coke, the broads... I 
          mean, he got sloppy.  He just wasn't 
          the same Nicky anymore.

DOMINICK takes over. Exhausted, NICKY walks to his car and 
leans on the open car door.

                      MARINO
               (To NICKY)
          You must have drunk too much.

                      NICKY
          Go fuck yourself.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          I heard one night he had to belt a 
          guy three times before he finally 
          went down.

DOMINICK finally knocks the man down.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          In the old days, Nicky would've decked 
          him with one shot.

INT. ROOM - NIGHT

EXTREME CLOSE-UP OF A CAMERA FOLLOWING A LINE OF COCAINE AS 
IT IS SUCKED UP INTO A STRAW.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          You add this into the mix...

EXTREME CLOSE-UP LOOKING THROUGH THE STRAW AS THE COKE IS 
SNIFFED.

Maybe Vegas just got . . .

EXT. BAR PARKING LOT - NIGHT

NICKY and his crew get into their cars.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...to all of us. And his crew followed 
          him right over the edge.

The man is left alone on the ground of the dingy parking 
lot.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          They were all tuned up half the time 
          on coke. I mean, they started doin'...

EXT. BERNIE BLUE'S HOUSE, RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

BLUE gets out of his car with an aluminium foil package to 
confront the police.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...stupid things.

                      COP #1
          Watch it, partner, watch it!

                      ACE (V.O.)
          The worst was Blue.

                      BLUE
               (Belligerent)
          Hey, what do you guys want out of my 
          life, huh?

                      COP #1
          Police! Stay in the fuckin' car!

                      ACE (V.O.)
          He never knew when to keep his fuckin' 
          mouth shut.

                      COP #2
          He has a gun!

                      COP #1
          Drop your gun or I'll -!

                      BLUE
          Hey, fuck you!

                      COP #1
          Drop the gun!

BLUE is shot several times by both COPS. He falls on the 
ground, dead.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          The cops shot him. They shot Blue...

FLASHBACK - A LITTLE EARLIER

BLUE is yelling back at the COPS, holding the foil package.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...because they thought his hero 
          sandwich was a gun!

Freeze frame as the camera moves in on the wrapped sandwich 
in his hand.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          You know, they could have...

The COPS walk up to BLUE, who is on the ground amid shattered 
glass.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...been right, but who knows?

                      COP #1
          Jesus Christ! What gun? He's got a 
          fuckin' hero sandwich here.

                      COP #2
          What do you want? It - It's pitch-
          black out here. It's tin foil.

                      COP #1
          Pitch-black?! It -

                      COP #2
          It looked like a fuckin' gun!

                      COP #1
          You - You fuckin' moron, I'll be 
          filling out paper work for the next 
          two months because of you and this 
          piece of shit, you...

                      COP #2
          Oh my God, what are we gonna do? I'm 
          sorry.

                      COP #1
          ...fuckin' jerk-off.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          And to make matters worse, to get 
          even, Nicky's crew got stoned one 
          night and they started shootin' up 
          the cops' houses.

COP #1 plants a gun on the ground next to BLUE's legs using 
a handkerchief to avoid leaving fingerprints.

EXT. DETECTIVE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The house explodes as gunfire riddles the front of a 
detective's home. MARINO, DOMINICK, FUSCO, HARDY and three 
HOODS in another car are spraying the home with machine-guns 
and shotguns.

EXT. GOLD RUSH - DAY

NICKY and MARINO emerge from the shop.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          I mean, it got to the point where 
          they couldn't even talk in the Gold 
          Rush anymore because the Feds put a 
          wire in the wall.

EXT. FBI STAKEOUT POST: MOTEL ACROSS FROM THE GOLD RUSH - 
DAY

Two FBI AGENTS with binoculars are watching NICKY and MARINO, 
trying to read their lips.)

                      ACE (V.O.)
          And even when they talked outside, 
          they had to cover their mouths 
          because...

                      LIP-READER
               (Lowering his 
               binoculars)
          Jeez, he's coverin' up again.

He raises the binoculars and looks through again.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...the Feds brought in lip-readers.

EXT. GOLD RUSH - DAY

NICKY and MARINO are outside talking. They are covering their 
mouths with their hands and constantly looking around.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Nicky found out about it from a teller 
          who owed him money.  This guy 
          worked...

Voice-over trails off.

                      MARINO
          He asked me again about you and the 
          Jew's wife.

                      NICKY
          Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say?

                      MARINO
          He asked me again about you and the 
          Jew's wife.

                      NICKY
          Yeah, what'd you tell him?

                      MARINO
          I told him I didn't know nothin'. 
          But Jiggs and, uh, Tony Gorilla said 
          if you did anything, you're fucked 
          up.

                      NICKY
          You think he's goin' home, makin' a 
          beef behind my back?

                      MARINO
          Nah. You would've heard somethin'.

                      NICKY
          Yeah, what's to stop him?

                      MARINO
          I know. I know.

                      NICKY
          I don't trust him anymore. But they'd 
          never okay anything, you know?

                      MARINO
          Yeah, but they keep askin' about it.

                      NICKY
          Well, now, sure they're askin'. They 
          earn with the prick. I got a funny 
          feelin' he's gonna start a fuckin' 
          war or somethin'.
               (Pause)
          I'm not sure yet, you know. But I w- 
          You know, but you know what I want 
          you to do?

                      MARINO
          What?

NICKY looks suspiciously at a man walking by them.

                      NICKY
          Who's this guy? Who's this guy?

                      MARINO
          Oh, he ain't nobody.

                      NICKY
          You know what I want you to do? Get 
          a couple of guys to dig a hole in 
          the desert, then let 'em show you 
          where it's at.

                      MARINO
          Angelo and Buster.

                      NICKY
          Yeah, but I'm not sure yet.

                      MARINO
          They'll do it.

                      NICKY
          And when I'm ready, I'll say the 
          words, 'Go see the Jew.'

                      MARINO
          Yeah.

                      NICKY
          And you make it disappear, you know 
          what I mean?

                      MARINO
          Yeah, just let me know. But you gotta 
          be ready. You know what I'm talkin' 
          about?

                      NICKY
          Did I say to do anything yet? I said 
          I'm not sure... I'll let you know. I 
          want to think about it. Where're 
          these pricks at?

Looks for the FBI AGENTS.

                      MARINO
          Don't know.

                      NICKY
          Dominick said they're in the motel?

                      MARINO
          Yeah, either that or in the fuckin' 
          bank. I don't know. They're all over 
          the joint.

He walks over to RUDY, the maitre d'.

                      ACE
          Rudy, any calls for me, just give 
          'em to Mr Sherbert. I'll be right

                      ACE
          I'm going home for a few seconds. 
          I'll be right back.

ACE hurries out. RUDY picks up the phone and dials a number.

                      RUDY

                      NICKY
          Yeah? All right.

out of a Martini.

INT. ACE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

ACE gets home and can't find GINGER.

                      ACE

          Hello? Hello! Ginger.

               (Faintly, from her 
               bedroom)
          Help, Daddy!

Fear strikes him and he runs to his daughter's room.

                      ACE
               (Knocking, turning 
               the doorknob)
          Amy! Amy, open the door!

                      AMY (O.S.)
               (From her room)
          I can't! I'm tied!

ACE slams his shoulder against the door, trying to knock it 
down.

INT. ACE'S HOUSE, AMY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

ACE forces it open and sees that AMY's arms have been tied 
to her bed with stockings. AMY screams.

                      AMY
          Dad!

                      ACE
          What happened? What happened? Who 
          did this to you?

                      AMY
          Mommy.

                      ACE
          I'm gonna get a knife and cut you 
          loose, honey, I'll -

                      AMY
               (Panting)
          Oh, no, please, please.

She tries to keep him from leaving her.

                      ACE
               (Bending down, kisses 
               her)
          Okay, I'll be right back.

ACE cuts AMY loose with a knife.

                      ACE
          When did this happen, honey?

                      AMY
          I don't know.

She gets up and hugs her father.

                      ACE
          You don't know? What time did your 
          mother do this? When did she leave?

                      AMY
          I don't know.

                      ACE
               (Comforting AMY as

High angle past the restaurant's neon sign to ACE's car 
screeching to a halt by the main entrance. He storms in.

INT. LEANING TOWER - NIGHT

ACE is stopped by NICKY in the foyer.

                      NICKY
               (Trying to calm him)
          Ace don't... listen, don't... don't

                      NICKY
          She didn't know who to turn to.
               (Raising his hand 
               almost in a plea.)
          She... she didn't know where to turn. 
          She was tryin' to save your marriage.

                      ACE
          Yeah? Nicky, I want to talk to that

          Hey, be fuckin' nice. Calm. Be nice. 
          Don't fuck up in here.

ACE pauses for a beat, realizing that NICKY is standing in 
his way and could be dangerous. ACE gives him a wide berth.

We follow ACE through the crowd to GINGER, seated in a booth. 
He sits down angrily across from her.)

          It's just for a little while, Sam. 
          The baby-sitter wasn't there.

GINGER darts a look to NICKY who is at the bar, watching 
anxiously. He gestures with his head for her to leave.

          Right now. Get up and -

ACE notices her look at NICKY but when he turns to see what 
she's looking at, he just misses NICKY's gesture. ACE grabs 
GINGER by her collar.

GINGER gets up and leans in to shout at ACE.

          I'm going. I'm going, you -!

She grabs her purse and leaves. Patrons stare as ACE follows 
her out.

GINGER follows ACE through the door. As soon as she closes 
the door behind her, ACE turns to face her.

          Now you need approval from him to go

          Oh, fuck you! Fuck you, Sam Rothstein!

A furious GINGER turns around and storms out, slamming the 
door.

          Where is he? Goddamn it! I want that 
          Jew bastard killed! I have fuckin'

NICKY walks in from the restaurant.

          Hide her car in the back!

He pulls her by her arm to a storage room upstairs.

                      GINGER
          There's no reason to hide my car. He 
          already knows!

          He threw it in my face! The second I

          goes back home and makes a fuckin' 
          beef?  I gotta know exactly what you 
          said. Tell me what you said to him.

                      GINGER
          Me? I said... nothin'. I said, I 
          said, 'No, no, no.' Everything he 
          said, I just kept sayin' no.

                      NICKY
          I told you this was fuckin' dangerous. 
          Remember I said, 'Ginger, this is a 
          dangerous situation. Be very careful.' 
          You fuckin' yessed me to death.

                      GINGER
          If it's so fuckin' dangerous, then 
          why don't you kill him?

                      NICKY
          I'm not gonna kill him. Shut the 
          fuck up. What, do you know what you're 
          talkin' about? I'm not killing anyb-

          Oh, well, then, have him killed and 
          get it over with.

          it.

                      GINGER
          What about my money?

                      NICKY
               (Raising his voice 
               even more)
          How the fuck am I gonna get your 
          fuckin' money now? You think he's 
          gonna give you fuckin' money? Are 
          you out of your mind?!  Look what

               (Grappling with her)
          What? Hey! Hey! What the fuck are 
          you... ?

NICKY slaps her roughly across the face, grabs the back her 
jacket and forcefully leads her to a stairway.

                      GINGER
          Ah, you fuck! You're such a fuckin' 
          asshole!

                      NICKY
          Get the fuck out of here. Get out! 
          Get the fuck out!

Shoves her down the stairs. GINGER yells and gasps on her 
way down.

                      MARINO (O.S.)
          (From bottom of stairway)
          Whoa. Calm down.

                      NICKY

          Get out. Get out! Get out!

                      MARINO (O.S.)
          Take it easy!

                      NICKY
          Why'd I get involved with this fuckin' 
          nut in the first place? Get out!

                      MARINO
          You're gonna fuckin' kill her. Take 
          it easy.

                      NICKY
               (Pushing a sobbing 
               GINGER out the back 
               door)
          Get her the fuck out of here. Get 
          her out of here.

EXT. LEANING TOWER, BACK DOOR/REAR PARKING LOT - NIGHT

MARINO throws GINGER out the back door. She falls on her 
side, crying.

                      NICKY
          Get the fuck out of here.

                      GINGER
               (Sobbing, getting up)
          I don't need you! I have my own 
          fuckin' money!

                      NICKY
          All right, all right.

She stumbles to her car.

                      GINGER
          I'm going' to the FBI! I'm not scared 
          anymore!

                      NICKY
          All right. Be careful.

                      GINGER
          You fucked with me for the last time!

                      NICKY
          Okay, yeah.

INT. LEANING TOWER, BACK DOOR - NIGHT

NICKY and MARINO are seated at the back door watching GINGER 
screech out of the parking lot.

                      NICKY
          Be careful.
               (To MARINO.)
          Hey, come on. Get inside.

They turn and walk back inside. MARINO leans on a wall next 
to the kitchen.

NICKY has scratches on his hand and face.

                      NICKY
          Can you fuckin' believe that?
               (Showing MARINO his 
               scratches.)
          Look at this motherfucker.

NICKY sits on the bottom step across from MARINO, who sighs. 
Cooks mill around in the background.

                      NICKY
          I fucked up, Frankie. I fucked up 
          good this time. Should have never 
          started with this fuckin' broad.

                      MARINO
          Take it easy. What could you do? I 
          mean, she threw herself at you, right?

                      NICKY
          I'm in a bad fuckin' spot here. You 
          know that? Bad fuckin' spot.

He puts his head in his hands.

We see SHERBERT approach the sliding glass door holding a

from him.

EXT. ACE'S HOUSE, LIVING-ROOM - NIGHT

Through the sliding patio doors, we see ACE and SHERBERT 
making sure all the doors are locked and the lights are turned

          I already left the kid with neighbors 
          and I had about a million in cash 
          and jewels that I gave to Sherbert 
          to lock up in the hotel.

                      ACE (O.S.)
               (From following scene)
          Put this in the...

INT. ACE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

ACE leads SHERBERT to the front door as he stuffs a shoebox 
filled with cash and jewels in a bag and hands it over to 
him.

                      ACE
          ...hotel safe, then I want you to 
          come right back. 

ACE shuts the down behind him and switches off a light. The 
room goes black.

EXT. ACE'S HOUSE - MORNING

A crisp, sunny morning. SHERBERT's car is parked on the street 
in front of the house.

INT. ACE'S HOUSE, UPSTAIRS DEN - MORNING

An exhausted ACE, in his robe, and SHERBERT are seated across 
from each other at the bar with the shotgun displayed 
prominently on the counter between them.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET, ACE'S HOUSE - MORNING

Camera pans with GINGER's car as it approaches the driveway 
and crashes into the back of ACE's parked car.

INT. ACE'S HOUSE, UPSTAIRS DEN - MORNING

ACE and SHERBERT react to the noise. SHERBERT grabs the 
shotgun. ACE looks out the window at GINGER ramming her car 
into his.

                      ACE
          She, she's alone. Just go. Take the 
          gun and go into Amy's.

                      GINGER (O.S.)
               (Screaming)
          You get down here!

                      ACE
               (To SHERBERT as he 
               walks around the bar 
               with the gun)
          Just wait there for me!

                      GINGER
               (From driveway)
          Get down here and talk to me, goddamn 
          it! Don't fuckin' ignore me! You 
          motherfucker!

SHERBERT exits. ACE runs over to the stairs and starts down 
them.

EXT. ACE'S HOUSE - MORNING

GINGER repeatedly smashes into ACE's car.

                      GINGER
               (From her car)
          I mean it!

ACE emerges from the front door, taking cover behind a brick 
column.

                      GINGER
          You come down here right now! Come 
          down here and talk to me, goddamn 
          it! Fuck you! Goddamn you, come out 
          here!  I'm gonna drive this fucking 
          car through the living-room!

She starts to drive it across the lawn. ACE darts back towards 
the front door. GINGER's car stops in front of the porch.

                      GINGER
               (Getting out of the 
               car to confront ACE)
          You fucking coward! You motherfucker!

She slips and falls on the lawn.

                      GINGER
          You come out here and talk to me, 
          you fucker!

                      ACE
               (From the porch)
          Will you stop it? You're drunk, you're 
          on drugs. You're gonna -

                      GINGER
          I am not!

                      ACE
               (Pointing to her)
          You're gonna be sorry if you don't 
          stop that.

                      GINGER
          Don't you threaten me!

                      ACE
          You'll wake the whole neighborhood!

                      GINGER
               (Kicking the hedges)
          Don't you threaten me!

EXT. NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE ACROSS THE STREET - MORNING

A female neighbor walks out of her house. A man from the 
house next door does the same. We see AMY watching from the 
neighbor's window.

                      GINGER (O.S.)
          You are not threatening me anymore!

                      ACE (O.S.)
          I'm not -

EXT. ACE'S HOUSE - MORNING

GINGER is bending down, breaking off branches from some plants 
and throwing them at ACE.

                      GINGER
          You fuck! You fuck! I'm sick of you!

ACE flinches as a handful of leaves hits his face.

                      GINGER
          I am fuckin' Nicky Santoro! I am! 
          He's my new sponsor!

ACE gestures towards the neighbors who are watching. A squad 
car pulls into the driveway.

                      GINGER
               (To ACE)
          What about that, you fuckhead?!
               (To neighbors.)
          What are you looking at? Fuck off!

Two COPS walk up the driveway towards GINGER.

                      COP #1
          Hey!

                      COP #2

          business!
               (To ACE.)
          I don't have to take your shit all 
          the time anymore.

An FBI AGENT is parked down the block, photographing the

          We've got some complaints about - 
          about the noise.

          I'm just trying to get in my house!

                      COP #1
          I understand.

                      GINGER
          He won't let me go in my house!

                      ACE
          I won't let her in. I'm sorry, Randy, 
          I'm not gonna let her in. She - Well, 
          I'm not gonna let her in, the way 
          she's behaving. I'm - I'm -

                      GINGER
          Not gonna let me in?

          Who knows what you're gonna do in 
          there? I don't want you -

                      GINGER
          What do you mean, what am I gonna 
          do? I'm in the same clothes for two 
          days! I want to get a few of my 
          things! Big deal!

                      COP #1
          All right. Okay, okay.

                      COP #2
          Mr Rothstein, why don't we just let 
          her in the house and get a few of 
          her things?  That way she'll get out 
          of here. This is half her house 
          anyway.

                      ACE
          I'm afraid to let her in the house.

                      GINGER
          Oh, you are...

                      ACE
          I'm afraid she's gonna destroy stuff.

               (Kicking, pulling up 
               plants and throwing 
               them at ACE)
          Let me in the house! Fucker!

COP #1 holds her back.

          Fucker!

                      COP #1
          Please.

                      ACE
          Should I let her in like - ?

                      GINGER
          You ought to be afraid, the way you 
          fuckin' treat me!

                      COP #1
          Hey, Mr Rothstein, it'll make it a 
          lot easier on everybody here if we 
          just let her in the house.

                      COP #2
          If we let her get a few of her things 
          we'll be out of your hair.

                      ACE
          If she calms down, I will let her in 
          the house.

GINGER walks towards the front door.

          We can do that. Absolutely. Yes. 
          Absolutely.

INT. ACE'S HOUSE, UPSTAIRS DEN - MORNING

GINGER races up the stairs, trailed by COP #2.

          ...most of my important stuff, all 
          my papers and things. And I have to 
          get 'em.

She walks across the room to ACE's desk.

                      GINGER
          So don't let him come in here 'cause 
          I know they're in here in the desk 
          and he's -

She tries to open the middle drawer but it's locked.

          Fuck!
               (Going through a couple 
               of drawers.)
          Just pay attention. He could come up 
          here at any time.
               (Pants.)

She spots a pair of scissors on the desk. She tries to open 
the drawer with them.

                      GINGER
               (Then, to COP #2)
          Are you watching for him?

She finally pries the drawer open, breaking the tip of the 
scissors.  GINGER's hands open the drawer and she picks up 
the safe deposit keys.

          Got 'em.

                      COP #1
          No, it's - it'll just be a couple of 
          minutes. We got other things to do

INT. ACE'S HOUSE, BEDROOM CLOSET - MORNING

GINGER runs into the closet, bending down to search through 
the shoe boxes that usually contain money but are now empty.

               a pair of ACE's shoes

               a fur coat off a 
               hangar. Then, grunting)
          Really pisses me off...

          I'd like to help...

INT. ACE'S HOUSE, UPSTAIRS DEN - MORNING

                      CHARLIE CLARK
               (Over telephone)
          ...but I can't.

                      ACE
               (Into telephone)
          Legally, she can't take that stuff. 
          Legally, she can't take the stuff.

                      CHARLIE CLARK
               (Over telephone)
          No, Ace.

                      ACE
               (Into telephone)
          Half of everything is mine.

                      CHARLIE CLARK
               (Over telephone)
          Ace, listen to me.

                      ACE
               (Into telephone)
          Half - I'm comin' down.
               (He hangs up.)

EXT. ACE'S HOUSE, DRIVEWAY - MORNING

ACE and SHERBERT get into ACE's damaged car. A metal strip 
dangling from SHERBERT's door scrapes the pavement as they 
pull out.

INT. VEGAS BANK - DAY

GINGER opens the safe deposit box, which is filled with bound 
stacks of cash.

She grabs handfuls in a frenzy, some fall off the counter to 
the floor.

                      GINGER
          Shit! Oh, goddamn it!

GINGER gets down on the floor to pick them up.

                      GINGER
               (Then, to COPS who 
               are watching)
          Um, I'm gonna need a bag. If you 
          could just ask the guy for a big 
          bag, okay?

                      COP #1
               (To COP #2)
          Go get a bag, man.

                      GINGER
               (Looking up, offering 
               COP #1 some cash)
          And here. Here.

                      COP #1
          Lady, I can't. I can't. I ca-

COP #2 exits.

                      GINGER
          No, you can, you can.
               (Sobbing.)
          You've been so nice to me.

                      COP #1
               (Taking the money)
          I can't.

INT. VEGAS BANK - MORNING, A LITTLE LATER

COP #2 holds open a large canvas bag for GINGER.

                      COP #2
               (To GINGER)
          Like this?

                      GINGER
               (Struggling with two 
               handfuls of cash)
          Yeah, just hold the top open, all 
          right, and I can -

She starts to stuff the money in the bag.

EXT. FBI SURVEILLANCE CAR, ACROSS THE STREET - MORNING

The FBI AGENTS photograph GINGER leaving the bank.

EXT. VEGAS BANK - DAY

GINGER throws the canvas bag into the trunk of her car when, 
suddenly, she sees ACE's beat-up Cadillac approaching. She 
gasps.

                      GINGER
          Oh, God. It's him.
               (To COPS.)
          You have to stop him. You have to - 
          'Cause he said he was going to kill 
          me.

ACE jumps out of his car and runs toward GINGER, SHERBERT 
follows him out.

ACE is intercepted by the COPS who hold him back.

                      GINGER
          You just - Just stop him.

                      COP #1
          Mr Ro- Mr Roth- Mr Rothstein, where 
          you goin' -

                      ACE
          Stop -

                      COP #1
          Wait, hold on a second.

                      ACE
          Hey!

                      COP #1
          Hold on a second.

The COPS huddle around ACE and SHERBERT until GINGER's car 
pulls out of the bank.

                      COP #1
          Nothin' we can do about it. Nothin' 
          we can do. There's nothin' we can 
          do.

ACE, unable to pursue, watches GINGER speed away.

                      ACE
          Look, look. You can't stop her for 
          speeding? I mean, look what the hell 
          she's doing.

                      COP #1
          Speeding?

                      COP #2
          We're talkin' to you right now.

GINGER's car disappears into traffic. The FBI car across the 
street follows right behind her.

                      COP #2
          There's nothing we can do. She had 
          the key.

                      COP #1
          She's on the account. There's nothing 
          we can do.

EXT. FBI SURVEILLANCE CAR - MORNING

The AGENTS are following GINGER.

                      FBI AGENT #1
          Let's pull her over at that Citgo 
          Station.

                      FBI AGENT #2
               (Driving)
          Okay, let's do it.

FBI AGENT #1 puts a siren on top of the car's roof.

EXT. VEGAS STREET, CITGO STATION - MORNING

GINGER pulls over at a gas station, the FBI car with siren 
blaring right behind her.

EXT. VEGAS BANK - MORNING

A powerless ACE and SHERBERT are still standing in front of 
the bank with the COPS. COP #2 gives ACE a 'sorry' gesture.

EXT. CITGO STATION - MORNING

GINGER and the FBI AGENTS are standing by her car. She is 
distraught.

                      FBI AGENT #2
          We're - we're placing you under arrest 
          for -

                      GINGER
               (Sobbing)
          For what?

                      FBI AGENT #2
          We're placing you under arrest for 
          aiding and abetting -

                      GINGER
               (Through tears)
          What?

                      FBI AGENT #2
          We're placing you under arrest for 
          aiding and abetting a -

                      GINGER
               (Crying)
          But I'm just trying to leave.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          After all the threats and all the 
          bullshit, it turned out Ginger didn't 
          tell 'em anything. But by then, the 
          Feds didn't need her, anyway.

                      GINGER
               (Sobbing)
          But it was just mine.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          They had all the pieces they needed.

                      FBI AGENT #1
          Come on.

                      GINGER
          But I didn't do anything.

The AGENTS escort GINGER to their car.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          And everybody...

EXT. GOLD RUSH - NIGHT

Twelve FBI AGENTS with rifles, wearing 'FBI' armbands, charge 
into the parking lot and rush through the front door.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...began to tumble.

                      FBI AGENT #3
          FBI! We have a warrant!

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...one after the other... just like 
          dominoes. Between Piscano complaining 
          on a wire.

EXT. GOLD RUSH - NIGHT, A LITTLE LATER

The FBI AGENTS escort DOMINICK, HARDY, FUSCO and MARINO out 
of the front of the shop.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Between Nicky, Ginger, me and my 
          license... paradise... we managed to 
          really fuck it all up.

INT. NICKY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

We hear a doorbell ring. LITTLE NICKY, now ten years old, 
see FBI AGENTS approaching the house.

                      LITTLE NICKY
               (Getting up from the 
               couch)
          Mom!

                      JENNIFER (O.S.)
               (Into telephone)
          Yeah, well, someone's at the fuckin' 
          door now.

Jennifer's cousin opens the door; seven AGENTS storm in.

                      FBI AGENT #4
          FBI. We have a federal search warrant.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Right away, I got wind of the pinches 
          comin' down, so I took off. Who needs 
          to hang around for that bullshit?

                      FBI AGENT #4
               (To JENNIFER, showing 
               his badge)
          My name is Marc Caspar, Special Agent, 
          FBI.

                      JENNIFER
               (Defensive)
          Yeah, well,
               (grabbing the phone 
               and walking away)
          Can I make a fuckin' phone call?

                      FBI AGENT #4
               (Blocking her way as 
               she tries to get by 
               him)
          Hey, ho-hold it for a minute. You 
          can make a phone call, but you don't 
          have to talk to us like that.

                      JENNIFER
               (Slamming the phone 
               down on a table)
          Hey -

INT. TANGIERS CASHIER'S CAGE - DAY

NANCE is talking to a cashier behind the cage when FBI AGENTS 
with Gaming Board investigators DUPREY and AUSTIN enter the 
casino.

                      FBI AGENT #5
          FBI! Don't be alarmed.

NANCE rushes out a back door.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          But they got almost everybody else.

                      FBI AGENT #5
          This area is seized.

                      DUPREY
          Grab everything in sight.

                      FBI AGENT #6
          Right.

                      DUPREY
               (Walking through a 
               door into the cage)
          Get the master account list!

                      AUSTIN
          I want all those papers seized, 
          regardless of what they are.

As AUSTIN and the others make their way into the soft count 
room, an AGENT puts up a yellow crime banner across the front 
of the cashier's window.

                      AUSTIN
          I want this area off-limits to 
          everybody.

INT. TANGIERS SOFT COUNT ROOM - DAY

The counters look on as several AGENTS seize the money boxes 
and stacks of cash from the glass table. DUPREY sifts through 
the Count Room Executive's notebook.

AUSTIN is at a cabinet looking through a ledger.

                      AUSTIN
               (Holding the book)
          Ah, yes, here we are. A little craps 
          figures.  [Actual amount taken from 
          craps tables before the skim.] Hey - 
          Hey.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Green?

INT. GREEN'S MALIBU HOUSE - NIGHT

GREEN, wearing a tennis outfit and holding a racquet, is 
being questioned by FBI AGENT #8 who's showing him confiscated 
papers. Several AGENTS are searching the house.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Don't even ask.

                      FBI AGENT #8
          Thirty thousand dollars...

                      GREEN
          No, he didn't. And that's why it 
          wasn't valid. I was being extorted, 
          all right?  I'm willing to tell you 
          whatever you want to know. I've got 
          nothin' to hide here.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Now, for the best...

INT. PISCANO'S HOUSE, LIVING-ROOM, KANSAS CITY - DAY

FBI AGENT #9 removes some ledgers from a a filing cabinet.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...and I couldn't believe this shit. 
          Piscano's expense reports took the 
          cake.

AGENTS are wandering around the house, looking for evidence.

                      FBI AGENT #9
          Oh, this is good. Bingo!

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          He might as well have given them a 
          fuckin' blueprint.  Everybody's names, 
          address, dates, everything.

                      FBI AGENT #9
               (Crossing the room to 
               PISCANO)
          Look at this! That you so much, Mr 
          Piscano. How considerate of you. 
          Appreciate it.

                      PISCANO
          Those are my m- those are my mother's 
          books.

                      FBI AGENT #10
          You're under arrest.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          What a fuckin' balloon head.

PISCANO gets more and more agitated as FBI AGENT #10 gets 
one cuff on him.

                      PISCANO
          What are you guys doin'?!

PISCANO gasps and clutches his chest, having a heart attack. 
The AGENT drops the cuffs and tries to help PISCANO as he 
collapses onto the floor.

                      FBI AGENT #10
          Take it easy, Artie. We just want to 
          talk to you.

PISCANO'S WIFE and the FBI AGENTS kneel down beside him.

                      PISCANO'S WIFE
               (Screaming)
          Artie, are you okay? Sweetheart? 
          Honey? Wait a minute! He's sick! 
          Artie! Oh, God!

She continues to scream as the AGENTS try to revive him.

                      FBI AGENT #10
               (To PISCANO's wife)
          Move back! Come on!

                      FBI AGENT #9
          Dave!

                      PISCANO'S WIFE
          He's sick! It's his heart!

                      FBI AGENT #9
          CPR! Now!

                      PISCANO'S WIFE
          Oh, God, is he breathing? He's not 
          breathing!

An FBI AGENT gives him mouth-to-mouth.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Poor Artie. He got so upset he had a 
          heart attack and dropped dead right 
          there in front of his wife.

FBI AGENTS #9 and #10 restrain PISCANO'S hysterical WIFE.

                      PISCANO'S WIFE
          Artie!

                      FBI AGENT #10
          Calm down! Calm down!

                      PISCANO'S WIFE
          No, I won't calm down! He's my 
          husband!

                      FBI AGENT #10
          Stay out of the way!

                      PISCANO'S WIFE
          Artie! Artie!

                      FBI AGENT #10
          We can't help him if -

EXT. ACE'S HOUSE - DAY

ACE opens his front door and is confronted by two FBI AGENTS. 
He is shown pictures of NICKY and GINGER at the construction 
site.

                      ACE (V.O.)
               (Quietly)
          And at the end of the day, they 
          finally came to see me with the 
          pictures.

                      FBI AGENT #1
               (Pointing to the 
               pictures)
          Why protect a friend who betrayed 
          you like that?

                      ACE (V.O.)
          But I didn't want to look at 'em. I 
          didn't want to look at the guys who 
          brought 'em either.

ACE refuses to look at the photos and quietly closes the 
door on the AGENTS.

INT. FEDERAL COURT-HOUSE - DAY

GAGGI, FORLANO, BORELLI and CAPELLI are all in court. FORLANO 
and CAPELLI are breathing through masks and oxygen tanks 
with nearby doctors and nurses. GAGGI

has a cane in front of him. Several court spectators look 
on. We hear the bosses' lawyer speak.

                      LAWYER
          Your Honor, as you can see, my clients 
          are elderly and infirm. Any 
          incarceration could pose a serious 
          health risk. They are no danger to 
          the community and they pose no flight 
          risk.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          When the bosses were arrested, some 
          of 'em were so old they needed doctors 
          at their arraignment.

                      LAWYER
          And Pre-trial Services recommends 
          that bail remain as presently set.

                      JUDGE
               (Calling a recess)
          We're going to take a ten-minute 
          recess.

The JUDGE pounds his gavel.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          And when it looked like they could 
          get twenty-five years... 

The BOSSES, their nurses and lawyer file through a side court 
door.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...to life in prison, just for 
          skimmin' a casino... sick or no 
          fuckin' sick, you knew people were 
          gonna get clipped. So, the day of 
          the arraignment, they had this meeting 
          right in the back of the court-house.

INT. COURT-HOUSE CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

The BOSSES are gathered around a conference table as the 
lawyers and nurses silently walk out the door as if on cue.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          See, when something like this happens, 
          you know how things are gonna work 
          out. It's always better with no 
          witnesses. So, what about Andy?

THE CAMERA PANS FROM ONE BOSS TO THE OTHER.

                      FORLANO
               (Putting down his 
               oxygen mask once the 
               door behind him is 
               shut)
          He won't talk. Stone is a good kid. 
          Stand-up guy, just like his old man. 
          That's the way I see it.

                      BORELLI
          I agree. He's solid. A fuckin' Marine.

                      CAPELLI
               (Holding his oxygen 
               mask)
          He's okay. He always was. Remo, what 
          do you think?

                      GAGGI
               (Pause)
          Look... why take a chance? At least, 
          that's the way I feel about it.

EXT. BACK HOME RESTAURANT, STRIP MALL PARKING LOT - DAY

ANDY STONE and his LAWYER are walking toward their car.

                      STONE
          You call Artie... and you tell him I 
          don't care what, he's gotta be in my 
          office Thursday morning before eleven 
          o'clock.

                      LAWYER
          It's done.

His LAWYER veers to the left, walking away from STONE who 
keeps talking.

                      LAWYER (O.S.)
          It's done.

                      STONE
               (To himself)
          It's terribly important. I gotta 
          have a conversation with this guy. 
          That's all.

GAGGI's men, CURLY and BEEPER, appear from behind STONE and 
shoot him dead.

They empty their silent half-load rounds into STONE even 
after he's down on the snowy ground. They walk away 
discreetly, leaving him partially hidden between cars.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          As much as they liked him, I mean, 
          he wasn't one of us. He wasn't 
          Italian. As far as they knew, he 
          could have talked. Otherwise, Stony 
          might still be alive.

MONTAGE OF MURDERS:

EXT. NANCE'S COSTA RICAN HOUSE - DAY

TITLE IN: COSTA RICA

The camera moves down a waterfall to reveal NANCE's Spanish-
style house.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          The first one to skip was John Nance. 
          He found a nice, warm secluded place 
          in Costa Rica. He thought nobody 
          would find him there.

Several gunshots are heard. NANCE emerges from the house 
through a door and runs along a verandah to another door. He 
breaks a pane of glass, unlocks another door and runs in.  
BEEPER emerges from the first door and follows him back into 
the house. Several more shots are heard. NANCE emerges from 
yet another door, only this time he's been shot in the 
stomach. He painfully staggers away from the hitmen.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          But, then, his kid got nabbed by the 
          Feds for drugs, and so naturally the 
          bosses were afraid he'd come out of 
          hidin' just to save his kid and give 
          'em all up.  So...

CURLY and BEEPER come out of the house and approach NANCE 
from behind.

                      CURLY
          Hey, where you goin', jag-off?

NANCE kneels down. CURLY points his gun expertly at the top 
of NANCE's head and fires. Blood splatters from NANCE's mouth 
and he falls to the ground. The gunmen walk away.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          But anyway, they, you know, they all 
          had to follow.

EXT. HOLE IN THE DESERT - DUSK

A bound COUNT ROOM EXEC and a CLERK are kneeling next to a 
large pit in the esert ground in front of BEEPER and CURLY.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Everybody went down.

The CLERK groans as he's shot in the head by BEEPER. Blood 
splatters and he falls right into the pre-dug hole.

                      COUNT ROOM EXEC
          Go ahead, fuck...

                      CURLY
          Fuck you.

CURLY shoots the EXEC in the head, he too falls backward 
into the pit. The gunmen fire more rounds into the bodies, 
then toss their guns into the hole.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Before you knew it...

EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

RICHIE, a sharply dressed Tangiers EXEC, is getting into his 
new Lincoln.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...anybody who knew anything wound 
          up gettin' whacked.

CURLY sneaks up from behind and hits the EXEC with a lead 
pipe. He puts a plastic bag over his head and begins to choke 
him to death. The EXEC struggles a bit but the bag soon fills 
with blood. CURLY strikes him with the pipe one last time.

INT. BEVERLY SUNSET MOTEL - NIGHT

The camera pans away from an empty registration desk to a 
motel corridor.

                      GINGER (O.S.)
               (Gasping)
          Oh! Oh, no!  No...

The camera moves past several rooms along a cinder block 
wall.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          After Ginger took off, she wasn't 
          much help to anybody. She found some 
          pimps, low-lifes, druggies and bikers 
          in LA. And in a few months, they 
          went through all the money and all 
          the jewels.

Suddenly, a door opens and GINGER overdosing, staggers into 
the hall looking for help. She gasps, goes halfway down the 
seedy corridor towards the desk, but collapses and dies.

FREEZE FRAME ON GINGER SPRAWLED OUT ON THE MOTEL CARPET.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          After they found her body... I had a 
          private doctor do another autopsy. 
          He said they gave her... a hot dose. 
          In the end... all she had left was 
          thirty-six hundred in mint-condition 
          coins.

END OF MONTAGE

EXT. TONY ROMA'S RESTAURANT PARKING LOT - DAY

ACE emerges from the restaurant, smoking a cigarette as in 
the first scene in the film. He gets into his car to start 
the ignition.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          No matter what the Feds or the papers 
          might have said about my car 
          bombing...

Flames surge from the windshield, concealing ACE behind the 
wheel.

FLASHBACK: EXT. TONY ROMA'S RESTAURANT PARKING LOT - DAY

The sign above him reads: 'Tony Roma's a Place for Ribs'. 
ACE is leaving the restaurant and walking to his car.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...it was amateur night, and you 
          could tell. Whoever it was, they put 
          the dynamite under the passenger 
          side. But what they didn't know, 
          what nobody outside the factory knew, 
          was that that model car was made 
          with a metal plate under the driver's 
          seat. It's the only thing that saved 
          my life.

ACE opens his car door and gets in.

INT. ACE'S CAR, TONY ROMA'S RESTAURANT PARKING LOT - DAY

ACE turns on the ignition and we see two- and three-inch 
flames come out of the defroster vents. Everything goes silent 
as he is suddenly engulfed in flames.

The car explodes in flames two storeys high. The screen fills 
with the rising explosion of smoke and fire.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          The bombing was never authorized, 
          but I suspect I know who lit the 
          fuse.

EXT. MIDWEST CORNFIELD - DAY

NICKY, DOMINICK and MARINO get out of a car on a farm road 
for a meeting. FAT SALLY, a heavy-set wiseguy, is already 
there.

                      FAT SALLY (O.S.)
          Hey, Nicky.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          And so did the power that be.

                      NICKY
          Hey, Mikey, how's your hernia?

They shake hands.

                      FAT SALLY
          How you doin'?

MARINO approaches NICKY from behind.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          It took months for...

FLASHBACK: EXT. MIDWEST CORNFIELD - DAY

NICKY's car drives up the farm road to meet his crew.

                      NICKY: (V.O.)
          ...everything to calm down, but 
          finally my guys got out on bail and 
          the bosses wanted me to send my 
          brother Dominick out to Vegas.  Always 
          the dollars, always the fuckin'...

NICKY, DOMINICK and MARINO get out of the car to greet FAT 
SALLY. HARDY, FUSCO and BEEPER are also waiting there, 
smiling.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...dollars. I mean, it was still way 
          too hot for me to even go near Vegas, 
          so I set up a meeting with the guys 
          way out in the sticks. I didn't want 
          my brother to get fucked around.

NICKY shakes hands with SALLY. FUSCO walks up to say hello.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          I mean, what's right is right. They 
          don't give a fuck about - urgghh!

MARINO hits NICKY in the back with a bat. FAT SALLY grabs 
him by the throat.

HARDY and BEEPER hold DOMINICK by the arms.

MARINO hits NICKY's legs with the bat.

                      FAT SALLY
          Huh? Come on, you fuckin' rat.

                      DOMINICK
          Fuck!  You...

FUSCO and FAT SALLY pin NICKY down and hold his face straight 
ahead, forcing him to watch his brother being beaten.

                      DOMINICK
               (To MARINO)
          ...rat motherfucker! You rat mother-

MARINO hits DOMINICK in the shoulder with the bat.

                      MARINO
          Tough guy! You and your f-
               (he strikes DOMINICK's 
               chest)
          Fuckin' brother!

                      DOMINICK
          Oh, you - !

NICKY tries to look away.

                      MARINO
          No more!

                      FAT SALLY
          Get him, Marino!

                      MARINO
               (Hitting DOMINICK 
               across the neck)
          You fuckin' scumbag!

The wiseguys hold NICKY's face so he has to see his brother.

                      MARINO
               (Lunging the bat into 
               DOMINICK's stomach)
          No more.

He swings the bat across his head, knocking DOMINICK on the 
ground.

                      NICKY
               (Still pinned, 
               screaming)
          Frankie!

                      MARINO
               (Looking at NICKY as 
               he strikes DOMINICK)
          No more! You see? Watch!

HARDY and BEEPER join MARINO. All three are beating DOMINICK 
with baseball bats.

                      NICKY
               (Held down by his 
               neck)
          Frankie! Frankie, you piece of shit!

                      MARINO
          Fuck you, you motherfuck!

The camera tilts down to DOMINICK's bloody face as the three 
continue to beat him to death.

                      NICKY
          Fuckin' punk, motherfucker! Piece of 
          shit!

NICKY tries to stand up but FAT SALLY and FUSCO keep him 
down.

                      MARINO
          No more fuckin' dirty work!

                      NICKY
               (Rolling over on his 
               back in pain)
          No, no, no, no!

                      MARINO
               (To HARDY and BEEPER)
          Take him out! Take this motherfucker 
          out!

They drag DOMINICK by his feet. MARINO swings at him with 
two bats as he's taken away into the cornfield.

EXT. MIDWEST CORNFIELD, GRAVE SITE - DAY, A LITTLE LATER

DOMINICK is battered and bloody. MARINO, HARDY and BEEPER 
stand over him, still swinging their bats.

NICKY is on his side, still held down by SALLY and FUSCO. 
His face is a little bloody.

                      NICKY
               (Whimpering, as they 
               beat DOMINICK)
          Dominick! Oh, Dominick. Oh, Dom.
          Frankie.
               (Pleading for his 
               brother's life.)
          Frankie, leave the kid alone. He's 
          still breathin'. He's still breathin'.  
          Leave him alone. Frankie.

MARINO swings two final blows to DOMINICK's head. NICKY looks 
away, sobbing.

                      MARINO
          All right. Strip him.

MARINO and his hoods remove DOMINICK's pants and shirt.

                      NICKY
               (Sobbing as they 
               undress his brother)
          No balls, you got no fuckin' balls. 
          Oh, Dominick. Oh, Dom.

NICKY sobs. They drag DOMINICK toward a freshly dug grave 
and toss his limp, barely conscious body into it.

                      NICKY
               (Crying quietly)
          Dominick.  Dominick.
               (Sobs.)
          Dominick.

NICKY looks up to MARINO. They share a look before MARINO 
swings his bat, striking NICKY's head.

FREEZE FRAME ON MARINO.

UNFREEZE - LIVE ACTION CONTINUES.

MARINO and his men start beating NICKY, who groans and spits 
blood as he is struck.

EXT. MIDWEST CORNFIELD, GRAVE SITE - DAY, A LITTLE LATER

NICKY is stripped down to his underwear. HARDY and FUSCO 
drag him to the grave and dump him over DOMINICK.

                      MARINO
          Come on, come on. Bury 'em.

MARINO and BEEPER look on as the other hoods begin the tedious 
work of tossing dirt on to the bodies, shovel by shovel, 
until they are covered up to their necks.

We see NICKY's face, bloodied and battered. He's still 
breathing and groaning.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          The word was out. The bosses had had 
          enough of Nicky. They had enough.  
          How much were they gonna take? So, 
          they made an example of him and his 
          brother. They buried them while they 
          were still breathing.

A full shovel of dirt lands upon NICKY's face and chest with 
a thud.

INT. ACE'S CAR, TONY ROMA'S RESTAURANT PARKING LOT - DUSK

ACE is engulfed in flames. His jacket catches fire. He opens 
the door and rolls out onto the pavement, barely escaping a 
smaller explosion. He lies on the floor as a ball of fire 
rises behind him. Two men pull him away from the car.

                      MAN #1
          Mister, you all right?

                      MAN #2
          Watch out, the -!

ACE watches as his car explodes in flames. Ashes and debris 
fall on ACE and the two men.

                      MAN #2
          Mister, you all right?

                      ACE
               (Dazed)
          Yeah.

          They had other ideas for me.

ACE is being wheeled to an ambulance on a stretcher. There

               (As ACE is wheeled 
               into the rear of the

INT. ACE'S SAN DIEGO LUXURY HOME - DAY

An older, grayer ACE is alone in his living-room with TV 
sets, fax machines and multiple phone lines. He is surrounded 
by newspapers and files. He is very much the way we saw him 
during his earlier handicapping days.

                      RACE ANNOUNCER
               (From a television 
               set)
          They're off and running...

                      ACE
               (Into telephone)
          Probable, but may be questionable. 
          All right. Well, let me know as soon 
          as you can find out.

ACE sets his cordless phone down and jots a few notes on a 
racing form. A television set shows a football game in the 
background.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          But in the end, I wound up right 
          back where I started. I could still 
          pick winners, and I could still make 
          money for all kinds of people back 
          home. And why mess up a good thing? 
          And that's that.

He takes off his glasses, and gazes ahead.

EXT. RESTAURANT PARKING LOT, LAS VEGAS, 1983 - DAY

SAM 'ACE' ROTHSTEIN, a tall, lean, immaculately dressed man 
approaches his car, opens the door, and gets inside to turn 
on the ignition.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          When you love someone, you've gotta 
          trust them. There's no other way. 
          You've got to give them the key to 
          everything that's yours.  Otherwise, 
          what's the point? And, for a while... 
          I believed that's the kind of love I 
          had.

Suddenly, the car explodes. Flames, smoke and metal rise 
into the sky covering the view of the Las Vegas casinos and 
their signs.

Music in: J.S. Bach - 'St Matthew Passion'.

Ace's body comes flying in - extreme slow motion. His body 
twists and turns through the frame like a soul about to tumble 
into the flames of damnation.

MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE.

INT. TANGIERS CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT

Vignette of ACE through rippling flames, we move in on ACE 
ROTHSTEIN overseeing the casino. He lights a cigarette.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Before I ever ran a casino or got 
          myself blown up, Ace Rothstein was a 
          hell of a handicapper, I can tell 
          you that. I was so good, that whenever 
          I bet, I could change the odds for 
          every bookmaker in the country. I'm 
          serious. I had it down so cold that 
          I was given paradise on earth. I was 
          given one of the biggest casinos in 
          Las Vegas to run, the Tangiers...

INT. SAN MARINO ITALIAN GROCERY/BACK ROOM, KANSAS CITY - 
NIGHT

Vignette of MOB BOSSES sitting at a table surrounded by food 
and wine like the gods of Olympus.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...by the only kind of guys that can 
          actually get you that kind of money: 
          sixty-two million, seven-hundred 
          thousand dollars. I don't know all 
          the details.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Matter of fact...

INT. BAR, LAS VEGAS - NIGHT

Vignette of NICKY SANTORO standing at a bar with DOMINICK 
SANTORO, his brother, and FRANK MARINO, his right-hand man.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...nobody knew all the details, but 
          it should'a been perfect. I mean, he 
          had me, Nicky Santoro, his best 
          friend, watching his ass...

INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

Vignette of GINGER MCKENNA a dazzling thirty-one-year-old 
blonde seated by a small fiery pool.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...and he had Ginger, the woman he 
          loved, on his arm.  But in the end...

INT. TANGIERS SPORTSBOOK/ACE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

ACE looks over the casino he rules.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...we fucked it all up. It should'a 
          been so sweet, too.  But it turned 
          out to be the last time that street 
          guys like us were ever given anything 
          that fuckin' valuable again.

EXT. LAS VEGAS - NIGHT

Aerial shot coming down out of the clouds over the brightly 
lit Vegas Strip and off into the blackness of the desert 
night.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          At that time, Vegas was a place where 
          millions of suckers flew in every 
          year on their own nickel, and left 
          behind about a billion dollars. But 
          at night, you couldn't see the desert 
          that surrounds Las Vegas...

EXT. DESERT - DAWN

Aerial shot swooping along the desert floor, then rising 
above the mist to reveal mountains in the distance.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          But it's in the desert where lots of 
          the town's problems are solved.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Got a lot of holes in the desert, 
          and a lot of problems are buried in 
          those holes. Except you gotta do it 
          right. I mean, you gotta have the 
          hole already dug before you show up 
          with a package in the trunk.  
          Otherwise you're talkin' about a 
          half-hour or forty-five minutes of 
          diggin'. And who knows who's gonna 
          be comin' along in that time? Before 
          you know it, you gotta dig a few 
          more holes. You could be there all 
          fuckin' night.

EXT. LAS VEGAS STRIP, 1973 - NIGHT

TITLE IN: 'THE STRIP', 'LAS VEGAS', 'TEN YEARS EARLIER'

ACE is greeted by a casino exec and walked through the 
brightly lit entrance to the Tangiers Casino.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Who could resist? Anywhere else in 
          the country, I was a bookie, a 
          gambler, always lookin' over my 
          shoulder, hassled by cops, day and 
          night. But here, I'm 'Mr Sam 
          Rothstein'. I'm not only legitimate, 
          but running a casino. And that's 
          like selling dreams for cash.

INT. TANGIERS CASINO - NIGHT

We see ACE enter alone. He is greeted by BILLY SHERBERT. 
They are joined by top executives RICHIE and RONNIE in suits 
and ties. They walk through the casino, past crowded and 
noisy craps tables, spinning roulette wheels, blackjack 
tables, poker-faced players at poker tables, and elegant, 
cordoned-off, black-tie, baccarat tables.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          I hired an old casino pal, Billy 
          Sherbert, as my manager and I went 
          to work.

                      SHERBERT
               (Introducing the EXECS 
               to ACE)
          ...And this is Ronnie, who takes 
          care of the card room...

                      ACE (V.O.)
          For guys like me, Las Vegas washes 
          away your sins. It's a morality car 
          wash. It does for us what Lourdes 
          does for humpbacks and cripples. 
          And, along with making us legit...

INT. TANGIERS/HARD COUNT ROOM - NIGHT

Dolly back from a wall of money. An employee pours a bucket 
full of coins into a trough. Camera follows progress as 
numerous coins move on a conveyor system, through a sorting 
machine. Camera reveals several rolls of coins on a lower 
conveyor as they move up a ladder towards an employee's hands, 
who then places the rolls on a rack.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...comes cash. Tons of it. I mean, 
          what do you think we're doing out 
          here in the middle of the desert?  
          It's all this money. This is the end 
          result of all the bright lights and 
          the comped trips, of all the champagne 
          and free hotel suites, and all the 
          broads and all the booze. It's all 
          been arranged just for us to get 
          your money. That's the truth about 
          Las Vegas.

INT. TANGIERS/FLOOR/SOFT COUNT ROOM - DAY

Camera follows JOHN NANCE carrying a small suitcase and 
walking through the casino to a door leading to the cashier's 
cage. The sign on the door reads 'Authorized Personnel Only'. 
He walks through the cage, to another door: 'Notice - Keep 
Out'.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          We're the only winners. The players 
          don't stand a chance. And their cash 
          flows from the tables to our boxes 
          ...through the cage and into the 
          most sacred room in the casino ...the 
          place where they add up all the money 
          ...the holy of holies ...the count 
          room.

He opens the door. We see inside the count room from NANCE'S 
point of view.

It looks like the area behind a teller's cage in a bank. A 
large room, windowless, decor-free. One side is a mesh cage, 
opened to reveal stacks of cash boxes. Several COUNTERS in 
white shirts are gathered around a glass table counting and 
sorting paper money.)

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Now this place was off limits.

                      COUNTER #1
          Verify two thousand.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Even I couldn't get inside, but it 
          was my job to keep it filled with 
          cash. That's for sure.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          They had so much fuckin' money in 
          there, you could build a house out 
          of stacks of $100 bills. And the 
          best part was that upstairs, the 
          board of directors didn't know what 
          the fuck was going on.

At one end of the room the clerks empty the metal boxes and 
rapidly count the cash at a counting table. The camera follows 
a cash 'drop box' being lifted from the stack by a clerk. He 
pours the cash on to the table and shows the empty box to a 
video camera. COUNTER #2 rapidly counts the cash and 
announces:

                      COUNTER #2
          Five thousand.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          I mean, to them everything looked on 
          the up and up. Right? Wrong.

The first counter recounts the cash.

                      COUNTER #1
          Verify five thousand.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          The guys inside the counting room...

Stacks of bills lie nearby. The camera pans across the room 
to another table manned by a COUNT ROOM EXECUTIVE who repeats 
the figure and writes it down on a master list.

                      COUNT ROOM EXEC
          Five thousand.

We move back to NANCE opening a cabinet full of stacks of 
$100 bills. He opens his suitcase and begins to fill it with 
cash. As he does this, the workers studiously look in other 
directions.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...were all slipped in there to skim 
          the joint dry.  They'd do short 
          counts, they'd lose fill slips. They'd 
          even take cash right out of the drop 
          boxes. And it was up to this guy 
          right here [NANCE], standin' in front 
          of about two million dollars, to 
          skim the cash off the top without 
          anybody gettin' wise ...the IRS or 
          anybody.

                      COUNTER #1
          Verify two hundred.

NANCE closes the case and walks out. One of the counters 
dumps another container of money on the table.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Now, notice how in the count room 
          nobody ever seems to see anything. 
          Somehow, somebody's always lookin' 
          the other way. Now, look at these 
          guys [COUNTERS]. They look busy, 
          right?  They're countin' money. Who 
          wants to bother them? I mean, God 
          forbid they should make a mistake 
          and forget to steal. Meanwhile, you're 
          in and you're out.

NANCE exits the count room and proceeds through the lobby of 
the casino, passing ACE and SHERBERT, to a side exit door.

                      NICKY
          Past the jag-off guard who gets an 
          extra c-note a week just to watch 
          the door.  I mean, it's routine. 
          Business as usual: in, out, hello, 
          goodbye. And that's all there is to 
          it. Just another fat fuck walkin' 
          out of the casino with a suitcase. 
          Now, that suitcase was goin' straight 
          to one place: right to Kansas City 
          ...which was as close to Las Vegas 
          as the Midwest bosses could go without 
          gettin' themselves arrested.

NANCE leaves the casino and gets into a cab parked at the 
curb.

EXT. KANSAS CITY AIRPORT - DAY

NANCE arrives. He is greeted by ARTIE PISCANO, a gray-haired 
sixty-year-old underboss.

TITLE IN: 'KANSAS CITY'

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          That suitcase was all the bosses 
          ever wanted ...and they wanted it 
          every month.

                      PISCANO
          Hey, John, how are you? How was your 
          ride?

EXT. SAN MARINO ITALIAN GROCERY, KANSAS CITY - DAY

NANCE, with suitcase, and PISCANO leave the car and enter 
the produce market.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Now this old Mormon fuck here...

              CUT TO: NANCE, AS HE GETS OUT OF PISCANO'S CAR

INT. SAN MARINO ITALIAN GROCERY, KANSAS CITY - DAY

NANCE and PISCANO walk through the grocery store, through 
the warehouse, past various employees to a doorway leading 
into the back room, where they are greeted by five older men 
around a large wooden table with bowls of macaroni and old 
jelly glasses filled with red wine.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...he had to fly in with suitcases 
          once a month, nice and easy.

                      NANCE
          Somethin' smells good.

                      PISCANO
          Yeah, they made us somethin' to eat.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          The bosses would come from all over 
          the place: Detroit, Cleveland, 
          Milwaukee. All over the Midwest.  
          And they would meet in the back of 
          this produce market in Kansas City. 
          I mean, nobody even knew.

NANCE shakes hands with AMERICO CAPELLI, sixty-eight, a bald, 
affable Milwaukee entrepreneur and ARTHUR CAPP, his thirty-
year-old yuppie lawyer son.

Camera continues to pan around the room.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          One of the guys made his mother do 
          all the cooking.

On VINCENT BORELLI, seventy-year-old Kansas City boss.

                      BORELLI
          Did you ever see that guy Jerry 
          Steriano?

On VINNIE FORLANO, mid-seventies, an old-timer who once drove 
for Capone and is now Remo Gaggi's right-hand man.

                      FORLANO
          Jerry Steriano?

                      BORELLI
          Yeah.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Now, these old greaseballs might not 
          look it, but believe me, these are 
          the guys who secretly controlled Las 
          Vegas.

PISCANO joins his MOTHER and DAUGHTER by a stove.

                      PISCANO'S MOTHER
          That man's here again.

Piscano dips a piece of bread into a pot of tomato sauce.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Because they controlled the Teamsters' 
          Union, and that's where you had to 
          go if you wanted to borrow money to 
          buy a casino.

                      BORELLI (O.S.)
          When you've finished with him, I 
          want him.

                      PISCANO'S MOTHER
               (Carrying a plate of 
               food to the table 
               where BORELLI and 
               FORLANO are seated.)
          Here you are, gentlemen.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          And nobody got a Teamsters' loan, 
          unless the guys in this room knew 
          they were gonna get their little 
          suitcases.

FORLANO gets up from the table and walks toward NANCE.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Guys like this antique here [FORLANO], 
          out of Detroit. Or especially guys 
          like Remo Gaggi, the outfit's top 
          boss.

NANCE embraces REMO GAGGI who's seated on a couch, and sits 
across from him.

                      GAGGI
          You got a round figure on it?

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Definitely the most important guy in 
          this room.

                      NANCE
               (Picking up the 
               suitcase)
          About twenty pounds.

                      GAGGI
          So?

                      NANCE
          That's around seven hundred thousand.

                      GAGGI
          Uh-huh, good.

NANCE opens the case to reveal the money.

                      ANDY STONE
               (Off-screen, from 
               following scene)
          I know it's a little early for Las 
          Vegas...

INT. TANGIERS EXECUTIVE OFFICE PRESS CONFERENCE/BANQUET ROOM - 
DAY

Camera tilts down a model of the Tangiers Hotel and Casino, 
then reveals the cover of Business Week magazine with a 
drawing of PHILIP GREEN, a young corporate type, smiling out 
under the headline: 'Philip Green, Vegas Wunderkind'.

                      STONE (O.S.)
          ...but I do want to welcome the ladies 
          and gentlemen of the gaming industry.

On ANDY STONE, a middle-aged man at a podium giving a speech 
while GREEN, seated at a table, looks on. PHOTOGRAPHERS flash 
their cameras. ACE and SHERBERT, sitting next to GREEN, also 
watch the photo op ceremony.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          As far as the world was concerned 
          Andy Stone, the head of the Teamsters' 
          Pension Fund, was a legitimate guy.

                      STONE
          This is a very auspicious occasion.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          A powerful man.

                      STONE
          Philip, if you would rise.

Green stands up.   

                      ACE (V.O.)
          He even played golf with the 
          President.

                      STONE
          On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension 
          Fund, it is my pleasure to present 
          to you . . .

                      ACE (V.O.)
          But Andy also took orders. And when 
          he was told to give a pension fund 
          loan to Philip Green...

                      STONE
               (Handing GREEN a large 
               cardboard facsimile 
               'check')
          ...this check for $62,700,000 for 
          the new Tangiers.

                      GREEN
          Thank you.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...he did what he was told.

PHILIP GREEN, who is now the head of the Tangiers Hotel and 
Casino Corporation, is standing at the podium giving a speech.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Now here was the perfect front man. 
          I mean, what the fuck else could he 
          be?  He didn't know too much. He 
          didn't want to know too much, 
          especially that the bosses made the 
          Teamsters lend him the money. He 
          wanted to believe the Teamsters gave 
          him all that fuckin' money 'cause he 
          was smart.

An exploding flash bulb fills the screen.

                      GREEN
          ...I say that, knowing full well 
          just how much competition we have in 
          this great city.

EXT. CHEAP MOTEL OFF HIGHWAY - DAY

We see a MAN and a WOMAN swimming underwater. Camera reveals 
that they are in a motel swimming pool with glass portholes.  
Expensive cars are parked outside one of the rooms. Hoods 
stand around outside the door.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          And where they got Green from - who 
          the fuck knows?  All I know is that 
          Green was an Arizona real estate 
          hustler, who barely had enough gas 
          money to come and pick up his own 
          fuckin' check...

INT. TANGIERS EXECUTIVE OFFICE PRESS CONFERENCE/BANQUET ROOM - 
DAY

We return to the press conference. Photographers snap away. 
In the background are six-foot blow-ups of the Business Week 
cover. The camera moves past GREEN, CAPP and several other 
men, past SHERBERT, to ACE.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Now, all they needed was somebody 
          they could trust to run the casino. 
          And who better than Ace?  I mean, he 
          was already in Vegas a couple of 
          years and he had the fuckin' place 
          clocked.

FREEZE FRAME ON ACE.

INT. TANGIERS SWIMMING POOL - DAY

Camera looks straight down from the top of a hotel to a large 
pool area.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          But typical Ace...

INT. TANGIERS SWIMMING POOL/POOLSIDE - DAY

STONE, in a bathing suit and robe, sits on a lounge chair 
with a telephone. ACE, in sports clothes, sits on another 
chair.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...give him a shot at runnin' a casino 
          and he tries to talk you out of it.

                      ACE
          You know, I don't know if I could do 
          this even if I wanted to. The Gaming 
          Commission would never give me a 
          license. I have at least two dozen 
          gambling and bookmaking pinches on 
          me.

                      STONE
          You don't have to have a license to 
          work in a casino. All you gotta do 
          is apply for one. The state law says 
          you can work in a casino while they're 
          processing your application. They 
          got a ten-year backlog.

                      ACE
          But what happens when they do find 
          out?

                      STONE
          Why would they want to find out? 
          We're puttin' a hundred million into 
          this desert here. Why would they 
          want to lock us out?  And besides, 
          they'll never find out. All you gotta 
          do is keep changing your job title. 
          Like, uh, from Casino Executive to 
          Food and Beverage Chairman. And what 
          happens it, they take your 
          application, they put it at the bottom 
          of the pile. I know guys workin' 
          there for thirty years, don't have a 
          license.

                      ACE
               (Exhales)
          It's a tough proposition, Andy. You, 
          you know, if I did it, I'd have to 
          run it my way.

                      STONE
          You got it.

                      ACE
          I'm serious. No interference.

                      STONE
          Nobody's gonna interfere with your 
          running the casino. I guarantee it.

Stone lights a cigarette.

INT. TANGIERS CRAPS PIT - NIGHT

ACE blows on a die.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          And that's how that got Ace to take 
          over.

ACES's hands place the die into a micrometer.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
           
          They wanted him because Ace ate, 
          slept and breathed gambling.

Camera swish tilts up to ACE, then swish pans to boxman, 
dealers and players watching him, trying to act calm.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          They worked out a real cute job title 
          too.

We see the die in the micrometer.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Tangiers Public Relations Director.

Satisfied the die is not loaded ACE sets it on the craps 
table, the camera cranes up to reveal the Tangiers Casino 
floor.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          But the only thing he ever directed 
          was the casino. He made his first 
          bet when he was fifteen years old, 
          and he always made money. But he 
          didn't bet like you or me.

A DEALER is sliding chips, tossing them on to a craps table.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          You know, havin' some fun with it, 
          shit like that.

                      ACE
               (Approaching the DEALER)
          Where the hell did you learn how to 
          deal?
               (He reaches down, 
               stacking and arranging 
               the chips.)

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.

                      ACE
               (To the chastised 
               DEALER)
          Place the checks properly. That's 
          the way you do it.

                      DEALER
          Yes, sir.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          He had to know everything, this guy.

Direct overhead tracking shot as ACE walks between two rows 
of gaming tables.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          He'd find out the kind of inside 
          stuff nobody else knew, and that's 
          what he'd put his money on.

INT. GYM/BOOKIE JOINT, BACK HOME, PRE-SEVENTIES - DAY

ACE walks past two boxers sparring in a ring, through a 
doorway into a room where several gamblers are seated around 
a table.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Even back home, years ago, when we 
          were first hangin' out together...

TITLE IN: 'BACK HOME, YEARS AGO'

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...he'd know if the quarterback was 
          on coke.

ACE is looking at the odds board for college football games. 
The bookie, LUCKY LARRY, is waiting for ACE to hand in his 
picks.

                      ACE
          I'll take Columbia for twenty.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          If his girlfriend was knocked up.

                      LUCKY LARRY
          Twenty dimes on Columbia . . .

As soon as ACE bets, a man erases a number from the chalkboard 
and replaces it was a '6', changing the odds. Two GAMBLERS 
saunter from the room.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          He'd get the wind velocity so he 
          could judge the field goals. He even 
          figured out the different bounce you 
          got off the different kinds of wood 
          they used on college basketball 
          courts, you know?

EXT. GYM/BOOKIE JOINT PUBLIC PHONES - DAY

The two GAMBLERS we saw sauntering out of the bookie joint 
are racing to the nearest public phones. Another GAMBLER has 
already beaten them to it.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          He'd be workin' on this shit day and 
          night. There was nothin' about a 
          game he was gonna bet that he didn't 
          know.

                      GAMBLER #1
               (Into phone)
          Ace got down at six.

                      GAMBLER #2
               (Into phone)
          Charlie, hey. Rothstein got six.

INT. GYM/BOOKIE JOINT, SEVERAL DAYS LATER - DAY

A bookie hands a stack of money to another bookie, who hands 
the money to ACE.

ACE removes several bills from the top of the stack of 
winnings and holds them out to the BOOKIES.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Season after season, the prick was 
          the only guaranteed winner I ever 
          knew. But he was so serious about it 
          all that I don't think he ever enjoyed 
          himself.  But...

ACE exits.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...that's just the way he was.

INT. MOB SOCIAL CLUB BACK ROOM - NIGHT

The room has an espresso machine and a saint's day calendar. 
Assorted hoods are listening to NICKY at the bar. Camera 
dollies to REMO GAGGI, at the rear table playing gin rummy 
with OLD MAN CAPO and losing. Every time the CAPO picks up a 
card, he's able to knock or get gin, sending GAGGI into a 
fit bemoaning his bad luck.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          But back then the bosses didn't give 
          a fuck about whether he enjoyed 
          himself of not. To them, he was a 
          cash register. All they had to do 
          was ring the bell and take the money. 
          Especially Remo, who was a fuckin' 
          degenerate gambler who always lost.

                      GAGGI
               (Slams down his cards 
               and curses at his 
               losing hands)
          Ma che cazzo!

[Italian-American slang for 'What a prick.'] All those fuckin' 
sweeps.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          I mean, unless Ace made his bet.

                      GAGGI
          That's enough now!

                      OLD MAN CAPO
          I can't contest the cards.

                      GAGGI
          Va fa 'n culo! [Italian-American 
          slang for 'Fuck off'] 
               (Summoning a young 
               man.)
          Johnny!

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Ace made more money for them on a 
          weekend than I could do heisting 
          joints for a month.

ACE enters and walks to GAGGI's table.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Whatever Ace picked up on the street 
          he told Remo.

                      NICKY
               (Walks over to ACE 
               and whispers)
          Hey, did you bring that thing?

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          You know, I mean fixed fights, doped 
          horses, crooked fuckin' zebras... 
          locked-in point spreads. He told 
          fuckin' Remo everything. And to tell 
          you the truth. I don't blame him.

GAGGI stands up and shakes ACE's hand.

                      GAGGI
          Ace.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Keepin' Remo happy with money was 
          the greatest insurance policy in the 
          world.

GAGGI beams as ACE takes out an envelope filled with cash 
and hands it over to him. GAGGI sits back down and ACE, 
knowing his place, smiles and is about to leave.

                      GAGGI
          Son-of-a-bitch. How the hell did you 
          get Oklahoma-Michigan?  Nobody ever 
          had Oklahoma-Mi... How the hell'd 
          you do it?

                      ACE
          Well, that's why they paid so well.

                      GAGGI
          You see?
               (Chuckles.)
          Never tells me nothin'. Ace, what do 
          we got on for next week?

                      ACE
          Well, it's a little too early. I'd 
          say Thursday would be good. I'll 
          know by then. Is that all right?

                      GAGGI
          Okay. You come by the house?

                      ACE
          I'll come by.

                      GAGGI
          Seven o'clock?

                      ACE
          Seven o'clock.

GAGGI gets up and kisses ACE as NICKY and OLD MAN CAPO look 
on.

                      GAGGI
          Good job, my boy. Keep it up. Okay, 
          Ace?

ACE nods in agreement and leaves the room.

                      GAGGI
               (To NICKY)
          Hey, Nick. Vien acca. [Italian-
          American slang for 'Come here']

                      NICKY
               (To ACE)
          I'll be right out.

                      GAGGI
          T'aggia parla. [Italian-American 
          slang for 'I've got to talk to you'] 
          Nicky... See that guy?
               (pointing to the off-
               screen ACE)

                      NICKY
          Mm.

                      GAGGI
          Keep a good eye on him. He's makin' 
          a lot of money for us. And he's gonna 
          continue makin' a lot of money for 
          us, so keep a good eye on him.

                      NICKY
          Mm.

                      GAGGI
          Not like your fuckin' friends out 
          there, that... without brains.  Okay?

                      NICKY
          All right.

                      GAGGI
          Uh-huh. Mi raccomando. [Italian-
          American slang for 'I'm counting on 
          you']

                      NICKY
          Yeah.

                      GAGGI
          Fine.

                      NICKY
               (Reaching down to 
               touch GAGGI's money, 
               joking with him.)
          Want me to take this for you?
               (He walks out.)

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          So, now, on top of everything else, 
          I gotta make sure that nobody fucks 
          around with the Golden Jew.

INT. BACK HOME BAR - NIGHT

We move past JOE, a guy at the bar entertaining a BRUNETTE 
and a BLONDE, to NICKY and FRANK MARINO at the other end. 
There are other bar patrons in the background.

                      JOE
               (To the BARTENDER)
          Chase, couple of shooters for the 
          ladies.

                      BARTENDER (O.S.)
          All right.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Yeah, we made a great pair. I made 
          book and Nicky made sure we always 
          collected. The old men loved us. And 
          why not? They all made money with 
          us.

                      NICKY
               (To MARINO)
          They payin'?

                      ACE (V.O.)
          How did Nicky collect?

                      MARINO
          They pay every week, like they're 
          supposed to.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Don't ask. 

                      NICKY
          Then where the fuck is the money? I 
          don't see the money.

ACE enters, and greets the two girls.

                      ACE
          Hi, Melissa. Heidi.

                      BLONDE
          Hi, Sam.

                      JOE
               (To the GIRLS)
          Who's this guy?

                      MARINO
               (To NICKY)
          Get the fuck out of here. It was 
          nine. I laid nine.

ACE approaches NICKY and MARINO.

                      NICKY
          It was eight.  Ace... tell him the 
          line on the Bear's game.

                      ACE
          Eight.

                      NICKY
          If he don't know, nobody knows. Told 
          you it was eight.

                      MARINO
          Well, how come I laid nine?

                      NICKY
          'Cause you're a jag-off. I would 
          have fuckin' made you lay ten...

ACE notices a pen lying on the bar. He taps JOE on the 
shoulder.

                      ACE
               (To JOE)
          Excuse me.

                      JOE
          What?

                      ACE
               (He holds up the pen)
          Is this yours? Your pen?

                      JOE
          Yeah, that's my pen. Why?

                      ACE
          I ju- Well, it's a nice pen. I just 
          didn't know whose it was. I thought 
          it was yours. I didn't want it to 
          get lost.

                      JOE
          Well, thank you. Why don't you take 
          that fuckin' pen and shove it up you 
          ass, you fuckin' jag-off?

NICKY looks over.

                      ACE
          Well, I was just offering you the-

NICKY moves towards JOE.

                      JOE
               (Turning his back to 
               talk to the girls, 
               referring to ACE)
          This fuckin' asshole.

NICKY grabs the pen out of ACE's hand.

                      MAN #1
               (To JOE)
          Look out!

Before ACE can react, NICKY grabs JOE and starts stabbing 
him in the neck with the pen.

                      MAN #1
          Joe! Look out, Joe! Look out!

NICKY grunts while JOE gasps and groans. The BLONDE screams 
while NICKY's hand continues to plunge the pen into JOE's 
throat. JOE tumbles to the floor.

NICKY pounces on him, still stabbing and now kicking. JOE 
whimpers.

                      NICKY
          What's that? You hear? You hear a 
          little girl, Frankie? You hear a 
          little girl, Ace? Is that a little 
          fuckin' girl?!  What happened to the 
          fuckin' tough guy?  Told my friend 
          stick it up his fuckin' ass?! Huh?! 
          Huh?!

                      ACE
               (Over whimpers and 
               pants)
          Wait a sec, Nicky, Nicky, Nicky. Ta-
          take it easy.

ACE looks stunned. NICKY's still holding the bloody pen.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          While I was tryin' to figure out why 
          the guy was sayin' what he was sayin', 
          Nicky just hit him. No matter how 
          big a guy might be, Nicky would take 
          him on. You beat Nicky with fists, 
          he comes back with a bat. You beat 
          him with a knife, he comes back with 
          a gun. And you beat him with a gun, 
          you better kill him, because he'll 
          keep comin' back and back until one 
          of you is dead.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Listen...

INT. TANGIERS CASINO FLOOR, 1972 - NIGHT

Camera swoops from a woman cheering as she wins at a slot-
machine to a blackjack table, then to a roulette table and 
over to a craps table.

Montage of very short cuts of chips being picked up, dice 
thrown, money being poured from a bucket, stacks of money.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...with me protecting Ace, he made a 
          fortune for the bosses. I mean that's 
          what got him to Vegas. He was a money 
          machine. A tremendous earner for 
          these guys.  As soon as he took over, 
          he doubled the fuckin' drop. With 
          Ace the casino never saw so much 
          money. And the bosses, they couldn't 
          be happier.

INT. TANGIERS CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT

Camera moves in on ACE as he looks out over the casino. 
Dealers deftly stack chips, scoop up losses and pay off 
winners. Chips and money are everywhere.

In extreme close-up slow motion a die falls on to a table.

INT. TANGIERS CASINO SLOT-MACHINE AREA - NIGHT

ACE and SHERBERT are walking down a casino aisle by the slot-
machines. Dealers immediately snap to attention at their 
approach.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          In Vegas, I had to keep a few juiced-
          in local cowboys working. They were 
          close to the, you know, good old 
          boys.

                      ACE
               (To SHERBERT)
          Pay him six hundred a week, tell him 
          to walk around and look smart.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          I mean, without us, these guys, they'd 
          still be shovellin' mule shit.

ACE points at paper cups, empty glasses and the debris of 
silver dollar wrappings on the floor. DON WARD, the Slots 
Manager in Western garb, immediately starts picking up the 
debris. ACE looks at WARD sternly.

                      ACE
          Ward, you gotta keep a cleaner 
          station. If you need 'Mr Clean', 
          page him, all right?

WARD bends down and picks up some trash.

                      WARD
          It won't happen again, Sam.

                      ACE
          Mr Rothstein.

                      ACE
               (To SHERBERT)
          Is this guy just another dumb fuckin' 
          white man, or what? What's his story?

                      SHERBERT
          We need this guy.

                      ACE
          We can't get rid of him?

                      SHERBERT
          He's juiced in. He's the County 
          Commissioner's cousin.

                      ACE
          I wouldn't give the bum a mop job.

They exit.

INT. TANGIERS BACCARAT TABLES - NIGHT

A card shoe slides across the baccarat table. A state SENATOR, 
a little drunk, tips the dealer, kisses the blonder HOOKER 
with him, fills his pockets with his winnings and walks over 
to see ACE.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          These yokels ran the state.

                      DEALER #1
          Thank you very much, Senator.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          They passed the laws, they owned the 
          courts.

                      SENATOR
          Hi, Ace.

                      ACE
          Hello, Senator.

They shake hands.

                      SENATOR
               (To ACE)
          Hey, I need a room. Need a room.

                      ACE
          Good to see ya.
               (To SHERBERT)
          William would you...

The SENATOR shakes hands with SHERBERT as the HOOKER joins 
them.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          I had dozens of politicians and state 
          officials comin' through that place 
          every week.

                      SHERBERT
          Nice to see you, Senator.

                      ACE
               (To SHERBERT)
          Help the Senator, give him whatever 
          he wants.

                      SHERBERT
          Certainly.
               (Leads the way.)
          Senator.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Why not make them happy?

                      SHERBERT
          We have some nice penthouses you'll 
          enjoy. Maybe the Presidential Suite.

INT. TANGIERS PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - DAY

The SENATOR unzips the HOOKER's dress, kisses her and walks 
through the bedroom doorway, looking over his shoulder to 
her as she takes off her dress and walks out of his sight.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          For politicians...

INT. TANGIERS BACCARAT TABLES - DAY

ACE smoking a cigarette by the baccarat tables.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...like our state senator up there, 
          everything was on the house.

INT. TANGIERS PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - DAY

The SENATOR opens a bureau drawer and takes out a small velvet 
pouch and pours black $100 into his palm.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          These guys won their comped life 
          when they got elected. So, hey, why 
          not take advantage of it? Still, the 
          politicians come cheap. We could 
          handle them.

INT. TANGIERS, ICHIKAWA LUXURY SUITE - DAY

K. K. ICHIKAWA a Japanese businessman, and a male associate 
pick up towels and soap from about the bedroom of their suite. 
A blonde woman checks herself in the mirror.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          It's a whale like K. K. Ichikawa, 
          who plays thirty thousand dollars a 
          hand in baccarat. That's the one you 
          really gotta watch.

ICHIKAWA and his associate walk into the the suite's living-
room and join a Japanese woman seated on a couch.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          He plays fast and big and he has the 
          cash and the credit to turn out your 
          lights. About a year ago, he cleaned 
          out a couple of casinos in the Cayman 
          Islands.

They begin to stuff Tangiers soap and towels into their 
luggage.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Downstairs, he takes us for two 
          million... and upstairs he takes 
          free soap, shampoo and towels. Another 
          billionaire cheapskate who loves his 
          free rooms...

EXT. TANGIERS JET, LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DAY

The Tangiers jet with the Tangiers logo on its side as 
ICHIKAWA shakes ACE's hands before boarding. SHERBERT follows 
him and his associates aboard.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...free private jets, and two million 
          of our money.

                      ACE
          Nice to see you again.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          But we got him back. I had our pilot 
          tell him the plane was on the fritz.

EXT. TANGIERS JET, STILL IN THE SAME SPOT - NIGHT

SHERBERT apologizes to ICHIKAWA and his entourage as they 
all get off the jet.

                      SHERBERT
          Ken, I don't know what the hell went 
          wrong. I'm awfully sorry.

                      ICHIKAWA
          This is a big problem. Big problem.

                      SHERBERT
          I can't understand it. These 
          mechanical things, you know, they 
          happen. Hey, be-better here than
               (gesturing to the sky)
          up there, you know what I mean?

INT. LAS VEGAS AIRPORT RESERVATION DESK - NIGHT

SHERBERT arguing with TICKET AGENT as ICHIKAWA and entourage 
look glum.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Then he missed the commercial flights 
          connecting with Japan.

                      AGENT
          I'm so sorry. There's a convention 
          in town, and all flights are booked.

                      SHERBERT
          A convention?
               (Turning to ICHIKAWA)
          I can't believe that there's a 
          convention. It's never... ?

                      ICHIKAWA
          What can I do?

EXT. TANGIERS CASINO - NIGHT

A smiling ACE greets ICHIKAWA and his entourage as they drive 
up and get out of Tangiers limos.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          We got him back ...with a whole floor 
          of rooms for himself.

                      ACE
          I'm sorry you missed the plane.

                      ICHIKAWA
          You want to get my money back, right?
               (Chuckles)

                      ACE
          No, no, no. No gambling. No.

INT. TANGIERS BACCARAT TABLES - NIGHT

ICHIKAWA, with the Japanese woman, picks up some chips and 
places them on the table. ACE and SHERBERT watch from behind 
a barrier.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          He bet one thousand a hand instead 
          of his usual thirty thousand a hand.

A dealer's hands slide two cards on the table.

                      DEALER
          The bank wins a natural eight over a 
          five.

Another dealer's hands place two chips on a table. ICHIKAWA 
looks on.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          But I knew, the trick with whales 
          like Ichikawa was that they can't 
          bet small for long. He didn't think 
          of it as winning ten thousand, he 
          thought of it as losing ninety 
          thousand.

ICHIKAWA places a larger bet.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          So, he upped his bets...

A dealer picks up some chips from a rack and places them on 
the table.

ICHIKAWA is now seated with stacks of chips in front of him.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...until he dropped his winnings 
          back and gave up a million of his 
          own cash.

                                                DISSOLVE TO:

ICHIKAWA, hours later, his chips depleted. ACE and SHERBERT 
still watch from behind the barrier as millions in chips are 
back in the dealer's racks.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          In the casino, the cardinal rule is 
          to keep them playing...

Move in on ACE as he smokes a cigarette.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...and keep them coming back. The 
          longer they play, the more they lose. 
          In the end, we get it all.

INT. TANGIERS CASINO - NIGHT

ACE, with pit bosses next to him, looks out over the huge 
casino where hundreds of thousands of dollars are being poured 
into machines.

The DEALER places some chips on the table.

                      GAMBLER #2
          Hard ten. One hundred.

INT. TANGIERS EYE-IN-THE-SKY MONITOR ROOM - NIGHT

ACE continues to look at the monitor. SHERBERT and a security 
man seated at a video console also look on.

INT. TANGIERS CRAPS TABLE - NIGHT

A craps stick pushes some dice towards GINGER. She rolls 
again, only this time she craps out. Gamblers groan, then 
applaud her. She's made so much money for the table that the 
winners toss chips in her direction.

                      HIGH ROLLER
          I'm sorry.

                      GINGER
          Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
               (To the table)
          Thank you very much. Thank you very 
          much.

ACE and two casino execs are now on the floor watching her.

                      GINGER
          Thank you, sir, I appreciate that. 
          Everybody, thanks. Gives some chips 
          as tips to the dealer and box man. 
          Thanks. Take care, Steve. Take chances 
          and drive fast.

                      HIGH ROLLER
          Ginger, honey.

                      DEALER
          Thank you very much, now.

                      HIGH ROLLER
          Ginger, honey, this is for you love. 
          Thanks for your time.

She turns to the HIGH ROLLER, who is handing her a thin stack 
of chips worth about $2,000.

                      GINGER
               (Chuckles)
          Come on.

                      HIGH ROLLER
          What's the matter?

                      GINGER
          What do you mean, 'What's the matter?' 
          I made a lot of money for you. I 
          want my cut.

                      HIGH ROLLER
          What money? I've seen you stealing 
          from me.

                      GINGER
          What money?  Look at this stack of 
          chips. Don't give me that shit. I 
          want my end.

                      HIGH ROLLER
          Ginger, I've been watching you all 
          night. You've been stealing from me.

                      GINGER
          Don't give me that shit. I want my 
          money.

                      HIGH ROLLER
          That bag's full of fuckin' chips you

                      GINGER
               (Interrupts)
          What do you mean 'stole'? I didn't 
          steal anything from you.

ACE watches the argument heat up.

                      HIGH ROLLER
          Get lost, Ginger! Get lost!

                      GINGER
          Get lost?

                      HIGH ROLLER
          Yes.

                      GINGER
          Get lost?

                      HIGH ROLLER
          Yes.

GINGER knocks the chip rack out of his hands.

                      GINGER
          Well, how 'bout that?

                      HIGH ROLLER
          Come on!
               (He bends down to 
               pick them up.)

Gamblers and dealers shout and yell. She picks up another 
rack of chips and tosses them into the air, then another, 
and another. Chips fly all over the casino. Everyone starts 
diving for chips. Dealers. Players. Security guards.  
Waitresses. Pit bosses. Bedlam.

ACE and the two execs with him are the only ones not diving 
for chips. He looks at GINGER. She looks at him.

FREEZE FRAME ON GINGER.

Slow motion: GINGER smiles at ACE and walks off.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          What a move. I fell in love right 
          there.

INT. COCKTAIL LOUNGE - NIGHT

GINGER and ACE are seated on a banquette. Close up of his 
hand attaching a diamond and ruby pin to her dress. Tilt up 
to GINGER's smiling face beaming at ACE.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          But in Vegas, for a girl like Ginger, 
          love costs money.

They kiss.

                      GINGER
          I'm going to go powder my nose.
               (ACE hands GINGER a 
               single $50 bill. She 
               smiles coyly. He 
               hands her another 
               fifty.)

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Ginger's mission in life was money.

                      GINGER
          I'll be right back.

                      ACE (O.S.)
               (from following scene)
          See you, Ginger.

FLASHBACK - EXT. CASINO ENTRANCE - NIGHT

GINGER waves goodbye to the DOORMAN and walks towards two 
VALET PARKERS who greet her warmly. She gets a bottle of 
pills from one of them and slips some cash into his hand in 
return.

                      GINGER
          Okay, thank you for asking.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          She was a queen around the casino. 
          She brought in high rollers and helped 
          them spread around a lot of money.

                      GINGER
               (To VALET PARKERS)
          Hello.

                      VALET PARKER
          Hey, Ginger, how you doin'?

                      GINGER
          Great.
               (Handing the VALET 
               some money.)
          And I have something for you. You 
          got me covered?

The VALET PARKER places a vial of pills in her hand.

                      VALET PARKER
          Yes. Something for you, there.

                      GINGER
          And you do. Thank you very much.

                      VALET PARKER
          Take care of yourself.

FLASHBACK - INT. HOTEL SUITE BATHROOM - NIGHT

GINGER hands the pills to HIGH ROLLER #2 in his hotel 
bathroom, where he is washing his face and trying to energize 
himself.

                      GINGER
          I got some lucky pills for you, honey.

                      HIGH ROLLER #2
          Oh, yeah?

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Who didn't want Ginger? She was one 
          of the best-known, best-liked and 
          most respected hustlers in town.  
          Smart hustlers like her could keep a 
          guy awake for two or three days before 
          sending him home broke to the little 
          woman and his bank examiners.

INT. COCKTAIL LOUNGE - NIGHT

GINGER comes back from the ladies room. She kisses ACE.

                      ACE
          Any change?

                      GINGER
               (Chuckles)
          I hit a few... uh, games on the way 
          back.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          That was all bullshit. She just 
          pocketed the cash.

FLASHBACK - INT. TANGIERS CASHIER'S CAGE - NIGHT

GINGER converts her chips into a pile of $100 bills.

                      GINGER
               (To CASHIER)
          How you doin' tonight?

                      CASHIER
          Good. How are you?

                      GINGER
               (Sighing)
          Oh, beat.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Ginger had the hustler's code.

                      CASHIER
          Okay.

                      GINGER
          Take one for you.

                      CASHIER
               (While she counts out 
               the cash)
          Thank you.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          She knew how to take care of people. 
          And that's what Vegas was all about.

                      CASHIER
               (As she pushes a stack 
               of $100 bills across 
               the counter)
          Sixty-eight hundred.

                      GINGER
          Thanks

She picks up the cash.

                      CASHIER
          You're welcome.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          It's Kickback City.

                      GINGER
          You have a good night.

                      CASHIER
          Thank you. You too.

Close-up of GINGER folding a $100 bill and placing it in her 
palm. She slips the folded bill deftly into the palm of a 
floor manager.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          She took care of the dealers...

                      GINGER
          Hey, Mitch.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...pit bosses, floor managers.

                      GINGER
          Thank you.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          But mostly...

EXT. TANGIERS ENTRANCE - NIGHT

GINGER, on her way out of the casino, passes a folded $100 
bill to a smiling older SHIFT BOSS.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...she took care of the valet parkers, 
          the guys who could get you anything 
          and take care of anything.

                      GINGER
          Thanks a lot.

                      SHIFT BOSS
          Thank you, Ginger.

EXT. TANGIERS ENTRANCE - NIGHT

GINGER exits and gets into her car, slipping a VALET PARKER 
a $100 bill.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Ginger took care of the parkers 
          because they took care of the security 
          guards, who took care of the metro 
          cops, who let her operate.

                      VALET PARKER #3
          Thank you, Ginger.

                      GINGER
               (Getting into her car)
          I need that stuff tonight.

                      VALET PARKER #3
          No problem.

                      GINGER
          You're a doll.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          The valet parking job was such a 
          money-maker that they had to pay off 
          the hotel manager just to get the 
          concession.

INT. GINGER'S APARTMENT - DAY

GINGER enters the room with $25,000 in her hands. She taps 
LESTER DIAMOND's leg with it and he turns to her.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          But one thing I could never 
          understand, was that she could have 
          everything under control, except for 
          her old pimp boyfriend, Lester 
          Diamond.

                      LESTER
          Look, Gin, you know I got other people 
          in this. I got partners. But I want 
          you to understand that I am lookin' 
          out for you in this thing.  Okay?  
          You're going to get yours back...   
          and you're gonna get it back first. 
          Okay?

                      GINGER
          All right.

                      LESTER
          Okay?

                      GINGER
          Yeah.

                      LESTER
          Where are you goin'? Where are you? 
          You're in that place. Where are you?

                      GINGER
          I'm here.

                      LESTER
          No, you're not. Where are you? Where 
          are you?

                      GINGER
          I'm always here for you.

                      LESTER
          You are.

                      GINGER
          I am.

He hastily kisses GINGER and slips out the door.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          The Ginger I knew wouldn't even look 
          at this creep.

                      GINGER
          Good luck.

                      LESTER
          Yeah.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          He was a moocher, a card cheat, a 
          country-club golf hustler. A 
          scumbag... chasing dentists for a 
          few bucks.

                      GINGER
          Careful.

GINGER looks out of the window and sees LESTER get into a 
convertible and drive off.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          I mean, the guy was always broke, he 
          always had a story. And somehow, she 
          could never turn him down. The way 
          Ginger saw it, I guess, was that 
          Lester was just an unlucky guy. 
          Somebody had to take care of him.

INT. BACK HOME AIRPORT/CUSTOMS - DAY

NICKY, his wife JENNIFER, with a beehive hairdo, and their 
eight-year-old son LITTLE NICKY, are detained while their 
luggage is searched by a customs agent.

TITLE IN: 'BACK HOME'

                      ACE (V.O.)
          But nobody had to take care of Nicky.

                      NICKY
               (To customs agent)
          You find any cash in there, we'll 
          whack it up with you.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          I mean, he took care of himself only 
          too well. And that's why every badge 
          back home wanted to nail him.

                      JENNIFER
               (To customs agent)
          Excuse me, but I folded these things 
          beautifully and I would appreciate a 
          little respect. Jesus Christ!

                      NICKY
          Don't look at me, pal. I gotta live 
          with her.

We see MARINO waiting for NICKY outside the customs area. 
Two COPS push past him.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Even after a little vacation, they 
          hassled him at the airport.

                      COP #1
               (To MARINO)
          Excuse me.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          I mean, Frank Marino was there to 
          meet him, but so were the cops. This 
          time they wanted to pinch him for 
          some diamond burglary in Antwerp.

CAMERA DOLLIES IN ON JENNIFER'S BEEHIVE.

                      JENNIFER
          Oh, yes. Will you help me fold these, 
          please?

                      ACE (V.O.)
          They were ready to blame him for 
          anything, no matter where it happened.

FLASH FORWARD - INT. NICKY'S HOUSE/BACK HOME - DAY

NICKY, JENNIFER, LITTLE NICKY and MARINO walk in.

                      JENNIFER
               (To LITTLE NICKY)
          You go and put your things away.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          And they were usually right.

NICKY, JENNIFER and MARINO are gathered around the kitchen 
table. JENNIFER leans over and starts to shake her hair.

                      MARINO
          Whoa, whoa, whoa.

                      NICKY
          Hold it, hold it. Here.

NICKY places a red towel down on the table. JENNIFER leans 
over again, tugs and shakes her hair until diamonds begin to 
fall out of her beehive.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Because Nicky enjoyed being a 
          gangster, and he didn't give a damn 
          who knew it.

                      JENNIFER
          Come on. There we go. Look at that. 
          Beautiful.

Diamonds fall on the red towel in slow motion.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          I mean, that's what worried me, 'cause 
          it turns out Nicky was about to be 
          sent to Vegas.

                      JENNIFER
          All right, we're clear.

                      NICKY
          There's more!

                      JENNIFER
          I think that's it.

                      NICKY
          There's more! There's a couple stuck 
          in there. I know there's more.

                      JENNIFER
          God, I'm telling you, they're out!

                      NICKY
          Come on, damn it. Don't get so 
          defensive. It could be stuck in your 
          hair, you know.

NICKY grasps JENNIFER's hair.

                      JENNIFER
          Look, there aren't...
               (A diamond falls out 
               of her beehive.)
          There aren't but...

                      NICKY
          Oh, there aren't?
               (Showing her the 
               diamond.)
          What's that?
               (Slaps her.)
          Huh? What's that.
               (FRANK chuckles.)
          There's no more. Thanks, hon.

INT. BACK HOME AIRPORT/CUSTOMS - DAY

ON NICKY.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          I couldn't wait to get my hands on 
          Vegas. But the bosses didn't send me 
          out there to have a good time.

INT. SAN MARINO ITALIAN GROCERY/BACK ROOM, KANSAS CITY - 
NIGHT

Mob bosses FORLANO, CAPELLI, GAGGI, BORELLI and PISCANO seated 
around the back room table eating and talking as in the 
opening vignette.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          They sent me out there to make sure 
          that nobody fucked with Ace and...

INT. ACE'S TANGIERS PENTHOUSE, LAS VEGAS - DAY

ACE opens the door to NICKY and JENNIFER.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...nobody interfered with the fuckin' 
          skim.

                      ACE
               (Opening door)
          Hey.

                      JENNIFER
          Hey, how you doin'?
               (Kisses ACE.)

                      NICKY
          Hey. Hey, Sammy, how are you?

JENNIFER and NICKY take in ACE's spectacular Vegas-style 
penthouse.

                      JENNIFER
               (Whispering)
          Wow.

                      NICKY
          Boy, look at this place, huh?

                      JENNIFER
          Incredible.

                      NICKY
          All right.

                      ACE
          Welcome to Vegas.

CAMERA TILTS UP TO REVEAL A SWEEPING VIEW OF THE LAS VEGAS 
SKYLINE.

                      NICKY
          Okay, Sammy.

                      ACE
          Somethin', huh?

                      NICKY
          Yeah.

                      ACE
               (Calling her over)
          Ginger.

GINGER emerges from the bedroom. NICKY and JENNIFER are both 
stunned by her beauty.

                      NICKY
               (To ACE)
          Holy shit, what've you been doin' 
          out here?

                      ACE
          Honey, come here.

She walks to them

                      ACE
          This is Jennifer and Nick. They're 
          dear friends of mine.

                      JENNIFER
               (Shaking hands)
          Good to meet you.

                      GINGER
          Hi, Jennifer.

                      NICKY
          Pleasure.
               (Grasping GINGER's 
               hand and kissing it.)
          Very nice to meet you.

                      GINGER
          Hi, how are you?

                      NICKY
          Okay, Sammy.

INT. ACE'S CAR, LAS VEGAS STRIP - NIGHT

ACE and NICKY are driving through town, the neon lights of 
Vegas reflected in the windshield.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          After we ate, we left Jennifer and 
          Ginger alone and we took a ride to 
          talk. And then... he hit me with it.

                      NICKY
          What do you think about me movin' 
          out here?
               (ACE looks away.)
          What's the matter? You got a problem 
          with that?

                      ACE
          No, of course not.

                      NICKY
               (Playfully)
          You mean, I have your permission?

                      ACE
          Sure, you have my permission. But I - 
          I just gotta tell you it's no joke 
          out here. It's no joke, you know?  
          You gotta keep a low profile. It's 
          not like back home. Right off the 
          bat, they don't like guys like us. 
          And this sheriff's a real cowboy. 
          Even the coppers aren't afraid to 
          bury people out in the desert here.

                      NICKY
          I don't care. I want to get away 
          from back home for a while. I'm tired 
          of that shit back there.
               (Referring to the 
               Vegas lights.)
          Look at this place. It's made of 
          money. You know what the best part 
          is? Nobody's gonna know what we're 
          doin'! There's nobody here to see 
          us! Everybody's back home.

                      ACE
          Nick, I gotta tell you, I got pinched 
          twice for no reason. You really gotta 
          be careful. I'm running a licensed 
          place. Everything's legit.

                      NICKY
          Don't worry about it. I'm not gonna 
          do anything. What am I gonna do?  
          I'm especially not gonna involve you 
          in anything.

ACE gives NICKY a look.

EXT./INT. LAS VEGAS SPORTSBOOK - NIGHT

NICKY and MARINO pull up in their car and get out.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Ace saw Vegas one way.

                      NICKY
          You call this guy and tell him I'm 
          comin'?

                      MARINO
          Of course.

They walk into the sportsbook, past numerous bar patrons and 
gamblers to TONY, the bookie at a betting counter.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          But I saw it another. I saw it as 
          untouched. I mean, they had bookies, 
          pimps and drug dealers I could shake 
          down. Who the fuck were they gonna 
          run to?  So, I started getting 
          everybody in line. Best of all, for 
          the first time in my life, I figured 
          out a way not to lose.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Yeah, he had a fool-proof scheme, 
          all right. It wasn't very scientific 
          but it worked. When he won, he 
          collected. When he lost, he told the 
          bookies to go fuck themselves. What 
          were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky?
               (Chuckles.)
          Nicky was the muscle.

NICKY grabs TONY by the back of his neck.

                      NICKY
          Tony.

                      TONY
          Hey.

                      NICKY
          How you doin'?

                      TONY
          How you doin'?

                      NICKY
          All right, yeah. You got that thing 
          for me?

                      TONY
          What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought 
          you was layin'.

                      NICKY
          I was layin'? No, no, I'm taking it. 
          I was takin' it.

                      TONY
          You sure?

                      NICKY
          I'm positive.

                      TONY
          Well, I'm a little confused here.

                      NICKY
          You're a little confused?

                      TONY
          Yeah.

                      NICKY
               (Pointing to a window, 
               above a counter with 
               a tiny opening to 
               talk through)
          Maybe if I stick your fuckin' face 
          through this window over here like, 
          you know, you'll - you'll get 
          unconfused. Give me the fuckin' money!

TONY takes some money out of his coat pocket.

                      TONY
               (Groaning)
          I'm sorry, Nicky. I didn't mean 
          anything by it.

                      NICKY
          Yeah, I know, that's why you had it 
          ready. You thought I was fuckin' 
          layin' it?!

He smacks the bookie on the head with the wad of money.

                      TONY
               (Gasps)
          My fuckin' head.

                      NICKY
          Your fuckin' head, huh? Don't fuck 
          around, Tony.

                      MARINO
               (Pointing to TONY)
          Smarten up.

                      NICKY
               (Walking out)
          You jag-off.

 

                      CLASSROOM NUN (O.S.)
               (From following scene)
          And now...

INT. CATHOLIC SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

NICKY and JENNIFER stand in the background with other parents 
listening to a NUN school teacher. LITTLE NICKY and other 
youngsters are seated at small children's desks.

                      CLASSROOM NUN
          ...Nicholas Santoro will come up and 
          tell us about our first president.

                      LITTLE NICKY
               (Stepping up in front 
               of the class to begin 
               a speech)
          George Washington was born in a...

                      ACE (V.O.)
          But still, it was nice and quiet for 
          a while. Ginger and I presented Nicky 
          and Jennifer all over town, like 
          regular Ozzie and Harriets.

                      LITTLE NICKY
          ...typical Virginia farmhouse.

EXT. LITTLE LEAGUE FIELD - DAY

NICKY and DETECTIVE BOB JOHNSON are coaching their sons. 
JOHNSON pats LITTLE NICKY on the back and with encouraging 
words sends him running on to the field.

                      DETECTIVE JOHNSON
               (To LITTLE NICKY)
          Beautiful. You got a beautiful swing.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Ace got my son, little Nicky, involved 
          with Little League, and it was great.

                      DETECTIVE JOHNSON
          Now, I want you to get out there and 
          get me singles and doubles, okay?  
          'Cause that's what's gonna win this 
          game.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Turned out to be one of the other 
          coaches was a fuckin'...  

                      DETECTIVE JOHNSON
          Now go out there and show your dad 
          what you can do.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...metro intelligence cop. But it 
          didn't matter. I mean, it was all 
          about the kids, you know.

                      DETECTIVE JOHNSON
          You know, he's gotta realize 
          everything can't be a home run that 
          he does.

                      NICKY
          Yeah, well, that's exactly what I 
          keep tellin' him, but that's the 
          kind of kid he is ever since he's 
          born.

                      DETECTIVE JOHNSON
          It's instinctive, you know.

                      NICKY
          He tries to do everything...

LITTLE NICKY hits the ball, NICKY and DETECTIVE JOHNSON 
applaud.

                      NICKY
          Ohh!

                      ACE (V.O.)
          And, Nicky being Nicky, he made his 
          presence known.

INT. TANGIERS CASHIER'S CAGE CREDIT WINDOW - NIGHT

NICKY saunters through the casino and up to EDDY and JERRY, 
two well-dressed hoods who are signing papers at the cashier's 
credit window near ACE and SHERBERT.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Especially at the casino, where he 
          definitely did not work, people got 
          the message.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Me? That's why the bosses sent me 
          out here. They wanted me to make 
          sure none of the other crews robbed 
          the joint. Like these two fuckin' 
          balloon-heads over here [EDDY and 
          JERRY]. They were gonna try and bang 
          us out of two hundred fuckin' grand?
               (Chuckling.)
          Yeah, right, I'm sure.

                      JERRY
               (Shakes NICKY's hand)
          Hey, Nicky. How are you?

                      NICKY
          Hey, Eddy.

                      EDDY
          Hey, Nicky, how are you? What are 
          you doin' here?

                      NICKY
          I'm over here now.

                      JERRY/EDDY
               (In unison)
          You're over here?

                      JERRY
          You're over here?

                      NICKY
          Yeah, I'm over here with him.

SWISH PAN TO ACE WITH SHERBERT OFF TO THE SIDE.

                      EDDY
          Oh.

                      JERRY
          Oh.

                      EDDY
          We're waiting on Carmine.

                      JERRY
          Yeah, we're lookin' for Carmine.

                      NICKY
          Carmine? He was here before. I saw 
          him. He had a suitcase and everything, 
          and then he left.

                      EDDY
          Carmine left?

                      NICKY
          Uh-huh.

                      JERRY
          Carmine left?

                      EDDY
          He's gone?

                      JERRY
          He's not here?

                      EDDY
          Carmine's gone.

                      NICKY
          I think, you know, maybe he went 
          across the street or somewhere else 
          or somethin'. I don't know.

                      EDDY
          Well, listen, uh... Good luck with 
          the joint, huh?
               (Shakes hands with 
               NICKY.)

                      NICKY
          Oh, thanks, Eddy.

                      JERRY
               (Shakes NICKY's hand)
          Yeah, lots of luck. Lots of luck.

                      NICKY
          Hey, great, Jerry.

They walk away.

                      NICKY
          Good luck to you too.

                      CREDIT CLERK
               (To NICKY from behind 
               the cage)
          Hey, they forgot to sign their papers.

                      NICKY
          What?

                      CREDIT CLERK
          They forgot to sign their papers.

                      NICKY
          Yeah, they don't need those anymore.

He looks over to ACE and SHERBERT. NICKY smiles.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Out of respect, guys from other crews 
          got away with a warning.

ACE taking a drag off his cigarette, nods an 'okay'.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Everybody else: watch out.

INT. TANGIERS CASINO/BLACKJACK TABLES - DAY

A blackjack WINNER, who looks like a school teacher, with 
over $100,000 in chips before him has gathered a crowd.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Like these yokels here who never 
          heard of Nicky or the bosses back 
          home, 'cause they're the morons who 
          give you the most trouble. Even after 
          we'd catch 'em, they'd try sneakin' 
          back with beards and wigs and fake 
          noses.

ACE and SHERBERT walk up to watch the WINNER who is playing 
all six hands at the blackjack table.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          You can spot these assholes by 
          watching the way they bet. Like this 
          guy. He's bettin' lavender chips at 
          five hundred each with only one little 
          problem. He's always guessed right.  
          If he wasn't so fuckin' greedy, he'd 
          have been tougher to spot. But in 
          the end, they're all greedy.

ACE walks around the WINNER's table, past the crowd, to the 
pit. Behind him are more blackjack tables, dealers and 
players. ACE bends down and ties his shoelace.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          I saw that the dealer was weak, but 
          he wasn't in on it.

The DEALER's hands lift the corner of his hole card a half 
an inch to determine the casino's hand against the WINNER. 
The slightly exposed hole card is a six of clubs.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          He just wasn't protecting his hand. 
          He was lifting his hole card way to 
          high.

ON ACE'S FACE THEN TO HIS POV OF THE CARD, PAST A PIT BOSS, 
PANNING TO THE SIGNALER AT THE BLACKJACK TABLE TO THE RIGHT. 
THE SIGNALER IS SLUMPED DOWN IN HIS SEAT, TOSSING DOWN SOME 
CARDS AND SNEAKING LOOKS AT THE DEALER'S HAND AT THE WINNER'S 
TABLE.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Now, here's this guy...

OVERHEAD PAN FROM THE SIGNALER SLUMPED IN HIS SEAT.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...reading the dealer's hole card...

PAN CONTINUES PAST ACE TO REVEAL THE WINNER'S TABLE.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...and signaling his buddy [the 
          WINNER] at this table.

OVERHEAD DOLLY IN ON SIGNALER WHO APPEARS TO BE NERVOUSLY 
TAPPING HIS THIGH.

We see through his trousers, that he is tapping a copper 
transmitter with a battery pack attached.

Back at the WINNER's table we see inside his pant leg where 
a device strapped to his leg is receiving the impulse signal - 
buzz - buzz - buzz - from the SIGNALER.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          And that's just what these hustlers 
          look for. They cruise from casino to 
          casino, lookin' for weak dealers the 
          way lions look for weak antelope.

ACE starts to get up.

                      ACE (O.S.)
               (From following scene)
          Operator?

INT. TANGIERS BLACKJACK TABLES/TELEPHONE - DAY

ACE is on the house phone right near the SIGNALER's table.

                      ACE
          This is Mr R. Get me Armstrong and 
          Friday over at pit two right away.

He hangs up, and fixes his tie in the mirrored panel above 
the phone.

OVERHEAD VIEW OF THE SIGNALER'S TABLE. VARIOUS SECURITY GUARDS 
SLOWLY BEGIN TO GATHER AROUND IT.

ACE, waiting, lights a cigarette. ARMSTRONG joins ACE. They 
look towards the SIGNALER's table.

                      ACE
               (To ARMSTRONG)
          BJ nineteen, second base, the beard 
          [Blackjack table number 19, second 
          position, man with the beard]

                      ACE
               (Picks up the phone 
               again.)
          Operator... I need Mr Happy, loud.

On ACE's signal, WAITRESSES, one carrying a cake with a 
sparkling candle, start singing 'Happy Birthday', attracting 
the crowd's attention.

                      WAITRESSES
               (In unison)
          Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday 
          to you. Happy Birthday, dear Jeff. 
          Happy Birthday to you.

Gamblers cheer and applaud.

ACE nods and ARMSTRONG lets a long metal object drop out 
from under his jacket sleeve and moves in close behind the 
SIGNALER, as though looking at the game.

He presses the object - a cattle prod - under the SIGNALER's 
arm near his heart. The SIGNALER instantly goes into 
convulsions, falling to the floor gasping and groaning. 
Several SECURITY GUARDS grab the SIGNALER as he falls.  
ARMSTRONG walks away.

                      SECURITY GUARD #1
          Man down!

The WINNER sees what happened to his partner.

                      SECURITY GUARD #1
          Notify medical! We got a cardiac 
          arrest here!

                      SECURITY GUARD #2
          He's fine, folks. Just give us some 
          room, please!

ACE watches the scene. The guards lift the stunned SIGNALER 
to his feet and help him away from the table. Play is 
immediately resumed.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Watch it now.

The WINNER hurriedly places his chips into racks.

                      SECURITY GUARD #1 (O.S.)
          Stand back!

                      ACE (V.O.)
          They never know what hit them. And 
          if and when...

SECURITY GUARDS drag the SIGNALER out.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...they do find out they just got 
          zapped by a cattle prod...

SHERBERT follows the WINNER as he rushes away.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...they wish they really did have a 
          heart attack.

ACE exits behind the GUARDS and the SIGNALER.

INT. BASEMENT MAINTENANCE ROOM - NIGHT

A grim, windowless utility room with tools on racks along 
the walls, some plain wooden chairs, and a workbench table.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Turns out this guy and his fuckin' 
          pals, they were knockin' this place 
          dead for years.

                      SECURITY GUARD #1
          He's got a wire on him.

The SIGNALER is roughly shoved into the room. A SECURITY 
GUARD tears his trousers down revealing the signaling device 
strapped to his leg.

                      SIGNALER
          Hey, hey, what are you doin', man?

                      SECURITY GUARD #2
               (Exposing the device)
          There it is! On the table!

                      SECURITY GUARD #1
          Cheater's justice!

The SIGNALER is slammed down face first on the bench and the 
two GUARDS spread his arms out on the table.

                      SIGNALER
               (In pain)
          Oh, God! Oh!

Another GUARD starts up a power saw and approaches the 
SIGNALER who is now pinned to the table. He starts to scream.

                      SIGNALER
          Hey, no! No! No!

ACE walks toward the table, gesturing for the GUARD to turn 
off the saw.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          We had to make an example of these 
          pricks that the party was over.

                      ACE
               (To relieved SIGNALER)
          I'm just curious. I saw you shuffling 
          your checks with your right hand. 
          Can you do that with both hands?

                      SIGNALER
          No.

                      ACE
          Can't do it with both hands?

                      SIGNALER
          No, Sir.

                      ACE
          Can you do it with your left hand?

                      SIGNALER
          Well, I... I never tried.

                      ACE
          So, you're a righty?

                      SIGNALER
          Ye-yeah.

ACE nods to one of the GUARDS. Instantly a large rubber mallet 
smashes onto the man's right hand four times to the sound of 
screams. ACE watches.

                      ACE
          Now, you're gonna have to learn with 
          your left hand.

                      SIGNALER
          God!
               (He moans and sits 
               back.)

                      WINNER (O.S.)
               (From following scene)
          It's a hundred...

INT. CASINO CASHIER'S CAGE AREA - NIGHT

The WINNER has been standing outside the cashier's cage 
waiting for his $110,000 in chips to be cashed. SHERBERT 
walks up behind him.

                      WINNER
          ...a hundred ten.

                      CASHIER
          Yes, it is.

                      WINNER
          I think.

                      CASHIER
          Yes.

                      WINNER
          Okay.

                      SHERBERT
          Hiya. That's a lot of money to be 
          counting out in public.

                      WINNER
          Yeah.

                      SHERBERT
               (To CASHIER)
          Why don't I take him over to the 
          office and verify it, huh?

                      CASHIER
          Yes.

                      SHERBERT
          A little privacy. And, by the way, 
          send over a... nice bottle of 
          champagne on ice, huh?

                      CASHIER
          Sure will.

                      SHERBERT
          Real special.  Somethin'...
               (To WINNER.)
          By the way...  I'm Billy Sherbert, 
          your casino manager.

He shakes hands with the WINNER.

                      WINNER
          Hi.

                      SHERBERT
          Having a good time?

SHERBERT leads him away from the cage.

                      WINNER
          Yes, uh...

                      SHERBERT
          You'll want to count the money in 
          privacy. You know, you don't need...

                      WINNER
          Uh, I have a plane to catch to 
          Cleveland...  Can I get my winnings?

INT. BASEMENT MAINTENANCE ROOM - NIGHT

The WINNER is pushed through the door by two GUARDS followed 
by SHERBERT and sees his pal moaning in pain and holding his 
broken hand.

                      SIGNALER
          Look what they did to my hand, man!

                      ACE
               (Walks over to the 
               WINNER)
          All right, I'm gonna give you a 
          choice. You can either have the money 
          and the hammer or you can walk out 
          of here. You can't have both. What 
          do you want?

SHERBERT stands next to the WINNER

                      WINNER
          I just wanna get out of here.

                      ACE
          And don't forget to tell your friends 
          what happens if they fuck around in 
          here. You understand?

                      WINNER
          I'm sorry. I made a bad mistake.

                      ACE
          You're fuckin' right, you made a bad 
          mistake. 'Cause if you come back 
          here - we catch either one of you - 
          we're gonna break your fuckin' heads 
          and you won't walk out of here. You 
          see that fuckin' saw?  We're gonna 
          use it. You don't fuck around in 
          this place. You got it?

                      WINNER
          Yeah.

                      ACE
          Get out of here.

                      WINNER
          Thank you.

The GUARDS usher the WINNER out of the room.

                      ACE
               (To the GUARDS, 
               referring to the 
               SIGNALER)
          Throw him out in the alley.  And 
          just tell the cops he got hit by a 
          car.

INT. ACE'S TANGIERS PENTHOUSE

ACE and GINGER are alone in the living room. The apartment 
looks out on the glittering neon signs of the Strip.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Within no time, everything was set 
          in place. We got rid of the freelance 
          scamsters. The per was way up.  The 
          gods were happy, or as happy as the 
          gods can ever be.  And I, I decided 
          to complicate my life. For a guy who 
          likes sure things, I was about to 
          bet the rest of my life on a real 
          longshot.

                      ACE
          We're not getting any younger. Don't 
          you think it's time? Aren't you 
          gettin' tired of all this shit? 
          Bangin' around, hustlin' around?

                      GINGER
          What, are you trying to handicap me?

                      ACE
          I'm gonna do you one better. I'm 
          trying to marry you. You want to 
          marry me?
               (GINGER looks doubtful.)
          I'm serious. I mean, I - I want to 
          settle down. I want a family.

                      GINGER
               (Sighs, laughing)
          You got the wrong girl, Sam.

                      ACE
          I know I'd be a good father. I know 
          you'd be a good mother.

                      GINGER
          You don't know me. What, you've known 
          me, two, three months. What do you 
          know?

                      ACE
          I'm forty-three years old. I don't 
          want to wait. I know you well enough 
          to know that I really love you very 
          much.  And I can't think of anybody 
          better to be with. And I don't feel 
          like waiting anymore.

                      GINGER
          You know a lot of happily married 
          people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.

                      ACE
          Yeah, I know all that.

                      GINGER
          I care about you, a - But I just 
          don't have those kind of feelings 
          for you. I'm sorry. I'm not in love 
          with you.

                      ACE
               (Brushing cigarette 
               ash off his dressing 
               gown)
          I - I - I...

                      GINGER
          Understand?
               (Pause)
          I'm sorry.

                      ACE
          No, I - I... mean...  that can grow 
          as I - as long as there's a mutual 
          respect... that kind of thing can 
          grow. I'm realistic. I can accept 
          that. But, you know, what is...  
          What is love anyway?  It's a... it's 
          a mutual respect. It's - it's a 
          devotion. It's a... it's a caring 
          from one person to another. And if 
          we could set up some kind of 
          foundation...  based on that mutual 
          respect...  I feel that eventually 
          you would care enough about me... 
          that I could live with that.

                      GINGER
          If it doesn't work out. You know, if 
          it doesn't play out, then what happens 
          to me?

                      ACE
          You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm 
          gonna do even better. And so, whatever 
          happens, if it doesn't work out 
          between us, I'm gonna make sure you're 
          okay for the rest of your life. And 
          if there are kids, especially, you 
          know, I'll take care of you better 
          than you'd ever imagine.

                      GINGER
               (Interrupts)
          What're you... what're you pitching 
          me, here?

                      ACE
          Just what I said. You'll be set up 
          for the rest of your life. That I 
          can promise you.
               (Pause)
          Want to take a chance?

She looks at him. ACE is holding her hand tightly.

INT. RIVIERA BALLROOM MARRIAGE - NIGHT

ACE and GINGER are seated at a banquet table with various 
guests, drinking champagne. AMY, their six-month-old child 
is in a cradle. NICKY and JENNIFER are hovering around the 
baby with LITTLE NICKY and are blissfully happy. It is an 
elegant affair.  City Officials, politicians and gaming 
officials are there, plus, SHERBERT and Ace's boss, PHILIP 
GREEN. A photographer takes pictures of the guests.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          When I married Ginger I knew all the 
          stories, but I didn't give a fuck. 
          'I'm Sam Rothstein,' I said. 'I can 
          change her.'

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          It was typical Ace. He invited the 
          biggest people in town and he knew 
          they'd show. Because he knew they 
          all wanted somethin' from him.  With 
          Ace, nobody ever got a free ride. 
          Even Ginger. With her -

We see AMY in the cradle.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          - he still covered his bets. They 
          had to have the baby first, before 
          they got married. Even made Jennie 
          and me watch Amy for a few days when 
          they went on their honeymoon. But I 
          didn't mind, we loved the kid.

IN SLOW MOTION CAMERA MOVES IN ON ACE AND GINGER, STANDING 
NEXT TO A LARGE WEDDING CAKE. THEY ARE KISSING. NICKY, 
SHERBERT AND OTHER GUESTS LOOK ON.

CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSER AS THEY KISS, THEN PAST THEM TO THE 
BRIDE AND GROOM FIGURINES ON THE CAKE.

LESTER's and GINGER's telephone conversation is heard in 
voice-over this scene.

                      LESTER
               (Over telephone)
          Can you feel my eyes on you? Can you 
          feel me look into your heart?  Can 
          you feel me in the pit of your 
          stomach? Can you feel me in you? In 
          your heart?

We see a wide view of the elaborate wedding, guests mill 
about the banquet hall.

                      LESTER
          Don't make me come there. Answer me.

                      GINGER
               (Over telephone, 
               sobbing)
          I love you.

INT. LESTER DIAMOND'S LOS ANGELES APARTMENT - NIGHT

LESTER DIAMOND is talking on the phone softly, cutting up 
cocaine on a piece of glass.

                      LESTER
               (Into telephone)
          Bub-ut, baby, do you know that I 
          love you too?

                      GINGER
               (Over telephone)
          No, Lester.

                      LESTER
               (Into telephone)
          Do you know that?

                      GINGER
               (Over telephone)
          Yeah. This is the best thing I can 
          do for my life right now.

                      LESTER
               (Into telephone)
          That's right.

INT. RIVIERA BALLROOM CORRIDOR - NIGHT

GINGER is sitting alone on the phone. She's crying.

                      LESTER
               (Over telephone)
          So, it's gonna be okay, isn't it?

                      GINGER
               (Sobbing, into 
               telephone)
          Promise?

                      LESTER
               (Over telephone)
          God... I wish you...

INT. LESTER DIAMOND'S LOS ANGELES APARTMENT - NIGHT

There is a beautiful scantily dressed blonde girl in the 
apartment with him. She bends down to the table in front of 
him, snorts some cocaine, then walks away.

                      LESTER
               (Into telephone)
          ...all the luck in the world.

                      GINGER
               (Over telephone)
          You do?

                      LESTER
               (Into telephone)
          Yeah, I do. I mean, it's - it's the - 
          it's the best thing you can do right 
          now. I mean this. And you'll have 
          real security.  Sweetheart... you're 
          gonna be situated just right in Vegas.

INT. RIVIERA BALLROOM CORRIDOR - NIGHT

ACE enters from the ballroom and sees GINGER on the phone. 
He walks towards her, listening to her conversation.

                      LESTER
               (Over telephone)
          Come on, this is great for us. You 
          know I'm gonna be here for you. I 
          ain't going no place. Huh?  I'm 
          lookin' at you right now. I'm seein' 
          you for the very first time, right 
          this minute. I'm seein' you, and I 
          can feel my heart click. I see you 
          fourteen years old. I see you the 
          first second I ever saw you. I see 
          you, long-legged little colt -

GINGER notices ACE behind her.

                      LESTER
          - with stupid braces on your teeth.

                      GINGER
               (Into telephone, 
               sniffing, trying to 
               cut him off)
          Okay, then.

                      LESTER
               (Over telephone)
          Every time I ever see you, that's 
          what I see.

                      GINGER
               (Into telephone)
          Uh, talk to you later.  Bye.
               (She hangs up the 
               phone quickly.)

                      ACE
          You all right?

                      GINGER
               (Drinking some 
               champagne, wiping 
               away tears)
          Yeah.

                      ACE
          Why're you crying?

                      GINGER
               (Laughs)
          I'm not crying.
               (Sniffs.)

ACE walks up behind GINGER.

                      ACE
          Maybe you shouldn't drink so much.

                      GINGER
          I'm okay. I just -
               (Sniffs)
          You just have to understand. I've 
          been with Lester since I was a kid. 
          I just wanted to say goodbye. I - I 
          just...  I don't... I think I have a 
          right to do that. Okay?

                      ACE
          It's all right. That part of your 
          life is over with. Right?

                      GINGER
          Yeah.

                      ACE
          You're with me now.

                      GINGER
          Yeah.

                      ACE
          Right?

                      GINGER
          Uh-huh.

                      ACE
          You sure?

                      GINGER
          Yeah. Yeah.

They are reflected in a mirror behind the telephone.

                      ACE
          Want to go? Let's go back in.

                      GINGER
               (Sniffs)
          Okay.

ACE's hands pick up a white rose and GINGER's gloves from 
the desk.

EXT. ACE'S HOUSE - DAY

ACE and GINGER drive up to an expensive house which backs on 
to a country-club golf course.

INT. ACE'S HOUSE - DAY

ACE takes GINGER inside. It is fancy and lush.

                      GINGER
          Oh...

Through sliding glass doors, we see a patio and a pool area.

                      GINGER
               (Sighing)
          It's great.

The living-room has exposed white brick along the walls, 
bronze ostrich figurines, a white baby grand piano, and a 
zebra print rug surrounded by a few couches.

                      GINGER
          Oh, it's great.

INT. ACE'S BEDROOM CLOSET - DAY

ACE takes GINGER past the bedroom to their huge room-sized 
closet. There are racks and racks of clothes.

                      GINGER
               (Running into the 
               closet)
          Oh! It's all my stuff. Oh, my God.

ACE presents her with a long chinchilla coat.

                      GINGER
          You brought all my stuff. I can -

She sees the coat.

                      ACE
          Try it on. It's yours.

He puts it on her.

                      GINGER
               (Whispering)
          You're kidding? My God. What is it?

                      ACE
          It's chinchilla.

                      GINGER
               (Looking at herself 
               in the mirror)
          Oh, it's so soft.

                      ACE
          It's nice isn't it?

                      GINGER
          Oh...

ACE Kisses her.

                      GINGER
          No one's ever been so nice to me.

They kiss and embrace.

INT. ACE'S HOUSE/BEDROOM - DAY

ACE's hand opens a leather case full of gold Bvlgari jewelry.

                      GINGER
               (Gasps)
          Oh, my God.

INT. ACE'S HOUSE/BEDROOM - DAY

ACE and GINGER lie on the bed, surrounded by jewelry. GINGER 
is swathed in the chinchilla coat. Ace watches as a transfixed 
GINGER tries on gold necklaces, rings, bracelets and earrings.

                      GINGER
          So, do you think it's too much if I 
          wear these in the same day?

                      ACE
          You do whatever you want. Do I keep 
          my promises, or do I keep my promises?

ACE kisses GINGER.

                      GINGER
          You're so wonderful. The jewelry's 
          not so bad, either.

                      ACE
          The only thing is... you shouldn't 
          keep this in the house. We gotta put 
          it in a bank.

                      GINGER
               (Putting on a gold 
               bracelet)
          Come on. Can I keep this one in the 
          house?

                      ACE
          Now look,
               (gently holding her 
               face, gathering her 
               total attention)
          pay attention to me. What I'm gonna
           tell you is very important.

                      GINGER
          Okay.

                      ACE
          All this stuff doesn't mean anything. 
          Money, this, doesn't mean anything 
          without trust. I have to be able to 
          trust you with my life.

EXT. BURBANK PRIVATE AIRPORT - DAY

TITLE IN: 'LOS ANGELES'

ACE and GINGER get off the Tangiers jet carrying two 
suitcases. ACE gives a chauffeur the luggage and follows 
GINGER into a brown Rolls Royce.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          With over a million in cash and jewels 
          tucked in a bank in Vegas only for 
          Ginger, she was secure and happy.

INT. BEVERLEY HILLS BANK - DAY

ACE and GINGER walk into the bank lobby carrying the 
suitcases.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          She loved that shit. But a guy in my 
          line of work has to have a lot of 
          pay-off cash around.

INT. BEVERLEY HILLS BANK/VAULT - DAY

There are several safe deposit boxes filled with cash. ACE 
and GINGER are closing a large box so crammed with cash that 
ACE has to lean on it for the clasp to lock.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Crooked cops and kidnappers, they 
          don't take checks.

                      GINGER
          Need a little help with that, Mr 
          Collins?

                      ACE (V.O.)
          So, I put two million in cash in a 
          Los Angeles bank under the name of 
          Mr and Mrs Tom Collins. This was 
          strictly my shakedown and kidnapping 
          money.

ACE and GINGER struggle to push the crammed box into a slot 
in the wall.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          And, since I'd either be in jail or 
          locked in a closet when I needed the 
          money the most...

The BANK PRESIDENT joins them, and he and ACE simultaneously 
double-lock the outer safe box door with two separate keys, 
after which, ACE gives GINGER his key.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...I gave Ginger the only key to the 
          cash that could get me back alive.

INT. BANK PRESIDENT'S OFFICE - DAY

GINGER is on the other side of a glass wall, signing papers.

                      BANKER
          Now this is just a signature card.

                      ACE
          So, once she signs those papers, 
          she'll be the only person to have 
          total access to the box?  No one 
          else, including myself?

                      BANKER
          That's right.

We see GINGER looking at ACE.

                      BANKER
          That's the way you wanted it, right?

ACE nods

                      BANKER
               (Quietly.)
          Sam, let me ask you a question. You 
          must really trust your wife.

                      ACE
               (Quietly)
          Yeah, sure I do. Why?

                      BANKER
          No, tha-that's good. It's just 
          unusual. To tell you the truth, so 
          many of my clients don't.

                      ACE
          Well...

ACE looks over to GINGER, smiles and winks. She looks back 
at him.

INT. TANGIERS LOUNGE - NIGHT

JERRY VALE sings to a seated audience. ACE sits alone at a 
table.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          With Ginger and the money in place, 
          I felt covered, and to play it safe 
          I switched job titles again and made 
          myself, um, Food and Beverage 
          Director. This way nobody would bother 
          me about a license. I mean, Vegas 
          was like a dream for me. Trouble 
          was...

NICKY is seated at another table with MARINO, peeling off 
money and giving it to MIKE, a crooked dealer.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...Nicky was dreamin' his own kind 
          of Vegas.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          To begin, I put money out on the 
          streets, chargin' three points a 
          week. You know - juice to the fuckin' 
          dealers.

                      MARINO
               (To MIKE)
          Don't make us come lookin' for you.

                      MIKE
          Oh, you won't have to look for me. I 
          appreciate it. Thanks, Nicky.

                      NICKY
          All right, Mike.

MIKE gets up from the table.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          They were degenerate gamblers, coke 
          freaks. In no time, I had half the 
          dealers in the Tangiers in my pocket.  
          Then...

INT. TANGIERS POKER TABLE - NIGHT

NICKY is at a table with his gang of card sharks: SLIM, ROCKY, 
MOOSH and COWBOY, all secretly signaling each other, 
sandbagging a mark. MIKE, the crooked dealer from the previous 
scene, deals NICKY a winning hand.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...the next thing I did, I started 
          bustin' out high-stakes poker players.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          It was so obvious. I mean, all of 
          Nicky's half-assed mechanics, they 
          were real signal happy.

                      MOOSH
               (Scratching his arm)
          I'm gonna open for five hundred.

                      ROCKY
          Moosh, you open?
               (Taps his fingers on 
               some chips before 
               picking them up.)

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Signaling back and forth.

                      CARD SHARK
          I bet thirty-five hundred.

NICKY wiggles a toothpick back and forth in his mouth.

                      DOCTOR DAN
          I've been losing for three days 
          straight, non-stop.

Another shark pulls on his ear.

                      ROCKY
          Oh, why're you crying, with three 
          loaves of bread under your arm?

ACE watches their signals with concern.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Nicky thought nobody was watching 
          him. But he was wrong.

We see two undercover gaming agents, looking like tourists, 
sneaking looks at NICKY's table.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          And I didn't want any of those agents 
          near my place.

                      NICKY
          Four aces, Doc.

His hands spread five cards on the table, showing four aces.

                      NICKY
          What do you got?

                      DOCTOR DAN
               (Getting up in disgust)
          Jesus Christ. I can't believe it.

COWBOY, the card shark with the cowboy hat, rakes in a large 
pot toward his side of the table.

                      DOCTOR DAN
          If I didn't have bad luck, I wouldn't 
          have any luck. I'm out of here, you 
          understand?

                      ACE (V.O.)
          I mean, I wished to God Nicky and 
          his whole crew would just get lost.

He walks towards NICKY's table.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          What am I gonna do? Go back home and 
          start a war?

ACE leans down to talk to NICKY.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          I mean, Nicky's a made guy and I'm 
          not. I can't do that.

                      ACE
               (Whispering in NICKY's 
               ear)
          Be careful. Gaming agents are all 
          over the place.

                      NICKY
          So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to 
          get lucky in this place?

                      ACE
          You been lucky all week. They're 
          lookin' to nail ya.

ACE walks away. NICKY looks over at the gaming agents.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Ace was so fuckin' worried about his 
          casino, he forgot what we were doin' 
          out here in the first place.

INT. TANGIERS CASINO - NIGHT

Security people are pulling apart a husband and wife who are 
fighting. Camera picks up ACE as he passes by them.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          A million times I wanted to yell in 
          his fuckin' ear: 'This is Las Vegas!  
          We're supposed to be out here robbin',

INT. TANGIERS CASINO POKER TABLE - NIGHT

Closeup of the COWBOY's white-socked feet with no shoes on a 
poker table.

                      ACE
               (To SHERBERT, referring 
               to COWBOY)
          I don't give a shit who he's connected 
          to. Tell him to take his fuckin' 
          feet off the table. What's he think 
          this is, a goddamn sawdust joint?

SHERBERT approaches COWBOY.

                      SHERBERT
          Sir, would you mind taking your feet 
          off the table and putting your shoes 
          on, please?

                      COWBOY
               (Sighs)
          Yeah, I would mind. I'm havin' a bad 
          night.

COWBOY remains the same with his feet on the table.

                      SHERBERT
               (Returning to ACE)
          Fuckin' asshole won't budge.

                      ACE
          Call security.

ACE approaches COWBOY.

                      ACE
          How are you?

                      COWBOY
          Good. How are you?

                      ACE
          Good. You want to do me a favor? You 
          want to take your feet off the table 
          and put your shoes back on?

                      COWBOY
          Fuck you.

ACE walks to nearby SECURITY GUARDS.

                      ACE
               (To GUARDS)
          I want you to exit this guy off the 
          premises, and I want you to exit him 
          off his feet and use his head to 
          open the fuckin' door.

Three SECURITY GUARDS approach COWBOY.

                      SECURITY GUARD #1
          Sir, you're gonna have to leave. You 
          mind accompanying us outside?

                      COWBOY
          Bullshit, I ain't goin' anywhere 
          with you!

                      SECURITY GUARD #1
          Bullshit, you're out of here, cowboy!

SECURITY GUARD #1 knocks his feet off the table, as GUARDS 
#2 and #3 lift him off his seat.

                      COWBOY
          Fuck you! Fuck you!

                      SECURITY GUARD #1
          Yeah?

                      COWBOY
          You know who you're fuckin' with?! 
          Huh? Do you?!

                      SECURITY GUARD #1
          Now move along.

                      COWBOY
               (Screaming at ACE who 
               follows him)
          You fuckin' faggot! Do you know who 
          you're fuckin' with?

The GUARDS carry him out and forcefully shove him towards a 
side exit.

                      COWBOY
          Leave me alone!

                      SECURITY GUARD #1
          Here we go!

                      COWBOY
               (Grunting)
          You've gotta be kidding me!
               (Groans.)

The GUARDS lift him off his feet and, holding him like a 
battering ram, smash his head into the door.

                      ACE (V.O.)
               (As COWBOY is thrown 
               out the door)
          Sure enough, an hour later, I get 
          the call.

INT. VEGAS BAR - NIGHT

NICKY is on a public wall-phone talking to ACE. MARINO is 
staring at the disheveled COWBOY.

                      NICKY
               (Into telephone)
          Ace, what happened over there? I 
          mean, did you know that guy you threw 
          out was with me?

INT. TANGIERS CASINO - NIGHT

ACE is on a Tangiers house phone. SHERBERT looks on.

                      ACE
               (Into telephone)
          No, I didn't know that. But you know 
          what he did?

                      NICKY
               (Over telephone)
          No.

INT. VEGAS BAR - NIGHT

NICKY gives COWBOY a look.

                      ACE
               (Over telephone)
          He insulted Billy. And then I walked 
          over to him politely...

INT. TANGIERS CASINO - NIGHT

                      ACE
               (Into telephone)
          ...and he tells me to go fuck myself.

                      NICKY
               (Over telephone)
          What?

                      ACE
               (Into telephone)
          Then he called me a faggot.

INT. VEGAS BAR - NIGHT

                      ACE
               (Over telephone)
          So what do you think I do? I threw 
          that cocksucker out.

                      NICKY
               (Into telephone)
          What? Ho-
               (He puts down the 
               phone; to COWBOY:)
          Hey, come here.

COWBOY walks up to him.

                      NICKY
          You called my friend a faggot? You 
          tell him to go fuck himself?

                      COWBOY
          Nicky, I did -

                      NICKY
          Is that what you did?

                      COWBOY
          I did - I didn't -

                      NICKY
          Tell him to go fuck himself? You 
          fuckin' hick!  Fuckin'...

NICKY hits him on the head with the phone. COWBOY falls back, 
groaning.

INT. TANGIERS CASINO - NIGHT

ACE listens to the noise of NICKY roughing up COWBOY.

                      NICKY
               (Over telephone)
          ...you big fuckin' hick, you. Come 
          here. Come here. Get him up. Come 
          here.

ACE LOOKS AT SHERBERT.

                      MARINO
               (Over telephone)
          Get up.

INT. VEGAS BAR - NIGHT

                      NICKY
               (To COWBOY)
          Come here, come here.

                      MARINO
          Get up.

                      NICKY
          You go over there right now and you 
          apologize. You better hope he lets 
          you back in.

INT. TANGIERS CASINO - NIGHT

                      NICKY
               (Over telephone)
          If you ever get out of line over 
          there again, I'll smash your fuckin' 
          head so hard...

INT. VEGAS BAR - NIGHT

                      NICKY
               (To COWBOY)
          ...you won't be able to get that 
          cowboy hat on. You hear me? Fuckin' 
          hick.
               (Into telephone)
          Sammy, listen...

          ...this guy obviously doesn't know 
          who he was talkin' to, you understand? 
          He doesn't...

INT. VEGAS BAR - NIGHT

                      NICKY
               (Into telephone)
          ...know that, uh, we're dear friends. 
          I mean, he's already very sorry. 
          But, uh, if you could do me a favor 
          to let him back in, I swear to you 
          he'll never get out of line again. I 
          promise you that.

INT. TANGIERS CASINO - NIGHT

                      ACE
               (Into telephone)
          If he does it again, he's out for 
          good. I don't care what it is, Nick, 
          I'm gonna ha- I'll - I'll never let 
          him in the place again.

                      NICKY
               (Over telephone)
          I'm sorry about this. Really.

          All right, Ace?

                      ACE

          Okay.

                      NICKY
               (Into telephone)
          Thanks, pal.

NICKY hangs up the phone and turns to COWBOY.

                      NICKY
          You took your boots off? You put 
          your feet on the table... you shit-
          kicking, stinky, horse-manure-smellin' 
          motherfucker you!  You fuck me up 
          over there, I'll stick you in a hole 
          in the fuckin' desert! You understand?
               (Slapping him.)
          Go over there and apologize.
               (Kicking the chastened 
               COWBOY away.)
          Go! Get the fuck out of -

                      COWBOY
          Nicky, I'm sorry.

EXT. TANGIERS CASINO - DAY

A tiger leaps towards the camera, which pans over to two 
showgirls and then to ACE's hand holding the key to a Rolls 
Royce. He gives it to JONATHAN and DAVID as reporters rush 
in to photograph the moment.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          You know, Ace could be a very touchy 
          guy, especially when he got bigger 
          and bigger in town. Like when he 
          hired that Jonathon and David and 
          their tigers away from the Palace by 
          buildin' them a new stage and then 
          givin' them a silver Rolls Royce.

INT. BACKSTAGE TANGIERS THEATER - DAY

ACE and SHERBERT watch as a STAGE MANAGER weighs in the 'Femme 
Fatale' Showgirls.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          But I'll tell you, he knew how to 
          bring in the crowds. He knew all the 
          fuckin' angles. He brought over the 
          whole 'Femme Fatale' show from Paris. 
          But he forgot how lazy them European 
          dancin' broads can get. I mean, he 
          had to weigh 'em in once a week to 
          make sure they didn't blow up like 
          fuckin' balloons.

                      ACE
               (To SHOWGIRL)
          You're still eight pounds over.
               (To MANAGER.)
          What's the reason for this?

                      STAGE MANAGER
          Mr Rothstein, sir, let me put her on 
          suspension.

                      ACE
          Never mind the 'sir'. Never mind the 
          'sir'.

                      STAGE MANAGER
          Well, sir, I was just...

                      ACE
          Why is she eight pounds over?

                      STAGE MANAGER
          ...trying to offer you the respect 
          that your...

                      ACE
          I...

                      STAGE MANAGER
          ...position...

                      ACE
          'Mr Rothstein' is good enough.

                      STAGE MANAGER
          Mr Rothstein... well, sometimes, 
          when you reach that pressure point, 
          when you put that pressure point on 
          them, you know, it shows...

                      ACE
          She could at least lose half a pound 
          or a quarter.  Listen...

                      STAGE MANAGER
          ...and she doesn't always -

                      ACE
          ...all you do is give me answers. 
          Just - just give me the right answer.

                      STAGE MANAGER
          But, sir. Well, I don't know why. I 
          guess, maybe, because she's frightened 
          that if she doesn't lose the weight 
          she may even get fired.

                      ACE
          That's right. She will get fired. In 
          fact, I want you to send her back to 
          Paris.

                      STAGE MANAGER
          It's always been our policy -

                      ACE
          No. Just stop everything.

SHERBERT and ACE walk away across a huge stage.

                      SHERBERT
               (To ACE)
          This woman's an institution.

                      ACE
          I don't care what she is. She's an 
          institution, that's the problem. 
          She's lazy.

INT. TANGIERS CASINO SPORTSBOOK - NIGHT

ACE standing in a large space surrounded by giant TV screens 
showing sports events. Around him, long rows of bettors are 
seated at betting stations, lined up at windows, or wandering 
around at the bar. It's like a NASA control room on launch 
day.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Hey, I gotta give the guy credit. He 
          does the most obvious thing. This is 
          the only town in the country where a 
          bookie joint is legit, so, why not 
          take advantage, right?  So... he 
          took bookie joints off the street 
          and then opened them up inside the 
          casino. Well, within a few years, by 
          doin' all of this, he had every casino 
          on the Strip trying to copy off him.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Between...

EXT. BACK ALLEY - NIGHT

NICKY, with MARINO, punching and kicking a man next to the 
open door of his luxury car.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...my innovations...

The man falls to the ground.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...and Nicky's dedication to his 
          job...

NICKY starts kicking him.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...I soon had the best operation on 
          the Strip.

NICKY lifts an empty trash can and shatters the car's 
windshield.

INT. TANGIERS CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT

ACE and NICKY are standing on the casino floor near the slot-
machines. Gamblers are milling about behind them.

                      ACE
          You better watch yourself. There's a 
          lot of heat on you already.

                      NICKY
          Why, somebody's complaining?

                      ACE
          I'm - I'm hearin' things from 
          security. They're all ex-cops. The 
          Sheriff's lookin' to bust your balls. 
          They want to put you in the Black 
          Book.

                      NICKY
          That Black Book is a bunch of 
          bullshit. They got two names in there 
          for the whole country and one of 
          them is still Al Capone.

                      ACE
          Bullshit or no bullshit, they put 
          you in that book, you're gonna be in 
          a lot of trouble. You will not be 
          able to walk into the casino. I'm 
          tellin' you.

                      NICKY
          What am I doin' out here? I'm tryin' 
          to make a livin', that's all.

                      ACE
          I'm just tellin' you. Don't say I 
          didn't warn you.

                      NICKY
          All right.

INT. VEGAS VALLEY COUNTRY CLUB, 1974 - NIGHT

Tight on the filaments of a flash bulb as they ignite.

TV news crews and still photographers are taking pictures of 
ACE and GINGER surrounded by clusters of celebrities and the 
Vegas power elite, including SHERBERT and GREEN, at a black 
tie event.

                      PHOTOGRAPHER #1
          Mrs Rothstein, look straight ahead. 
          Very nice. Thank you.

          Thank you.

          Yes, nice smile.

                      PHOTOGRAPHER #3
          Just look right at the camera. Hold 
          that pose.

We hear GREEN making a speech over flashing cameras and freeze 
frames of himself, SHERBERT, ACE and GINGER.

                      GREEN (O.S.)
          Considering all of his hard work and 
          dedication and the new lifeblood he 
          has instilled in Las Vegas...

We now see GREEN at a mike speaking in front of the seated 
club members.

                      GREEN
          Sam has established himself as an 
          indispensable member of the gaming 
          community. As the head of the Tangiers 
          Gaming Corporation, it's my pleasure 
          to welcome Sam Rothstein to the Vegas 
          Valley Country Club.

Members cheer and applaud as GREEN hands ACE a framed 
citation. It reads: 'This Certificate of Appreciation. Sam 
Rothstein. Charitable Foundations of Greater Las Vegas'. 
They shake hands for the photographers.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Back home, they would have put me in 
          jail for what I'm doing. But out 
          here, they're givin' me awards.

                      ACE
               (Into the microphone)

INT. VEGAS VALLEY COUNTRY-CLUB BANQUET ROOM - NIGHT

A dazzling GINGER moves charmingly about the room chatting 
up top executives, lawyers, judges, bankers and their wives. 
ACE, standing with GREEN and an elderly man, watches her 
work the room.

                      COUNTRY-CLUB WOMAN #1
          Congratulations, sweetheart.

                      GINGER
          Thank you.

                      COUNTRY-CLUB WOMAN #2
          Sam raised more than we've ever raised 
          before.

                      GINGER
          He worked so hard.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          But my greatest pleasure was watchin' 
          my wife, Ginger, work the room.

                      COUNTRY-CLUB MAN #1
          Thank you for everything.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          They all loved her. How could you 
          not live her?

                      GINGER
               (To COUNTRY-CLUB WOMAN 
               #3)
          Hi. Nice to see you.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          She could be the most charming woman 
          you ever saw. People loved to be 
          around her.

                      COUNTRY-CLUB WOMAN #3
          Listen, you've got to bring Amy to 
          Sasha's birthday party because he'd 
          love to have her there.

                      GINGER
          Thanks.

                      COUNTRY-CLUB WOMAN #3
          We'll see you three o'clock Saturday.

                      GINGER
          Thanks. Yes, all right.

                      COUNTRY-CLUB WOMAN #3
          Great.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          She made everybody feel good.

GINGER joins ACE. He smiles proudly.

INT. VEGAS VALLEY COUNTRY-CLUB BANQUET ROOM - NIGHT

GINGER and ACE are off alone by a dining-room table, talking 
intently. A young casino EXECUTIVE interrupts them.

                      EXECUTIVE
          Congratulations, Sam.

                      ACE
               (Shaking his hand)
          Oh, thanks.

The flirting EXECUTIVE looks at GINGER.

                      EXECUTIVE
          Hello, Mrs Rothstein.

                      GINGER
          Hi.

                      EXECUTIVE
          How are you?

                      GINGER
          Oh.

GINGER gives the flirting EXECUTIVE her hand, he kisses it.

                      EXECUTIVE
          You're one of the most gorgeous women 
          I've ever seen. You're a lucky man 
          Mr Rothstein.

ACE watches as GINGER flashes one of her dazzling smiles, 
but he's not sure whether she's flirting. He looks at the 
young man and back at his wife.

                      ACE
          Thank you. Thanks for that compliment.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          He was a young kid from the casino... 
          nice kid...  bright boy. What balls 
          on this fuckin' kid! The next day I 
          fired him.

Freeze frame on ACE smiling at GINGER.

INT. VEGAS BANK VIEWING ROOM - DAY

GINGER, with two-year-old AMY in a stroller, is seated on a 
bench going through large bank vault boxes containing her 
jewels.

                      GINGER
               (To AMY)
          Hey, do you want to see this one? 
          Daddy gave me all this jewelry because 
          he loves me so much. (She places a 
          gold bracelet on AMY's hand.) Put 
          your arm in there.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          But as much as they loved her...

                      GINGER
               (To AMY, wearing the 
               bracelet)
          Oh, fabulous.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...they didn't know what really moved 
          her.

She holds up a necklace to the light.

                      GINGER
          Look at this. Look at this.

CAMERA PULLS AWAY FROM THE DOOR LEADING TO THE VIEWING ROOM 
REVEALING A BANK MANAGER SEATED AT A DESK. WE HEAR GINGER 
AND AMY BEHIND THE DOOR.

                      GINGER (O.S.)
               (From the viewing 
               room)
          Daddy gave me this pin when we were 
          dating.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          And with Ginger happy, I was able to 
          concentrate on what I knew best.

INT. TANGIERS CASINO, SLOT-MACHINES - NIGHT

ACE is talking to DON WARD.

                      WARD
          Loose machines are right back over 
          there.

                      ACE
          What are they doin' way back there? 
          Bring 'em up here where they belong.  
          You can't even see 'em over there.

                      WARD
          Okay, I'll -

                      ACE
          What about the progressives with the 
          high jackpots? Where are they? These 
          machines are hidden.

                      WARD
          Well...

                      ACE
          These are our best machines. They 
          bring all the action. No wonder the 
          drop is off.

                      WARD
          Yeah, okay.

                      ACE
          The action is in the front, not in 
          the back. Bring 'em up front.

                      WARD
          All right, I will, I will.

                      ACE
          Listen to me very carefully. There 
          are three ways of doing things around 
          here. The right way, the wrong way, 
          and the way I do it. You understand?

                      WARD
          I do understand that. I'll get right 
          on it. And thank you.

                      ACE
          Don't thank me, just do it. You're 
          the Slots Manager. I shouldn't have 
          to tell you this.

                      WARD
          Dang, you are right, Mr Rothstein, I 
          am so sorry.

INT. CLASSY RESTAURANT - NIGHT

GINGER follows a snooty MAITRE D' to JENNIFER, already seated 
at a table.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          So, I ended up workin' what? Eighteen-
          hour days?  Ginger was the one who 
          wound up enjoying the best of Vegas.

                      MAITRE D'
               (To JENNIFER)
          Come with me, please. I have a better 
          table for you.  Sorry.

He shows the two of them to the best table in the place.

                      JENNIFER
               (Sitting down next to 
               GINGER)
          So, what'd you say to that fuckin' 
          jerk anyway?

                      GINGER
               (Smiling)
          I told him I was Mrs Sam Rothstein.

                      JENNIFER
               (Chuckles)
          Well, you might as well get somethin' 
          out of it.

GINGER lights a cigarette.

EXT. IDLE SPURS DESERT DINER - DAY

Wide overhead of roadhouse cafe isolated in the middle of 
the desert with a sign out front that reads '60 miles to 
Vegas'.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Well, it wasn't long before what I 
          was afraid was gonna happen, happened. 
          Nicky managed to get himself banned 
          from every casino in Las Vegas, and 
          from then on, I couldn't be seen 
          talkin' to him anywhere in Vegas, or 
          even near it.

                      NICKY
               (From inside the diner)
          What the fuck is that supposed to 
          mean?

INT. IDLE SPURS DESERT DINER - DAY

ACE and NICKY are seated at a table in the empty diner.

                      NICKY
               (Reading from a 
               document)
          ' ...detrimental to gaming. And he 
          will be ejected from any casino in 
          Las Vegas...  and the casinos can be 
          fined as much as a hundred thousand 
          every time he shows up.'
               (He waves the document.)
          Do you believe this shit?

                      ACE
               (Smoking a cigarette)
          Yeah, I believe it. You got banned.

NICKY hisses.

                      NICKY
               (Reading)
          'Who is of notorious and unsavory 
          reputation...'

He angrily wads the document and tosses it across the table.

                      NICKY
          Motherfucker.  Unsavory fuckin'... 
          Is there any way around this?

                      ACE
          Nope, there's no way.

                      NICKY
          Let's say... for instance... I want 
          to go in the restaurant which happens 
          to be in the casino... to get one of 
          those sandwiches I like?

                      ACE
          Forget it. You can't even set foot 
          in the parking lot. That's how serious 
          it is.

                      NICKY
          In other words, I'm fucked.

                      ACE
          In so many words, yes.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          It just didn't sink into his head 
          about the Black Book and what it 
          meant. Not being able to go into a 
          casino is just one thing, but being 
          in this book etched your name into 
          the brains of every cop and FBI agent 
          in the state. I mean, you're listed 
          in there with Al Capone. But Nicky 
          didn't care.

                      NICKY
          I gotta do somethin'. I gotta do 
          somethin'. They ain't gettin' rid of 
          me. They're not gettin' rid of me. 
          I'm staying here. Fuck 'em. Fuck 
          'em.

EXT. GOLD RUSH JEWELER'S - DAY

WE MOVE PAST THE SKULL OF A STEER MOUNTED ON AN EXTERIOR 
WALL AND A WOODEN CIGAR STORE INDIAN STATUE, TO REVEAL 
DOMINICK SANTORO (WHO LOOKS A LITTLE LIKE HIS BROTHER NICKY) 
AND MARINO WHO ARE WAITING INSIDE THE GOLD RUSH. CAMERA COMES 
TO REST ON EXTREME CLOSE-UP OF NICKY'S EYES AS HE STANDS ON 
THE OUTSIDE PORCH.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          So, once they pulled that shit, I 
          started doin' my own things in Vegas 
          nobody ever thought of doin'. To 
          keep an eye on things, I brought in 
          my kid brother Dominick... and some 
          desperadoes from back home and started 
          knockin' over high rollers, casino 
          bosses, bookmakers, anybody, right 
          here in town. I had a good fuckin' 
          crew goin' for me, I'll tell you 
          that.

SAL FUSCO, JACK HARDY and BERNIE BLUE are getting out of a 
car and walking into the jewelry store which is designed to 
replicate an old-fashioned Western town with peaked roofs, 
wooden planked sidewalks and hitching posts. The camera tracks 
by each man as they're introduced.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          I had Sal Fusco, a great second-story 
          guy. Jack Hardy, he worked for a 
          safe company after he did a six-year 
          bit. And then there was Bernie Blue. 
          This guy could bypass any alarm for 
          me. And I opened up my own jewelry 
          store, too: 'The Gold Rush'.

INT. BEDROOM OF LUXURY HOME - NIGHT

NICKY places some jewelry from a vanity table into a sack 
and turns over some family photos. MARINO and HARDY are 
struggling with a safe.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Sometimes I used to go along on a 
          heist just for the fun of it. But I 
          didn't like the people I was rippin' 
          off lookin' at me, so I used to turn 
          their fuckin' pictures around.

                      NICKY
               (To MARINO and HARDY)
          What's takin' so long over there?

                      MARINO
          This peter's a motherfucker.

                      HARDY
               (Grunting)
          It's workin'. Just keep workin' it. 
          It's comin'.

                      NICKY
          Gotta learn how to open these fuckin' 
          things so you won't have to take 
          'em.

INT. GOLD RUSH BACK ROOM - DAY

NICKY is looking at diamonds with MARINO, HARDY and BLUE.

                      NICKY
          Frankie, some of these stones got a 
          lot of niggers in 'em.

ZOOM IN TIGHT ON A DIAMOND.

                      NICKY
          Tell that fuckin' Pepe if he's 
          switching stones on us, he'd better 
          take a fuckin' camel -

Phone rings.

We move past the van to a larger truck parked in an alley. 
Unseen, the truck has an open side door abutting the jewelry 
store's wall. SAL FUSCO and BERNIE BLUE are inside the truck 
drilling into the wall using a heavy-duty battery-powered 
drill. The drill is muffled with sheets of insulation 
material.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          They were always very careful. And 
          they always bypassed the alarms, or 
          else... if not, they'd drill enough 
          holes to knock through the walls 
          with a sledgehammer...

BLUE widens the hole with a hammer muffled with insulation.

EXT. JEWELRY STORE WALL - DAY

A flashbulb explodes.

Cops and detectives are photographing and inspecting holes 
drilled in the wall of the shop, through which the thieves 
have come and gone. The camera moves in through the hole.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Nobody out there was expecting a guy 
          like him.

INT. JEWELRY STORE - DAY

The stunned STORE OWNER looks at the rubble and the empty 
jewelry boxes.

Detectives collect evidence.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          For Nicky, Las Vegas was the fuckin' 
          Wild West.

                      STORE OWNER
               (Leading a detective 
               to his showroom)
          I just got a shipment of diamonds 
          from Israel...

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          But what the fuck they expect from 
          me? I had to earn, didn't I?

INT. PALM SPRINGS JEWELRY STORE - DAY

MARINO stands above two IRANIANS who are looking at the stolen 
gems.

                      IRANIAN #1
          You know, this diamond has flaws in 
          it.

                      MARINO
          No, no, there's no flaws in it.

                      IRANIAN #2
          Don't tell me. I'm doing this for 
          twenty-five years.

                      MARINO
          You better clean your fuckin' loupe. 
          'Cause there's no flaws in these 
          diamonds.

The two IRANIANS speak to each other in Farsi.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Whenever we got local merch, we'd 
          usually send it to Palm Spring or 
          Arizona... LA. I had a couple of 
          sand niggers out there. You know, 
          Arabs.

                      MARINO
          What, are you gonna have a fuckin' 
          meeting here, or are you gonna buy 
          some diamonds?

                      IRANIAN #2
               (Chuckling)
          No, no. I know his language. I'm 
          talking with him.

                      MARINO
          Forty thousand dollars, you can buy 
          the whole package.

                      IRANIAN #1
          Twenty thousand, and that's my final 
          offer and...

                      MARINO
               (To IRANIAN #2)
          All of a sudden he talks English, 
          now.
               (To IRANIAN #1.)
          Let's talk turkey here, how 'bout 
          twenty-five thousand?

IRANIAN #1 laughs.

INT. NICKY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

NICKY and MARINO sneak into the house past JENNIFER who is 
asleep on the sofa in front of a TV set. NICKY takes out a 
key and opens the metal door into his bedroom.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          I actually turned my bedroom into a 
          bank vault where I kept the choice 
          stuff.

                      MARINO
               (Referring to JENNIFER 
               as they pass the 
               kitchen)
          She asleep?

                      NICKY
          Every night, on the couch.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          I couldn't leave it at the Gold Rush 
          in case we got raided by the cops... 
          or if my crew got cute.

Opening the metal door to his bedroom.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          I had the only key.

INT. NICKY'S BEDROOM/CLOSET - NIGHT

Camera pans across bedroom to closet door.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Jennifer didn't give a fuck. She 
          used to fall asleep on the couch 
          watchin' television every night. 
          This stuff was all mine. I didn't 
          send any of this back home.

NICKY opens the closet door. He and MARINO walk in and bend 
down to lift up a small square of carpet to reveal a floor 
safe.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Actually, I couldn't because I wasn't 
          even supposed to be doin' it. The 
          bosses were makin' so much fuckin' 
          money with the casinos
               (unlocking the safe)
          that they didn't want anybody makin' 
          any waves for them.

In the floor safe, there are several handguns and silencers.

FRANK hands NICKY a roll of money.

                      NICKY
          Give all the guys in your crew a 
          piece of that?

                      MARINO
          I took care of everybody.

                      NICKY
          Yeah?  

He searches MARINO's jacket.  

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          That's why there was no real organized 
          street stuff in Vegas before I came 
          here.

NICKY throws the cash in the safe and closes the lid.

INT. NICKY'S HOUSE - DAY

NICKY is being shown papers by CHARLIE CLARK, a heavy-set 
banker with a moustache. They're both seated at a table in 
the living-room.

                      CHARLIE CLARK
          Yeah, that works out.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          But how much cash could I bury in my 
          closet, right?

                      CHARLIE CLARK
          You need to understand, and I - I'm 
          sure you do... that in a venture of 
          this kind, you have to be prepared 
          to take some kind of loss.

                      NICKY
          Oh, listen, I understand that there's 
          always a risk... you know, I might 
          have to take a loss somewhere.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          So I put some of the money into 
          legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. 
          He was Ace's banker.

                      NICKY
          I mean, you will try to push it 
          through, won't you, Mr Clark?

                      CHARLIE CLARK
          Yes.

                      NICKY
          Well, you gotta understand, I'm giving 
          you fifty thousand cash.

CHARLIE CLARK chuckles

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Then I put some more of the money...

INT. LEANING TOWER RESTAURANT, KITCHEN - NIGHT

A prosciutto sandwich is being prepared on a kitchen counter.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...in some legitimate places, like 
          my restaurant.

                      DOMINICK
               (To COOK preparing 
               sandwich)
          Is that the last one?

                      COOK
          Yeah.

He hands the sandwich to DOMINICK who spits in it.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          I had my kid brother, Dominick, run 
          it for me.

                      DOMINICK
               (Spits)
          Fuckers!

DOMINICK wraps it in plastic and puts it into a brown paper 
bag.

INT. LEANING TOWER RESTAURANT - NIGHT

DOMINICK sets the bag with the wrapped sandwich in it on top 
of pizza boxes being held by two uniformed Vegas COPS.

                      DOMINICK
          Here you go, guys.

                      COP #1
          All right. Thanks, a lot.

                      DOMINICK
          Yeah... yeah, enjoy.

                      COP #2
          Yeah.

He shakes COP #2's hand before heading back into the 
restaurant.

                      DOMINICK
          Have a good time.
               (Muttering to himself.)
          Choke on it, ya motherfucker!

                      MAN #1
               (Passing DOMINICK on 
               his way out)
          Hey, Dom.

                      DOMINICK
          Hey, how you doin'?

DOMINICK walks over to some patrons in the bar area. NICKY 
enters, kissing his brother.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants. He 
          was a real restaurant buff. And over 
          the years, he always made money with 
          them.

                      NICKY
               (Looking at one of 
               the patrons)
          Hey, Rich.

THE CAMERA FOLLOWS NICKY AROUND THE RESTAURANT PAST LAS VEGAS 
TYPES - DEALERS, LOUNGE ACTS, SHOWGIRLS, TV AND MOVIE 
CELEBRITIES, WAITRESSES AND BARMEN - WHO USE THE JAMMED PLACE 
AS THEIR HANGOUT.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          In Vegas, he had The Leaning Tower. 
          It was a very popular spot. He had 
          politicians, showgirls and movies 
          stars hangin' out all over the place.

NICKY walks up to STEVE ALLEN and JAYNE MEADOWS seated at a 
table, he whistles their theme tune as he approaches from 
behind.

                      NICKY
          Listen, that show over at the Flamingo 
          gets better and better.

                      STEVE ALLEN
          By the way, Sammy said whenever you 
          have a minute, give him a call.

                      NICKY
          Made a messenger out of you too, 
          huh?

                      STEVE ALLEN
               (Laughs)
          I'll do anything for a buck.

                      NICKY
          He does it. He does it to everybody. 
          Enjoy your dinner.

                      JAYNE MEADOWS
               (Chuckles)
          Thanks.

                      STEVE ALLEN
          Okay, thanks.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          But I gotta tell you, the thing Nicky 
          liked the most was the showgirls, 
          naturally. I mean, to them, Nicky 
          was the movie star.

NICKY walks across the room to MARINO and two showgirls, 
SHELLY and STACY.

                      NICKY
               (To MARINO)
          You walk past me?

                      MARINO
          Hey. This is Shelly.

                      NICKY
          Hey, Shelly.
               (Kisses her hand.)

                      SHELLY
          Hi.

                      NICKY
          How are you? Nice to meet you.

                      MARINO
               (Pointing to STACY)
          And this is Stacy.

                      NICKY
          Stacy.
               (Kisses her hand.)

                      MARINO
               (To the SHOWGIRLS)
          This is Nick.

                      NICKY
          Pleasure.

                      STACY
          Hi, Nick.

                      MARINO
          We're gonna have dinner. Come on.

                      NICKY
          All right, uh,
               (To SHELLY)
          Let's just check the kitchen first. 
          Excuse us one second. Come on, I'll 
          show you.

He takes SHELLY's hand and leads her out.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
               (From following scene)
          'Cause I fly stuff in fresh every 
          day.

INT. LEANING TOWER RESTAURANT, PARKING LOT - NIGHT

NICKY and SHELLY walk across the parking lot and get into 
his two-tone, red and white car.

                      NICKY
          I get bread from back home. I get 
          fish from California. And you can 
          always tell a great kitchen like 
          ours because of the milk-fed veal. 
          That's the secret.

Opening the car door from the passenger's side, she gets in.

                      NICKY
          See, milk-fed veal is pure white. 
          Out here, they got that pink veal. 
          Slide over, honey.

She slides over, he gets into the passenger's seat and closes 
the door.

                      NICKY
          Now, pink veal, you can pound that 
          shit for two days and it'll never 
          get tender, you know what I mean?

SHELLY's head disappears into NICKY's lap.

INT. LEANING TOWER RESTAURANT - NIGHT

FRANK and DOMINICK are at the bar watching as NICKY chastises 
AL, a gambler. The restaurant is empty except for a waiter 
milling around in the background, setting a few tables.

                      AL
          When I left here with the money...

                      NICKY
          Mm.

                      AL
          ...I got muscled on the street.

                      NICKY
          Mm.

                      AL
          A couple of guys, I owe them. So, 
          that's what I did. I gave 'em the 
          money.  That's what I did.

                      NICKY
          Yeah?

                      AL
          Yeah.

                      NICKY
          You call yourself a man? You know 
          you're a lyin', low-life, 
          motherfuckin' gambling degenerate 
          prick? You know that's what you are?  
          Two small kids at home. I gave you 
          money to pay the fuckin' rent and 
          buy groceries, put the heat on. You 
          know your wife called Frankie and 
          told him the fuckin' heat's off?

AL glances over to MARINO.

                      NICKY
          Huh? And you didn't gamble that 
          fuckin' money? You're gonna stand 
          here and tell me that?

He shakes his head 'no'.

                      NICKY
          No, no? You didn't?

                      AL
          I didn't give 'em the m-

                      NICKY
          Don't fuck with me, Al! Don't make a 
          fuck out of me! You want to embarrass 
          me and make a fool out of me?!  You 
          didn't gamble?! Tell me you gambled 
          the fuckin' money, I'll give you the 
          fuckin' money to put the fuckin' 
          heat on! Did you gamble?! Huh?!

The chastised gambler nods 'yes', bowing his head in shame.

                      NICKY
          Fuckin' degenerate, you.

NICKY takes some money from his coat pocket and starts 
counting out some bills.

                      NICKY
          Fuckin' kids at home!  Here.
               (Giving him the money.)
          Get the fuck out of here.

                      AL
          Thanks, Nick.

                      NICKY
          Yeah, thanks.

AL walks out.

                      NICKY
          Let me find out you fucked up, I'll 
          leave you wherever I find you.

INT. NICKY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY

NICKY, worn out from the night before, is making pancakes 
for LITTLE NICKY.

                      NICKY
               (To LITTLE NICKY)
          How many of these you gonna eat, 
          huh?

                      LITTLE NICKY
          Two.

                      NICKY
          Two?

                      ACE (V.O.)
          But around six-thirty in the morning 
          when he finished his day -

NICKY hugs and kisses his son.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          - no matter where he was or what he 
          was doing, he always went home to 
          make breakfast for his son, Nicky-
          Boy.

                      NICKY
               (Pouring some syrup 
               on his son's pancakes)
          Here, let's put a little of this on 
          for you. I know you like this. A 
          little butter, right, not a lot?

                      LITTLE NICKY
          Mm-hm.

                      NICKY
          You know why, right?

                      LITTLE NICKY
          Yeah.

                      NICKY
          Why?

                      LITTLE NICKY
          'Cause it clogs up your heart.

                      NICKY
          What a smart kid you are!
               (Kisses him.)
          Okay, eat.

INT. ALL-AMERICAN GAS STATION, BACK HOME - DAY

MARINO walks through an office past a few hoods.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Every couple of weeks I used to send 
          Marino back to the bosses with a 
          piece of what I made.

TITLE IN: 'BACK HOME'

MARINO walks out of the office and through the garage.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Not a big piece, but fuck them, what 
          did they know? They were fifteen 
          hundred miles away...

EXT. ALL-AMERICAN GAS STATION, BACK HOME - DAY

Wide shot of gas station. There is snow on the ground. The 
cloudy, Midwestern skyline of warehouses and skyscrapers can 
be seen behind the gas station sign: 'All-American Gas'.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...and I don't know anybody who can 
          see that far. Their drop was a truck 
          stop/garage where...

INT. ALL-AMERICAN GAS STATION, GAGGI'S BACK OFFICE - DAY

REMO GAGGI is seated in a chair as MARINO walks in. CURLY, 
one of Gaggi's men, and two of the bosses are there.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...Remo and the guys used to hang 
          out and count their millions.

                      MARINO
          Remo.

He bends down and kisses him.

                      GAGGI
          Hey, Frankie.

                      MARINO
          How are you?

                      GAGGI
          Fine, fine.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          I mean, the cops knew, but they didn't 
          give a fuck. I mean, you know, they 
          all worked it out together.

                      MARINO
          Nicky sends his warmest regards.

MARINO unzips a small sack and hands GAGGI a thick stack of 
cash. GAGGI inspects it before handing it over to one of his 
men.

                      GAGGI
          Uh-huh. Good.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          But I knew how to keep the bosses 
          happy. Whenever they gave me little 
          jobs to do, you know, to send a 
          message, I would carry things out...

                      GAGGI
          And how are things going down there?

                      MARINO
          Fine. Everything's goin' good.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...to a tee. Like the time Tony 
          Dogs...

INT. OUTSKIRTS OF VEGAS BAR - NIGHT

Flash cut of TONY DOGS and two men shooting up a bar with 
automatics hitting the owner, bartenders and a waitress.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...who was supposed to be the new 
          maniac tough guy in town, shot up 
          one of Remo's bars. Here's a fuckin' 
          guy, kills two of Remo's guys and a 
          poor fuckin' waitress, who was just 
          workin' on her night off, of all 
          things.

SLOW MOTION ON TONY DOGS.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          I mean, this guy's just beggin' to 
          be made an example of.

The men and the waitress lie dead on the floor. The bar is 
left in shambles.

                      GAGGI (V.O.)
               (From his office)
          Frankie...

INT. ALL-AMERICAN GAS STATION, GAGGI'S BACK OFFICE - NIGHT

An enraged GAGGI gives MARINO orders.

                      GAGGI
          ...I want all the names of all the 
          other people he had with him. And I 
          don't care what you have to do to 
          him to get 'em. You understand?

                      MARINO
          I'll take care of it, Remo.

                      GAGGI
          E mo va! [Italian-American slang for 
          'Now, go!']

INT. SLOT-MACHINE SHOP, LAS VEGAS - NIGHT

MARINO and BLUE are dragging TONY DOGS, who is beaten to a 
pulp, across the floor towards a workshop table. NICKY follows 
them.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          To be truthful with you, I had to 
          admire this fuckin' guy.  He was one 
          of the toughest Irishmen I ever met.

                      NICKY
          This fuckin' guy, he got some stamina, 
          don't he?

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          This son-of-a-bitch was tough.

                      NICKY
          Personally, I don't give a fuck who 
          was with him anyway. As long as he 
          gives me a name I could give to them.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          For two days and two fuckin' nights, 
          we beat the shit out of this guy. I 
          mean, we even stuck ice-picks in his 
          balls.

                      NICKY
          You better hope he gives me a fuckin' 
          name soon, or I'm gonna give him 
          yours, Frank.

MARINO and BLUE lay DOGS on the table and put his head in a 
vise. They're exhausted from beating him.

                      MARINO
               (To NICKY)
          Yeah, thanks a lot.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          But he never talked.

                      NICKY
               (To MARINO)
          I know you would have ratted by now.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          In the end, I had to put his fuckin' 
          head in a vise.

                      NICKY
          Dogs. Dogs, can your hear me, Dogs?

DOGS gasps and mumbles.

                      NICKY
          Listen to me, Anthony. I got your 
          head in a fuckin' vise. I'm gonna 
          squash your fuckin' head like a 
          grapefruit if you don't give me a 
          name. Don't make me have to do this, 
          please. Come on. Don't make me be a 
          bad guy. Come on.

                      TONY DOGS
               (With what strength 
               he as left)
          Fuck you!

                      NICKY
               (To MARINO and BLUE)
          This motherfucker, do you believe 
          this? Two fuckin' days and nights!
               (To DOGS.)
          Fuck me?

NICKY begins to tighten the vise.

                      NICKY
          Fuck me, you motherfucker?
               (Turning the vise.)
          Fuck my mother? That's what you 
          fuckin' tell me?

NICKY angrily keeps spinning the vise handle until suddenly 
one of DOGS's eyes bulges out of the socket.

                      NICKY
          Huh? You motherfucker, you, huh?

MARINO and BLUE are horrified by the sight. Everybody freezes.

                      NICKY
          Oh, God! Give me the fuckin' name!

                      TONY DOGS
          Ch-Charlie M!

                      NICKY
          Charlie M?

                      TONY DOGS
               (Blood streaming out 
               of his mouth)
          Charlie M.

                      NICKY
               (Screaming)
          Charlie M? You make me pop your 
          fuckin' eye out of your head to 
          protect that piece of shit? Charlie 
          M? You dumb motherfucker!

                      TONY DOGS
               (Pleading)
          Kill me, you fuck, kill me.

                      NICKY
          Kill you,
               (unwinds the crank)
          You motherfucker you!
               (To MARINO.)
          Frankie, do him a fuckin' favor.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          The word got around that finally...

MARINO places a knife against DOGS's neck.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...there was a real gangster in town. 
          Nicky was the new boss of Las Vegas.

We hear DOGS gasp as the knife slices his throat.

                      NICKY
          Charlie M!

INT. TANGIERS CASINO - DAY

Extreme close-up of a slot-machine. Four reels with sevens 
across. Suddenly, the power goes out. Lights die down.. 
Machine 'waaaooows' down to a dead stop.

Security guards, on their hands and knees, are pulling the 
plugs on the three giant $15,000 progressive machines, as 
ACE talks to DON WARD.

                      ACE
          Four reels, sevens across, three 
          fifteen-thousand-dollar jackpots? Do 
          you have any idea what the odds are?

                      WARD
          Shoot, it's gotta be in the millions, 
          maybe more.

                      ACE
          Three fuckin' jackpots in twenty 
          minutes? Why didn't you pull the 
          machines? Why didn't you call me?

                      WARD
          Well, it happened so quick. Three 
          guys won. I didn't have a chance to 
          call you.

                      ACE
          You didn't see the scam? You didn't 
          see what was goin' on?

                      WARD
          Well, there's no way to determine 
          that, Sam.

                      ACE
          Yes, there is. An infallible way! 
          They won!

                      WARD
          Well, it's a casino. People gotta 
          win sometimes.

                      ACE
          Hey... Ward, you're pissin' me off. 
          Now, you're insulting my intelligence. 
          What do you think, I'm a fuckin' 
          idiot? You know goddamn well somebody 
          had to get into those machines and 
          set those fuckin' reels.

SHERBERT enters, stands next to ACE.

                      ACE
          The probability on one-four-reel 
          machine is a million and a half to 
          one. On three machines in a row, 
          it's in the billions.  It cannot 
          happen... would not happen, you 
          fuckin' momo! What's the matter with 
          you!  Didn't you see you were bein' 
          set up on the second win?

                      WARD
          I really think you're -

                      ACE
               (Interrupts)
          You - Wait! You didn't see that you 
          were being set up on the second win?

                      WARD
          I really think you're overreacting 
          in this whole -

                      ACE
               (Interrupts)
          Listen, you fuckin' yokel, I've had 
          it with you. I've been carryin' your 
          ass in this place ever since I got 
          here. Get your ass and get your things 
          and get out of here.

                      WARD
          You're firin' me?

                      ACE
          I'm firin' you? No, I'm not firin'
               (mocking WARD)
          I'm firin' you, you -

Gives SHERBERT a look.

                      WARD
          You might regret this, Mr Rothstein.

                      ACE
          I'll regret it even more if I keep 
          you on.

                      WARD
          This is not the way to treat people.

                      ACE
          Listen, if you didn't know you're 
          bein' scammed, you're too fuckin' 
          dumb to keep this job. If you did 
          know, you were in on it. Either way, 
          you're out!  Get out! Go on.
               (To SHERBERT.)
          Let's go.

ACE and SHERBERT walk off, WARD turns to leave.

INT. TANGIERS CASINO, AKU-AKU LOUNGE - DAY, AN HOUR LATER

ACE and GREEN are seated having coffee and muffins in the 
Hawaiian lounge by the casino floor.

                      ACE
          I mean, the guy is history as far as 
          I'm concerned. History.

                      GREEN
          But you can't just fire him. Webb's 
          his brother-in-law. He's County 
          Commissioner.

                      ACE
          So what? Everybody out here with 
          cowboy boots is a fuckin' county 
          commissioner or related to a county 
          commissioner. I'm fuckin' sick of 
          it.

                      GREEN
          This is his state. His uncle's Chief 
          Judge. His brother-in-law runs the 
          County Commission. I don't know how 
          many other relatives he's got in 
          town.  There's gotta be a way to 
          work him back in.

                      ACE
          Phil, I can understand. You're in 
          the finances, you're upstairs, but 
          you are not on the floor. I got 
          thousands of players. I got five 
          hundred dealers.  They're all lookin' 
          to rob me blind, twenty-four hours a 
          day. I have to let them know I'm 
          watching all the details, all the 
          time; that there is not one single 
          thing I will not catch as I am over 
          here.

Green's.

                      ACE
          Look at yours.

                      GREEN
          What?

                      ACE
          Look at that. Look at this. There's 
          nothin'... look how many blueberries 
          your muffin has and how many mine 
          has. Yours is falling apart. I have 
          nothing.

                      GREEN
          What are you talking about?

                      ACE
          It's like everything else in this 
          place. You don't do it yourself, it 
          never gets done.

GREEN follows ACE to the kitchen.

                      GREEN
          Where you goin'?

INT. TANGIERS KITCHEN - DAY

ACE, GREEN and the BAKER are gathered around the BAKER's 
counter surrounded by muffin tins and batter.

                      ACE
               (Handing the BAKER 
               the two muffins)
          From now on I want you to put an 
          equal amount of blueberries in each 
          muffin. An equal amount of blueberries 
          in each muffin.

                      BAKER
          You know how long that's going to 
          take?

                      ACE
          I don't care how long it takes. Put 
          an equal amount in each muffin.

ACE leaves, GREEN looks on in amazement as the BAKER holds 
the muffins. GREEN follows ACE out.

INT. ACE'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY

ACE, seated at the kitchen table, is feeding AMY in a high 
chair. The nanny is in the background.

                      ACE
          Come on, honey, just a little. That 
          a girl, that a girl. Oh, boy, look.

GINGER enters and goes to the sink.

                      ACE
               (To AMY, who is sobbing 
               and mumbling)

                      ACE
          What do you need?

                      GINGER
               (Giving AMY to the 
               NANNY)
          You get her?  Okay.
               (To ACE.)
          Well, I need a lot. I need more than 
          usual.

                      ACE
          Well, why don't you take it out of 
          your account? There's a lot there.

                      GINGER
          Well, I would, you know, Sam. It's 
          just that... well, I need more than 
          that. I need twenty-five thousand.

She sits down at the table next to him.

                      ACE
          Twenty-five thousand? For yourself?

               (Picking up an empty 
               carton of milk)
          Yeah.

                      ACE
          Why do you need that much?

                      GINGER
          Well, what's the difference? I just 
          need it.

                      ACE
          Well, I mean... you know, I gotta 
          ask you. That's a lot of money.  
          You're not asking for a box of 
          popcorn, you know. I mean...

                      GINGER
          I'm aware of that. We don't have to 
          turn this into a big deal.
               (Getting up to the 
               refrigerator.)
          Okay? We don't have to have a fight. 
          It was important to me. But forget 
          it. Just something I wanted to do 
          for myself.

                      ACE
          Who's fighting? I mean, I'm, you 
          know, tell me what it's for.

GINGER, annoyed, closes the refrigerator door.

                      ACE
          Why can't you tell me what it's for?

She stirs her coffee.

                      ACE
          Huh?
               (Pause)
          Well, you know what? Now, I want you 
          to tell me. I mean, my wife comes to 
          me and asks me for twenty-five 
          thousand. I mean, what do you want? 
          Do you want a coat?

                      GINGER
          No.

                      ACE
          Well, if you want a coat, you got 
          it. You know that. It's not the money, 
          it's just why do you want it?  That's 
          all I'm askin'. Am I not entitled to 
          that?

                      GINGER
          Look - Sam, I've been independent my 
          whole life. I never had to ask anybody 
          for anything. Now you're making me 
          beg you for this.

                      ACE
          What are you talkin' a- ?

                      GINGER
               (Interrupting)
          Okay? And you're embarrassing me. 
          Why do want to make me feel so bad?

                      ACE
          You're askin' me for twenty-five 
          thousand. I'm not out to make you 
          feel bad. I want to just be able to 
          trust you. You now, it's about trust. 
          I have to be able to trust you with 
          my life. Do you understand? Can I 
          trust you?
               (She doesn't answer.)
          Can I trust you?... Can I trust 
          you?... Answer me. Can I trust you?

                      GINGER
               (Quietly)
          You can trust me.

                      ACE
          Good, so then you could tell me what 
          the money is for.

GINGER gives him a look and leaves.

INT. VEGAS BANK VAULT - DAY

GINGER takes about two inches of $100 bills out of a safe 
deposit box and slips it in an envelope.

EXT. VEGAS/BANK/PUBLIC PHONE - DAY

NICKY is on a phone watching GINGER leave the bank.

                      NICKY

          Yeah, she's leavin' the bank now. 
          All right, I'm gonna follow her.
               (He hangs up.)

INT. SALVADORAN DINER BOOTH - DAY

GINGER is in a booth with LESTER DIAMOND, handing him the 
envelope filled with money.

                      LESTER
          What does that mean? No, I know that 
          look. What does that mean?

                      GINGER
          It means I got the money.

                      LESTER
          You got money. That's a - That's a 
          good look.

SWISH PAN TO ACE ENTERING, FOLLOWED BY A HOOD. HE SITS DOWN 
AT THE BOOTH WITH LESTER AND GINGER.

                      ACE
          How you doin', Les? It's Lester, 
          right? Sam.

Extends his hand to LESTER, who shakes it.

                      ACE
          From my recollection, aren't you the 
          card shark... the golf hustler...  
          the pimp from Beverly Hills?

LESTER gives GINGER a 'how did you fuck this up?' Look.

                      ACE
          If I'm wrong, please correct me, 
          'cause I never knew you to be a heist 
          man.
               (LESTER sighs.)
          But if you are, you know what... 
          here, take mine too.

ACE takes some money out of his coat and puts the thick wad 
of bills on the table.

                      ACE
          Go ahead, take it. 'Cause you already 
          have hers.

LESTER turns and sees two HOODS standing by the front and 
back doors of the diner.

                      ACE
          She's my wife.
               (To LESTER.)
          Look at me. You did know that, didn't 
          you? You knew that she's my wife? 
          Huh? Hey, look at me.

                      LESTER
          Yeah, yeah. I know that.

                      ACE
          You do? Yeah? Well, if you ever come 
          back again... ever... to take her 
          money... next time bring a pistol.  
          That way you got a chance. Be a man, 
          don't be a fuckin' pimp. Now, you 
          want to do me a favor? Get out of 
          here. I want to be alone with my 
          wife. Get the fuck up and get out of 
          here.

After stammering for a moment, LESTER gets up and begins to 
move towards the back door.  

                      LESTER
               (Quietly)
          Okay.

                      ACE
          You fuckin' piece of shit.

                      LESTER
          Hey, that's just fuckin' - That's 
          bullshit. You know, you know, what 
          the fuck?

The thugs follow him out of the back door. GINGER freezes.

                      ACE
          You remember when you called him 
          that night? When you said goodbye to 
          him?  He didn't say, 'Don't get 
          married, I'll be right down, we'll 
          get married.'  He didn't say that to 
          you, did he?

                      GINGER
               (Whispering)
          No, he didn't.

                      ACE
               (Picks up the money)
          Didn't. No, instead, what did he 
          say? 'Fuck him. Take him for 
          everything he's got.'

ACE takes GINGER by the arm to the rear of the diner where 
they can see the parking area through a glass door.

                      ACE
          Come here, I want to show you 
          somethin'.

EXT. REAR OF SALVADORAN DINER, PARKING LOT - DAY

Three HOODS rush LESTER who is running towards his car. GINGER 
bursts through the doors, trying to get to LESTER. ACE holds 
her back. They struggle. LESTER groans and gasps as the HOODS 
start to beat him up.

                      HOOD #1
          You fuckin' shit.

                      GINGER
          No! No! No! Don't!

ACE restrains her.

The HOODS punch LESTER in the face and stomach.

                      GINGER
          Make them stop it!
               (Sobbing.)
          No! No! No! It's not his fault! It's 
          my fault!

NICKY watches from a car in a parking lot across the street, 
out of GINGER's sight.

ACE forces GINGER into the car as the HOODS finish the 
beating.

                      GINGER
               (Sobbing)
          No! No!

The HOODS toss LESTER into his car.

                      LESTER
               (Falling into the 
               front seat on his 
               back.)
          Fuck!

NICKY watches as the HOODS walk away from LESTER's car.

                      LESTER
          Fuck you!

                      HOOD #2
          You piece of shit.

ACE pulls out of the parking lot with a wailing GINGER.

LESTER groans, trying to sit up.

                      LESTER
               (As ACE and GINGER 
               drive off down the 
               street)
          Couldn't do it yourself, you 
          chickenshit cocksucker!

INT. GOLD RUSH BACK ROOM - DAY

GINGER and NICKY are in the back room. NICKY is sitting on a 
couch while GINGER stands by a mirror with a curling iron.

                      GINGER
               (Throwing the iron on 
               the counter)
          He's such a prick. He had some guy 
          from the hotel beat him up. He didn't 
          want to do it himself. Oh, no, he 
          didn't want to get his own hands 
          dirty.

She takes a pill with a drink.

                      GINGER
          So, why'd he have to do that, huh?

She walks towards NICKY, who is sitting on a couch across 
the room.

                      GINGER
          Tell me.

                      NICKY
          I know it wasn't a nice thing to do 
          but -

                      GINGER
               (Interrupts)
          Yeah, no shit.

She sits down next to NICKY.

                      NICKY
          Well, you gotta understand it. He 
          doesn't know if this guy is shaking 
          you down or taking advantage of you.

                      GINGER
          No! No! I told him all about the guy 
          before we ever got married. This is 
          no fuckin' surprise.

                      NICKY
          Oh, you did? I didn't know that.

                      GINGER
          Yeah. He's just a friend of mine I 
          was trying to help, so... so what?

                      NICKY
          You know... the first time I ever 
          saw your guys together... I never 
          saw him so happy. I mean, I know 
          he's a crazy Jew fuck and everything, 
          but...

She smiles.

                      NICKY
          I never see - You know, I never seen 
          him act like that with anybody else.  
          I think he's crazy about you. I mean, 
          he really loves you. He does.

                      GINGER
          Oh, come on. I went into this with 
          my eyes open, you know. I knew the 
          bottom could drop out at any time. 
          I'm a working girl, right?  You don't 
          think I'm gonna go into a situation 
          like this if I don't think I'm gonna 
          get covered on the back end.

                      NICKY
          Sure.

                      GINGER
          Am I right?

                      NICKY
          I can see that. Sure.

                      GINGER
          So, he put aside some jewelry for 
          me. A lot of jewelry.

                      NICKY
          You mean, like a lot of expensive 
          jewelry? About how much?

                      GINGER
          Mm, you want to steal it?
               (Cracking a smile.)

                      NICKY
          No. I - I'm just curious, you know. 
          I was wonderin' how much he would 
          put into a thing like that. That's 
          all.

                      GINGER
          I'm told it's worth about a million 
          dollars, maybe more. 
               (Sniffs.)

                      NICKY
          Well, there you go. But what does 
          that tell ya? A million dollars in 
          jewelry. Does that tell you the guy 
          is crazy about you, or what?

                      GINGER
          I should have never married him. 
          He's a Gemini. A triple Gemini...  
          duality.
               (Breaking down.)
          Gemini's the snake. You know you 
          can't trust the snake.
               (Sniffs.)
          I mean it.

                      NICKY
          I know what you mean.

He moves closer to her.

                      NICKY
          Listen, Ginger... you know, this is 
          probably not... I don't have the 
          answers anyway... and this is probably 
          not what you want to hear right now, 
          because you're a little upset with 
          Ace.

                      GINGER
          I do.

                      NICKY
          I understand that. But, you know, I 
          think you should try to make the 
          best of it now. Go slow, you know. 
          See what happens.

                      GINGER
          He could have killed him! Okay? He 
          could have killed him. 

She gets up and walks to the counter by the mirror.

                      GINGER
          He didn't have to hit him. It's not 
          exactly like I'm sleepin' with the 
          guy! And he makes me sneak around to 
          see my own friends! What the fuck is 
          that all about?

                      NICKY
          Well, I guess it's 'cause he loves 
          you so much. He's jealous and worried.

                      GINGER
               (Sighs, her voice 
               starts to crack)
          He gives a fuck what I do?

                      NICKY
               (Getting up)
          Look, I'll try to find out what the 
          hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll 
          talk to him.

                      GINGER
          Okay.

                      NICKY
          All right?

                      GINGER
          Yeah.
               (Walking over to him, 
               smiling.)
          Thanks.

Towering over NICKY, holding a drink in one hand and his 
shoulder in the other, she leans down and kisses him.

                      GINGER
          Thanks for puttin' up with me.

NICKY takes the drink out of her hand.

                      NICKY
          And take it easy with this shit, 
          will you? I mean, this can only make 
          matters worse.

                      GINGER
          Oh, come on.

                      NICKY
          You're a beautiful girl. You don't 
          want to ruin your looks. I've seen a 
          lot of girls get shot to hell from 
          this stuff.

                      GINGER
               (Fidgeting with his 
               jacket, then holding 
               his face in her hands, 
               smiling.)
          You're so nice.
               (She begins to cry.)

                      NICKY
          Come on, now, I don't want to see 
          you unhappy.

She kisses him.

                      GINGER
               (Tenderly strokes his 
               head)
          Thanks.

                      NICKY
          Yeah.

She embraces NICKY, wrapping her arms around him.

                      GINGER
               (Through tears)
          Thank you.

                      NICKY
               (Feeling a little 
               awkward with the hug)
          It's all right.

She kisses him again. NICKY doesn't move, holding back.

A very patient WEBB is leaning against some double doors 
across from Ace's SECRETARY.

                      SECRETARY
          Mr Webb...  Can I get you anything?

                      WEBB
          Oh, no.
               (Cordially tipping 
               his hat.)
          No, thank you, little lady.

INT. ACE'S OFFICE - DAY

                      ACE
               (Into telephone)
          Okay, send him in and call me four 
          minutes after.

WEBB walks in. He is big, tough and western, wearing a 
Stetson, tooled boots, jeans, an elbow-patched jacket and a 
turquoise bear claw string-tie. His headband contains a 
rattlesnake head. Ace's SECRETARY shuts the door on her way 
out.

                      WEBB
          Mr Rothstein...
               (With hand outstretched 
               to ACE.)
          I'm Pat Webb.

                      ACE
          How do you do?

They shake hands.

                      WEBB
          Hey, it is my pleasure.

                      ACE
          Yeah, I heard a lot about you.

                      WEBB
          Oh, thank you, sir.

Looking out Ace's office picture window overlooking the 
sportsbook.

                      WEBB
          Hey, house is doin' well.
               (Chuckling.)
          Hey, all that money is rollin' in. I 
          appreciate you takin' the time to 
          see a poor ol' civil servant.

                      ACE
          No, that's quite all right.

TILT UP FROM WEBB'S SNAKESKIN COWBOY BOOTS AND ACE'S BLUE 
SHOES AS THEY CONTINUE TALKING.

                      ACE
          Why don't you have a seat?

                      WEBB
          Hm? Oh. Thank you, sir.

WEBB sits down in a chair in front of ACE's desk.

                      WEBB
          Uh, I come here personally to kind 
          of smooth over a fracas about a 
          certain matter. See, uh, maybe you 
          didn't know it, but, uh, Don Ward is 
          a very well-liked man in this town.  
          He's got lots of friends here. Now, 
          his family and their money go back 
          many, many years. Now, friends vote... 
          family and money votes. That's 
          important to me... and you. And if 
          you'll think about our little problem 
          along them lines...  and you forgive 
          me for sayin' it, maybe he did not 
          deserve to be fired.

                      ACE
          I'm sorry, but he knew about our 
          gettin' hit on three big machines in 
          a row and he did nothing about it.  
          That means either he was in on it 
          or, forgive me for saying this, he 
          was too dumb to see what was going 
          on. Either way, I cannot have a man 
          like that workin' here.

                      WEBB
          Before we point the dirty end of the 
          stick at 'ol Don, uh, we better be 
          sure we can prove them charges.

                      ACE
          Believe me, if I could prove it, he 
          would be under arrest.

                      WEBB
          Are, uh -
               (Clears throat.)
          - are we certain that you want the 
          Gamin' Control Board eyeballin' your 
          record and your gangster pals like 
          Nicky Santoro?

                      ACE
          I think you're way out of line talkin' 
          to me like that. What you're sayin' 
          is libelous, and you're in no position 
          to challenge my expertise. I went 
          way out of my way to be very helpful 
          and courteous to that kid. He's weak, 
          he's incompetent. He jeopardizes the 
          whole place. There's not much more I 
          can do for him.

                      WEBB
               (Chuckling)
          You have got me there. Old Don is as 
          useless as tits on a boar.
               (Chuckles.)
          But, he is my brother-in-law, and I 
          would look on it as a personal favor 
          if you'd think some more on hirin' 
          him back.

                      ACE
          I can't do that. And I appreciate 
          the fact that he's your brother-in-
          law, and I do want to help you and I 
          like to do favors, and I know who 
          you are, but I cannot do that.

                      WEBB
          Well, could there be any position... 
          further down the trough?

                      ACE
               (Pause)
          I'm sorry, I can't do anything. He's 
          too incompetent. And the bottom line 
          is, he cannot be trusted.

The telephone rings. ACE picks it up.

                      ACE
               (Into telephone)
          Okay, thanks.
               (To WEBB.)
          Um... you know, that's it. I'm sorry.

                      WEBB
          Mr Rothstein. Your people never will 
          understand the way it works out here. 
          You're all just our guests. But you 
          act like you're at home. Let me tell 
          you somethin', partner... you ain't 
          home. But that's where we're gonna 
          send you if it harelips the Governor.
               (Pause.)
          Thank you for your time.

                      ACE
          No problem.
               (Getting up and shaking 
               hands.)
          Sorry.

                      WEBB
               (Smiles slightly)
          You bet.

INT. ACE'S HOUSE, BATHROOM/BEDROOM - DAY

ACE, in pain from his ulcer, opens a bottle of pills in his 
bathroom and sees that it is almost empty.

                      ACE
          What happened to my pills?

He leaves the bathroom and walks into the bedroom where GINGER 
is stretched out on their imperial bed.

                      GINGER
          Huh?

                      ACE
               (Waving the pill bottle)
          Isn't it bad enough you're drinkin' 
          too much, you're takin' all my pills 
          too?

                      GINGER
          I didn't take your pills.

                      ACE
          Look - for my ulcer, I take a half a 
          one of these, a half a one of these.  
          And that's when I have extreme pain. 
          I had a three-month supply. What'd 
          you do with 'em?

                      GINGER
               (Sobbing)
          You didn't have to beat him up!

                      ACE
               (Walking back to the 
               bathroom)
          What?

ACE puts the bottle into the medicine cabinet.

                      GINGER
               (Sobbing)
          I was just tryin' to help him. It's 
          not like I'm sleeping with the guy!

                      ACE
          Yeah, how do I know?

                      GINGER
               (Sobbing)
          You can't make me stop caring...

                      ACE
          What? What?!

                      GINGER
          I said, you can't make me stop caring 
          about people.

She starts to cry.

                      ACE
               (Trying to calm her)
          Listen.
               (Stepping up to the 
               bed.)
          Ginger. I'm tryin' to make the best 
          of everything here, you know?  I 
          mean, you're my wife, for chrissakes. 
          Uh, I mean... people look up to you 
          in this town. I don't know what to 
          think -

                      GINGER
               (Interrupts)
          You know what, Ace? I don't give a 
          shit! I'm gettin' out of here.
               (Crying.)
          I am.

She sits up woozy, and tries to pull on her trousers.

                      ACE
               (Walking around the 
               bed to her)
          It's okay.  Look...
               (holding her face, 
               gently)
          ...you gotta get a hold of yourself.

                      GINGER
          Okay.

                      ACE
          If not for me, at least for Amy.

                      GINGER
               (Sobbing)
          Okay, okay.

                      ACE
               (Gently)
          You understand? Your drinking's 
          gettin' way out of hand. I'm gonna 
          get you into a program. They got 
          plenty of good ones.

                      GINGER
          I don't need one.

                      ACE
          Yes, you do. It's very discreet. 
          There's no names in the papers. You 
          don't have to worry about any of 
          that stuff.

                      GINGER
          That's all you care about.
               (Collapsing on the 
               edge of the bed.)
          You don't care about me at all.

                      ACE
               (Bending down to her)
          Yes, I - yes, I do.

                      GINGER
          No, you don't.

                      ACE
          How could you say that?  You're a 
          beautiful woman. You're destroying 
          yourself. You don't need that stuff. 
          You don't need that fuckin' leech 
          livin' off you. I know you better 
          than you know yourself. You're a 
          tiger, you're stronger than I am.  
          And when you set your mind on doing 
          something, you do it better than 
          anybody.
               (Strokes her hair. 
               Then, quietly:)
          You can do it.
               (Kissing her.)
          You can do it.

                      GINGER
               (Sobbing)
          Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay.  Okay... 
          I'll try. I'll try.

She sits up and puts her arms around ACE's waist. He strokes 
her head.

                      GINGER
          I'll try. I will. Don't be mad at 
          me, okay... I will.

INT. TANGIERS HARD COUNT ROOM - DAY

Move in on a door that reads: 'Notice - No Admittance - 
Caution - Hearing Protection Must Be Worn In This Area'. 
NANCE opens it with a key to reveal the hard count room. 
Coins tumble of a conveyor belt.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          No matter what the problems were 
          outside the count room, it was all 
          worth it. The cash kept rollin' in. 
          And the...

EXT. CASINO REAR LOADING PLATFORM - DAY

NANCE, dumping two large suitcases in the trunk of a car.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...suitcases kept comin' and goin'. 
          And let me tell ya, the fuckin' bottom 
          line here is... cash.

The trunk lid is shut.

INT. TANGIERS SOFT COUNT ROOM - DAY

The counters sort through a pile of cash on a table. The 
camera moves on one counter as he pockets some cash.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          The only problem was that, after a 
          while, the bosses noticed that the 
          suitcases were gettin' a little light.

INT. SAN MARINO ITALIAN GROCERY/BACK ROOM, KANSAS CITY - DAY

NANCE is seated at a table eating with FORLANO, CAPELLI, 
CAPP, BORELLI, PISCANO and GAGGI.

                      BORELLI
          Aspett'. [Italian-American slang for 
          'Wait'] Wait a minute. You mean to 
          tell me that the money we're robbing 
          is bein' robbed? That somebody's 
          robbing from us?  We go through all 
          this fuckin' trouble, and somebody's 
          robbin' us?

                      GAGGI
               (To NANCE)
          Eh?

                      NANCE
          Like I said, you know, i-it's part 
          of the business. I-it's considered 
          leakage.

                      BORELLI
          Leakage, my balls. I want the guy 
          who's robbin' us.

INT. TANGIERS HARD COUNT ROOM - DAY

NANCE enters through a door and walks past a man picking up 
a bucket of coins and dumping them into a trough. A clerk, 
seated at a coin weighing scale, places a ticket into a small 
tray. NANCE reads the printout of the machine.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Even John Nance, that's the guy who 
          ran the skim, he knew there wasn't 
          much you could do about it. You gotta 
          know that a guy who helps you steal, 
          even if you take care of him real 
          well, I mean, he's gonna steal a 
          little bit extra for himself. Makes 
          sense, don't it? Right? Well, you go 
          try and make these hard-headed old 
          greaseballs understand that.

INT. SAN MARINO ITALIAN GROCERY/BACK ROOM, KANSAS CITY - DAY

                      BORELLI
          What's the point of skimming if we're 
          being skimmed? Defeats the whole 
          purpose of what we're doin' out there.

                      GAGGI
               (To NANCE)
          Huh?

                      NANCE
          You know, they take this money because 
          they're my guys. So you gotta give 
          'em some leeway.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          But the bosses never believed in 
          leeway, so listen to what they do: 
          they...

INT. SAN MARINO ITALIAN GROCERY/BACK ROOM, KANSAS CITY - DAY

BORELLI is talking to PISCANO, his underboss.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...put Artie Piscano, the underboss 
          of KC, in charge of making sure nobody 
          skimmed the skim.

                      BORELLI
          What the hell have you been doin' 
          out there?

                      PISCANO
          I was out there with my cumma [Italian-
          American slang for 'girlfriend'.]

                      BORELLI
          Your cumma? What are you doin' with 
          your cumma?

                      PISCANO
          What else? I gave her a schaff 
          [Italian-American slang for 'tap'.]

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          The only trouble was, Piscano was a 
          disaster. This guy could fuck up a 
          cup of coffee.

                      BORELLI
          Artie, what the hell have you been 
          doin' out there, Artie?

                      PISCANO
          I'm out there more than I'm here.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          And little did anybody know where 
          this would all lead. If they did, 
          they would have been better off makin' 
          fuckin' novenas.

                      BORELLI
          You gotta go back there and talk to 
          that guy.

                      PISCANO
          Come on, go back there? I never got 
          paid my expenses for the last trip.

                      BORELLI
          What expenses?

                      PISCANO
          Well, I'm goin' all over, layin' 
          money out of my own pocket, and I 
          never get anything back. What the 
          hell's goin' on?

                      BORELLI
          You gotta go back out there.

                      PISCANO
          Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna 
          start keepin' records.

                      BORELLI
          Artie, no records, Artie. What are 
          you gonna do with records? Pay taxes?

INT. TANGIERS, GREEN'S OFFICE - DAY

GREEN is arguing with ANNA SCOTT, a fifty-year-old no-nonsense 
businesswoman.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...was gonna stop what came up next 
          at the casino.

                      GREEN
          I can't believe you're doing this.

                      SCOTT
          We made a deal. You came to me, 
          remember?

                      GREEN
          Yes, I appreciated your advice...

                      ACE (V.O.)
          It turned out Phil Green, Mr 
          Integrity, had a partner nobody knew 
          about... and when she showed up and 
          started demanding some money from 
          the Tangiers...

                      GREEN
          Why are you doing this to me?

                      SCOTT
          Because you're wrong.

                      GREEN
          I'm not wrong.

                      SCOTT
          Yes, you are.

                      GREEN
          No, I am not wrong.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...Green tried to stonewall her.

                      SCOTT
          And you're not going to get away 
          with this! I will see to it that you 
          do not get away with this!

She walks out.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          So...

INT. COURT-ROOM - DAY

A JUDGE is seated at his bench. SCOTT and GREEN, surrounded 
by their lawyers, take their seats. NANCE watches from the 
back row.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...she sued him in court.

                      JUDGE
          The court will now hear the matter 
          of the plaintiff, Anna Scott, against 
          Tangiers Corporation and its 
          president, Philip Green.

                      LAWYER #1
          Good morning, your Honor. John Momet 
          on behalf of Mr Green.

                      LAWYER #2
          Mitchell Logan on behalf of Anna 
          Scott, your Honor.

                      JUDGE
          Mr Logan, you may proceed.

                      LAWYER #2
          Thank you, Judge.

As the JUDGE pounds his gavel, we see ANNA SCOTT and a grim 
GREEN.

INT. COURT-HOUSE CORRIDOR - DAY

ANNA SCOTT holds an impromptu press conference.

                      SCOTT
          I believe he was absolutely fair and 
          I'm delighted with the decision.

NANCE is talking at a pay phone, SCOTT and the reporters are 
in the background.

                      NANCE
               (Into telephone)
          We got a problem.

INT. ALL-AMERICAN GAS STATION, GAGGI'S BACK OFFICE, BACK 
HOME - DAY

CURLY hands GAGGI the phone. He listens.

                      NANCE
               (Over telephone)
          It didn't go too well.

INT. COURT-HOUSE CORRIDOR - DAY

                      NANCE
               (As GREEN and his 
               lawyers walk past 
               him, exiting the 
               court-house)
          Green has to open up the books... 
          has to show how he got the financing. 
          And, hey, that's - that's not good.

INT. ALL-AMERICAN GAS STATION, GAGGI'S BACK OFFICE, BACK 
HOME - DAY

GAGGI, holding a cigarette, snaps his fingers in disgust, 
grunts, and slams down the phone. He men watch in silence.

                      GAGGI
          Shit.

CURLY takes the phone away.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          She was doin' pretty good with her 
          lawsuit, but before she could start 
          countin' her money, the boys back 
          home decided to settle the case out 
          of court instead.

INT. ANNA SCOTT'S HOME, KITCHEN, LAS VEGAS - DAY

SCOTT, alone, is sitting at her kitchen table.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          So, they send me.

NICKY swiftly enters the room, grabs SCOTT around the neck, 
and fires three shots into her head.

He leans SCOTT back against the chair, then gently, while 
stroking her hair, sets her head to the side. Blood flows 
from her mouth on to her pink robe.

NICKY grabs his gun and leaves.

Reporters are heard shouting 'Mr Green'.

EXT. LAS VEGAS PRIVATE AIRPORT - MORNING

GREEN gets off the Tangiers corporate jet and is assaulted 
by questions about the Scott murder. GREEN is stunned.

                      REPORTER #1
          Can you comment on the murder of 
          Anna Scott?

                      GREEN
          What are you talking about?

                      REPORTER #1 (O.S.)
          She was found last night, shot in 
          the head.

                      REPORTER #2 (O.S.)
          Was this just a real-estate 
          partnership?

                      REPORTER #3 (O.S.)
          Her lawyer said you were partners.

                      GREEN
          We were - We were involved in minor 
          real estate deals many years ago.  
          It was never a partnership.

Reporters chase CHASE as he walks down the ramp and across 
the tarmac to his white limousine.

                      REPORTER #1
          Police are calling this a mob-style 
          killing.

                      REPORTER #2
          Did you ever hear of the twenty-two-
          caliber killer?

                      GREEN
          I'm a little in shock, quite 
          frankly...

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Now, instead of the cops only lookin' 
          at Nicky, they started looking at 
          Green too. And he was supposed to be 
          our squeaky...

INT. ACE'S OFFICE - DAY

ACE is being interviewed by a female Business Week REPORTER. 
SHERBERT and RONNIE are sitting on a couch, listening to the 
interview. The REPORTER is seated across from ACE, at his 
desk.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...clean front man. So, I had to 
          start giving interviews to make sure 
          everybody knew the casino was on the 
          up and up.

                      REPORTER
          So, actually, how often do you really 
          fill in for him?

ACE looks at SHERBERT.

                      SHERBERT
               (to REPORTER, who 
               looks his way.)
          Green's here about two or three times 
          a month, and he's busy -
               (REPORTER glances 
               back at ACE.)
          - with other real-estate deals and - 
          and things, you know.

                      REPORTER
               (To ACE)
          So, in Green's absence, then, you're 
          the boss.

                      ACE
          I serve at the pleasure of the 
          chairman of the board and... my, uh, 
          responsibilities are to run the day-
          to-day operations.

                      REPORTER
          So, day-to-day, then, you're the 
          boss?

                      ACE
          Well, in a sense, you could say 
          that... I am the boss, when Mr Green 
          is away. You could say that.

INT. GAMING CONTROL BOARD OFFICE - DAY

A magazine headline reads 'Sam Rothstein: "I'm the Boss!" '.

                      WEBB (O.S.)
          Hm. Have you read this?

The magazine shows a photograph of ACE. A caption reads: 
'Rothstein asserts authority at Tangiers Casino'.

                      WEBB (O.S.)
          Hm? It's 'bout Mr Rothstein.

We see WEBB holding up a copy of Business Week in the gaming 
board office of investigators RONNIE DUPREY and MATT AUSTIN.

                      WEBB
          It says
               (Reading)
          'The Midwest bookmaker with mob ties 
          says that he is the real boss of the 
          new hundred-million-dollar Tangiers 
          Casino empire.'
               (To DUPREY and AUSTIN)
          You believe that?

                      DUPREY
          Did he really say that?

                      WEBB
          Why, of course, he really said that. 
          It's right here. Has that man even 
          filed for his license yet?

                      AUSTIN
          I don't know. We'll have to check 
          the files.

                      WEBB
          Well, without gettin' your shorts in 
          a knot, would you do that? And kinda 
          check closely, 'cause we may have to 
          kick a kike's ass out of town.  Thank 
          you.

He exits.

ACE and the banker, CHARLIE CLARK, are upstairs in the den, 
which has a patio overlooking a swimming pool and golf course.  
CHARLIE is seated on a couch watching TV. GINGER enters and 
walks across the room, getting another drink from the bar. 
ACE, taking his ulcer medicine, watches her.

          to get state licensing despite law

          Santoro keep Rothstein from running 
          the Tangiers Casino?  And can the 
          integrity of state gaming laws be 
          jeopardized by a boyhood friendship?

ACE walks over to GINGER at the bar.

                      ACE

          Why don't you take it easy with that

          just about the time that I'm comin' 
          out of jail, hopefully, you'll be 
          comin' out of your coma. And guess 
          what?  I'll split your fuckin' head 
          open again. Because I'm fuckin' 
          stupid. I don't give a fuck about 
          jail.  That's my business. That's 
          what I do. And we know what you do, 
          don't we, Charlie? You fuck people 
          out of money and get away with it.

                      CHARLIE CLARK
               (As he puts a notepad 
               in his briefcase)
          You can't talk to me like...

          Hey, you fat Irish prick. You put my 
          fuckin' money to sleep. You go get 
          my money, or I'll put your fuckin' 
          brain to sleep.

          Sam?

          Never mind fuckin' Sam. This is

               to the stairs.)
          I'll be there in the morning. You

A frightened CHARLIE hurries down the stairs.

                      NICKY
          You fuckin' try me.

He turns to ACE who's behind the bar.

                      MARINO
          Yeah, but they're complaining.

                      NICKY
          Let 'em complain. I'm the one who's 
          here.

The bus arrives, obscuring our view of them.

                      NICKY
          I do all the work. Somebody don't 
          like it, fuck him.

                      MARINO

the bench, talking.

                      NICKY
          I know one thing. All I gotta do is 
          take care of four or five of those 
          fuckin' guys, the rest will fall 
          right into place. Believe me.

INT. GOLD RUSH - DAY

NICKY is watching a police surveillance car with two agents 
through binoculars.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Peekaboo, you fucks, you.

                      NICKY
          I see you, you motherfuckers.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          The problem was, Nicky was not only 
          bringin' heat on himself, but on me 
          too. The FBI watched every move he 
          made. But he didn't care. He just 
          didn't care.

THE CAMERA MOVES PAST NICKY TO REVEAL MARINO, SEATED IN FRONT 
OF TV SECURITY MONITORS ON THE PARKING AREA IN FRONT AND 
BEHIND THE GOLD RUSH.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          If they're gonna watch me, fuck 'em, 
          I'm gonna watch 'em right back. I 
          spent a few dollars. Top dollar, who 
          gives a shit?

HARDY, seated next to MARINO, is adjusting a knob on one of 
the may police radio scanners. There are a couple of cameras 
on the table next to him.

A debugging expert is going over the walls with a metal 
detector.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          I got the latest anti-buggin' 
          equipment from the same places that 
          sell to the fuckin' CIA. I had all 
          the special police frequency radios, 
          FBI descramblers, cameras that see 
          in the dark, and because of that, 
          the miserable sons-of-bitches that 
          they are, they never once caught me 
          doin' anything I couldn't handle.

DOMINICK and FUSCO are at a table arguing.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          I got my job...

EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY

NICKY swings a gold club. MARINO, and two men, are with him.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...on the line and this guy's out 
          havin' the time of his life. He has 
          every cop in the state watchin' him, 
          and he's out playin' golf.

                      NICKY
          Practice enough this week, you prick?

                      ACE (V.O.)
          And at the...

EXT. ACE'S PATIO - DAY

ACE is with the Control Board investigators AUSTIN and DUPREY. 
They are all pouring over legal files and record books out 
on a table by the swimming pool.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...worst possible time for me.

                      AUSTIN
          A record of the arrests...

                      ACE (V.O.)
          I had my license hearing coming up 
          and I didn't wanna leave anything to 
          chance.

                      ACE
          That was nineteen years ago, and 
          they were simple gambling pinches.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          I mean, if I can't work in Vegas, 
          where am I gonna go?

                      AUSTIN
          You've been very open with us. I 
          mean, uh, your books and papers and...  
          that - that's gonna mean something 
          when you go before the Commission.

                      ACE
          Well, that's all I ask, gentlemen, a 
          fair hearing.

                      DUPREY
          Well, this kind of honesty will 
          guarantee that fair hearing.

                      ACE
          Good.

                      AUSTIN
          All right, well, we'll move on to -

Suddenly a sputtering airplane flies right over Ace's house.

                      AUSTIN (O.S.)
               (As he looks at the 
               plane)
          I wanted to hear something about...  
          Kansas City.

EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY

                      NICKY
               (Looking at the 
               airplane)
          What the fuck is this? Where's this 
          fuckin' guy gonna land, on the 
          fairway?

EXT. ACE'S PATIO - DAY

ACE and the board investigators follow the plane as it lands 
on the fairway. ACE has taken off his sunglasses to get a 
better look. Two men in suits get out.

EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY

                      NICKY
               (To MARINO)
          They're fuckin' agents, Frankie. 
          Look at this.

EXT. ACE'S PATIO - DAY

The AGENTS run across the golf course, past ACE and the 
investigators, who look on open-mouthed.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          The Feds were watchin' Nicky play 
          golf for so long, they ran out of 
          gas. Just what I needed. Right in 
          front on the Control Board.

The agents run behind the hedges by ACE's pool. AUSTIN and 
DUPREY stare at ACE as if he had something to do with it.

EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY

                      NICKY
          A hundred dollars, whoever hits the 
          plane.

NICKY, MARINO, and the other men swing their clubs.

EXT. ACE'S PATIO - DAY

                      ACE (V.O.)
               (putting his sunglasses

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...in comes Piscano, the Kansas City 
          underboss. He ran that little grocery 
          store in Kansas City where they 
          brought the suitcases.

INT. SAN MARINO GROCERY, KANSAS CITY - DAY

PISCANO and his MOTHER are at the counter of his elderly 
BROTHER-IN-LAW's store.

                      PISCANO
          They're fightin' over those suitcases 
          again. You know what that means, 
          right? You know what that means, 
          right? That means I gotta take another 
          trip out to Vegas, and it's gonna 
          cost me another couple of grand.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          He ran it with his brother-in-law, 
          but mostly what he did was complain, 
          complain about his trips to Vegas, 
          to his brother-in-law and to his 
          mother, all the time.

                      BROTHER-IN-LAW
               (Seated)
          You gotta lay down the law. Otherwise 
          they're gonna make a fool out of 
          you.

                      PISCANO
          They're not gonna make a fool out of 
          me. I write it all down in this book,
               (holding up a notepad)
          every fuckin' nickel that goes down. 
          Right here, receipts...

                      PISCANO'S MOTHER
               (Chastising her son)
          Hey! Oh!

                      PISCANO
          Oh, sorry -

                      PISCANO'S MOTHER
          What's the matter with you?

                      PISCANO
          Receipts and bills and... everything's 
          here.

                      PISCANO'S MOTHER
          Since when do you talk like that?

                      PISCANO
          I'm sorry.

                      PISCANO'S MOTHER
          There's a lot of people here.

                      PISCANO
          Nance gives me trouble and I'll tell 
          him... screw around with those 
          suitcases and I'll take the eyes out 
          of his frickin' head.

                      PISCANO'S MOTHER
          Again!

                      PISCANO
          I didn't curse. I said 'frickin' 
          head'.

                      PISCANO'S MOTHER
          That's enough.

                      PISCANO
          I'm sorry.

                      ACE (V.O.)

          You can't believe it. I mean, who 
          the hell would believe that the FBI 
          had a wire in the place lookin' for 
          some information about some old 
          homicide about some guy who was 
          whacked-out, God knows when, over 
          God knows what?

                      PISCANO
          Plus, what's to prevent him with the 
          suitcases, that he can take what he 
          wants?  Fuckin' Nance, he brings us 
          back two suitcases from the Tangiers, 
          and what about three or four?

          We got nobody in the room to watch. 
          That's the law. You know, we can't 
          even go into the count room to watch 
          our money? Could you believe this 
          cowboy bullshit?

His MOTHER shakes her head.

                      PISCANO
          And sure he's got his people in there. 
          But how do you know? They could all 
          be in on it together, those miserable 
          fucks.

His MOTHER reacts to his language.

                      PISCANO

ACE is in the court with OSCAR GOODMAN, his lawyer, facing 
the Control Board's Chairman and six COMMISSIONER MEMBERS.  
The Chairman is the SENATOR we saw earlier in the casino 
suite taking chips out of the bureau drawer. The room is jam-
packed: GREEN, GINGER, SHERBERT, as well as WEBB, reporters 
and other spectators. ACE's secretaries carry in legal papers. 
There are piles of briefs and law books on OSCAR's and ACE's 
table.

                      OSCAR
          Mr Chairman and members of the

          to be here today.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          And when the day finally came, I was 
          ready. I felt so confident that all 
          I had to do was present my case.

                      OSCAR
          ...evidence... and we have documents, 
          one of which is a report by retired

          Mr. Chairman -

The COMMISSIONERS quickly repeat:

          The ayes have it. This hearing is 
          adjourned.

The CHAIRMAN bangs his gavel and prepares to leave. The 
COMMISSIONERS hurriedly pack up their papers. An enraged ACE 
rises and approaches the SENATOR.  TV CAMERAS ROLL.

          You guys have to be kidding.

The SENATOR picks up his briefcase.

          Adjourned! What do you mean, 
          adjourned?

The SENATOR picks up his folder.

          Senator, you promised me a hearing.

We see WEBB seated in the first row, watching.

                      ACE
          You won't allow me a hearing? You 
          didn't even look at the FBI reports.

A reporter holds a microphone up to the SENATOR.

          a fair hearing -

The SENATOR bends down to a microphone.

               microphone)

          Uh, I - I'd... I'd like to answer -

WEBB starts to leave.

          The only time I was at the Tangiers

          I was in the building!

GREEN, embarrassed by ACE's behaviour, starts to get up.

                      ACE
          You know damn well I was at that 
          dinner, and you swore to me that I 
          would have a fair hearing at that 
          dinner! Did you not?! Did you not?!
               (Pause, ACE looks at 
               OSCAR.)
          Well, tell me I was at least at the 
          dinner! A-allow me that much.

          make a move anymore. I mean, what do 
          you do about that?

                      STONE
          What do you propose?

                      ACE
          I don't know, he doesn't listen to 
          me. Maybe he should...  get lost for 
          a while. Take a vacation. Would that 
          be so bad?

                      STONE
          They ain't sendin' Nicky nowhere.

                      ACE
          All right, look, if he took a break, 
          it would just give everybody some 
          time to maneuver. That's all I'm 
          saying. It's all that I'm saying.

                      STONE
          I would forget about the maneuver. I 
          would just get out.

                      ACE
               (Sighs)
          I can't do that.

          Of course...

          You know, I don't feel like playin'

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...as soon as Andy got back home, 
          Nicky heard about our talk in the

          Well, you know...

                      ACE (V.O.)
          But just getting a call from Nicky 
          wasn't easy anymore. Even the codes 
          didn't work. So, we figured out 
          another act.

INT. FBI PHONE TAP ROOM - DAY

A bored FBI man, seated at his desk with a tape recorder and

INT. FBI STAKEOUT POST, MOTEL ACROSS THE FROM THE GOLD RUSH - 
DAY

Through a windows of a motel room across the street from The 
Gold Rush, an FBI AGENT watches NICKY and MARINO exit the 
jewelry store, get into a parked car and rive away.

IRIS OUT.

                      FBI AGENT (O.S.)
               (Into a radio)
          Okay, he, uh, he's out. It's the 
          ant, uh, Brown unit. And he's with, 
          uh, bogie. I think it's Frankie.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Nicky started out before me because 
          it wasn't that easy...

SWISH PAN TO THE FBI AGENT LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW TALKING 
INTO A RADIO.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...for him to get around anymore.

                      FBI AGENT

          Okay, pulled out...

SWISH PAN TO NICKY AND MARINO DRIVING DOWN THE STREET.

                      FBI AGENT (O.S.)
               (Into radio)
          ...pretty fast. He's headed upstream.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Nicky couldn't even go for a ride 
          without changing...

SWISH PAN TO FBI CAR TRAILING BEHIND.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...cars at least six times before he 
          could shake all his tails.

INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE #1 - DAY

NICKY's car with MARINO driving pulls in; NICKY jumps out 
and gets in another car.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          And because of all the planes, he 
          had to use underground garages.

MARINO drives off.

INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE #2 - DAY

NICKY's second car screeches in to another garage.

EXT. DESERT SCENE - DAY

A solitary ACE waiting in the vast desert, looking around. 
ACE looks at a sage brush and sand and a few rocks on the 
desert floor. This could be a hole meant for him. He steps 
away from it.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Meeting in the middle of the desert 
          always made me nervous.

It's a scary place. I knew about the holes in the desert, of 
course, and everywhere I looked, there could have been a 
hole.

EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY

Aerial shot of NICKY driving.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Normally, my prospects of comin' 
          back alive from a meeting with Nicky 
          were ninety-nine out of a hundred.  
          But this time, when I heard him say, 
          'A couple a hundred yards down the 
          road', I gave myself fifty-fifty.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

ACE still standing in the desert. NICKY's car suddenly appears 
as a reflection in ACE's sunglasses, shaking ACE out of his 
desert-induced reverie. NICKY's car pulls up by ACE. He gets 
out and storms up to him.

                      NICKY
          Where the fuck you get off talkin' 
          to people about me behind my back?  
          Goin' over my head?

                      ACE
          What people?

                      NICKY
          What people! What'd you think, I 
          wasn't gonna find out?

                      ACE
          I don't even know what you're talkin' 
          about, Nick.

                      NICKY
          No? You said I'm bringin' heat on 
          you?! I gotta listen to people because 
          of your fuckin' shit?! You're ordering 
          me out?! You better get your own 
          fuckin' army, pal!

                      ACE
          I didn't do anything. I mean, I didn't 
          order you or anybody...  I only told 
          Andy Stone that you had a lot of 
          heat on you, and that was a problem.

                      NICKY
          You want me to get out of my own 
          fuckin' town?!

                      ACE
          Yeah, I said I - let the bullshit 
          blow over for a while so I can run 
          the casino. Anything goes wrong with 
          the casino, it's my ass. It's not 
          yours, it's my ass.

                      NICKY
          Oh, I don't know whether you know 
          this or not, but you only have your 
          fuckin' casino because I made that 
          possible!

          I'm what counts out here! Not your 
          fuckin' country clubs or your fuckin' 
          TV shows! And what the fuck are you 
          doin' on TV anyhow?!

                      ACE
          What are you -

                      NICKY
               (Interrupting)
          You know I get calls from back home 
          every fuckin' day?!  They think you 
          went batshit!

                      ACE
          I'm only on TV because I gotta be 
          able to hang around the casino. You 
          understand that. You know that. Come 
          on.

                      NICKY
          Your fuckin' ass! You could have had 
          the food and beverage job without 
          goin' on television!  You wanted to 
          go on TV.

                      ACE
          Yeah, I did want to go on TV. That 
          way I have a forum. I can fight back.  
          I'm known. People see me. They know 
          they can't fuck around with me like 
          they could if I was an unknown. That's 
          right.

                      NICKY
          You're makin' a big fuckin' spectacle 
          of yourself.

                      ACE
          Me?! I wouldn't even be in this 
          situation if it wasn't for you. You 
          brought down so much fuckin' heat on 
          me. I mean, every time I meet somebody 
          here, the big question is do I know 
          you.

                      NICKY
          Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your 
          fuckin' license on me, is that it?

                      ACE
          No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked 
          me if you could come out here, what 
          did I tell you? I mean, you asked 
          me, and I knew you were going to 
          come out no matter what I said, but 
          what did I tell you? Do you remember 
          what I told...

                      NICKY
               (Interrupting)
          Back -

                      ACE

          you?

                      NICKY
          Back - Back up, back up a fuckin' 
          minute here. One minute. I asked 
          you?! When the fuck did I ever ask 
          you if I could come out here?! Get 
          this through your head, you -

                      ACE
               (Interrupting)
          You never - ?

                      NICKY
          Get this through your head, you Jew 
          motherfucker, you. You only exist 
          out here because of me!  That's the 
          only reason!  Without me, you, 
          personally, every fuckin' wiseguy 
          skell [Skell: the lowest form of 
          wiseguy - a drunken bum] around'll 
          take a piece of your fuckin' Jew 
          ass! Then where you gonna go?!  You're 
          fuckin' warned! Don't ever go over 
          my fuckin' head again! You 
          motherfucker, you!

NICKY drives off, leaving an angry and frustrated ACE to 
ponder the desert and the holes.

INT. JUBILATION NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

Overhead of ACE, OSCAR, SHERBERT, TRUDY and showgirls walking 
down the zebra pattern carpet of the nightclub. They are 
escorted to their table.

NICKY, MARINO and DOMINICK are seated at another table in 
the rear of the club so no one can hear their conversation.

                      MARINO
          Well, we got company.

ACE avoids looking at NICKY.

                      NICKY
          Do you see that? Dumb Jew 
          motherfucker. Grew up together and 
          he's actin' like he don't even know 
          me. I know we're supposed to avoid 
          each other, but, you know, there's 
          ways to do things and there's ways 
          not to.

                      DOMINICK
          Yeah. Fuck him.

SHERBERT and the others make a toast.

NICKY watches ACE's entourage.

                      DOMINICK
          Forget about it, Nick. Don't let it 
          bother you.

                      NICKY
          Why, does it look like it's bothering 
          me? What do I give a fuck?  Fuckin' 
          Oscar too. All the fuckin' money 
          I've given that prick, he don't even 
          look over here. What's his problem?

                      MARINO
          Mm.

                      NICKY
          Fuckin' Jews stick together, don't 
          they?

                      MARINO
          They're havin' a good time too.

          No, just - just give him, give him 
          ten. That's it. Ten.  I'll be right 
          down.

INT. TANGIERS BLACKJACK TABLE - NIGHT

                      SHERBERT
               (To NICKY)
          He's gonna come up with ten thousand, 
          just the way you wanted.

                      NICKY
          Ten thou? No, no, no.

                      SHERBERT
          ...give you ten thousand -

                      NICKY
               (Grabbing SHERBERT's 
               lapel)
          Fifty! I said fifty!

                      SHERBERT
          Look, take -

                      NICKY
               (Pushing him away and 
               walking back to the 
               blackjack table)
          Fuckin' fifty thousand!  Go get it. 
          I don't give a fuck where you get 
          it.
               (To FEMALE DEALER.)
          Fuckers!  They take it, but they 
          don't want to give it back.

NICKY turns up another bad card and looks at the dealer. She 
smiles as she slides the house winnings over to her side of 
the table.

                      NICKY
          How the fuck can you grin? How the 
          fuck could you grin?

The FEMALE DEALER looks to her PIT BOSS for help. He steps 
up to a MALE DEALER at a neighboring table.

                      NICKY
          You know how much I'm stuck? You 
          give a fuck?

The MALE DEALER walks up to the FEMALE DEALER and taps her 
on the shoulder.

                      NICKY
          Do ya?!

She lays down some cards, claps her hands to show the Eye-in-
the-Sky that they are empty, and exits.

                      NICKY
               (To departing FEMALE 
               DEALER)
          Yeah. Give yourself a hand right 
          across your fuckin' mouth.

The MALE DEALER takes her place behind the table.

                      NICKY
          Look at this fuckin' beaut they put 
          in now. Sherbert send you in here to 
          rob me now? Been fuckin' knockin' 
          everybody's dick in all night? Huh?  
          You been beatin' all the customers 
          tonight, motherfucker?

We see the PIT BOSS lock up the chip tray from the table the 
dealer has just left. NICKY has a diminished stack of chips 
and an upturned ten and a two.

                      NICKY
          Huh, jag-off? Hit me.

The card is a king or a 'paint', a picture card, meaning 
that NICKY has lost.

Everyone freezes in fear. NICKY takes the paint and flicks 
it at the DEALER's chest where it sticks to his shirt.)

                      NICKY
          Take this stiff and pound it up your 
          fuckin' ass! Hit me again.

The DEALER looks to the PIT BOSS who nods 'okay'. He turns 
over a card. It's another paint, a queen. NICKY flicks the 
card to the DEALER's face.

                      NICKY
          Take this one and stick it up your 
          sister's ass! Hit me again.

The DEALER looks to the PIT BOSS again.

                      NICKY
          That's it, keep lookin' at him, you 
          fuckin' dummy. If you had any fuckin' 
          heart at all, you'd be out fuckin' 
          stealin' for a livin'.
               (Tossing the card at 
               the DEALER.)
          Hit me again.

The DEALER looks at the PIT BOSS.

                      NICKY
          What the fuck you keep lookin' at 
          him for, huh, you fuckin' pu-

The DEALER deals him another paint.

                      NICKY
          Look at this, twenty fuckin' paints 
          in a row. Hit me again!

ACE enters the casino with SHERBERT.

                      MARINO
               (To NICKY)
          He's here.

                      NICKY
               (To the DEALER)
          You should pay as fast as you collect, 
          you know.

NICKY gets up to go over to ACE, glowering at SHERBERT as he 
walks past.

ACE and NICKY are partially hidden behind a pillar by the 
slot-machines.

                      ACE
          What are you doin'? You gotta get 
          out of here!

                      NICKY
          Hey, Sammy, tell this Jew motherfucker 
          over here to pay that marker.

                      ACE
          Nicky, Nicky, you're not listenin' 
          to me. I'm here to help you. What's 
          the matter with you?  You're gonna 
          bury us both.

                      NICKY
          Just give me the money. Fuckin' give 
          me the fuckin' money, Sammy.

                      ACE
          I'm gonna okay you ten and get you 
          even, and that's it. Then you got to 
          get out of here before the cops and 
          the newspapers are all over you.

To the PIT BOSS, holding up ten fingers.

                      ACE
          Ten and that's it.

He makes a throat cutting gesture with his hand. ACE leaves. 
NICKY turns to walk back to the table. He sees SHERBERT 
standing right behind him.

                      NICKY
          What are you starin' at, you bald-
          headed Jew prick?!

Before SHERBERT can answer, NICKY grabs the receiver off a 
wall phone and hits him across the face and back. SHERBERT 
falls to the floor. NICKY pulls the cradle off the pillar 
and tosses it down on his back. He and MARINO walk back to 
the table, SHERBERT winces on the floor in shock.

                      NICKY
          Sue me, you Jew fuck!

                      MARINO
          Let's get out of here.

                      NICKY
          What? Get out of here? I got a marker 
          comin'.

He puts some chips down on the table.

                      NICKY
               (To DEALER)
          Deal.

INT. OSCAR, THE LAWYER'S OFFICE - DAY

ACE and GINGER are seated across from OSCAR, their lawyer.

                      OSCAR
          I know, but everything's changed 
          now. You're talking about a divorce.  
          You're even asking for alimony 
          payments and... child support... and 
          now custody.

                      GINGER
          I just want what any divorced woman 
          would get.

                      ACE
          I mean she's only sober about two 
          hours a day. It's usually from eleven 
          in the morning until one in the 
          afternoon. And if I gave her her 
          money and her jewels now, you know 
          what she's gonna do? She's gonna 
          piss it all away in about a year, 
          and then where will she be?
               (To GINGER.)
          Where would you be then? Comin' right 
          back to me, right back to me.
               (To OSCAR.)
          Or finding some other excuse to come 
          and I - I -

                      GINGER
               (To ACE)
          We had a deal. Remember that?
               (To OSCAR.)
          He said if it didn't work out between 
          us, that I could get my things and I 
          could leave.

                      ACE
               (To GINGER, leaning 
               closer to her)
          Look in my eyes. Look in my eyes.

GINGER turns to him.

                      ACE
          You know me. Do you see anything in 
          these eyes that makes you think I 
          would ever let someone in your 
          condition take my child away from 
          me?
               (Pause.)
          Do you?  You know that won't happen.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          And after all this time... and as 
          hard as I tried, as much as I 
          wanted...

INT. ACES HIGH BACKSTAGE CORRIDOR/SHOWGIRLS' DRESSING-ROOM - 
DAY

ACE, with Kleenex sticking out of his collar to protect his 
shirt from his television make-up, walks back to the dressing 
room with TRUDY. She pecks his cheek before exiting to her 
own room. A security guard opens the door for ACE.

We follow him past numerous showgirls and costumes.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...I could never reach her. I could 
          never make her love me. I always 
          felt she should have gone for all 
          that money... being somebody for the 
          first time in her life, a home and a 
          kid. But that's not what happened. 
          It just didn't work out that way.

                      ACE
               (To the showgirls)
          Everything all right?

                      ACE
          I mean, what could we do? After a 
          while, we'd just take breathers from 
          each other. You know, little 
          separations. At that time, I remember 
          Ginger took Amy and went to Beverly 
          Hills. She was gonna spend a week or 
          so shopping.

ACE picks up the phone at a make-up table.

               (To GINGER.)
          You dye your hair... you get plastic 
          surgery, like we talked about. Right?  
          You're the mother. How much do you 
          think he's gonna pay to get this 
          fuckin' kid back?

                      AMY
          I don't want to go to Europe.

                      LESTER
               (To AMY)
          Shut your mouth!

GINGER puts her hand over AMY's mouth.

                      LESTER
          You know where she gets this from!

                      AMY
          You shut up.

                      LESTER
          No, you - You want me to come over 
          there? I'll smack your face.

AMY sticks her tongue out at LESTER.

                      LESTER
          Don't give me any of your shit!
               (To GINGER.)
          Okay, this has always been a dream, 
          but we're going.

                      GINGER
          Lester - he called you here.

                      LESTER
          Right.

                      GINGER
          Here.

                      LESTER
          He was just on the phone.

                      GINGER
               (Sniffs)
          He called you right here.

                      LESTER
          I just talked to him.

                      GINGER
               (Sighs)
          So, he knows where you are. That 
          means he's sending some guys over 
          here probably right now.

                      LESTER
          Ginger... It means he's sitting by 
          the phone like a dumb-bell, waiting 
          for me to call him back. Now, I -

                      GINGER
               (Interrupting and 
               getting up)
          That's - Yeah, he's sitting by the 
          phone like a dumb-bell, just waiting 
          for you to call him back. That's 
          what he's -

                      LESTER
               (Interrupting)
          He's sittin' by the phone -

                      GINGER
               (Yelling)
          What do you think we're gonna do? 
          He's probably got guys outside the 
          fuckin' house!

                      GINGER
               (Gathering AMY, 
               hysterical)
          Get your bag! Come on, get your bag! 
          Get your things! Let's go!

                      LESTER
          It's this bullshit. It's just bullshit 
          right here. This is the fuckin' 
          problem, you know.

                      GINGER
               (Hysterical)
          Oh, what bullshit? What, do you want 
          to fuckin' talk it over now?

                      LESTER
          You're done yakkin', okay? You're 
          done yakkin' now?

                      GINGER
               (Grabbing her purse 
               and rushing AMY out)
          Go! Go! Get in the car! Go!

                      LESTER
               (Mimicking GINGER)
          'Go! Go! Go!'

          Bye.

She hangs up and walks over to LESTER and AMY who are 
fighting.

                      GINGER
          Just knock it off! Would you two 
          knock it off? Get in the car.

                      LESTER
          She started it. She started the whole 
          thing. I'm just standin' here.

GINGER opens the driver's side door.

                      LESTER
          You're not gonna drive. Don't even 
          think you're gonna drive.

                      GINGER
          No, I'm gonna drive.

                      LESTER
               (Stopping GINGER)
          No, I'm not gonna drive with some 
          crazy -

                      GINGER
               (Yelling)
          You're driving me nuts!

She walks around to the passenger door.

                      LESTER
          Get in the passenger's side! And I'm 
          sendin' this kid to Bolivia in a 
          fuckin' box.

EXT. ACE'S PATIO - DAY

Through glass doors we see ACE seated in his living-room. 
NICKY slips into frame and taps on the window, gesturing 
that he wants to talk. ACE signals for him to go around to 
the garage.

INT. ACE'S GARAGE - DAY

NICKY walks past GINGER's white Mercedes towards ACE.

                      NICKY
          Ginger -

He's cut off by ACE who points to the passenger's side of 
his Cadillac. NICKY walks around and gets in. ACE starts the 
engine to make it harder for anyone to listen in on their 
conversation.

ACE turns the volume down. He looks straight ahead, away 
from NICKY.

                      NICKY
               (After an awkward 
               moment)
          Ginger called me.

                      ACE
               (Polite, careful, 
               smoking a cigarette)
          Yeah.

                      NICKY
          I just told you. She called me.

                      ACE
          And what'd she want?

                      NICKY
          She was afraid to call you.

                      ACE
          Yeah, she's with that cocksucker 
          again... and they got Amy.

                      GINGER
          Well, that's why I'm here. She wants 
          to come back, but she's afraid you're 
          gonna whack her out.

                      ACE
          Yeah, they're gonna kidnap my kid. 
          What do you want?

                      NICKY
          I know. Why didn't you come to me? I 
          mean, this is family, it ain't 
          business. Meanwhile, you make calls 
          back home. Sammy, it makes us look 
          bad out here, you know what I mean?  
          Back and forth, this one and that 
          one, and, in the meantime, she's 
          gone anyway. Am I right?

                      ACE
               (Sighing)
          I don't know. What am I gonna do 
          with this woman? I don't know...
               (Pause.)
          She's drivin' me fuckin' crazy.

                      NICKY
          I think if you, uh, okay it, you 
          know, assure her that she's gonna be 
          all right, she'll come back.

                      ACE
          She's driving me fuckin' crazy.

                      NICKY
          Well, once you get her here, you 
          think about it, you know?  But get 
          the kid back here. She wants to come 
          back. That's the, uh, that's the 
          main thing here. You want your kid, 
          don't you? Huh?

GINGER is on the phone. In the background, AMY is acting up 
in the back seat of the car and driving LESTER crazy.

          With the money.

          He needed some clothes.

                      ACE
               (Sighs)
          Twenty-five thousand for clothes.

                      GINGER
          He wanted a watch, too.

          Twenty-five thousand for clothes and

ACE and GINGER, dressed for dinner just like any other couple, 
walk towards a table overlooking the colorful lights of 
downtown Vegas.

          ...good evening. Signora.

                      GINGER
          Gino.

               (as they are led to 
               their table)
          The good part was, I had Amy back. 
          So, we went home, had the housekeeper 
          stay over, put the kid to bed, I 
          calmed myself down and we went to 
          dinner. I tried to keep things nice 
          and civil, you know.  But... hey, 
          twenty-five thousand for three suits? 
          That doesn't make much sense.

                      ACE
               (Seated across from 
               GINGER at a booth)
          First of all, he's not gonna wear f- 
          thousand-dollar suits. But let's say 
          he did, which he won't. How you gonna 
          get fitted for twenty-five suits in 
          three days?  I, um, I mean, how could 
          you get fitted that fast? I can't 
          get fitted that fast, and I pay twice 
          as much.

                      GINGER
          I bought him a watch too.

                      ACE
          Yeah.

                      GINGER
          Yeah.

                      ACE
          But even if you bought him a watch, 
          a really nice watch, one that he 
          thought was nice - and he doesn't 
          know what the fuck a good watch is - 
          so, you go, five, ten, twelve grand?

                      GINGER
          Yeah.

                      ACE
          At the most, which is impossible for 
          him.

She glances to the table behind them.

                      ACE
          Plus, at the most, three suits, a 
          thousand apiece. That still leaves 
          what?  Around ten thousand?

                      GINGER
               (Staring down at her 
               plate, trying to 
               restrain herself)
          Would you knock it off, Sam?

                      ACE
          I'm just tryin' to figure it out.

                      GINGER
          There's nothin' to figure out. I'm 
          home... we're workin' it out.

She lights a cigarette.

                      ACE
          Yeah, but I've been told that before, 
          'We're workin' it out.' You think 
          that you're home... after what you 
          just put me through with Amy, is a 
          favor to me?

She looks at ACE.

                      ACE
               (Pause)
          So, counting the watch, let's say 
          another four thousand for expenses 
          over the weekend... of which you 
          must have had a good time. I know he 
          did.  That's for sure. I know that... 
          fuckin' piece of shit had a good 
          fuckin' time. On my money. You might 
          as well have fucked him, which you 
          probably did anyway.

GINGER glares at him.

                      ACE
          You're lookin' at me a certain way. 
          You - you're teary-eyed, huh? You're 
          upset. You're a good actress, you 
          know that?  Good fuckin' actress. 
          You can fuckin' get that pity out of 
          people. I'm not a john, you 
          understand?  You always thought I 
          was, but I'm not. And I'm not a 
          sucker. That fuckin' pimp cocksucker. 
          He's lucky I didn't kill him last 
          time. Lucky he's fuckin' livin'.  
          And if you would've stayed with Amy... 
          and you would've ran away... you 
          would've been fuckin' dead.

GINGER scoots out of the booth and leaves.

                      ACE
          Both of you. Dead. Dead.

INT. ACE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Wide overhead of ACE alone in bed. Off-screen, we hear GINGER, 
a little drunk, on the phone.

                      GINGER (O.S.)
               (Whispering into 
               telephone)
          I cannot do it anymore. I can't 
          fuckin' live like this. It's not 
          right.

ACE's point of view as he moves towards the sound of GINGER's 
voice. He enters frame and stops to listen.

                      GINGER (O.S.)
          What are you? Yes, of course - He 
          doesn't come home at night.  What is 
          the big fuckin' deal? I go - Yes, 
          and I just - I can't fuckin' take 
          it. Why should I fucking take it? 
          That wasn't the deal. He acts like...  
          like I'm the only one around here 
          with a fuckin' past. He'll never let 
          me live it down.  Well... well, I 
          mean, I tried. What the fuck do you 
          think I came back here for? No, I'm 
          not!

ACE slips into the foyer where he can see GINGER's reflection 
in a glass door as she talks on the phone in the living-room.

                      GINGER
               (Whispering into 
               telephone)
          I want to have him killed. Yes, I 
          want him killed.  I've fuckin' had 
          it.

INT. ACE'S HOUSE, LIVING-ROOM - NIGHT

GINGER is on the phone.

                      GINGER
               (Into telephone)
          So, are you with me on this?

ACE steps up behind her. She gasps, still holding the phone.  
Petrified.

                      ACE
          You want to get rid of me? Here I 
          am. Go ahead, get rid of me
               (ACE grabs the phone.)
          Hello.

He hears nothing and throws the phone down near her.

GINGER rises and attacks ACE.

                      GINGER
               (Grunting)
          Yes! I fuckin' hate you! I can't 
          take it anymore!

ACE grapples with GINGER.

                      GINGER
          Yes, I want to kill you! I hate your 
          fuckin' guts!

                      ACE
          You hate my guts? I want you to come 
          with me now.

He drags her by her arms across the living-room hallway, 
into the bedroom.

                      GINGER
          Get off of me! Stop it!

                      ACE
          Come with me now! Come with me now. 
          Come with me now. I want you out of 
          here.

GINGER screams.

INT. ACE'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - NIGHT

                      ACE
          I want you out of here! I want you 
          out of here!

                      GINGER
               (Starting to get up)
          Let go of me! Let go of me!

INT. ACE'S HOUSE, BEDROOM CLOSET - NIGHT

He pushes her against the closet wall, and throws an overnight 
bag at her.

                      ACE
          Take your
               (kicking the bag)
          fuckin' bag and get out of here!

                      GINGER
          I'll go, but I want my money right 
          now!

ACE tosses clothes at her.

                      ACE
          You'll get your money! Don't worry.

GINGER squats down and starts to gather her stuff.

                      GINGER
          The arrangement is over!

                      ACE
               (Tossing clothes)
          No kidding. NO KIDDING!

                      GINGER
          And I still get my money. I need 
          some cash right now. You can't just 
          put me in the street.

                      ACE
          I'll get your cash. You haven't been 
          straight with me ever since I met 
          you! You never loved me in the first 
          place!  I need eyes in the back of 
          my fuckin' head with you, you fuckin' 
          bitch!

ACE walks past her to his side of the large walk-in closet. 
Racks and racks of her clothes are still hanging.

                      GINGER
          Love you?!

She tosses a pair of red shoes at him.

                      GINGER
          How could I love you?! How can I 
          love you?! You treat me like I'm 
          your fucking dog!

ACE leans down and opens a shoe box filled with money. He 
grabs as much cash as he can hold.

                      ACE
          You're lower than a dog!

                      GINGER
          Fuck you!

He walks up to her.

                      ACE
               (Shoving the bundles 
               of cash in her face)
          Here. Here. Is this enough money?! 
          Huh?  Will it last you two fuckin' 
          days? Take it, greedy bitch.
               (Stuffing the money 
               in her bag.)
          Take the fuckin' money you fuckin' 
          want.

                      GINGER
          I'm going to the bank and I'm getting 
          my jewelry too!

She puts on a white fur coat.

                      ACE
          Yeah, no kidding. Good! It opens at 
          9 a.m. Be there!

                      GINGER
          And don't send your guys down there 
          to stop me! I mean it.

She bends down to pick up her bag, but ACE insists on carrying 
it.

                      ACE
          I guarantee you, I will not stop 
          you.

INT. ACE'S HOUSE, BEDROOM/FOYER - NIGHT

GINGER and ACE walk through their bedroom to the front door. 
He's carrying her suitcase.

                      GINGER
          Stop! You aren't getting rid of me 
          with one fuckin' suitcase!

                      ACE
          You'll come back tomorrow and get 
          the rest. Just get out of here.

                      GINGER
          Fine.
               (Sniffs, walking back.)
          I'm takin' Amy.

                      ACE
               (Stopping her)
          You're not takin' Amy.

                      GINGER
          I am. I'm wakin' her up right now.

                      ACE
          You're stoned. You're a junkie. Get 
          out of here.

He opens the door and tosses her suitcase out.

                      GINGER
          I am not! She's my daughter too! 
          Goddamn you!

                      ACE
          Get out of here!

He shoves her out the door.

                      ACE
          Send my lawyers a letter.
               (Slamming the door 
               behind her.)
          God-fuckin'-damn you!

He locks the door, and peers through the peep-hole.

                      GINGER (O.S.)
               (Through the doors as 
               ACE walks away)
          You're not getting away with this! 
          You're not gonna fuck me out of my 
          end!

EXT. ACE'S HOUSE, FRONT YARD - NIGHT

GINGER is furious. She picks up the suitcase and walks up to 
her sportscar.

                      GINGER
          Fucker!
               (Sobs.)

She drives off.

INT. ACE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT, LATER

ACE is lying awake in bed smoking a cigarette, watching the 
casino's Eye in the Sky surveillance monitors. He hears a 
car turn into his driveway. He sees the car's headlight beams

                      ACE (V.O.)
          The funny thing was, that after all 
          that... I didn't want her to go. She 
          was the mother of my kid. I loved 
          her. And later... I realized I didn't 
          want to give her the money, because 
          if I did... I knew I'd never see her 
          again.

ACE reaches over to take GINGER's hand - she slowly takes 
hold of his.

INT. ACE'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY

GINGER is getting AMY ready for school. ACE enters as AMY is 
on her way out. He holds her face in his hands and kisses 
her.

                      ACE
               (Affectionately)
          Oh. Have a good day at school.

                      AMY
          Okay.

Amy exits.

                      ACE
          Okay? Okay, angel.

ACE walks over to GINGER who turns sullenly to look at him.

                      ACE
               (Clears throat.)
          From now on, I have to know where 
          you and Amy are at all times.

He takes a beeper out of his coat pocket and holds it up to 
GINGER.

                      ACE
               (Gently)
          Now, here's a beeper. I want you to 
          keep it on you. It's very light.  So 
          I can call you whenever I have to.

GINGER reluctantly takes the beeper.

                      ACE
               (Pause.)
          Okay?

She nods silently. He looks at her and turns, leaving her 
alone in the kitchen.

EXT. CONSTRUCTION TRAILER - EVENING

A very large trailer is in the middle of an empty construction 
site. GINGER's and NICKY's cars are parked outside.

                      NICKY (O.S.)
               (From trailer)
          Well, what are you supposed to do? I 
          mean, what do you want to do?  Do 
          you want to stay the way you are? 
          You want to stay like this?  You 
          can't do that.

INT. CONSTRUCTION TRAILER - EVENING

GINGER and NICKY are alone in the large trailer. They are 
sitting close together on a couch.

                      NICKY
          I mean, listen, two people don't get 
          along, at some point you gotta call 
          it... I mean, it's none of my 
          business, but I ... I think that's 
          what you gotta do. You gotta take it 
          somewhere -

                      GINGER
               (Smoking a cigarette)
          Oh, you're right, I know.  It's... 
          well, I was just -

                      NICKY
          What? What?

                      GINGER
          Nothin'.

                      NICKY
          What were you gonna say? Go ahead.

                      GINGER
          I don't -
               (Sighs.)

                      NICKY
          Tell me what you were gonna say. Go 
          ahead.

                      GINGER
          Yeah?

                      NICKY
          Yeah.

                      GINGER
          Well, I was thinkin', maybe... you 
          know somebody at the bank...  could 
          help me get my jewelry out?  There's 
          a lot of money in there. Lot of money 
          in there, and I'd be willing to take 
          care of anybody who helped me out.

                      NICKY
               (Pauses)
          Let me think about that.

                      GINGER
          Okay.

                      NICKY
          See who I got in there. Gotta get 
          somebody I can trust.

                      GINGER
          Mm-hm.

                      NICKY
          You know?

                      GINGER
          Yeah. 'Cause, you know,
               (leaning her head 
               back)
          He's never gonna give me my jewelry.

                      NICKY
          Hm.

                      GINGER
          He holds that key so tight, he's 
          probably got it stuck up his ass.

                      NICKY
               (Chuckles)
          Yeah, right. That's Sammy. And he's 
          probably got it there too.

Takes a sip of his drink.

                      GINGER
          He's so fuckin' lucky. I could have 
          buried him. I could have gone to 
          Europe and taken the baby. And then 
          he'd've tracked me down and he'd've 
          killed me.

                      NICKY
          No, he wouldn't. I would have.
               (GINGER chuckles.)
          And he'd've been right, too. I mean, 
          seriously.
               (She cuddles closer 
               to him.)
          Well, there's one thing you don't 
          do. You don't take a guy's kid and 
          then take off.

                      GINGER
               (Quietly)
          I didn't.
               (Chuckles.)
          I didn't. I mean, I did, but then I 
          did exactly what you told me to do, 
          and I came right back.

                      NICKY
          You did. You're right.

                      GINGER
          Exactly.

NICKY embraces her.

                      NICKY
          You did. I like that. I like that. 
          That's what I like about you. You 
          did the right thing.

                      GINGER
               (Playing with his 
               jacket)
          I did what you told me to.

                      NICKY
          Yes, you did.

                      GINGER
          'Cause you always tell me the right 
          thing to do.

                      NICKY
          Yeah.
               (Pause, with his arm 
               around her.)
          Boy, he really fucked himself up out 
          here -
               (She caresses his 
               face.)
          - didn't he?

                      GINGER
          Sure did.

                      NICKY
          Everything went to his head.
               (He sighs, rubbing 
               her neck.)

                      NICKY/GINGER
               (In unison)
          Changed.

                      NICKY
          He did. He ain't the same person, 
          right?

                      GINGER
               (Whispering)
          No, he's not.

                      NICKY
          He really thinks who the fuck he is, 
          I'll tell you that.

                      GINGER
               (Holding back tears)
          Exactly.
               (Sighs.)
          He hates me.

She rests her head on NICKY's shoulder, starting to weep.

                      GINGER
          He hates my fuckin' guts.

                      NICKY
          Come on, come on, you're a toughie. 
          You can take this.
               (Runs his hand down 
               her cheek.)
          Don't cry.

                      GINGER
               (Crying)
          I'm not as tough as you think I am.

                      NICKY
          Yes, you are.

                      GINGER
               (Sobbing)
          I'm not and he scares the shit out 
          of me. I never know what he's gonna 
          do.

                      NICKY
               (Whispering)
          Come on. Don't be scared.

                      GINGER
               (Softly, through tears)
          I need some help. I do. I need some 
          help.
               (Strokes his chest.)
          You gotta help me. I need a new 
          sponsor, Nicky.

GINGER's sobs subside a little and her hand starts to stroke 
NICKY's neck.

                      GINGER
               (Whispering)
          I do. I need a new sponsor.

                      NICKY
               (Quietly, cheek to 
               cheek)
          Is that what you want?

                      GINGER
          Yeah.

                      NICKY
          A sponsor.

                      GINGER
          Yeah.

                      NICKY
          Mm... okay. Don't worry about it. 
          Nobody'll fuck with ya anymore.  
          I'll take care of ya.

                      GINGER
               (Whispering)
          Nicky, please...

                      NICKY
          Yes, I will. It's what you want, 
          isn't it? Huh?

                      GINGER
               (Sobbing)
          Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

                      NICKY
          It's what you want?

                      GINGER
          Yeah. Uh-huh -

NICKY interrupts and kisses her. She kisses him back. He 
pushes her head down to his lap.

EXT. CONSTRUCTION TRAILER - NIGHT

NICKY opens the door to the trailer and peers out to make 
sure no one is watching.

EXT. FBI SURVEILLANCE CAMPER - NIGHT

We see past a chain-link fence to a camper. We hear the sound 
of photos being taken with a high-speed camera.

EXT. CONSTRUCTION TRAILER - NIGHT

We see GINGER and NICKY slip out of the trailer in the 
deserted work site.

                      FBI AGENT #1 (O.S.)
          You see that?

EXT. FBI SURVEILLANCE CAMPER - NIGHT

FBI MEN with long-lens cameras are recording the event on 
film.

                      FBI AGENT #1
          That's Ace's wife.

NICKY and GINGER drive off.

INT. ACE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

ACE is waiting for GINGER. He hears a car pull into the drive-
way, he gets up and looks out the sliding glass door. It's 
GINGER. He sits back down, motionless with a glass of milk. 
She walks in with a sack of groceries and some dry cleaning.

                      GINGER
          Hi.

She puts her purse and the groceries down on the kitchen 
counter, and hangs up the dry cleaning.

                      ACE
          Hi. You didn't answer your beeper.

                      GINGER
          I threw it away.

                      ACE
          You threw it away?

                      GINGER
               (As she puts some 
               items away)
          Look, I tried to do this thing. I 
          know that you want me to, but it's 
          just - You know, I'm driving down 
          the freeway and the fuckin' thing's 
          'beep-beep-beep-beep'. You know, I'm 
          in a restaurant and it's - it's 
          embarrassing. I don't want to do it 
          anymore.
               (Stopping suddenly.)
          Where's Amy?

                      ACE
          I put her to bed.

                      GINGER
          Oh.
               (Walking away towards 
               their bedroom.)
          I got your cigarettes.

INT. ACE'S HOUSE, BATHROOM - NIGHT

GINGER sets some items down on her dressing-table, in front 
of a mirror.

                      GINGER
          Oscar wants you to call him.

                      ACE
          So, who'd you go to lunch with?

                      GINGER
          With Jennifer.

                      ACE
          And where'd you go?

                      GINGER
          To the Riviera.

                      ACE
               (Pause)
          What'd you have?

                      GINGER
          I had a... salad.

                      ACE
          What did Jennifer have?

                      GINGER
               (Turning to ACE)
          She had the same.

                      ACE
               (Pause)
          Okay. I want you to call Jennifer 
          and I want you to tell her to tell 
          you what she had for lunch, and I'm 
          gonna listen in on the other line.

                      GINGER
          Why do you want to do that?

                      ACE
          You know why I want to do it. Just 
          do it.

                      GINGER
          Fine.
               (Walking out and down 
               the hall.)
          Just gonna get the bowl for my thing.

                      ACE
          Mm.

INT. ACE'S HOUSE, LIVING-ROOM - NIGHT

GINGER is on the hall phone, dialing. We hear a phone ring 
through the earpiece.

She waits a few seconds and hangs up.

                      GINGER
          The line's busy. There's nobody there.

She starts to walk away. ACE stops her, picks up the phone 
and dials. We hear JENNIFER answer.

                      JENNIFER
               (Over telephone)
          Hello.

                      ACE
               (Into telephone)
          Hello, Jennifer, it's Sam -

TIGHT ON GINGER'S FINGERS CUTTING OFF THE CALL.

                      GINGER
          All right... I didn't have lunch 
          with Jennifer.

                      ACE
               (Hanging up)
          Who were you with?

                      GINGER
               (Quietly)
          I was with somebody.

                      ACE
          I know you were with somebody. Who 
          was it?
               (Pause.)
          I just hope it's not someone who I 
          think it might be.
               (Sighs, then whispers:)
          I just hope it's not them.

                      ACE (V.O.)
               (Quietly)
          I knew she fucked around.
               (Sighing.)
          You know...

INT. ACE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

The two of them are seated separately. GINGER is on the floor 
leaning against a chair, crying softly.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...she did what she did and I did 
          what I had to do. But, Jesus, Nicky 
          was the worst thing she could've 
          done.

                      ACE
          What if he won't stop?

                      ACE (V.O.)
          I mean, it could get us both killed.

                      GINGER
          I can back him off.

ACE sighs.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          She was very convincing...

EXT. LA CONCHA MOTEL - DAY

A neon signs reads: LA CONCHA MOTEL.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...when she wanted to be.

WE SEE A CANTED ANGLE OF A ROOM AND BALCONY WITH DRAWN 
CURTAINS.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          And... this... this is how she backed 
          him off.

INT. LA CONCHA MOTEL - DAY

GINGER and NICKY are making love on the bed, panting, grunting 
and gasping.

INT. LA CONCHA MOTEL - DAY

They have finished making love. NICKY is zipping up his pants. 
GINGER still sits on the bed smoking a cigarette.

                      NICKY
          Hey, Ginger... don't forget, if you're 
          challenged, you know, if he asks 
          anything, deny everything.
               (He walks up to her.)
          Do you understand? I don't want him 
          bringin' beefs back home ... 'cause 
          that could be a problem. You gotta 
          be careful. He's not dumb, you know? 
          You hear what I'm sayin', right?

Her arm and thigh are bruised.

                      GINGER
          I know. You don't have to tell me 
          that. What do you think, 
               (chuckling)
          I'm stupid?

She takes a drag off her cigarette.

                      NICKY
          Do I think you're stupid? No, I think 
          you're beautiful.
               (He bends down and 
               kisses her.)
          But I gotta go.

He exits.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          By this...

EXT. ALL-AMERICAN GAS STATION, BACK HOME - DAY

A car moves into the station and stops at a gas pump.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...time, Nicky had things so fucked 
          up on the streets, that every time 
          Marino went back home, the...

INT. ALL-AMERICAN GAS STATION, OFFICE AND GARAGE - DAY

Slow motion of MARINO walking through the front office past 
a few men. He tosses his cigarette butt and puts it out with 
his shoe. He looks nervous.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...packages got smaller and smaller. 
          It got...

INT. ALL-AMERICAN GAS STATION, GAGGI'S BACK OFFICE - DAY

MARINO takes a small stack of cash out of his coat. A seated 
GAGGI nods for one of his men to take the money.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...to the point when he walked into 
          the place... he didn't know whether 
          he was gonna be kissed or killed.

GAGGI's man takes the money.

                      GAGGI (O.S.)
          Frankie, I want to ask you something.

                      GAGGI
          It's private... but I want you to 
          tell me the truth.

                      MARINO
          Of course, Remo.

                      GAGGI
          I want you to tell me the truth, 
          mind you.

                      MARINO
          I always tell you the truth, Remo.

                      GAGGI
          Frankie... the little guy, he wouldn't 
          be fuckin' the Jew's wife, would he? 
          Because if he is... it's a problem.

FREEZE FRAME OF MARINO.

                      MARINO (V.O.)
          What could I say? I knew if I gave 
          the wrong answer, I mean, Nicky, 
          Ginger, Ace, all of 'em could've 
          would up gettin' killed.

FREEZE FRAME OF GAGGI.

                      MARINO (V.O.)
          Because there's one thing about these 
          old timers: They don't like any 
          fuckin' around with the other guy's 
          wives. It's bad for business.

ON MARINO'S FREEZE FRAME.

                      MARINO (V.O.)
          So, I lied... even though I knew 
          that by lyin' to Gaggi, I could wind 
          up gettin' killed too.

UNFREEZE - LIVE ACTION CONTINUES.

                      MARINO
               (To GAGGI)
          No. I ain't see anything like that.

                      GAGGI
          Are you sure?

                      MARINO
          I'm positive.  Remo... things are 
          very fucked up down there, you know?

                      GAGGI
          Yeah, I know. That's why I'm asking. 
          You see, my main concern is Nicky.

                      MARINO
          Hm.

                      GAGGI
          I want to know... if he's doin' all 
          right. If he's okay.

                      MARINO
          He's good. He's fine.

                      GAGGI
          I'm askin' you, Frankie, to keep an 
          eye on Nicky. Do it for me.

                      MARINO
          No problem.

                      GAGGI
          You see... I wouldn't want to be 
          jeopardizing anything for people who 
          are our friends. You understand?

                      MARINO
          I understand.

                      GAGGI
          Okay.
               (Pause.)
          Frankie, you're a good boy.

Pats MARINO's hand.

                      MARINO
          Thanks, Remo.

GAGGI drinks from his espresso cup. So does MARINO, looking 
over cautiously at the old man.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          By now, Nicky and his crew had already 
          hit rock bottom. I mean, Vegas really 
          got to him.

EXT. BAR PARKING LOT, LAS VEGAS - NIGHT

NICKY is punching a man who is leaning against a car. They 
are surrounded by MARINO, FUSCO, BLUE and HARDY. The man 
remains erect.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          The booze, the coke, the broads... I 
          mean, he got sloppy.  He just wasn't 
          the same Nicky anymore.

DOMINICK takes over. Exhausted, NICKY walks to his car and 
leans on the open car door.

                      MARINO
               (To NICKY)
          You must have drunk too much.

                      NICKY
          Go fuck yourself.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          I heard one night he had to belt a 
          guy three times before he finally 
          went down.

DOMINICK finally knocks the man down.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          In the old days, Nicky would've decked 
          him with one shot.

INT. ROOM - NIGHT

EXTREME CLOSE-UP OF A CAMERA FOLLOWING A LINE OF COCAINE AS 
IT IS SUCKED UP INTO A STRAW.

EXT. BAR PARKING LOT - NIGHT

NICKY and his crew get into their cars.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...to all of us. And his crew followed 
          him right over the edge.

The man is left alone on the ground of the dingy parking 
lot.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          They were all tuned up half the time 
          on coke. I mean, they started doin'...

EXT. BERNIE BLUE'S HOUSE, RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

BLUE gets out of his car with an aluminium foil package to 
confront the police.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...stupid things.

                      COP #1
          Watch it, partner, watch it!

                      ACE (V.O.)
          The worst was Blue.

                      BLUE
               (Belligerent)
          Hey, what do you guys want out of my 
          life, huh?

                      COP #1
          Police! Stay in the fuckin' car!

                      ACE (V.O.)
          He never knew when to keep his fuckin' 
          mouth shut.

                      COP #2
          He has a gun!

                      COP #1
          Drop your gun or I'll -!

                      BLUE
          Hey, fuck you!

                      COP #1
          Drop the gun!

BLUE is shot several times by both COPS. He falls on the 
ground, dead.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          The cops shot him. They shot Blue...

FLASHBACK - A LITTLE EARLIER

BLUE is yelling back at the COPS, holding the foil package.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...because they thought his hero 
          sandwich was a gun!

Freeze frame as the camera moves in on the wrapped sandwich 
in his hand.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          You know, they could have...

The COPS walk up to BLUE, who is on the ground amid shattered 
glass.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...been right, but who knows?

                      COP #1
          Jesus Christ! What gun? He's got a 
          fuckin' hero sandwich here.

                      COP #2
          What do you want? It - It's pitch-
          black out here. It's tin foil.

                      COP #1
          Pitch-black?! It -

                      COP #2
          It looked like a fuckin' gun!

                      COP #1
          You - You fuckin' moron, I'll be 
          filling out paper work for the next 
          two months because of you and this 
          piece of shit, you...

                      COP #2
          Oh my God, what are we gonna do? I'm 
          sorry.

                      COP #1
          ...fuckin' jerk-off.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          And to make matters worse, to get 
          even, Nicky's crew got stoned one 
          night and they started shootin' up 
          the cops' houses.

COP #1 plants a gun on the ground next to BLUE's legs using 
a handkerchief to avoid leaving fingerprints.

EXT. DETECTIVE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The house explodes as gunfire riddles the front of a 
detective's home. MARINO, DOMINICK, FUSCO, HARDY and three 
HOODS in another car are spraying the home with machine-guns 
and shotguns.

EXT. GOLD RUSH - DAY

NICKY and MARINO emerge from the shop.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          I mean, it got to the point where 
          they couldn't even talk in the Gold 
          Rush anymore because the Feds put a 
          wire in the wall.

EXT. FBI STAKEOUT POST: MOTEL ACROSS FROM THE GOLD RUSH - 
DAY

Two FBI AGENTS with binoculars are watching NICKY and MARINO, 
trying to read their lips.)

                      ACE (V.O.)
          And even when they talked outside, 
          they had to cover their mouths 
          because...

                      LIP-READER
               (Lowering his 
               binoculars)
          Jeez, he's coverin' up again.

He raises the binoculars and looks through again.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...the Feds brought in lip-readers.

EXT. GOLD RUSH - DAY

NICKY and MARINO are outside talking. They are covering their 
mouths with their hands and constantly looking around.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Nicky found out about it from a teller 
          who owed him money.  This guy 
          worked...

Voice-over trails off.

                      MARINO
          He asked me again about you and the 
          Jew's wife.

                      NICKY
          Walk, walk, walk. What'd you say?

                      MARINO
          He asked me again about you and the 
          Jew's wife.

                      NICKY
          Yeah, what'd you tell him?

                      MARINO
          I told him I didn't know nothin'. 
          But Jiggs and, uh, Tony Gorilla said 
          if you did anything, you're fucked 
          up.

                      NICKY
          You think he's goin' home, makin' a 
          beef behind my back?

                      MARINO
          Nah. You would've heard somethin'.

                      NICKY
          Yeah, what's to stop him?

                      MARINO
          I know. I know.

                      NICKY
          I don't trust him anymore. But they'd 
          never okay anything, you know?

                      MARINO
          Yeah, but they keep askin' about it.

                      NICKY
          Well, now, sure they're askin'. They 
          earn with the prick. I got a funny 
          feelin' he's gonna start a fuckin' 
          war or somethin'.
               (Pause)
          I'm not sure yet, you know. But I w- 
          You know, but you know what I want 
          you to do?

                      MARINO
          What?

NICKY looks suspiciously at a man walking by them.

                      NICKY
          Who's this guy? Who's this guy?

                      MARINO
          Oh, he ain't nobody.

                      NICKY
          You know what I want you to do? Get 
          a couple of guys to dig a hole in 
          the desert, then let 'em show you 
          where it's at.

                      MARINO
          Angelo and Buster.

                      NICKY
          Yeah, but I'm not sure yet.

                      MARINO
          They'll do it.

                      NICKY
          And when I'm ready, I'll say the 
          words, 'Go see the Jew.'

                      MARINO
          Yeah.

                      NICKY
          And you make it disappear, you know 
          what I mean?

                      MARINO
          Yeah, just let me know. But you gotta 
          be ready. You know what I'm talkin' 
          about?

                      NICKY
          Did I say to do anything yet? I said 
          I'm not sure... I'll let you know. I 
          want to think about it. Where're 
          these pricks at?

Looks for the FBI AGENTS.

                      MARINO
          Don't know.

                      NICKY
          Dominick said they're in the motel?

                      MARINO
          Yeah, either that or in the fuckin' 
          bank. I don't know. They're all over 
          the joint.

showgirls. ACE is on the phone. It rings and rings, but 
there's no answer.

The camera pans from the bedroom hallway to the living-room 
as the phone rings.

                      ACE
               (Getting up from the 
               table)
          Be right back. I'll be right back.

He walks over to RUDY, the maitre d'.

                      ACE
          Rudy, any calls for me, just give 
          'em to Mr Sherbert. I'll be right 
          back.

                      RUDY
          Sure, Mr Rothstein. You'll be back...?

                      ACE
          I'm going home for a few seconds. 
          I'll be right back.

ACE hurries out. RUDY picks up the phone and dials a number.

                      RUDY

          Yeah, he just left.

                      NICKY
          Yeah? All right.

He hangs up the phone and looks across the room at GINGER, 
who is seated in a booth smiling at him and picking the olive 
out of a Martini.

INT. ACE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

ACE gets home and can't find GINGER.

                      ACE
               (Looking around the 
               house)
          Hello? Hello! Ginger.

                      AMY
               (Faintly, from her 
               bedroom)
          Help, Daddy!

Fear strikes him and he runs to his daughter's room.

                      ACE
               (Knocking, turning 
               the doorknob)
          Amy! Amy, open the door!

                      AMY (O.S.)
               (From her room)
          I can't! I'm tied!

                      ACE
          Wh-wh -

ACE slams his shoulder against the door, trying to knock it 
down.

INT. ACE'S HOUSE, AMY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

ACE forces it open and sees that AMY's arms have been tied 
to her bed with stockings. AMY screams.

                      AMY
          Dad!

                      ACE
          What happened? What happened? Who 
          did this to you?

                      AMY
          Mommy.

                      ACE
          I'm gonna get a knife and cut you 
          loose, honey, I'll -

                      AMY
               (Panting)
          Oh, no, please, please.

She tries to keep him from leaving her.

                      ACE
               (Bending down, kisses 
               her)
          Okay, I'll be right back.

ACE cuts AMY loose with a knife.

                      ACE
          When did this happen, honey?

                      AMY
          I don't know.

She gets up and hugs her father.

                      ACE
          You don't know? What time did your 
          mother do this? When did she leave?

                      AMY
          I don't know.

                      ACE
               (Comforting AMY as 
               she moans)

          Uh, all right.

He hangs up and steps over to DOMINICK and MARINO.

                      NICKY
          He's comin' over.

                      DOMINICK
          Great!

INT. LEANING TOWER - NIGHT

High angle past the restaurant's neon sign to ACE's car 
screeching to a halt by the main entrance. He storms in.

INT. LEANING TOWER - NIGHT

ACE is stopped by NICKY in the foyer.

                      NICKY
               (Trying to calm him)
          Ace don't... listen, don't... don't 
          make a scene, all right?

                      ACE
          I want to just talk. I want to talk 
          to that Irish bitch.

                      NICKY
          She didn't know who to turn to.
               (Raising his hand 
               almost in a plea.)
          She... she didn't know where to turn. 
          She was tryin' to save your marriage.

                      ACE
          Yeah? Nicky, I want to talk to that 
          fuckin' bitch.

                      NICKY
               (Menacing)
          Hey, be fuckin' nice. Calm. Be nice. 
          Don't fuck up in here.

ACE pauses for a beat, realizing that NICKY is standing in 
his way and could be dangerous. ACE gives him a wide berth.

We follow ACE through the crowd to GINGER, seated in a booth. 
He sits down angrily across from her.)

                      GINGER
               (Stoned, smoking a 
               cigarette)

          It's just for a little while, Sam. 
          The baby-sitter wasn't there.

          She wasn't gonna get up. I was just 
          gonna be out for a little while.

                      ACE
          I should have -

                      GINGER
          I mean, she was asleep. I was going 
          to be right back before she even 
          woke up.

                      ACE
          Listen to me, listen to me, listen 
          to me.

               the table.)
          Listen, you fuckin' cunt.

                      GINGER
          Oh, sh-

                      ACE
          Listen to me.

                      GINGER

               (Knocking her drink 
               over)
          Let me tell you something.

          Listen to me.

                      GINGER
          I w- I was gonna be back before she 
          woke up.

                      ACE
          You listen carefully! You ever fuckin' 
          touch her again, you ever do anything 
          like that again, I'll fuckin' kill 
          you.  Pure and simple. Do you hear 
          me? Pure and fuckin' simple, I'll 
          fuckin' kill you, you bitch.

                      GINGER
               (Leaning in to him)
          Why don't you just let me go, Sam?

                      ACE
          You fuckin' whore!

                      GINGER
          I'll sign anything you want me to 
          sign, okay?

                      ACE
          You understand? What? Let you go?

                      GINGER
          I just want the key to my jewelry, 
          and I want you to let me go.

                      ACE
          You want your jewelry?

                      GINGER
          I want you to let me go.

                      ACE
          And what? And let you disgrace me, 
          you fuckin' pig? And let you disgrace 
          me?  Get up. Get up and be a mother. 
          Get in the car and go to the house...

GINGER darts a look to NICKY who is at the bar, watching 
anxiously. He gestures with his head for her to leave.

                      ACE
          Right now. Get up and -

ACE notices her look at NICKY but when he turns to see what 
she's looking at, he just misses NICKY's gesture. ACE grabs 
GINGER by her collar.

                      ACE
          Get - Get up! Get up!

                      GINGER

          you.

                      ACE

          Get up! Get going!
               (Pushing the table.)

NICKY gestures to her again.

                      GINGER
          I wouldn't -

          I'll fuckin' kill you in this place!
               (Pointing to her.)
          Get up and go home right now.

GINGER gets up and leans in to shout at ACE.

                      GINGER
               (Barking)
          I'm going. I'm going, you -!

She grabs her purse and leaves. Patrons stare as ACE follows 
her out.

INT. ACE'S HOUSE, FOYER - NIGHT

GINGER follows ACE through the door. As soon as she closes 
the door behind her, ACE turns to face her.

                      ACE
          Now you need approval from him to go 
          home?

                      GINGER
          So what? So who fuckin' blew you in 
          the parking lot before you came in... 
          huh?

                      ACE
               (Disgusted)
          You make me sick, you fuck. Once a 
          fuckin' hooker, always a hooker.

                      GINGER
          Oh, fuck you! Fuck you, Sam Rothstein!
               (Opening the door.)
          Fuck you!

A furious GINGER turns around and storms out, slamming the 
door.

INT. ACE'S HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT

Through the kitchen sliding glass door: GINGER's engine roars 
and tires screech as she tears away in her her sportscar. 
ACE dials the phone.

                      ACE
               (Into telephone)
          Yeah, Billy Sherbert, please. Put

          Who's this?

          Yeah, Bill, listen, I'll explain to

EXT. LEANING TOWER - NIGHT

GINGER's car screeches into the parking lot and she jumps 
out, leaving her car oor open and engine running. A valet 
parker approaches.

                      GINGER
               (To VALET PARKER)
          Leave it where it is.

INT. LEANING TOWER, FOYER - NIGHT

GINGER bursts in. MARINO tries to calm her down.

                      GINGER
          Where is he? Goddamn it! I want that 
          Jew bastard killed! I have fuckin' 
          had it!

NICKY walks in from the restaurant.

                      MARINO
          Calm down, calm down. Shh!

                      NICKY
          Shh.
               (To MARINO.)
          Hide her car in the back!

He pulls her by her arm to a storage room upstairs.

                      GINGER
          There's no reason to hide my car. He 
          already knows! 
               (Walking up the stairs.)
          He threw it in my face! The second I 
          get out of here, I -

INT. LEANING TOWER, UPSTAIRS STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT

GINGER is enraged and panting.

                      NICKY
          What did I tell you? Supposing he 
          goes back home and makes a fuckin' 
          beef?  I gotta know exactly what you 
          said. Tell me what you said to him.

                      GINGER
          Me? I said... nothin'. I said, I 
          said, 'No, no, no.' Everything he 
          said, I just kept sayin' no.

                      NICKY
          I told you this was fuckin' dangerous. 
          Remember I said, 'Ginger, this is a 
          dangerous situation. Be very careful.' 
          You fuckin' yessed me to death.

                      GINGER
          If it's so fuckin' dangerous, then 
          why don't you kill him?

                      NICKY
          I'm not gonna kill him. Shut the 
          fuck up. What, do you know what you're 
          talkin' about? I'm not killing anyb-

                      GINGER
               (Interrupting)
          Oh, well, then, have him killed and 
          get it over with.

                      NICKY
               (Loud and angry)
          Hey, don't be such a fuckin' smartass, 
          will you?  I mean, I know the fuckin' 
          guy thirty-five years, I'm gonna 
          fuckin' whack him for you?  Fuck... 
          motherfucker! I knew this, I knew 
          it.

                      GINGER
          What about my money?

                      NICKY
               (Raising his voice 
               even more)
          How the fuck am I gonna get your 
          fuckin' money now? You think he's 
          gonna give you fuckin' money? Are 
          you out of your mind?!  Look what 
          you just did to this fuckin' guy!  
          If you would have just kept your 
          fuckin' mouth shut!
               (Walking away.)
          Ah, what the fuck is the use? I 
          should've never got invol-

GINGER screams and attacks NICKY.

                      NICKY
               (Grappling with her)
          What? Hey! Hey! What the fuck are 
          you... ?

NICKY slaps her roughly across the face, grabs the back her 
jacket and forcefully leads her to a stairway.

                      GINGER
          Ah, you fuck! You're such a fuckin' 
          asshole!

                      NICKY
          Get the fuck out of here. Get out! 
          Get the fuck out!

Shoves her down the stairs. GINGER yells and gasps on her 
way down.

                      MARINO (O.S.)
          (From bottom of stairway)
          Whoa. Calm down.

                      NICKY
               (Behind GINGER)
          Get out. Get out! Get out!

                      MARINO (O.S.)
          Take it easy!

                      NICKY
          Why'd I get involved with this fuckin' 
          nut in the first place? Get out!

                      MARINO
          You're gonna fuckin' kill her. Take 
          it easy.

                      NICKY
               (Pushing a sobbing 
               GINGER out the back 
               door)
          Get her the fuck out of here. Get 
          her out of here.

EXT. LEANING TOWER, BACK DOOR/REAR PARKING LOT - NIGHT

MARINO throws GINGER out the back door. She falls on her 
side, crying.

                      NICKY
          Get the fuck out of here.

                      GINGER
               (Sobbing, getting up)
          I don't need you! I have my own 
          fuckin' money!

                      NICKY
          All right, all right.

She stumbles to her car.

                      GINGER
          I'm going' to the FBI! I'm not scared 
          anymore!

                      NICKY
          All right. Be careful.

                      GINGER
          You fucked with me for the last time!

                      NICKY
          Okay, yeah.

INT. LEANING TOWER, BACK DOOR - NIGHT

NICKY and MARINO are seated at the back door watching GINGER 
screech out of the parking lot.

                      NICKY
          Be careful.
               (To MARINO.)
          Hey, come on. Get inside.

They turn and walk back inside. MARINO leans on a wall next 
to the kitchen.

NICKY has scratches on his hand and face.

                      NICKY
          Can you fuckin' believe that?
               (Showing MARINO his 
               scratches.)
          Look at this motherfucker.

NICKY sits on the bottom step across from MARINO, who sighs. 
Cooks mill around in the background.

                      NICKY
          I fucked up, Frankie. I fucked up 
          good this time. Should have never 
          started with this fuckin' broad.

                      MARINO
          Take it easy. What could you do? I 
          mean, she threw herself at you, right?

                      NICKY
          I'm in a bad fuckin' spot here. You 
          know that? Bad fuckin' spot.

He puts his head in his hands.

INT. ACE'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT

We see SHERBERT approach the sliding glass door holding a 
shotgun. ACE lets him in, locks the door and grabs the gun 
from him.

EXT. ACE'S HOUSE, LIVING-ROOM - NIGHT

Through the sliding patio doors, we see ACE and SHERBERT 
making sure all the doors are locked and the lights are turned 
off.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          I already left the kid with neighbors 
          and I had about a million in cash 
          and jewels that I gave to Sherbert 
          to lock up in the hotel.

                      ACE (O.S.)
               (From following scene)
          Put this in the...

INT. ACE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

ACE leads SHERBERT to the front door as he stuffs a shoebox 
filled with cash and jewels in a bag and hands it over to 
him.

                      ACE
          ...hotel safe, then I want you to 
          come right back. 

ACE shuts the down behind him and switches off a light. The 
room goes black.

EXT. ACE'S HOUSE - MORNING

A crisp, sunny morning. SHERBERT's car is parked on the street 
in front of the house.

INT. ACE'S HOUSE, UPSTAIRS DEN - MORNING

An exhausted ACE, in his robe, and SHERBERT are seated across 
from each other at the bar with the shotgun displayed 
prominently on the counter between them.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET, ACE'S HOUSE - MORNING

Camera pans with GINGER's car as it approaches the driveway 
and crashes into the back of ACE's parked car.

INT. ACE'S HOUSE, UPSTAIRS DEN - MORNING

ACE and SHERBERT react to the noise. SHERBERT grabs the 
shotgun. ACE looks out the window at GINGER ramming her car 
into his.

                      ACE
          She, she's alone. Just go. Take the 
          gun and go into Amy's.

                      GINGER (O.S.)
               (Screaming)
          You get down here!

                      ACE
               (To SHERBERT as he 
               walks around the bar 
               with the gun)
          Just wait there for me!

                      GINGER
               (From driveway)
          Get down here and talk to me, goddamn 
          it! Don't fuckin' ignore me! You 
          motherfucker!

SHERBERT exits. ACE runs over to the stairs and starts down 
them.

EXT. ACE'S HOUSE - MORNING

GINGER repeatedly smashes into ACE's car.

                      GINGER
               (From her car)
          I mean it!

ACE emerges from the front door, taking cover behind a brick 
column.

                      GINGER
          You come down here right now! Come 
          down here and talk to me, goddamn 
          it! Fuck you! Goddamn you, come out 
          here!  I'm gonna drive this fucking 
          car through the living-room!

She starts to drive it across the lawn. ACE darts back towards 
the front door. GINGER's car stops in front of the porch.

                      GINGER
               (Getting out of the 
               car to confront ACE)
          You fucking coward! You motherfucker!

She slips and falls on the lawn.

                      GINGER
          You come out here and talk to me, 
          you fucker!

                      ACE
               (From the porch)
          Will you stop it? You're drunk, you're 
          on drugs. You're gonna -

                      GINGER
          I am not!

                      ACE
               (Pointing to her)
          You're gonna be sorry if you don't 
          stop that.

                      GINGER
          Don't you threaten me!

                      ACE
          You'll wake the whole neighborhood!

                      GINGER
               (Kicking the hedges)
          Don't you threaten me!

EXT. NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE ACROSS THE STREET - MORNING

A female neighbor walks out of her house. A man from the 
house next door does the same. We see AMY watching from the 
neighbor's window.

                      GINGER (O.S.)
          You are not threatening me anymore!

                      ACE (O.S.)
          I'm not -

EXT. ACE'S HOUSE - MORNING

GINGER is bending down, breaking off branches from some plants 
and throwing them at ACE.

                      GINGER
          You fuck! You fuck! I'm sick of you!

ACE flinches as a handful of leaves hits his face.

                      GINGER
          I am fuckin' Nicky Santoro! I am! 
          He's my new sponsor!

ACE gestures towards the neighbors who are watching. A squad 
car pulls into the driveway.

                      GINGER
               (To ACE)
          What about that, you fuckhead?!
               (To neighbors.)
          What are you looking at? Fuck off!

Two COPS walk up the driveway towards GINGER.

          business!

          We've got some complaints about - 
          about the noise.

                      GINGER
          I'm just trying to get in my house!

                      COP #1
          I understand.

          He won't let me go in my house!

                      ACE
          I won't let her in. I'm sorry, Randy, 
          I'm not gonna let her in. She - Well, 
          I'm not gonna let her in, the way 
          she's behaving. I'm - I'm -

          What do you mean, what am I gonna 
          do? I'm in the same clothes for two 
          days! I want to get a few of my 
          things! Big deal!

                      COP #1
          All right. Okay, okay.

                      COP #2
          Mr Rothstein, why don't we just let 
          her in the house and get a few of 
          her things?  That way she'll get out 
          of here. This is half her house 
          anyway.

                      ACE
          I'm afraid to let her in the house.

                      GINGER
          Oh, you are...

                      ACE
          I'm afraid she's gonna destroy stuff.

          Fucker!

          Please.

                      ACE
          Should I let her in like - ?

                      GINGER
          You ought to be afraid, the way you 
          fuckin' treat me!

                      COP #1
          Hey, Mr Rothstein, it'll make it a 
          lot easier on everybody here if we 
          just let her in the house.

                      COP #2
          If we let her get a few of her things 
          we'll be out of your hair.

                      ACE
          If she calms down, I will let her in 
          the house.

          No, you're not calm.

          ...I will let her in the house for 
          five minutes if you gentlemen will 
          escort her out if she happens not to

          Can I go in?

          Jeff, would you go in with her?

GINGER walks towards the front door.

                      COP #2
          We can do that. Absolutely. Yes. 
          Absolutely.

                      GINGER
          Yes, fine!  Fine!

          been to me. He's locked up...

INT. ACE'S HOUSE, UPSTAIRS DEN - MORNING

GINGER races up the stairs, trailed by COP #2.

                      GINGER
          ...most of my important stuff, all 
          my papers and things. And I have to 
          get 'em.

She walks across the room to ACE's desk.

                      GINGER
          So don't let him come in here 'cause 
          I know they're in here in the desk 
          and he's -

She tries to open the middle drawer but it's locked.

          Fuck!
               (Going through a couple 
               of drawers.)
          Just pay attention. He could come up 
          here at any time.
               (Pants.)

She spots a pair of scissors on the desk. She tries to open 
the drawer with them.

                      GINGER
               (Then, to COP #2)
          Are you watching for him?

She finally pries the drawer open, breaking the tip of the 
scissors.  GINGER's hands open the drawer and she picks up 
the safe deposit keys.

                      GINGER
          Got 'em.

          than a few more minutes.

                      COP #1
          No, it's - it'll just be a couple of 
          minutes. We got other things to do 
          too, you know. He'll hurry her up.

INT. ACE'S HOUSE, BEDROOM CLOSET - MORNING

GINGER runs into the closet, bending down to search through 
the shoe boxes that usually contain money but are now empty.

          thing and then we'll be - We can go.

               a pair of ACE's shoes 
               and tossing them on

          God, fuck! Shit! God!
               (She runs out, taking 
               a fur coat off a 
               hangar. Then, grunting)
          Really pisses me off...

          And it would be great if you guys 
          could follow me out of here, because 
          he's been threatening me.

GINGER walks to her car.

               (To COP #1)
          Come on. I'm sorry.

               handfuls of cash)
          Yeah, just hold the top open, all

She starts to stuff the money in the bag.

GINGER throws the canvas bag into the trunk of her car when, 
suddenly, she sees ACE's beat-up Cadillac approaching. She 
gasps.

          Oh, God. It's him.
               (To COPS.)
          You have to stop him. You have to - 
          'Cause he said he was going to kill 
          me.

ACE jumps out of his car and runs toward GINGER, SHERBERT 
follows him out.

ACE is intercepted by the COPS who hold him back.

                      GINGER
          You just - Just stop him.

The COPS huddle around ACE and SHERBERT until GINGER's car 
pulls out of the bank.

          Nothin' we can do about it. Nothin' 
          we can do. There's nothin' we can

          Look, look. You can't stop her for 
          speeding? I mean, look what the hell 
          she's doing.

                      COP #1
          Speeding?

                      COP #2
          We're talkin' to you right now.

GINGER's car disappears into traffic. The FBI car across the 
street follows right behind her.

                      COP #2
          There's nothing we can do. She had 
          the key.

                      COP #1
          She's on the account. There's nothing 
          we can do.

EXT. FBI SURVEILLANCE CAR - MORNING

The AGENTS are following GINGER.

                      FBI AGENT #1
          Let's pull her over at that Citgo 
          Station.

                      FBI AGENT #2
               (Driving)
          Okay, let's do it.

FBI AGENT #1 puts a siren on top of the car's roof.

EXT. VEGAS STREET, CITGO STATION - MORNING

GINGER pulls over at a gas station, the FBI car with siren 
blaring right behind her.

EXT. VEGAS BANK - MORNING

A powerless ACE and SHERBERT are still standing in front of 
the bank with the COPS. COP #2 gives ACE a 'sorry' gesture.

EXT. CITGO STATION - MORNING

GINGER and the FBI AGENTS are standing by her car. She is 
distraught.

                      FBI AGENT #2
          We're - we're placing you under arrest 
          for -

                      GINGER
               (Sobbing)
          For what?

                      FBI AGENT #2
          We're placing you under arrest for 
          aiding and abetting -

                      GINGER
               (Through tears)
          What?

                      FBI AGENT #2
          We're placing you under arrest for 
          aiding and abetting a -

                      GINGER
               (Crying)
          But I'm just trying to leave.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          After all the threats and all the 
          bullshit, it turned out Ginger didn't 
          tell 'em anything. But by then, the 
          Feds didn't need her, anyway.

                      GINGER
               (Sobbing)
          But it was just mine.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          They had all the pieces they needed.

                      FBI AGENT #1
          Come on.

                      GINGER
          But I didn't do anything.

The AGENTS escort GINGER to their car.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          And everybody...

EXT. GOLD RUSH - NIGHT

Twelve FBI AGENTS with rifles, wearing 'FBI' armbands, charge 
into the parking lot and rush through the front door.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...began to tumble.

                      FBI AGENT #3
          FBI! We have a warrant!

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...one after the other... just like 
          dominoes. Between Piscano complaining 
          on a wire.

EXT. GOLD RUSH - NIGHT, A LITTLE LATER

The FBI AGENTS escort DOMINICK, HARDY, FUSCO and MARINO out 
of the front of the shop.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Between Nicky, Ginger, me and my 
          license... paradise... we managed to 
          really fuck it all up.

INT. NICKY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

We hear a doorbell ring. LITTLE NICKY, now ten years old, 
see FBI AGENTS approaching the house.

                      LITTLE NICKY
               (Getting up from the 
               couch)
          Mom!

                      JENNIFER (O.S.)
               (Into telephone)
          Yeah, well, someone's at the fuckin' 
          door now.

Jennifer's cousin opens the door; seven AGENTS storm in.

                      FBI AGENT #4
          FBI. We have a federal search warrant.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Right away, I got wind of the pinches 
          comin' down, so I took off. Who needs 
          to hang around for that bullshit?

                      FBI AGENT #4
               (To JENNIFER, showing 
               his badge)
          My name is Marc Caspar, Special Agent, 
          FBI.

                      JENNIFER
               (Defensive)
          Yeah, well,
               (grabbing the phone 
               and walking away)
          Can I make a fuckin' phone call?

                      FBI AGENT #4
               (Blocking her way as 
               she tries to get by 
               him)
          Hey, ho-hold it for a minute. You 
          can make a phone call, but you don't 
          have to talk to us like that.

                      JENNIFER
               (Slamming the phone 
               down on a table)
          Hey -

INT. TANGIERS CASHIER'S CAGE - DAY

NANCE is talking to a cashier behind the cage when FBI AGENTS 
with Gaming Board investigators DUPREY and AUSTIN enter the 
casino.

                      FBI AGENT #5
          FBI! Don't be alarmed.

NANCE rushes out a back door.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          But they got almost everybody else.

                      FBI AGENT #5
          This area is seized.

                      DUPREY
          Grab everything in sight.

                      FBI AGENT #6
          Right.

                      DUPREY
               (Walking through a 
               door into the cage)
          Get the master account list!

                      AUSTIN
          I want all those papers seized, 
          regardless of what they are.

As AUSTIN and the others make their way into the soft count 
room, an AGENT puts up a yellow crime banner across the front 
of the cashier's window.

                      AUSTIN
          I want this area off-limits to 
          everybody.

INT. TANGIERS SOFT COUNT ROOM - DAY

The counters look on as several AGENTS seize the money boxes 
and stacks of cash from the glass table. DUPREY sifts through 
the Count Room Executive's notebook.

AUSTIN is at a cabinet looking through a ledger.

                      AUSTIN
               (Holding the book)
          Ah, yes, here we are. A little craps 
          figures.  [Actual amount taken from 
          craps tables before the skim.] Hey - 
          Hey.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Green?

INT. GREEN'S MALIBU HOUSE - NIGHT

GREEN, wearing a tennis outfit and holding a racquet, is 
being questioned by FBI AGENT #8 who's showing him confiscated 
papers. Several AGENTS are searching the house.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Don't even ask.

                      FBI AGENT #8
          Thirty thousand dollars...

                      GREEN
          No, he didn't. And that's why it 
          wasn't valid. I was being extorted, 
          all right?  I'm willing to tell you 
          whatever you want to know. I've got 
          nothin' to hide here.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Now, for the best...

INT. PISCANO'S HOUSE, LIVING-ROOM, KANSAS CITY - DAY

FBI AGENT #9 removes some ledgers from a a filing cabinet.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...and I couldn't believe this shit. 
          Piscano's expense reports took the 
          cake.

AGENTS are wandering around the house, looking for evidence.

                      FBI AGENT #9
          Oh, this is good. Bingo!

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          He might as well have given them a 
          fuckin' blueprint.  Everybody's names, 
          address, dates, everything.

                      FBI AGENT #9
               (Crossing the room to 
               PISCANO)
          Look at this! That you so much, Mr 
          Piscano. How considerate of you. 
          Appreciate it.

                      PISCANO
          Those are my m- those are my mother's 
          books.

                      FBI AGENT #10
          You're under arrest.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          What a fuckin' balloon head.

PISCANO gets more and more agitated as FBI AGENT #10 gets 
one cuff on him.

                      PISCANO
          What are you guys doin'?!

PISCANO gasps and clutches his chest, having a heart attack. 
The AGENT drops the cuffs and tries to help PISCANO as he 
collapses onto the floor.

                      FBI AGENT #10
          Take it easy, Artie. We just want to 
          talk to you.

PISCANO'S WIFE and the FBI AGENTS kneel down beside him.

                      PISCANO'S WIFE
               (Screaming)
          Artie, are you okay? Sweetheart? 
          Honey? Wait a minute! He's sick! 
          Artie! Oh, God!

She continues to scream as the AGENTS try to revive him.

                      FBI AGENT #10
               (To PISCANO's wife)
          Move back! Come on!

                      FBI AGENT #9
          Dave!

                      PISCANO'S WIFE
          He's sick! It's his heart!

                      FBI AGENT #9
          CPR! Now!

                      PISCANO'S WIFE
          Oh, God, is he breathing? He's not 
          breathing!

An FBI AGENT gives him mouth-to-mouth.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          Poor Artie. He got so upset he had a 
          heart attack and dropped dead right 
          there in front of his wife.

FBI AGENTS #9 and #10 restrain PISCANO'S hysterical WIFE.

                      PISCANO'S WIFE
          Artie!

                      FBI AGENT #10
          Calm down! Calm down!

                      PISCANO'S WIFE
          No, I won't calm down! He's my 
          husband!

                      FBI AGENT #10
          Stay out of the way!

                      PISCANO'S WIFE
          Artie! Artie!

                      FBI AGENT #10
          We can't help him if -

EXT. ACE'S HOUSE - DAY

ACE opens his front door and is confronted by two FBI AGENTS. 
He is shown pictures of NICKY and GINGER at the construction 
site.

                      ACE (V.O.)
               (Quietly)
          And at the end of the day, they 
          finally came to see me with the 
          pictures.

                      FBI AGENT #1
               (Pointing to the 
               pictures)
          Why protect a friend who betrayed 
          you like that?

                      ACE (V.O.)
          But I didn't want to look at 'em. I 
          didn't want to look at the guys who 
          brought 'em either.

ACE refuses to look at the photos and quietly closes the 
door on the AGENTS.

INT. FEDERAL COURT-HOUSE - DAY

GAGGI, FORLANO, BORELLI and CAPELLI are all in court. FORLANO 
and CAPELLI are breathing through masks and oxygen tanks 
with nearby doctors and nurses. GAGGI

has a cane in front of him. Several court spectators look 
on. We hear the bosses' lawyer speak.

                      LAWYER
          Your Honor, as you can see, my clients 
          are elderly and infirm. Any 
          incarceration could pose a serious 
          health risk. They are no danger to 
          the community and they pose no flight 
          risk.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          When the bosses were arrested, some 
          of 'em were so old they needed doctors 
          at their arraignment.

                      LAWYER
          And Pre-trial Services recommends 
          that bail remain as presently set.

                      JUDGE
               (Calling a recess)
          We're going to take a ten-minute 
          recess.

The JUDGE pounds his gavel.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          And when it looked like they could 
          get twenty-five years... 

The BOSSES, their nurses and lawyer file through a side court 
door.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...to life in prison, just for 
          skimmin' a casino... sick or no 
          fuckin' sick, you knew people were 
          gonna get clipped. So, the day of 
          the arraignment, they had this meeting 
          right in the back of the court-house.

INT. COURT-HOUSE CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

The BOSSES are gathered around a conference table as the 
lawyers and nurses silently walk out the door as if on cue.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          See, when something like this happens, 
          you know how things are gonna work 
          out. It's always better with no 
          witnesses. So, what about Andy?

THE CAMERA PANS FROM ONE BOSS TO THE OTHER.

                      FORLANO
               (Putting down his 
               oxygen mask once the 
               door behind him is 
               shut)
          He won't talk. Stone is a good kid. 
          Stand-up guy, just like his old man. 
          That's the way I see it.

                      BORELLI
          I agree. He's solid. A fuckin' Marine.

                      CAPELLI
               (Holding his oxygen 
               mask)
          He's okay. He always was. Remo, what 
          do you think?

                      GAGGI
               (Pause)
          Look... why take a chance? At least, 
          that's the way I feel about it.

EXT. BACK HOME RESTAURANT, STRIP MALL PARKING LOT - DAY

ANDY STONE and his LAWYER are walking toward their car.

                      STONE
          You call Artie... and you tell him I 
          don't care what, he's gotta be in my 
          office Thursday morning before eleven 
          o'clock.

                      LAWYER
          It's done.

His LAWYER veers to the left, walking away from STONE who 
keeps talking.

                      LAWYER (O.S.)
          It's done.

                      STONE
               (To himself)
          It's terribly important. I gotta 
          have a conversation with this guy. 
          That's all.

GAGGI's men, CURLY and BEEPER, appear from behind STONE and 
shoot him dead.

They empty their silent half-load rounds into STONE even 
after he's down on the snowy ground. They walk away 
discreetly, leaving him partially hidden between cars.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          As much as they liked him, I mean, 
          he wasn't one of us. He wasn't 
          Italian. As far as they knew, he 
          could have talked. Otherwise, Stony 
          might still be alive.

MONTAGE OF MURDERS:

EXT. NANCE'S COSTA RICAN HOUSE - DAY

TITLE IN: COSTA RICA

The camera moves down a waterfall to reveal NANCE's Spanish-
style house.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          The first one to skip was John Nance. 
          He found a nice, warm secluded place 
          in Costa Rica. He thought nobody 
          would find him there.

Several gunshots are heard. NANCE emerges from the house 
through a door and runs along a verandah to another door. He 
breaks a pane of glass, unlocks another door and runs in.  
BEEPER emerges from the first door and follows him back into 
the house. Several more shots are heard. NANCE emerges from 
yet another door, only this time he's been shot in the 
stomach. He painfully staggers away from the hitmen.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          But, then, his kid got nabbed by the 
          Feds for drugs, and so naturally the 
          bosses were afraid he'd come out of 
          hidin' just to save his kid and give 
          'em all up.  So...

CURLY and BEEPER come out of the house and approach NANCE 
from behind.

                      CURLY
          Hey, where you goin', jag-off?

NANCE kneels down. CURLY points his gun expertly at the top 
of NANCE's head and fires. Blood splatters from NANCE's mouth 
and he falls to the ground. The gunmen walk away.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          But anyway, they, you know, they all 
          had to follow.

EXT. HOLE IN THE DESERT - DUSK

A bound COUNT ROOM EXEC and a CLERK are kneeling next to a 
large pit in the esert ground in front of BEEPER and CURLY.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Everybody went down.

The CLERK groans as he's shot in the head by BEEPER. Blood 
splatters and he falls right into the pre-dug hole.

                      COUNT ROOM EXEC
          Go ahead, fuck...

                      CURLY
          Fuck you.

CURLY shoots the EXEC in the head, he too falls backward 
into the pit. The gunmen fire more rounds into the bodies, 
then toss their guns into the hole.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          Before you knew it...

EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

RICHIE, a sharply dressed Tangiers EXEC, is getting into his 
new Lincoln.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...anybody who knew anything wound 
          up gettin' whacked.

CURLY sneaks up from behind and hits the EXEC with a lead 
pipe. He puts a plastic bag over his head and begins to choke 
him to death. The EXEC struggles a bit but the bag soon fills 
with blood. CURLY strikes him with the pipe one last time.

INT. BEVERLY SUNSET MOTEL - NIGHT

The camera pans away from an empty registration desk to a 
motel corridor.

                      GINGER (O.S.)
               (Gasping)
          Oh! Oh, no!  No...

The camera moves past several rooms along a cinder block 
wall.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          After Ginger took off, she wasn't 
          much help to anybody. She found some 
          pimps, low-lifes, druggies and bikers 
          in LA. And in a few months, they 
          went through all the money and all 
          the jewels.

Suddenly, a door opens and GINGER overdosing, staggers into 
the hall looking for help. She gasps, goes halfway down the 
seedy corridor towards the desk, but collapses and dies.

FREEZE FRAME ON GINGER SPRAWLED OUT ON THE MOTEL CARPET.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          After they found her body... I had a 
          private doctor do another autopsy. 
          He said they gave her... a hot dose. 
          In the end... all she had left was 
          thirty-six hundred in mint-condition 
          coins.

END OF MONTAGE

EXT. TONY ROMA'S RESTAURANT PARKING LOT - DAY

ACE emerges from the restaurant, smoking a cigarette as in 
the first scene in the film. He gets into his car to start 
the ignition.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          No matter what the Feds or the papers 
          might have said about my car 
          bombing...

Flames surge from the windshield, concealing ACE behind the 
wheel.

FLASHBACK: EXT. TONY ROMA'S RESTAURANT PARKING LOT - DAY

The sign above him reads: 'Tony Roma's a Place for Ribs'. 
ACE is leaving the restaurant and walking to his car.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          ...it was amateur night, and you 
          could tell. Whoever it was, they put 
          the dynamite under the passenger 
          side. But what they didn't know, 
          what nobody outside the factory knew, 
          was that that model car was made 
          with a metal plate under the driver's 
          seat. It's the only thing that saved 
          my life.

ACE opens his car door and gets in.

INT. ACE'S CAR, TONY ROMA'S RESTAURANT PARKING LOT - DAY

ACE turns on the ignition and we see two- and three-inch 
flames come out of the defroster vents. Everything goes silent 
as he is suddenly engulfed in flames.

The car explodes in flames two storeys high. The screen fills 
with the rising explosion of smoke and fire.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          The bombing was never authorized, 
          but I suspect I know who lit the 
          fuse.

EXT. MIDWEST CORNFIELD - DAY

NICKY, DOMINICK and MARINO get out of a car on a farm road 
for a meeting. FAT SALLY, a heavy-set wiseguy, is already 
there.

                      FAT SALLY (O.S.)
          Hey, Nicky.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          And so did the power that be.

                      NICKY
          Hey, Mikey, how's your hernia?

They shake hands.

                      FAT SALLY
          How you doin'?

MARINO approaches NICKY from behind.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          It took months for...

FLASHBACK: EXT. MIDWEST CORNFIELD - DAY

NICKY's car drives up the farm road to meet his crew.

                      NICKY: (V.O.)
          ...everything to calm down, but 
          finally my guys got out on bail and 
          the bosses wanted me to send my 
          brother Dominick out to Vegas.  Always 
          the dollars, always the fuckin'...

NICKY, DOMINICK and MARINO get out of the car to greet FAT 
SALLY. HARDY, FUSCO and BEEPER are also waiting there, 
smiling.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          ...dollars. I mean, it was still way 
          too hot for me to even go near Vegas, 
          so I set up a meeting with the guys 
          way out in the sticks. I didn't want 
          my brother to get fucked around.

NICKY shakes hands with SALLY. FUSCO walks up to say hello.

                      NICKY (V.O.)
          I mean, what's right is right. They 
          don't give a fuck about - urgghh!

MARINO hits NICKY in the back with a bat. FAT SALLY grabs 
him by the throat.

HARDY and BEEPER hold DOMINICK by the arms.

MARINO hits NICKY's legs with the bat.

                      FAT SALLY
          Huh? Come on, you fuckin' rat.

                      DOMINICK
          Fuck!  You...

FUSCO and FAT SALLY pin NICKY down and hold his face straight 
ahead, forcing him to watch his brother being beaten.

                      DOMINICK
               (To MARINO)
          ...rat motherfucker! You rat mother-

MARINO hits DOMINICK in the shoulder with the bat.

                      MARINO
          Tough guy! You and your f-
               (he strikes DOMINICK's 
               chest)
          Fuckin' brother!

                      DOMINICK
          Oh, you - !

NICKY tries to look away.

                      MARINO
          No more!

                      FAT SALLY
          Get him, Marino!

                      MARINO
               (Hitting DOMINICK 
               across the neck)
          You fuckin' scumbag!

The wiseguys hold NICKY's face so he has to see his brother.

                      MARINO
               (Lunging the bat into 
               DOMINICK's stomach)
          No more.

He swings the bat across his head, knocking DOMINICK on the 
ground.

                      NICKY
               (Still pinned, 
               screaming)
          Frankie!

                      MARINO
               (Looking at NICKY as 
               he strikes DOMINICK)
          No more! You see? Watch!

HARDY and BEEPER join MARINO. All three are beating DOMINICK 
with baseball bats.

                      NICKY
               (Held down by his 
               neck)
          Frankie! Frankie, you piece of shit!

                      MARINO
          Fuck you, you motherfuck!

The camera tilts down to DOMINICK's bloody face as the three 
continue to beat him to death.

                      NICKY
          Fuckin' punk, motherfucker! Piece of 
          shit!

NICKY tries to stand up but FAT SALLY and FUSCO keep him 
down.

                      MARINO
          No more fuckin' dirty work!

                      NICKY
               (Rolling over on his 
               back in pain)
          No, no, no, no!

                      MARINO
               (To HARDY and BEEPER)
          Take him out! Take this motherfucker 
          out!

They drag DOMINICK by his feet. MARINO swings at him with 
two bats as he's taken away into the cornfield.

EXT. MIDWEST CORNFIELD, GRAVE SITE - DAY, A LITTLE LATER

DOMINICK is battered and bloody. MARINO, HARDY and BEEPER 
stand over him, still swinging their bats.

NICKY is on his side, still held down by SALLY and FUSCO. 
His face is a little bloody.

                      NICKY
               (Whimpering, as they 
               beat DOMINICK)
          Dominick! Oh, Dominick. Oh, Dom.
          Frankie.
               (Pleading for his 
               brother's life.)
          Frankie, leave the kid alone. He's 
          still breathin'. He's still breathin'.  
          Leave him alone. Frankie.

MARINO swings two final blows to DOMINICK's head. NICKY looks 
away, sobbing.

                      MARINO
          All right. Strip him.

MARINO and his hoods remove DOMINICK's pants and shirt.

                      NICKY
               (Sobbing as they 
               undress his brother)
          No balls, you got no fuckin' balls. 
          Oh, Dominick. Oh, Dom.

NICKY sobs. They drag DOMINICK toward a freshly dug grave 
and toss his limp, barely conscious body into it.

                      NICKY
               (Crying quietly)
          Dominick.  Dominick.
               (Sobs.)
          Dominick.

NICKY looks up to MARINO. They share a look before MARINO 
swings his bat, striking NICKY's head.

FREEZE FRAME ON MARINO.

UNFREEZE - LIVE ACTION CONTINUES.

MARINO and his men start beating NICKY, who groans and spits 
blood as he is struck.

EXT. MIDWEST CORNFIELD, GRAVE SITE - DAY, A LITTLE LATER

NICKY is stripped down to his underwear. HARDY and FUSCO 
drag him to the grave and dump him over DOMINICK.

                      MARINO
          Come on, come on. Bury 'em.

MARINO and BEEPER look on as the other hoods begin the tedious 
work of tossing dirt on to the bodies, shovel by shovel, 
until they are covered up to their necks.

We see NICKY's face, bloodied and battered. He's still 
breathing and groaning.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          The word was out. The bosses had had 
          enough of Nicky. They had enough.  
          How much were they gonna take? So, 
          they made an example of him and his 
          brother. They buried them while they 
          were still breathing.

A full shovel of dirt lands upon NICKY's face and chest with 
a thud.

INT. ACE'S CAR, TONY ROMA'S RESTAURANT PARKING LOT - DUSK

ACE is engulfed in flames. His jacket catches fire. He opens 
the door and rolls out onto the pavement, barely escaping a 
smaller explosion. He lies on the floor as a ball of fire 
rises behind him. Two men pull him away from the car.

                      MAN #1
          Mister, you all right?

                      MAN #2
          Watch out, the -!

ACE watches as his car explodes in flames. Ashes and debris 
fall on ACE and the two men.

                      MAN #2
          Mister, you all right?

                      ACE
               (Dazed)
          Yeah.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          They had other ideas for me.

EXT. TONY ROMA'S RESTAURANT PARKING LOT - NIGHT

ACE is being wheeled to an ambulance on a stretcher. There 
are firemen and policemen in the background.

                      AMBULANCE DRIVER
               (As ACE is wheeled 
               into the rear of the 
               ambulance)
          You sure are lucky, mister.

ACE's face disappears into the ambulance.

EXT. ACE'S SAN DIEGO LUXURY HOME - DAY

TITLE IN: SAN DIEGO

A house very much like ACE's house in Vegas, including the 
fact that it backs up on a golf course. We see ACE inside 
talking on the phone with a bookie.

               (Into telephone)
          Still not sure?

INT. ACE'S SAN DIEGO LUXURY HOME - DAY

An older, grayer ACE is alone in his living-room with TV 
sets, fax machines and multiple phone lines. He is surrounded 
by newspapers and files. He is very much the way we saw him 
during his earlier handicapping days.

                      RACE ANNOUNCER
               (From a television 
               set)
          They're off and running...

                      ACE
               (Into telephone)
          Probable, but may be questionable. 
          All right. Well, let me know as soon 
          as you can find out.

ACE sets his cordless phone down and jots a few notes on a 
racing form. A television set shows a football game in the 
background.

                      ACE (V.O.)
          But in the end, I wound up right 
          back where I started. I could still 
          pick winners, and I could still make 
          money for all kinds of people back 
          home. And why mess up a good thing? 
          And that's that.

He takes off his glasses, and gazes ahead.

           BLACK AND WHITE FOOTAGE FROM 1978 

                         MUSIC UP:
          A simple GAME SHOW SET -- one long desk-that houses four
          "CELEBRITY PANELISTS," a small pulpit with attached microphone
          for the host, BUD COLLYER, who walks through the curtain to
          the delight of the audience. Bud bows and waves to the
          celebrities -- ORSON BEAN, KITTY CARLISLE, TOM POSTON, and
          PEGGY CASS.

                         BUD COLLYER
          Hello, panel, and welcome everyone
          to another exciting day on "To Tell
          The Truth." Let's get the show
          started.

          THE CURTAIN STARTS TO RISE
          BRIGHT LIGHTS SHINE on the faces of THREE MEN who walk toward
          center stage. All thre n wear identical AIRLINE PILOT
          UNIFORMS, each with m; c ng blue blazers and caps.
          (cont' d)
          Gentleman, please state
          your names.

                         PILOT #1
          My name is Frank Abagnale Jr.
          THE PILOT IN THE MIDDLE steps forward.

                         PILOT #2
          My name is Frank Abagnale Jr.
          THE THIRD PILOT does the same.

                         PILOT #3
          My name is Frank Abagnale Jr.
          Bud smiles, grabs a piece of paper.

                         BUD COLLYER
          Panel, listen to this one.
          (he starts to read)
          My name is Frank Abagnale Jr, and
          some people consider me the worlds
          greatest imposter.

          PILOTS.
          BUD COLLYER (cont'd)

                         (READING)
          From 1964 to 1966 I successfully
          impersonated an airline pilot for
          Pan Am Airlines, and flew over two
          million miles for free. During that
          time I was also the Chief Resident
          Pediatrician at a Georgia hospital,
          the Assistant Attorney General for
          the state of Louisiana, and a
          Professor of American History at a
          prestigious University in France. By
          the time I was caught and sentenced
          to prison, I had cashed over six
          million dollars in fraudulent checks

          Imposter number one, how many years
          were you in prison?

           A heavy rain falls on JOE SHAPE, 40's, who wears a black hat
          and holds a black umbrella as he bangs on the window of a
          small GUARDHOUSE in front of a LARGE GATED PRISON. Joe is
          sneezing as he holds up an IDENTIFICATION CARD TO THE GUARD.

          Joe is walking down a long corridor inside the prison,
          struggling to close his umbrella as he faces WARDEN GARREN
          and TWO GUARDS.

                         JOE SHAPE

          Joe takes a roll of CASH out of h` ocket, casually slips
          the money to the Warden.

                         JOE SHAPE
          If I give you another twenty, will
          you turn up the heat in here?

          Warden Garren is leading Joe down a small, isolated corridor
          just off the main floor. They pass CEMENT DOORS with metal
          SLIDE HOLES and numbers taped to the front. There are no
          bars or windows in this area, and complete silence. Garren
          stops at the last cell and opens the SLIDE HOLE.

                         WARDEN GARREN
          Don't pass him anything through the

          WE SEE FRANK ABAGNALE JR., his face partially hidden in the
          dim cell, which gets its only light from a hanging bulb.
          Frank is lying on the cement floor, his back up against the
          far wall. He wears only a pair of underwear and clutches a
          torn blanket.

                         JOE SHAYE
          Jesus, Frank, you look terrible. I
          heard about French prisons, but this
          is positively barbaric.

          Why do you think I've been fighting
          to have you extradited. Why do you
          think I came to take you home? Do
          you know that 21 other countries
          want'you in their prisons? I saw the
          list -- Egypt was on there. Who the

          plane, clean you up, and put you in

          THE CELL DOOR IS THROWN OPEN
          Frank is being dragged across the floor by Warden Garren and
          a second GUARD, each holding an arm as they drag Frank's
          emaciated six-foot frame through the halls. Joe Shaye jogs
          behind the guards.

          lifted onto one of the beds, his legs and arms flailing out
          to the sides, kicking a thin curtain out from the wall.

                         JOE SHAYE
          What's happening to him?
          Garren and the Guard quickly move toward a sink, where they
          start to wash their hands.

          the curtain, pushes it open.

          drawing his gun and sprinting out the open door of the
          infirmary, yelling in French for the Guard to follow. Joe

          trips and falls, his body too weak to run as he starts to
          crawl across the prison floor.
          Joe and Garren easily catch up to him, Garren quickly kneeling
          down and holding his gun against Frank's head --cocking the
          weapon. Frank stops crawling, rolls over on his back and
          smiles up at Joe Shaye.

          The New Rochelle Rotary Club has a
          history that goes back to 1859. In
          all those years, we have only inducted
          a handful of deserving men as lifetime
          members, an honor that has seen 187
          names enshrined on the wall of honor.

          to borrow a suit for a couple of
          hours.

          I'm sorry. We don't loan suits, and
          we're not open.
          As she closes the door, Frank Sr. takes a small GOLD NECKLACE
          OUT OF HIS POCKET, holds it up to the glass.

          Your son held a teacher-parent
          conference yesterday. He was planning
          a class field trip to a French bread
          factory in Trenton. Do you see the
          problem we have?
          Frank Sr. and Paula seem a bit confused.

                         PAULA
          This is our fault, Principal Evans.
          Frank had been at Buckley since he
          was a little boy. We had to take him
          out for personal reasons, away from
          his friends -- you know how kids
          are. He's all alone here.

          FRANK SR.
          He's not alone. He has us.

          27 EXT. - PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE. - SAME TIME 27

           Frank is sitting outsid' he Principal's office wearing his
           coat and tie, waiting oI his parents to come out. He watches
           as a FOOTBALL PLAYER hands- SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR a note.

           FO IL PLAYER

          Thank you, Roger.
          As the Football player walks off, Frank leans over to look
          at the note. The Administrator catches him looking.

                         FRANK
          It's a fake.

                         SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR
          Excuse me?

                         FRANK
          There's no crease in the paper.

          When your mom hands you a note to
          miss school, you put it in your
          pocket. And if it was in his pocket,
          where's the crease?

          Sir, we have no choice but to suspend
          Frank for one week, and transfer him
          out of French and into German.

          FRANK SR.

                         JOANNA
          Are you that transfer from Buckley?
          Frank looks a bit confused as he stares at the girls.

          dance? All the other guys are afraid
          to try.

                         FRANK
          I'm only sixteen. How could I buy

          you're old enough to buy beer.

          Frank walks in from school, throws his books on n-a chair and
          opens the refrigerator. The radio is on and there's a bottle
          of wine on the counter.

          President -- who wears a tailored ck suit. Paula wears a
          dress and holds a tray of food.

          That's all there is, two bedrooms,
          but we're getting used to it. Frankie,
          you remember Dad's friend Jack Wright
          from the club, he came by looking
          for your father -- I was giving him
          a tour of the apartment.

          Frank walks to the couch, picks up a small ROTARY PIN that

          Thank you, Frank. That's the
          President's pin. I'd be in big trouble

          Frank, the court apologizes for
          pulling you out of school this
          morning. Are you aware of the fact
          that your parents have filed for
          divorce?

          Again, I apologize. This is a custody
          hearing to determine who you are
          going to live with after the divorce.
          Your mother and father are leaving
          this decision up to you. For the
          record, I would like to praise both
          parents for showing such confidence
          in their son, who they believe will
          make the best decision for himself
          and his family.
          Frank stares straight ahead, his breathing forced as he stares
          at Judge Larkin.
          JUDGE LARKIN (cont'd)
          Okay, Frank, I'm going to ask you a
          difficult question. Who's it going
          to be, your mother or your father?
          Frank looks to his father, then turns and stares at his mother

          floating up-side-down in a pool of bubbles.

           MARCI, a cute 27-year-old EASTERN STEWARDESS with short blonde
          hair and glasses, stands at the front of the plane smiling
          at Frank -- who holds out his pink boarding slip.

                         MARCI
          Are you my dead-head?

          70 INT. - COCKPIT. - 707. - DAY 70

          Frank is led into the cockpit by Marci, trying not to react
          to the intensity of the tiny space. He immediately looks
          around for the jump-seat -- or any seat -- but sees nothing.

                         MARCI
          Frank, this is Captain Oliver. That's
          John Paxton, the Co-Pilot, this is
          Ron Vega, flight engineer.

          Go ahead and take a seat, Frank,
          we're about to push.
          Frank continues to search for the JUMP SEAT, the panic
          starting to show on his face as Marci reaches her hand around
          to the back of the cockpit door and pulls down the small

          Frank quickly sits in the jump-seat, his hands shaking as he
          tries to strap himself in.

          Frank is staring out the cockpit window in disbelief, the
          way all kids do the first time they ride in a plane.

          73 INT. - EASTERN 707. - LATER IN FLIGHT 73

          Frank walks through the COCKPIT DOOR, sees Marci preparing

           Frank is lying on top of Marci -- losing his virginity --
          not moving -- just staring down at her with a bizarre look
          on his face. The lights are low, the radio is on.

          Demoted is the wrong word. It was

          No. I've never worked in the field

          for a match. Joe is alone in the fingerprint lab, where a
          pathetic looking Christmas tree sits in the corner of the
          room. The phone rings, and Joe quickly answers.

          I've been trying to track you down
          for a couple of hours. Did you know
          that most people in the FBI have no
          idea who you are or what you do?

          Joe, do you always work on Christmas
          Eve?
          Joe looks around the room before he answers.

                         JOE SHAYE
          I volunteered, so that men with
          families could go home early.

                         FRANK
          You were wearing a wedding ring in
          L.A.. I thought maybe you had a
          family?

          face to face.

                         FRANK
          Okay. I'm at the Waldorf Astoria in
          Manhattan. Suite 3113.
          Joe starts to write this down, then suddenly stops himself.

                         JOE SHAYE
          You think you're gonna get me again,
          don't you? You'd love for me to send
          twenty agents out on Christmas Eve
          to barge into that hotel, break down
          doors so you can make a fool out of
          me again?

          Joe, I'm sorry if I made a fool out

                         JOE SHAYE
          Then tell me something. How did you
          know I wouldn't look in the wallet?

                         FRANK
          The same reason the Yankees always
          win. Nobody can keep their eyes off
          the pinstripes.

                         JOE SHAYE
          The Yankees win because they have
          Mickey Mantle.

                         FRANK
          I have to go. I'm catching a flight
          in two hours. Merry Christmas, Joe.

          It doesn't make any sense. A thirty-

          Maybe there's a reason he didn't

          It's just a hobby. Every Sunday night
          I go into the garage, pretend I'm an
          artist. Sometimes I stay in there
          for hours, hiding from the world,
          making a fool out of myself.

          Before I went to medical school I

          regulars, all watching TV. Frank walks up to his Dad and
          sets a DIME in front of him.

                         FRANK
          How about a little music, Dad?

          FRANK SR.
          I took a job. A government job. You

          good lawyer?

                         FRANK
          Dad, I am a lawyer.

          FRANK SR.
          Look at this letter.
          (handing Frank a letter)
          They kicked me out. They took away
          my membership at the Rotary Club.
          They accused me of terrible things,
          made up a list of lies just to keep
          me out. I'm gonna sue them, a lifetime
          membership is what I have. I have
          the plaque, the letters of
          congratulations.

          above the toilet. The screws come free, and Frank is able to
          pull the entire TOILET UNIT away from the wall. He makes

          There's no perforated edge, which
          means this check was hand cut, not
          fed. The paper is double bonded,

          That's not possible.
          Frank opens the drapes and looks out at a POLICE STATION
          that sits across the street from his apartment.

                         FRANK
          One of the men gave me a check today.

          JOE SHAYE (cont'd)
          Did you know I was recruited by the
          FBI while I was still in law school?
          The government said I was the best
          the country had to offer, top of my
          class -- and they chased me until I
          said yes.

                         FRANK
          I'm sorry, Joe.

                         JOE SHAYE
          I spent four years arranging your
          release. I convinced the Attorney

          Why did you do it?

                         JOE SHAYE
          You're just a kid.

          the camera pans across this local tourist attraction.
          Cut to SINCLAIR STEVENS, the handsome but intense
          20-year-old theater manager as he adjusts the final
          letter of the film's title on the marquee, perched atop
          a ladder. SINCLAIR is dressed in an obviously rented
          tuxedo and for a moment seems like any other middle
          class suburban kid.

          ROY STILLINGS, the tuxedoed fifty-year-old theater
          owner, shouts instructions from below as CATERERS,
          DECORATORS and PUBLICITY PEOPLE rush in an out of
          theater preparing for tonight's event. He is
          surrounded by several of his young staff - DINAH, the
          sourpussed but unconventionally striking cashier;
          CHARDONNAY, the African-American ticket-taker with a
          huge 90's hairdo so popular with the black girls in
          Baltimore; RAVEN, the happy and always smiling pretty
          usherette, and FIDGET, the dweebish but somehow sexy
          janitor. All have made an attempt to dress up their
          usual uniforms for the premiere.

                        MR. STILLINGS
          A little more to the right,
          Sinclair.

                         SINCLAIR
          (Moving the final "S"

                         IN "HAPPINESS")
          That better, Mr. Stillings?
          Title on marquee fades out and "Produced by..." credit
          fades in.

                        MR. STILLINGS

                         (SQUINTING)
          Yeah, that's good.

                         (STILL UNSATISFIED)
          But try moving the "K" in "Whitlock."
          A little to the left.

                         SINCLAIR
          (Following his boss's instructions,
          the "Some Kind Of Happiness" title
          back on the marquee)
          Have you met her yet?

                        MR. STILLINGS
          Not yet. But don't worry,
          Sinclair, I'll introduce you!

                         SINCLAIR
          You promise?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          SINCLAIR smiles sneakily to himself as "Some Kind Of
          Happiness" logo fades out on marquee and "Written and
          Directed by John Waters" credit fades in.

                         SINCLAIR

          I'm a bg fan!

          HONEY WHITLOCK turns from beautiful Inner Harbor view
          outside hotel window and we see she is about forty
          years old and a complete knockout.

                         HONEY
          Ah, what a town!
          HONEY is dressed for the premiere in an elegant evening
          gown and her black hair is cut perfectly in the Louise
          Brooks style that has become her signature. She
          continues her press conference under the watchful eyes
          of her press agent CHARLES and her long-time assistant
          LIBBY, both of whom are also dressed for the premiere.
          ROOM SERVICE employees stand by, ready to serve.

                         HONEY
          I tell everybody in Hollywood,
          when you shoot on location in
          Baltimore, you don't need to
          bring all the crew from Los
          Angeles. Baltimore really ia the
          best!...

          MR. STILLINGS lectures his other staff members as
          CATERERS and BARTENDERS set up behind him. SINCLAIR
          STEVENS is paying close attention as is LYLE, the
          projectionist, a handsome but surprisingly gaunt young
          man. CHERISH, a sexy and slightly nasty candy-counter
          girl leers at SINCLAIR who flirts back as she feigns
          interest in MR. STILLINGS' pep talk. PAM the popcorn
          girl, a masculine but beautiful nineteen year old with a
          seemingly bad attitude and LEWIS, the young cool
          African-American usher with a chip on his shoulder join
          FIDGET, RAVEN and DINAH.

                      MR. STILLINGS
          and remember, Miss Whitlock
          is every inch a movie star and
          expects to be on stage at exactly
          7:10pm to ensure live coverage
          from all three local news shows.
          By the way, I hear she's really
          a nice person...

          6. INTERIOR HONEY'S HOTEL ROOM. 6.
          HONEY's mean face glares out window at the twinkling
          lights of Baltimore's Inner Harbor in the early
          evening.

                         HONEY
          Look at this dump of a town!
          HONEY turns to her long suffering assistant, LIBBY.
          The press is gone and they are alone.

                         HONEY
          Get me the fuck back to L.A. If
          one more asshole mentions a crab
          cake to me, I think I'll puke.

                         LIBBY
          (Trying to be positive)
          Did you try the steamed crabs?
          They're red and...

                         HONEY
          No I didn't! I'm not interested
          in any kind of meal you have to
          beat with a mallet...
          A knock is heard at hotel door.

                         HONEY

                         (SUDDENLY NICE)
          Just a minute...
          (Muttering to herself as
          LIBBY goes to answer door)
          .wearing some stupid kind of bib
          while families of mutants gawk in
          my face ...No thank you!
          CHARLES, the press agent enters.

                         CHARLES
          Your limousine is here, Miss
          Whitlock. You look beautiful.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         HONEY
          (Back to being gracious)
          Thank you Charles, darling. We'll
          be right with you. I'm excited.
          CHARLES exits.

                         HONEY
          (Back to her nasty self)
          Do you think Pat Nixon got
          fucked in this hotel room?

                         LIBBY

                         (STUPEFIED)
          Well ...I don't know...I mean...

                         HONEY
          It's called the "Presidential
          Suite" isn't it?

                         LIBBY
          Yes...but...

                         HONEY
          I BET SHE DID! Call the
          manager and ask him!

                         (HORRIFIED)
          I can't ask that. . .Pat Nixon
          was a stroke victim...

                         HONEY
          It's your ï¿½ to ask, Libby!
          Call downstairs and find out
          if Pat Nixon got fucked in my
          hotel room! I want to know!

          Large crowd of fans and gawkers let out a roar of
          approval as the klieg lights are switched on by WORKMAN
          and the night sky is lit up by the criss-crossing beams
          of light.

          8. INTERIOR HALLWAY OF HARBOR COURT HOTEL. 8.
          HONEY WHITLOCK, looking incredibly glamorous, is being
          led downstairs by CHARLES, the press agent and RODNEY,
          a young biker-type bodyguard assigned to her for the
          night by the theater. He wears an ill-fitting polyester
          suit and an earphone. LIBBY hurries to catch up with
          them.

          The hotel manager said "No."
          Pat Nixon never stayed here,
          but Nancy Reagen did in 1986...

                         HONEY

                         (AMAZED)
          You didn't actually ask him?

                         (CONFUSED)
          You said to call downstairs...

                         (APPALLED)
          You asked the hotel manager if
          Pat Nixon had sex in my room?

                         LIBBY
          Well. . .sort of. I mean you
          told me...

                         HONEY
          I was kidding Libby. He must
          think you're a complete lunatic!
          Good God, you'd do anything!
          A HOTEL MAID pushing a cart of towels and bathroom
          supplies comes around a corner and is completely
          star-struck.

                         MAID
          Good luck, Miss Whitlock!
          HONEY's face freezes in horror as elevator doors
          open and she is led inside.

          Several well-dressed hotel guests recognize HONEY

          (In a sudden tirade)
          Did you hear what that little
          bitch said to me?

                         LIBBY
          She didn't know.

                         HONEY
          In show business we say "break a
          leg." NEVER fucking "Good Luck"!

          burst of flashbulbs.

                         HONEY
          Mayor Fenwick!
          LIBBY and CHARLES look to one another relieved as
          HOTEL GUESTS stumble out of elevator, shaking their
          heads in disgust.

                         MAYOR
          Miss Whitlock, what an honor!
          They pose together as PRESS snaps away.

                         CECIL

                         (TO GANG)

          POWER TO THE PEOPLE WHO

          PUNISH BAD CINEMA!
          PETIE peels out in limo as PREMIERE GUESTS and FANS
          dive out of the way and GANG chants "Battle of
          Algiers"-type revolutionary yell.
          CECIL fires his gun out back window and shatters the
          "Some Kind Of Happiness" logo on marquee.

          45. INTERIOR SPEEDING LIMO. 45.
          CHERISH lunges for CECIL and they french kiss hotly.
          From PETIE's POV behind the wheel we see COP CAR #1
          with sirens wailing and lights flashing heading
          towards premiere.
          In rear view mirror, PETIE sees three other COP CARS
          speeding up to Senator Theater and screeching to a
          stop.

          46. EXTERIOR YORK ROAD. NORTH OF SENATOR THEATER. 46.
          COP CAR #1 screeches into a U-turn and COP in
           passenger side fires his gun at CECIL's limo.

          47. INTERIOR SPEEDING WHITE LIMO. 46.

          Back window is blasted out by COP's bullet.

                         CECIL
          I fuckin' hate car chase scenes!

                         PETIE
          (Flooring the accelerator,

                         PISSED)
          Yeah, but "Bullit" was good!
          LYLE snorts cocaine off a coke-spoon and nonchalantly
          picks glass out of his hair.

                         LYLE
          But it lead to the "French
          Connection."

                         (VICIOUSLY)
          Which inspired a sequel!

                         LEWIS
          And lead to "Smokey and The
          Bandit" and that kinda shit!
          PETIE sees another cop car speeding up behind him in
          the rear view mirror.
          DINAH leans out limo window and fires gun back'at
          cop car.

                         PAM

                         (FURIOUS)
          "Smokey and The Bandit"
          even had fuckin' sequels...
          Another cop car speeds towards them from the front
          trying to cut them off.

                         PETIE
          (Insane, driving like a lunatic)
          Yeah, Part fucking Two, 1980!...

                         (PSYCHOTICALLY)
          "Smokey and The Bandit"
          ruined my childhood!
          CECIL fires his gun in the nick of time and shatters
          approaching cop car's windshield.

          PETIE makes a hard right and zooms up church driveway
          as two cop cars collide behind him.
          FIDGET cheers like a kid and starts absentmindedly
          playing pocket pool.

          48. EXTERIOR CHURCH ROAD. 48.
          Another cop car is speeding to premiere from behind
          the church and almost hits the limo as PETIE veers
          right in the "V" in the road, narrowly missing a
          MINISTER and a suspiciously SENSITIVE TEEN as they
          leave the church rectory.

                         CHERISH
          (Yelling out window)
          Long live pornography!

          49. EXTERIOR ONE-WAY STREET. 49.
          PETIE speeds limo the wrong way past one-way sign
          into path of oncoming speeding cop car.
          In the nick of time, PETIE turns a hard left
          skidding around corner onto bumpy cemetery road behind
          church.
          Cop car swerves right to avoid collision and careens
          into CABLE TV installation truck.
          COP jumps out of car and starts firing at limo.

          50. INTERIOR SPEEDING LIMO. 50.
          CHARDONNAY puts tape into limo cassette player and
          the entire GANG starts singing along with original
          gangsta rap song entitled "SHE'S A BANKABLE BITCH (and
          we don't need no pitch)."

          51. EXTERIOR CEMETERY ROAD. 51.
          COP fires again and hits limo trunk lock.
          Trunk door flies open and HONEY screams her lungs out,
          holding on for dear life.
          HEAVY METAL KIDS, hanging out in graveyard look up and
          see RAVEN yelling out car window with HONEY in trunk.

                         RAVEN
          (Imitating "The Exorcist")
          Your mother sucks cocks in hell!
          HEAVY METAL KIDS look at each other in horror and run

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         - 22 -
          away in fear.
          Limo bumps down road at high speed and trunk door
          bangs shut, knocking HONEY into submission.
          Limo makes a fast right.

          52 SUBURBAN INTERSECTION. 52
          Traffic is stopped in both lanes for a red light.
          PETIE screeches to a sudden stop. HE checks rear-view
          mirror and realizes they have escaped their POLICE
          pursuers.

                         PETIE

                         (TO GANG)
          We did it.
          PETIE grabs RODNEY from back seat and gives him a
          big kiss.
          A SUBURBAN LADY pulls up in her car next to limo
          on right.

                         SUBURBAN LADY
          Sinclair, is that you?
          PETIE turns down radio and GANG freezes.

                         CECIL
          (Suddenly turning into
          his old self)
          Hi, Mrs. Waltrup.

                         SUBURBAN LADY
          Did you win the lottery?

                         CECIL

                         (POLITELY)
          No, ma'am, we were at a
          movie premiere.

                         SUBURBAN LADY
          I don't go to the movies
          much, I wait for the video.

                         CECIL
          Not me, I like the big screen.

                         SUBURBAN LADY
          Say hello to your mom and
          dad for me.

                         CECIL
          I sure will.
          SUBURBAN LADY makes right on red and pulls off.

                         CECIL
          (Smugly, to GANG)
          Casting has been completed!
          PETIE peels out in other direction.
          53. Cut to EXTERIOR "SPROCKET HOUSE," a run-down, 53.
          seemingly abandoned warehouse in an industrial part
          of t:he city. The moon is full and the quiet is
          interrupted by faint sirens in the distance.
          Suddenly, like a low-rent Bat Cave, the large
          industrial garage doors swing open and the white
          limo speeds inside.
          54. Dissolve to INTERIOR SPROCKET HOUSE. HONEY's 54.
          "dressing room"; a bizarrely decorated prison cell
          fit for a movie queen.
          HONEY is blindfolded, gagged and tied to a director's
          chair with her name printed on the back, still
          wearing her torn and soiled premiere gown.
          LEWIS, now dressed in terrorist punk outfit removes
          HONEY's blindfold and gag as she sputters in terror.
          We see LEWIS has D-A-V-I-D L-Y-N-C-H tattooed on his
          fingers.
          HONEY's e yes light up in terror as she sees CECIL, now
          attired in insane grunge Cecil B. DeMille inspired
          outfit being lowered by PETIE on jerry-rigged film
          crane. "Otto Preminger" is tattooed on CECIL's bicep.

                         CECIL
          .Hello, I'm Cecil B. DeMented
          and I'm your new director...
          HONEY stares in confused horror.

                         CECIL
          I'd like you to meet your
          co-stars ...I call them the
          "Sprocket Holes."
          HONEY looks over in fear as the SPROCKET HOLES, now
          changed from their theater uniforms into their own
          scary "terrorist chic" fashions, gather around CECIL in a
          "crew-shot from hell" pose.

                         CECIL
          This is Cherish...
          CHERISH, now heavily made-up and dressed "riot-girl"
          style, in a "SINEMA" T-shirt, steps forward. We see
          "Andy Warhol" tattooed on her thigh.

                         CHERISH
          Hi, I played you in lots of
          porno movies. "Some Kind Of
          Happiness"? I've already shot
          it - only it's called "Some
          Kind Of Horniness."

                         (PROUDLY)
          But that's all behind me. I'm
          an outlaw cinema girl now.

                         CECIL
          Lyle?
          LYLE takes a big huff of glue in plastic bag and
          steps forward. He is dressed in scarily in 1970's
          junky wear meets 90's Hollywood sleaze, and sports a
          "Herschell Gordon Lewis" tattoo across his skinny chest.

                         LYLE
          Hi, I'm Lyle and I'm your
          leading man. I've had a
          boner for you for years.
          HONEY pales.

                         CECIL
          (Getting off crane and
          stepping towards HONEY)
          Don't worry, we've all taken a
          vow of celibacy for celluloid.
          No one gets laid until we've
          finished our movie. We're horny...
          CHERISH starts writhing sexily.

                         CECIL
          .but our film comes first.
          CECIL gently shoves her away as SPROCKET HOLES
          undulate in sexual frustration.

                         CECIL
          .And now for the crew.
          PAM the popcorn girl swaggers over carrying a beat-up
          vintage 16mm movie camera and aims it at HONEY's face.
          She is wearing a black para-military jump suit and we

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         - 25 -
          see her "Sam Peckinpah" tattoo on her arm.

                         PAM
          I'm Pam, the director of
          photography and you'd better
          hit your mark!
          CHARDONNAY, now done up in outrageous homegirl
          gangster look, carries an old wrecked Nagra sound
          recorder and spins her microphone boom pole like
          lethal numchucks before raising it over HONEY's
          head, revealing the "Spike Lee" tattoo on her stomach.

                         CHARDONNAY
          .and remember - SPEAK UP, BITCH!
          I'm Chardonnay and I do the sound.
          LEWIS proudly steps forward, menacingly holding
          staple gun like a weapon.

                         LEWIS
          We met. I'm Lewis, the art
          director. I hope you'll be
          comfortable here...
          HONEY looks around cell and sees giant stills blown up
          from her past films showing her in physical and
          emotional distress.

                         LEWIS

                         (MOVING CLOSER)
          .'cause you ain't goin'
          nowhere else!
          HE staples her gown to the chair.
          FIDGET, the grunge dweeb, dressed in complete rags but
          looking somehow great with his "William Castle" tattoo,
          shyly steps forward, absentmindedly playing "pocket
          pool."

                         FIDGET

                         (BASHFUL)
          I'm Fidget, the costumer...
          (Suddenly rips dress to give
          her a plunging neckline)
          Sorry.. .but I'm gonna have to
          give you a new look...
          RAVEN, smiling beatifically, steps forward dressed
          in a satanic robe, an inverted cross necklace,
          pentagram jewelry and a "Kenneth Anger" tattoo.

                         RAVEN
          Hi, I'm Raven and I'm a Satanist.
          I'll be doing your makeup...
          HONEY stares back in confusion.

                         RAVEN
          You look so pale...
          RAVEN suddenly slaps HONEY across face and HONEY
          cries out in shock.

                         RAVEN
          Sorry... but Satan says...
          you need color!
          RODNEY, the biker "bodyguard," now in S&M leather
          get-up steps toward HONEY carrying a rat-tail comb
          and a hair dye applicator bottle. His "Almodovar"
          tattoo is a beauty.

                         RODNEY
          Call me Rodney. Tomorrow
          I'm bleaching your hair out
          platinum and I should warn
          you...I FUCKING HATE ROOTS!
          PETIE, the sexy hillbilly "chauffeur," now dressed
          in redneck militant garb and featuring a "Fassbinder"
          tattoo, steps forward.

                         PETIE
          Hey, I'm Petie, remember me,
          "the trailer trash"? I'll be
          your driver. I'll take you
          anywhere... anywhere but home!!
          (Laughs evilly as he

                         CARESSES RODNEY)
          From behind a curtain, covering a room of lab and
          editing equipment comes DINAH, now dressed in
          alarming vintage fashion outfit that shows off her
          shapely but purposely hairy legs. "Sam Fuller" is
          tattooed on her back. She wheels a TV set and VCR
          mounted on wheels framed by little velvet curtain.

                         DINAH
          (Snarling to HONEY)
          I'm Dinah, Cecil's prodÂ»cer
          and I do everything! I've
          been knocking down box office
          money from every big Hollywood

          We made the news...
          CECIL nods to DINAH to turn on the VCR to show clip
          taped from TV.

                         NEWSMAN
          . So once again, our top story.
          Sylvia Mallory, the fifty-two
          year old chairwoman of the
          Maryland Heart Fund died tonight
          at Union Memorial Hospital
          following an on stage heart
          attack she suffered in the middle
          of Honey Whitlock's kidnapping at
          tonight's Baltimore movie
          premiere...
          SPROCKET HOLES stare in amazement at TV screen, the
          enormity of their act barely sinking in.

                         NEWSMAN
          .the teenage gang of cinema
          terrorists who apparently
          infiltrated the staff of the
          Senator Theater are now eligible
          for the death penalty in the
          State of Maryland...
          CECIL nods to DINAH to turn it off, which she does.
          SPROCKET HOLES gulp and look to their leader for
          guidance.
          CECIL steps forward, getting right in HONEY's
          terrified face.

                         CECIL
          Miss Whitlock, we're going to
          make our first film and NOBODY'S
          going to stop us. Lots of kids
          dream of making a movie...
          SPROCKET HOLES smile in brain-washed enthusiasm.

                         CECIL
          .but only the ones willing
          to dia for it succeed.
          HONEY looks into CECIL's face and lets out a sob of
          terror.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                          - 28 -

           FADE OUT.
          55. Fade in to EXTERIOR "SPROCKET HOUSE." Next morning. 55.
           We hear HONEY letting out a fresh cry of agony.

          56. INTERIOR "SPROCKET HOUSE" - "HAIR AND MAKEUP," 56.
          a dilapidated section of the loft filled with broken
          mirrors, beat up barber chairs, filthy hair driers
          and mangy beauty supplies.
          HONEY, tied to a barber chair, still dressed in her
          raggedy premiere gown, moans in pain as RODNEY, in
          scary rubber fetish outfit, sadistically
          applies the final batch of double strength bleach to
          HONEY's already shockingly blond hair.
          RAVEN, wearing another "witchy" black robe and 666
          earrings, finishes up HONEY's overly-theatrical
          makeup job.

                         HONEY

                         (TO RODNEY)
          Owwww! Please! I don't
          want to be blond!

                         RODNEY
          You're going right off the deep
          end of the Clairol color chart!
          RODNEY squirts on more dye.

                         HONEY
          It's burning my scalp!
          Ow! Ow! Ow!

                         RODNEY
          Beauty comes from agony! Everyone
          knows that!

                         RAVEN
          I haven't had this much fun since
          my last livestock mutilation...
          RAVEN lunges towards HONEY's eyebrows and painfully
          tweezes out a hair.

                         HONEY
          Oh God! That really hurt!

                         (GIGGLING)
          Allistair Crowley said that.

                         RODNEY
          Let's wash it out!
          RODNEY yanks HONEY's head back as RAVEN pours
          scalding water over her head.

                         HONEY
          (Screams in pain,

                         SPUTTERING)
          Oh God, please!

                         (PLEADING)
          Let me go! I won't tell
          anybody about your little movie.
          Suddenly CECIL enters dressed to the nines in another
          lunatic "movie director" outfit. He is accompanied by
          DINAH, who is even more severely dressed in thrift-shop
          couture, carrying a clip board and a stop watch.

                         CECIL

                         HONEY
          (Horrified to see him)
          .I mean... not little. . .10w
          budget. . .you know, cult.

                         CECIL
          Good morning, Miss Whitlock.
          Know your lines?

                         HONEY
          Please...Mr. DeMento? Is that
          correct?

                         CECIL

                         (TESTILY)
          DeMenTED!

                         HONEY
          You have the wrong star for
          this film...

                         CECIL
          Nonsense, Miss Whitlock...

                         (THREATENINGLY)
          I wrote the part just for you...

          outside, and smiling)
          .and the whole world is watching...

                         SIREN OUTSIDE)
          Even your agent can't help you now!

          57. INTERIOR SPROCKET HOUSE - "WARDROBE." A cluttered 57.
          work area with piles of stolen clothes spread out in
          disarray. Insane fashion sketches of HONEY throwing
          bombs, firing guns, dressed in terrorist-inspired haute
          couture are tacked to the wall.
          FIDGET is vainly trying to rip off security device still
          attached to fake leopard military jacket. First he
          tries pulling it off with his teeth, then hits it with a
          hammer to no avail.

                         FIDGET

          I HATE THESE FUCKING THINGS!
          CECIL enters with HONEY as RODNEY and RAVEN follow,
          continuing torturing HONEY by blow-drying her hair
          with malfunctioning, smoking hair dryer and curling her
          eyelashes with rusty curlers.

                         CECIL
          Ah Fidget. Fidget, my little
          genius, :Fidget!

                         FIDGET
          (Not missing a beat,

                         TO HONEY)

          PAM is changing the film in her changing bag between her
          legs. She hears FIDGET and looks up excitedly.
          CHARDONNAY takes off her earphones and nods to LEWIS who
          is finishing up painting a van to look like a FEDEX
          delivery truck. All quickly exit.

          59. INTERIOR SPROCKET HOUSE - "WARDROBE"
          RODNEY, RAVEN, and FIDGET leer at HONEY who looks to
          CECIL in horror when she realizes there will be no
          privacy.

          Do I have a trailer? ...I mean,
          is there a dressing room...?
          DINAH leans over set wall from above and watches
          with open lesbian lust.

                         CECIL

                         (IMPATIENTLY)
          Miss Whitlock, we're an a schedule...

          LEWIS, CHARDONNAY, and PAM run to peepholes cut in
          "Wardrobe" walls and watch HONEY voyeuristically from
          the other side.

          61. INTERIOR SPROCKET HOUSE - "WARDROBE"
          HONEY sees eyeballs staring through peepholes and
          looks to CECIL in sexual fear.

          (To HONEY, ever the

                         LEADER)
          Don't worry, they're not
          allowed any form of sexual release.:.
          HONEY nervously starts to unzip her gown.
          SPROCKET HOLES let out an involuntary sexual moan.

                         HONEY
          (Muttering, furious)
          The Screen Actors Guild will
          hear about this and I mean it!
          HONEY lets gown fall to floor and steps out of it.
          She is wearing beautiful lingerie.

                         FIDGET

          DAMN!

                         RAVEN

          pocket, subtly)

          RODNEY moans in sexual frustration as HONEY begins
          getting dressed in FIDGET's costume.
          DINAH pants from above as HONEY slips on tight
          pants.
          LEWIS, CHARDONNAY, and PAM watch from peepholes,
          breathing hard and moaning as HONEY slips into jacket.
          PETIE appears and jealously catches RODNEY trying to
          peek down the front of HONEY's jacket. RODNEY looks
          away guiltily.
          FIDGET whacks and "creates," lewdly "styling" HONEY's
          outfit. He then wheels full-length mirror to HONEY and
          signals to CECIL she is ready.
          HONEY sees her transformation into terrorist glamour
          girl for the first time.

                         HONEY
          Oh, God, I look terrible!
          (Breaks into sobs)
          CECIL and SPROCKET HOLES applaud triumphantly.

                         DINAH

          Alright, LET'S LOCK IT UP!

          CECIL leads HONEY to set, past equipment and lights as
          SPROCKET HOLES scurry to position, adjusting lights,
          setting up camera, readying props.

                         CECIL

                         (TO HONEY)
          This is Sprocket House,
          Miss Whitlock, think of it
          as your studio.
          They arrive at the amazingly inventive exterior set of
          "RITZ CINEMA," a tiny guilded movie palace gone to seed.
          Marquee reads: PASOLINI FESTIVAL.
          HONEY stares dumbfounded.

                         CECIL
          Can't you say good morning to
          Lewis? He worked hard on this
          set with a budget of zero.

          DINAH quickly hands CECIL a stun-gun.

                         CECIL
          You dare to tell Cecil B.

          CECIL zaps her painfully with the stun gun.
          HONEY twitches in agony and lets out a painful
          scream.

                         CECIL
          There are no creative differences on
          a Cecil B. DeMented set, Miss Whitlock.
          Got that? One day you'll thank me for
          saving you from your bad career.

          PLACES!

                         (TO HONEY)
          Alright, walk-through rehearsal.
          DINAH slams the open, hand-written, fetishistically-
          covered script into HONEY's hands.
          CHERISH takes her place in cashier's booth as DINAH
          drags HONEY inside theater door with LYLE to wait
          for her cue.
          LYLE takes out vial of drugs.

          HONEY shakes her head negatively in helpless horror.
          LYLE shrugs his shoulders and happily pops the pill
          into his mouth.

                         CECIL
          .and ACTION!
          CECIL moves around stage, making cliche director's
          frame with his hands as PAM and CHARDONNAY rehearse
          camera and sound moves behind him.
          All the camera equipment has "UNIV OF MD" stenciled
          on it that has been scratched out half-heartedly.

          Pasolini's playing and we
          have an empty theater?!
          DINAH pushes HONEY on stage.

                         HONEY
          (Reading lines in a monotone)
          It's that fucking new multiplex
          that opened in the mall, isn't it?
          CECIL's face turns to stone as the rest of the
          SPROCKET HOLES watch, shocked at HONEY's wooden
          performance.

                         CHERISH

          Not for "THE FLINTSTONES"!? 
          CECIL starts banging his head painfully on cement
          wall to show his displeasure at HONEY's reading.

                         HONEY
          (Still in a monotone)
          Somebody's gotta pay for
          this insult!
          HONEY looks out and sees SPROCKET HOLES aping

          CECIL immediately stops banging his head and

                         (IN CHARACTER)
          It's that fucking new multiplex
          that opened in the mall, isn't it?
          CECIL's eyes light up in happiness at HONEY's
          performance.

                         CHERISH
          I heard they were sold out
          last night, Mom.

          From the empty movie seats of
          every good movie theater in

          CECIL and SPROCKET HOLES burst into applause.

                         CECIL
          That's more like it, Miss Whitlock!
          CHERISH gives HONEY a suddenly jealous look.

                         HONEY
          (Feeling her oats)
          To be frank, Cecil, I would
          never do this picture in my
          real film life. The whole
          message is stupid - ask theater
          owners in any country and they'll
          tell you. Hollywood makes the
          best films in the world and I'm
          proud to be part of that system.

                         CECIL

                         CECIL
          The first take is the only
          real truth...

                         HONEY
          But you can't cut the film
          with only a master!

                         CECIL
          There are no rules in outlaw
          cinema, Miss Whitlock, only
          edges. We believe technique
          to be nothing more than failed
          style. You see, I've had a vision...
          All the SPROCKET HOLES smile like film zombies to

          .and that vision is called
          "ultimate reality." The rest
          of our film is shot in real
          life, with real people ... . and
          yes, with real terror.

          CECIL hurriedly flips through TIME Magazine until he
          finds the article he wants. RODNEY and RAVEN

                         CECIL
          That's not what TIME Magazine
          has to say.

          "Miss Whitlock seems a little
          ill at ease and past her prime

          CANDY BAR?!
          CANDY COUNTER GIRLS scream in real fear.
          DINAH and LEWIS enter on exit side of front doors
          and guard the "set."
          LYLE and CHERISH enter in character with their guns
          drawn.
          LYLE grabs an over-sized cup from behind counter.

                         LYLE
          You call THAT a SMALL??!!

          THIS IS STILL POPPED IN

          COCONUT OIL, ISN'T IT?!!
          CHERISH blasts popcorn machine with gun.
          THEATER MANAGER comes running down from office.

                         MANAGER
          (Walking right into

                         CECIL'S TAKE)
          Hey, what's the trouble here!?
          CHERISH glares at a large marketing booth filled
          with items for sale in lobby.

                         CHERISH

          NOBODY NEEDS THIS GARBAGE!
          She overturns the booth and items crash to the
          floor.

                         LYLE

                         (TO MANAGER)
          We are the ultimate bad review!

                         MANAGER

          Please ...I didn't make this
          movie ... . I'm just the manager...
          CHARDONNAY knocks him out cold with one smack of her
          boom pole.

          71. INTERIOR TIMONIUM THEATER. 71.
          Horribly unfunny scene from "THE FLINTSTONES" is
          seen on screen.
          Packed AUDIENCE howls in laughter.
          Doors to lobby fly open and CECIL and his CAST and CREW
          come running in, tying handkerchiefs around their noses
          and mouths and filming the action. CECIL fires his gun
          in air. AUDIENCE turns around in confusion.

                         CECIL
          (Hissing to HONEY)
          Say the lines!

          (To AUDIENCE, ferociously

                         IN CHARACTER)

                         (TO AUDIENCE)

          THIS FILM STINKS AND YOU KNOW IT!
          LYLE, CHERISH and HONEY lob stink bombs into AUDIENCE.
          AUDIENCE screams in panic as stink bombs go off, and
          tries to run to exits, holding their noses and
          gagging as PAM and CHARDONNAY record their every
          move.
          CECIL smiles in directorial lunacy as one TICKET
          BUYER vomits right in front of PAM's camera.

                         CECIL

          CUT! PRINT!
          (To HONEY and SPROCKET HOLES)

          WRAP IT UP AND RUN!
          CECIL, his "cast and crew" take off, chanting their
          terrorist yell.

          FADE OUT.

           We hear a cool rap song on soundtrack called
          "NO BUDGET." ("When we say action, we mean action,

          73. INTERIOR SPROCKET HOUSE. 73.
          Wild "Dailies" party is in progress. LYLE is
          smoking crack and showing developed footage from
          that day's shoot on the wall of the warehouse as he
          dances lewdly with himself in place.
          LEWIS watches the "dailies" as he DJ's from turntables in
          booth while CHARDONNAY sexily raps the outlaw-film
          call-to-arms we hear on the soundtrack.
          PETIE and RODNEY torridly go-go dance on separate
          tables as PAM and DINAH writhe sexily to the beat on
          the dance floor.
          CECIL and CHERISH watch the gritty film rushes atop
          CECIL's bizarrely decored crane that doubles as their
          love nest. CECIL is frantically trying to write his
          script but CHERISH is pawing him, turned on by seeing
          herself on film.

                         CHERISH
          Come on, Cecil, I want a little
          "action" of my own!

                         CECIL
          (Gently pushing her away)
          I'm trying to write, Cherish!
          HONEY, looking more relaxed, with only one leg cuffed to
          director's chair, watches herself on film in the arty,
          grainy, but very striking footage.
          RAVEN does a "devil dance" with herself and
          ritualistically drinks from a skull head.

                         RAVEN

                         (TO HONEY)
          Goat urine, want some?
          HONEY pales.

                         (HAPPILY)
          It's a Satan thing!
          (Glancing at HONEY on film)
          You're really good in our movie!
          HONEY beams at compliment, catches herself, and smiles
          weakly back at RAVEN as FIDGET approaches with a martini
          on a tray for HONEY.

                         HONEY
          Oh, craft service. Thank you,
          Fidget, but I never
          drink when I'm working but
          you're very kind. Do your parents
          know where you are tonight?

                         FIDGET
          They're probably mad...

                         HONEY
          Don't you think you ought
          to call them...?

                         (FALTERING)
          Cecil says our parents are
          the enemies of film...

                         HONEY
          You know that's nonsense!
          Go ahead, call them up. I bet
          they miss you...
          LYLE ruins everything by staggering over, scarily
          high.

                         LYLE
          Hey Honey, want some crack?

                         HONEY
          I most certainly do NOT, Lyle.
          I can't believe you'd be a drug
          addict in the 90's - it's so retro.

                         LYLE
          Before I was a drug addict, I had
          so many different problems, Honey.
          Now I just have one - drugs. It
          gave my life a real focus.
          Cut to CECIL on crane with CHERISH as they hornily
          watch CHERISH on film.

                         CHERISH
          (Suddenly riding CECIL's leg)
          How can you see me on film and
          not want to fuck me?!

          (Moaning in sexual frustration)
          I S-Q want to fuck you, Cherish, but
          you know I can't...

                         CHERISH
          Why not?!

                         (PROUDLY)
          All my directors fuck me!

                         CECIL

          I'm not "all your directors," Cherish.

          I'M CECIL B. DEMENTED, THE ULTIMATE

          AUTEUR!
          LYLE begins projecting the dailies on the writhing
          bodies of the sexually frustrated SPROCKET HOLES.

                         CECIL

          addressing his followers)

          Our footage is stronger than
          Otto Preminger's...
          CHERISH licks CECIL's tattoo.

                         CECIL
          .creepier and darker than
          David Lynch's...
          LEWIS scratches a sexual note in the music as he
          lusts towards CHARDONNAY who sings out a torrid
          moan.

                         CECIL
          .more exploitative than
          Herschel Gordon Lewis.
          LYLE humps the projector, out of his mind.

          .and more violent than
          Sam Fuller..-
          DINAH writhes in horniness, pulls her pistol and fires
          at "The Films of David Lean" coffee table book she uses
          as a target.

          hormones to a new level of
          cinema unrest!

          HONEY nods her support.

          avoid sexual release! Get as
          drunk as Sam Peckinpah...
          PAM guzzles whisky.

                         CECIL
          As high as Rainer Werner
          Fassbinder!...
          LYLE sniffs fumes from an aerosol can of metallic
          paint.

                         CECIL
          But stay celibate for celluloid!
          Cut back to FIDGET on phone. We see his suburban
          MOM answer on split screen.

          Are you okay?

                         FIDGET

          .the satanic fury of Kenneth

          .the racial tension of Spike Lee...
          CHARDONNAY lets out a soulful wail as she dances in
          sexual abandon.

          Hello? Hello?
          FIDGET hangs up phone and starts playing pocket pool
          frantically.

          other SPROCKET HOLES as they fall to their knees in
          cult worship.
          HONEY signals to FIDGET she's changed her mind -
          she'll have the martini after all.

          SPROCKET HOLES are passed out all over loft,
          surrounded by rotting junk food, empty liquor
          bottles and last night's party debris.
          CECIL and CHERISH lie asleep twisted and entwined in
          the sheets, tortured by their erotic dreams.
          Suddenly, one of CECIL's bloodshot eyes open and
          he lurches for the microphone.

          He hits hideously loud alarm button.
          SPROCKET HOLES leap to their feet and stagger into
          film production.

          Before she can barely open her eyes, HONEY sees
          RODNEY and RAVEN rushing towards her, their
          instruments of beauty torture ready.

                         RODNEY
          (Glaring at HONEY's hair)
          I see that fucking brown color...

                         HONEY
          Please Rodney, those aren't roots
          - they're scabs on my scalp from
          the dye and they're raw!
          RODNEY sadistically squirts her roots with dye as
          HONEY lets out a cry of agony.

                         RAVEN

                         (SMILING)
          Just close your eyes and think
          of the films of George Cukor.
          RAVEN tweezes HONEY'S eyebrows painfully as RODNEY
          continues to torture her hair.

          you could escape this madness...

          Escape to what, Honey?

                         (PROUDLY)

          three-headed guard dog at the
          gate of hell!

          Don't say that, Raven! Tell her,
          Rodney - no movie is worth dying for!
          RODNEY blasts HONEY's hair with his fiery
          malfunctioning drier as she cries out in pain.

                         HONEY
          OWWWW! Rodney, why do you want
          to hurt me? Gay men are supposed
          to be gentle...

                         RODNEY
          (Begins teasing HONEY's hair)
          That's just it, Honey! I'm not
          gay. I'm straight and I fucking
          hate it! Petie loves me but I
          can't love him back! I've tried!
          I kiss him and all I feel is beard.

          I CAN'T TAKE THAT CERTAIN THICKNESS

          IN HIS PANTS!

                         (SOBBING)

          about pussy!
          RODNEY rips out a clump of HONEY'S teased hair with
          brush.

                         HONEY

          No one chooses to be
          heterosexual. Honey knows
          that.

          I'M STRAIGHT! AND I HATE!

          SO JUST GET USED TO IT,

          HONEY WHITLOCK!
          He blasts the blow drier on finished hairdo and
          flames singe her neck.

                         HONEY

          AHHHHHHHHH!
          CECIL enters, now dressed in an even more elaborate
          Cecil B. DeMille-inspired movie director outfit.
          PETIE, acting as bodyguard, leers at RODNEY who lets
          out one final sob of frustration as DINAH, changed
          into another alarming retro fashion number wheels in
          her portable TV monitor and VCR.

                         CECIL
          Good morning, Miss Whitlock.

          Whatever for? Your old career
          is over. . .but your comeback
          has just begun...
          CECIL nods to DINAH to start tape and we see a
          TEENAGE BOY on news in front of vandalized Timonium
          theater.

                         TEENAGE BOY
          .I was in the audience when
          they attacked and I'll tell
          you. . .Honey Whitlock was awesome!
          HONEY looks in confusion to CECIL who smiles proudly
          back. Tape jumps to a different news show showing
          TEEN GIRL, wearing a handmade "CECIL RULES" T-shirt.
          She stands out front of the popular local art house,
          The Charles Theater.

                         TEEN GIRL
          I think Honey Whitlock is right
          - most films suck and it's time
          somebody did something about it...
          HONEY catches herself half smiling at the favorable
          mention.
          Tape cuts to TIMONIUM THEATER MANAGER, his head now
          bandaged.

                         THEATER MANAGER
          .Nobody forced her to be in
          that movie, I could see that,
          but she was damn good! Scarier
          than hell, if you ask me! She
          looked different from her other
          films, too...I don't know...
          younger.
          HONEY's face lights up but CECIL quickly brings her
          down to earth.

                         CECIL

          who don't understand our work...

                         HONEY

                         (SUDDENLY SKEPTICAL)
          Oh, really! Are you sure this stuff
          really happened?

                         CHERISH
          (In a sudden rage)

          YES IT REALLY HAPPENED! "OH

          SANTA WHY HAST THOU FORSAKEN ME?"

          I SCREAMED...

                         (TO CECIL)
          BUT Â£iE. DOESN'T BELIEVE ME!

                         HONEY
          I. .I believe you.

          Shut up, Cherish. I've told you.

          THAT'S ALL OVER WITH! SAVE YOUR

          RAGE AND USE IT IN THE CINEMA!
          CHERISH suddenly quiets down in fear.

                         CHERISH

                         (MEEKLY)
          Yes, Cecil...

                         (PREOCCUPIED)
          Now Honey...I want you to do a
          little stunt for this scene...

                         HONEY

                         (ALARMED)
          A what?

                         CECIL
          A simple little stunt.

                         HONEY
          It doesn't say anything
          about a stunt in your rewrite.

                         CECIL

                         (TO HONEY)
          See Pam?
          HONEY looks down to PAM, and sees PAM putting
          gaffer's tape mark on deck of ship.

          86. "PRIDE OF BALTIMORE" DECK. 86.
          PAM, wearing earphones, looks up at CECIL and HONEY
          in window and nods gravely.
          Another CATERER looks quizzically at PAM, not
          recognizing her. He then sees DINAH shucking
          oysters and realizes something is wrong. He spots a
          mobile phone on table.
          87. Cut back to INTERIOR SECOND FLOOR ABANDONED PIER. 87.

                         CECIL

                         (TO HONEY)
          That's your mark. When you
          hear "Action," jump through
          the window, and land facing
          Pam's camera.

                         (LOOKING DOWN)
          But Cecil, surely you realize
          I could be injured...

                         CHERISH
          Suffer for celluloid!

                         HONEY
          Maybe with an air bag or some
          kind of safety precaution...

          Just call me irresponsible...

                         CECIL
          (Smiling, to HONEY)
          Prove yourself, Honey.
          HONEY spots a marine police boat quickly darting
          behind "Pride of Baltimore," filled with MARINE

          POLICE.

                         HONEY
          (Realizing this could be
          her only chance)
          Alright, Cecil. I'm a professional...
          Roll the camera.

                         CECIL

          CHERISH and LYLE rush to scurry back down steps.
          CECIL hands HONEY a grenade and a gun.

                         CECIL
          Don't worry, they're just props.
          After your first line, throw the
          grenade at the Film Commission.
          Nobody will get hurt.

                         HONEY
          But there are bullets in
          this gun...

          DINAH throws down shucking knife and takes out
          clapboard from under oyster bar.

          HONEY is practicing and trying to get up her nerve.
          She runs to window, stops, goes back and runs up
          again, getting her rhythm.

          HONEY runs and jumps through window.

          93. DECK OF "PRIDE OF BALTIMORE." 93.
          HONEY comes crashing down in a hail of broken glass
          and lands directly on her mark holding her grenade.
          PARTY GUESTS scream in panic and try to escape but
          PETIE, DINAH, FIDGET and LEWIS block every exit with
          drawn guns.
          HONEY, bleeding from tiny cuts looks up to CECIL'S
          directorial glare and realizes she is supposed to
          act.

                         HONEY
          (In character, to table full
          of terrified producers headed

          insulted our movie?!
          (To FILM COMMISSIONER)

          WAS IT YOU?!!

                         FILM COMMISSIONER
          No...please...I was only
          following studio orders.
          HONEY throws what she thinks is her "prop" grenade.
          The FILM COMMISSIONER dives out of the way and it
          explodes.
          HONEY, horrified that the "effect" was real looks up
          to CECIL but he has vanished.
          Suddenly CECIL enters the ship "directing" through
          megaphone.

          in gastronomic detail for PAM'S camera.
          CHERISH and LYLE, enter ship on cue in character,

          HONEY aims gun at PRODUCER C, terrified the gun is
          as real as her grenade was.

          MARINE POLICE suddenly open fire on SPROCKET HOLES.
          RODNEY is instantly killed as he mixes HONEY'S hair
          dye.
          PETIE's face turns to stone at seeing his dead
          "boyfriend."
          HONEY screams, thinking she is being rescued as
          RAVEN bravely tries to touch up her makeup.

          PETIE fires gun and kills COP who shot RODNEY.
          PARTY GUESTS and STUDIO EXECS dive under tables or
          jump overboard.
          LYLE is suddenly so stoned that he can't move.

                         LYLE
          Help me, Cherish. I'm stuck
          in a K-hole and I can't get out!
          CHERISH, firing her gun wildly, runs to LYLE and
          manages to pull him "off set" as HONEY freezes in
          terror deciding between her director or the POLICE.
          CHARDONNAY fires her gun and accidentally blasts her
          ears over earphone and lunges to turn down volume

          PRODUCER C clutches his stomach and doubles over.
          HONEY covers her mouth in real horror.
          Instantly PRODUCER C recovers, realizing the bullet
          was a blank.

          THAT'S A CUT!
          CECIL is shot in the left shoulder by POLICE.
          HONEY kisses RAVEN goodbye and makes a break for it
          and runs towards MARINE POLICE.

          DON'T SHOOT! I'm Honey Whitlock
          and I've been kidnapped!
          HONEY is shocked when the POLICE tackle her and
          place her under arrest.
          DINAH grabs FILM COMMISSIONER and uses him as a
          human shield as she fires away, hitting several
          cops.

                         FILM COMMISSIONER

          NO! NO! WE'LL GO TO SUNDANCE

          TOGETHER, I PROMISE!
          CECIL, clutching his shoulder wound, looks up in
          shock to see HONEY being dragged off ship in
          handcuffs as POLICE read her her Miranda rights.

          SPROCKET HOLES, nursing their wounds, but still
          obsessed, aim guns at cops.

          FAMILIES' eyes light up in rage as they charge
          CECIL, HONEY and SPROCKET HOLES, pelting them with
          their concession candies.
          Completely outnumbered, and out of ammunition, CECIL
          realizes they had better run for their lives.

                         CECIL

          CUT! MOVING ON!
          CECIL and SPROCKET HOLES take off with FAMILIES in

          CECIL and his SPROCKET HOLES round the corner and
          stop in happiness at seeing the theater. CECIL
          smiles in relief and beckons his gang to follow as
          FAMILIES gain on them in fury.

          Intense karate fight scene finale is on screen as packed
          AUDIENCE of inner city ACTION FANS watch on the edge of their
          seats, cheering their hero Jackie Chan.
          Suddenly CECIL runs into front of theater through
          fire door with HONEY and SPROCKET HOLES.

          The entire audience of tough ACTION FANS leap to their
          feet.
          FAMILIES rush into theater and freeze in horror at
          the sight of ACTION FANS.
          As karate mayhem rages on screen, ACTION FANS attack
          FAMILIES with karate chops and FAMILIES turn in their
          tracks and run for their lives.
          HONEY is mobbed by ACTION FANS who beg for

          WANNA BET?!
          LEWIS gives an expert karate chop to DRIVER who in turn
          uses a few quick karate moves of his own on LEWIS.
          PETIE jumps in and picks up DRIVER and throws him into
          display case out front of theater, smashing the glass
          and knocking DRIVER unconscious.

          PETIE is gunning the motor of Hiway Film Delivery truck
          with LEWIS aboard as DRIVER lies unconscious on ground.
          CECIL, HONEY and SPROCKET HOLES come running out of
          theater and pile on to truck as ACTION FANS chase after
          them, cheering and begging for autographs.

          PETIE peels out the truck, as one diehard FAN keeps
          running along so HONEY can finish signing her signature,
          hanging out the back of truck.

          FADE OUT.
          103. Fade in to EXTERIOR SPROCKET HOUSE. NIGHT. 103.
          We hear a jazzy, gospel-influenced rap song being DJ'd
          by LEWIS and sung by CHARDONNAY on soundtrack entitled
          "DeMented Forever."

          104. INTERIOR SPROCKET HOUSE. 104.
          PETIE, dressed in mourning, brands CECIL on the arm with
          the CECIL B. DEMENTED logo as SPROCKET HOLES lie
          exhausted, awaiting their turn for the brand, nursing
          their wounds, loading their guns, and eating junk food.
          CECIL, bandaged, filthy, wide-eyed in directorial
          fanaticism rants to his followers below.

                         CECIL
          .The slash and burn of the
          white hot metal will brand you
          forever with the logo of Cecil B.
          DeMented... Wear the privileged
          scar of cinema sainthood with
          pride and horniness...
          LYLE projects the dailies of the day on wall as he pops
          Percodans.
          HONEY, out of her cell and unguarded for the first time,
          watches her "stunt" footage with pride as she gets the
          vodka bottle from their filthy dirty freezer and goes
          about the ritual of making the perfect martini.
          LEWIS, proudly displaying his brand, DJ's the music as
          CHERISH writhes in a sexy go-go dance for CECIL.
          CHARDONNAY painfully caresses her fresh brand and wails
          out the chorus of "DeMented Forever."
          HONEY empties ice tray into martini shaker.

                         CECIL
          .There is no such thing as
          family. We are the orphans of

          eagerly sticks out her. arm.

          From the valleys of Lebanon...

          HONEY stops making martini and quickly checks her hair
          to see if any dark roots are showing and smiles at

          RAVEN.

          hell where one day we'll all
          be reunited.
          RODNEY brands RAVEN.

                         RAVEN
          (Eyes rolling back in head)

          PLEASURE IS PAIN! SLAVERY

          IS FREEDOM! SUICIDE FOR SATAN!
          HONEY scientifically adds one drop of vermouth to
          martini shaker and looks up sharply at the mention of
          suicide and gives RAVEN a stern but motherly
          disapproving look.
          RAVEN looks away guiltily, feeling HONEY's influence.

          after we're dead, right, Cecil?
          CECIL smiles egotistically and joins in chanting with
          zombie-like SPROCKET HOLES.

          A distracted HONEY expertly shakes her martini happily.
          PETIE turns towards FIDGET with the brand and FIDGET
          begins playing pocket pool frantically in fear.
          HONEY takes chilled martini glass from freezer.
          CECIL sees FIDGET's fear and nods to DINAH to turn on
          video footage with remote. FIDGET looks sad to see his
          PARENTS flash on the TV screen taped from WJZ TV news
          show.

                         FIDGET'S MOM

          SPROCKET HOLES freeze in horror at FIDGET'S disloyalty
          and stare at him in cult pressure.
          HONEY pops an olive into martini glass and looks up in
          surprise.

                         CECIL

                         (TO FIDGET)
          I knew you were the weak
          one, Fidget.
          (Eyes widening in hypnotic

                         FRENZY)
          But just remember - your parents
          liked "Godzilla"!

                         LYLE
          They wouldn't let you see
          R-rated films as a child!

                         DINAH
          They've never been to a
          midnight movie!
          FIDGET starts to crack as his hand creeps in his pocket.

                         CHARDONNAY
          They enjoy classic TV sitcoms
          turned into feature length films!

                         CHERISH
          They've never rented a porno
          movie!
          FIDGET starts whacking nervously.

                         CECIL
          (Right in FIDGET's face)
          And to top it off...they talk
          out loud in the theater once
          the feature has begun!
          SPROCKET HOLES grimace in horror.
          Even HONEY shakes her head in disgust as she pours
          martini into glass.

                         HONEY
          That really is unforgivable,
          Fidget!

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         - 77 -
          FIDGET looks around at the brainwashed faces of his
          disgusted, judgmental cult and crumbles.
          HONEY greedily gulps down her martini.

                         FIDGET

          OK! OK! MY PARENTS ARE THE

          ENEMY OF FILM! DO IT!
          PETIE brands FIDGET as CECIL smiles victoriously.
          HONEY, slightly tipsy, joins the SPROCKET HOLES in
          singing the refrain.

                         ALL

          DEMENTED FOREVER!
          CECIL turns to HONEY as PETIE brandishes the red hot
          iron.

                         CECIL
          And you...Honey?

                         HONEY
          No, Cecil...
          CECIL nods to DINAH who plays the tape.
          HONEY sees her ex-husband, a handsome movie star on
          screen with JAY LENO on "The Tonight Show."

                         EX-HUSBAND
          Well, I was married to her for
          seven years so I know just
          how nuts Honey Whitlock is...
          JAY LENO and STUDIO AUDIENCE howls in laughter.
          HONEY stares at TV, betrayed as RAVEN gently puts her
          t arms around her in comfort.

                         RAVEN
          Satan loves you, Honey, and
          so do I.

          Suddenly TEAMSTER B opens fire and shoots LYLE in
          the back of the head right in the middle of CECIL's
          take.
          MICHAEL J. FOX and DIRECTOR dive for cover under

          rattle.

          HONEY gulps as bullets whiz around her head and then
          jumps right back into character.

                         HONEY

          DEATH TO ALL WHO ARE

                         (TO TEAMSTERS)

          THAT MEANS YOU, FUCKERS!
          CECIL fires his gun and kills TEAMSTER B.
          CECIL is shot in the chest by TEAMSTER C and falls to

                         F
          his knees in great pain.
          PAM pans the camera back to TEAMSTER C and shoots her
          gun and kills him.
          CHERISH runs to crane and hops on with CECIL and shoots
          at TEAMSTERS D & E who rush in.
          DINAH sees that CECIL has been hit and a look of fury
          sweeps over her face.
          CECIL fires gun at TEAMSTERS F, G & H as they flood the
          set.
          FIDGET fires his gun at TEAMSTER F with one hand and
          plays pocket pool with the other hand. He is shot in
          pocket pool hand by TEAMSTER G and looks down, stunned
          at his injury.
          PETIE maneuvers the crane from below with amazing skill
          to dodge the bullets as CECIL and CHERISH fire back at
          TEAMSTERS G & H, and PAM continues to film.
          PAM is shot in stomach by TEAMSTER G.
          LEWIS staple guns TEAMSTER F right in the neck with
          multiple staples.
          CHARDONNAY hurls an expensive microphone at TEAMSTER H
          just as he is about to shoot her and then continues
          recording the sound on her own equipment.

          Suddenly TEAMSTER D jumps from trap door in set floor
          with gun aimed at HONEY.
          CHERISH fires her gun in the nick of time and kills
          TEAMSTER D and saves HONEY's life.
          HONEY locks eyes with CHERISH in a newfound thespian
          bond.
          HONEY, FIDGET and RAVEN crawl off set as bullets fly
          over their heads.
          CECIL, PAM and CHERISH are cornered by TEAMSTERS E, G &
          H who advance on crane with drawn guns.
          PETIE throws his hands in the air.
          CECIL fires but he is out of ammunition.
          DINAH frantically reloads her weapons.
          CHERISH fires but then she too is out of ammunition.
          PAM continues to film, bleeding badly from her wound.
          DINAH suddenly runs in front of CECIL in a kamikaze
          action and opens fire killing TEAMSTERS E, G & H.
          CECIL grabs HONEY and all SPROCKET HOLES manage to
          escape set before TEAMSTER F, badly injured with staples
          in neck, staggers to his feet and mows down DINAH in a
          hail of bullets.
          CECIL's eyes light up in horror at seeing DINAH's
          corpse.

          A badly injured and distraught CECIL staggers outside
          with HONEY and what's left of his wounded SPROCKET
          HOLES, and they limp up the street.
          CHERISH races ahead and turns the corner just as
          bleeding TEAMSTER F staggers out of studio and
          collapses. TEAMSTERS I & J come around corner, sae

          CHERISH, disheveled, filthy and out of her mind with
          fear, comes running and, force of habit, adjusts her
          breasts to look good.

          up next to him is HONEY, still dressed it same costume
          from last scene but now wearing a bad "Honey Whitlock"
          wig.

          Ten dollars.

                         (TO HONEY)
          Hey, that's pretty good...

                         HONEY
          (Suddenly the consummate

                         ACTRESS)
          Thanks. What's the prize
          if I win?

                         TICKET SELLER
          A big ham! What else?!

                         (LAUGHS HIDEOUSLY)
          HONEY clenches her teeth in mortification as GROUPIE
          pulls off into drive-in, fuming.
          CECIL, CHERISH and RAVEN's heads pop up from hiding in
          back seat under blanket.

                         CECIL
          This is it - our final location.

                         CHERISH

                         (OVERLY-ENTHUSIASTIC)

          TOTALLY RADICAL!
          CECIL rolls his eyes at GROUPIE's political fervor as
          HONEY rips off wig and RAVEN starts touching up her
          makeup.

          EMPLOYEES, both male and female, are dressed as Honey

          scores of Honey Whitlock look-a-likes from the drive-in
          audience.
          134. Cut back to DRIVE-IN SCREEN.
          HONEY WHITLOCK'S CHARACTER is hiding with her cat in
          terror behind bedroom door as HIT MAN #1 climbs in
          window with flashlight as suspenseful music on
          soundtrack builds. HONEY'S CHARACTER takes off down
          hall outside of her bedroom.

          135. INTERIOR DRIVE-IN. 135.
          GROUPIE pulls car into row of other parked cars with
          drive-in speakers hooked in windows. CECIL, HONEY and
          RAVEN get out as GROUPIE pop open the trunk.
          Out climb FIDGET, CHARDONNAY and LEWIS helping the
          injured and bleeding PAM and PETIE. They all struggle
          to carry film equipment.
          CECIL, HONEY and entire gang of SPROCKET HOLES scatter
          in the dark between the rows of parked cars towards

          Or those last minute fuck-head
          ticket buyers who enter the theater
          after the feature has begun!
          GIRL FAN sees CECIL, badly injured, as he limps past car
          with CHERISH to concession stand.

          Oh my God... the greatest director
          of all time!
          137. Cut to ROW OF DRIVE-IN. 137.
          HONEY stands transfixed in between cars as she watches
          her old self on screen with disdain as GROUPIE gently
          tries to pull her away.

                         GROUPIE
          Come on, you didn't know...
          On drive-in screen, HONEY's character clutches the cat,
          races down steps to first floor of her house and sees
          HIT MAN #2 briefly staring through front door. Her
          CHARACTER runs to kitchen in fear and drops cat to get
          butcher knife out of kitchen drawer.
          RAVEN and FIDGET, both injured, touch up and adjust
          HONEY's final insane terrorist-chic look.

                         RAVEN

                         (TO HONEY)
          You have cinematic immunity now.

                         FIDGET
          None of your old movies count.
          CAT, on screen, scurries through "cat-door" cut in
          kitchen wall and escapes outside.
          In car next to HONEY, REDNECK MOM, POP and DORKY KID
          watch the movie. MOM is weary "Honey Whitlock" wig.

                         REDNECK MOM
          I bet she's Miss Phony Baloney
          in real life.

                         REDNECK DAD
          She don't look so hot to me.
          I prefer Meg Ryan or somebody
          younger.

          Can I get more food?

          (Turning around, snarling)
          I told you to stop slurping!
          REDNECK MOM suddenly sees HONEY WHITLOCK and quickly
          turns back around.

                         REDNECK MOM
          (Under her breath)
          Oh my God-don't look now...

                         (SUDDENLY SCARED)
          .but I think she's standing right
          next to our car...

          138. MANAGER'S OFFICE. 138.
          MANAGER is sitting in his wheelchair, counting cash in
          front of giant ham, gift-wrapped in cellophane with
          Honey's picture stuck to it. His sawed-off shotgun is
          propped up on chair nearby. A knock is heard at door.

                         MANAGER
          Who is it?

                         CECIL
          Cecil B. DeMented.

                         MANAGER
          (Thinking it's one of

                         HIS STAFF)
          Real funny asshole!
          MANAGER wheels himself over and opens door.
          PAM and CHARDONNAY aim the camera and sound microphone
          at MANAGER's stunned face.
          MANAGER looks to his shotgun.
          CECIL steps forward with CHERISH and pulls his empty
          gun. A trickle of blood runs from CECIL's mouth as
          CHERISH lunges for MANAGER's shotgun.

          money!

          141. DRIVE-IN SCREEN.
          On screen, HONEY'S CHARACTER's terrorized eyes are lit
          melodramatically as she holds butcher knife and hears
          HIT MAN #1 approaching from other side of kitchen door.
          142. EXTERIOR DRIVE-IN. Row near concession stand.
          HONEY, GROUPIE, FIDGET and RAVEN rush by car filled with
          JOCKS wearing "Cecil Sucks" T-shirts as they yell out to
          screen.

                         JOCK A

                         JOCK B
          She never could act!

          Her career is over!
          GROUPIE hears and tries to turn back to confront JOCKS
          but HONEY grabs him.

                         HONEY
          No! Bad reviews can't hurt me
          anymore!

                         FIDGET
          We're beyond the critics' reach!

                         RAVEN
          Who cares what anybody thinks
          of our movie except Satan?!
          HONEY, FIDGET and RAVEN pull GROUPIE away towards

           HONEY'S CHARACTER screams in terror as HIT MAN #1 rips
           open door to kitchen. Just as HONEY'S CHARACTER begins
           to strike back with knife, HIT MAN #2 reaches through
           cat-door and grabs her leg. HIT MAN #1 knocks knife
          from her hand. HIT MAN #2 grabs her ass with other
          hand. HONEY'S CHARACTER lets out a scream of horror.
          Suddenly the film jams in drive-in projector and freezes
          on screen before melting before drive-in AUDIENCE's
          eyes.
          The screen goes blank.

          AUDIENCE starts honking their car horns.
          Suddenly we hear CECIL's voice booming out over the

                         CECIL
          Hello, this is Cecil B. DeMented

          CECIL FANS A, B & C jump out of their cars happily along
          with other supporters.
          REDNECK FAMILY guiltily starts up engine of car, hoping
          to escape along with other terrified FAMILIES.
          JOCKS A, B & C leap from car, ready for a fight as do

          CECIL FAN C throws beer bottle at REDNECK FAMILY's car

          Suddenly mini-cams from other local news teams
          speed into drive-in behind them.

          PETIE and FIDGET struggle to carry CECIL on "set" in a
          makeshift stretcher as RAVEN applies makeup to his

          HONEY tips her head out of PAM's frame and CHERISH sets
          HONEY's hair on fire with one quick touch of the torch.
          HONEY's hair goes up in flames as she gives the
          performance of a lifetime as LEWIS pushes PAM on the
          wheelchair and they film their most technically
          ambitious shot.

                         HONEY

          FANS go wild, screaming their approval.
          GROUPIE vainly tries to light his own hair on fire with
          a lighter but it doesn't really work.
          CECIL'S ENEMIES stare at HONEY's hair ablaze in shock.
          SWAT TEAMS' mouths fall open in stunned amazement.
          FIDGET'S PARENTS and PSYCHIATRIST watch in horror.
          CECIL watches from stretcher in pride and amazement and
          motions for PETIE and FIDGET to put him down.

          Instantly PAM is shot dead by SWAT TEAM SHARPSHOOTER and

          B in audience, PETIE eyes a TOM OF FINLAND TYPE who
          nervously cruises back, and FIDGET plunges both hands
          deep in the fly of his pants. Their partners struggle
          to climb up on roof and everybody begins to make love.
          HONEY looks hornily to GROUPIE below but he is being
          beaten up by JOCKS A, B & C as he desperately tries to
          struggle up to her. HONEY sighs in sexual frustration.
          CHERISH runs to dying CECIL, unzips his pants and mounts
          him.
          COPS and SWAT TEAMS freeze in utter horror at the sudden
          sexual activity.
          FIDGET'S PARENTS lower their eyes at seeing FIDGET in
          deliriously happy orgasm alone as PSYCHIATRIST eagerly
          takes notes.
          NEWS TEAMS beat each other up to get better camera
          positions.
          SPROCKET HOLES reach orgasm together as the FANS cheer
          through the tear gas.

          Just after CHERISH and CECIL reach orgasm, CHERISH is
          shot dead in the forehead by SWAT TEAM A who leaps to
          roof of manager's office from helicopter.
          HONEY sees CHERISH's death, grabs PAM's camera from the
          ground and hurls it at SWAT TEAM MEMBER A and hits him
          in the head. He staggers backwards, drops his gun, and
          falls off roof where FANS refuse to catch him and he
          lands with a thud.
          SPROCKET HOLES leap up from lovemaking to escape but are
          shot again and again, badly outnumbered.
          FIDGET'S MOM and DAD grab PSYCHIATRIST and run for their
          lives, crying in despair.
          FIDGET sees his PARENTS in distance and jumps off roof
          to follow and is safely caught by CECIL FANS.
          LEWIS looks into cheering FANS' faces and suddenly jumps
          from concession stand roof with changing bag into mob of
          FANS and removes exposed film from PAM's camera.
          SWAT TEAM MEMBER B jumps from high roof of manager's
          office to concession stand roof pointing an AR15 at

          HONEY.

                         SWAT B
          I seen what you did, you
          Hollywood bitch!
          HONEY looks through the tear gas below to see GROUPIE
          suddenly battling himself free from JOCKS A, B & C. He
          bravely beckons HONEY to jump.
          CECIL disengages CHERISH's dead body up and off of him
          and seeing HONEY in danger crawls painfully to Pam's
          wheelchair dolly.

                         SWAT B

                         (TO HONEY)
          You're under arrest, Honey
          Whitlock!
          HONEY leaps from roof into mob of FANS and lands safely
          in GROUPIE's arms. They immediately begin to kiss in
          wild abandon.
          SWAT B shoots GROUPIE from atop roof and kills him.
          HONEY cries out at his death and panics as SWAT TEAM
          MEMBERS move in on her pointing high-powered rifles.
          FANS and ENEMIES scatter, abandoning her.

          CECIL lunges for dropped gun of SWAT TEAM A and shoots
          SWAT B dead, struggles aboard dolly and nods to FIDGET
          to douse him with gas.

          HONEY looks for help but she is suddenly all alone.
          CECIL pushes himself forward on wheelchair dolly,
          gaining speed and begins laughing maniacally.
          FIDGET flicks lit match on CECIL as he rolls by and
          CECIL ignites like a Buddhist monk.

          V-I-I-I-S-S-S-I-O-N!
          CECIL smashes into SWAT TEAM and they go up in flames,
          saving HONEY in the nick of time.

          HONEY sees BALTIMORE CITY POLICE, MARYLAND STATE
          TROOPERS, more SWAT TEAMS, local and national PRESS
          TEAMS, all running towards her with guns and camera
          equipment. She turns away, pulls out compact and sees
          her smeared makeup. She looks for RAVEN to touch her up
          and spots her being hustled away by SATANIST-TYPE FANS
          outside concession stand moments before the plate glass
          windows are shattered by police gunfire.

          PETIE is jumped and arrested by special SWAT TEAM
          wearing rubber gloves and surgical masks. PETIE laughs
          and moans in S & M pleasure as he tries to grope an
          especially macho MEMBER OF SWAT TEAM.

          HONEY turns back to mob in front of her and gives them a
          demented movie star grin.

          FIDGET struggles to climb up marquee to search for his

          throwing down letters as weapons at fleeing cars,

          re-arranges them to read T-H-E- E-N-O before a SWAT TEA,
          bullet tears into him. FIDGET falls and lands on the
          hood of his PARENTS' car as they exit the drive-in.

                         FIDGET
          (Injured badly, but alive)
          Hi Mom, hi Dad.
          FIDGET'S MOM and DAD'S eyes light up in parental love.

          HONEY, bald, bleeding, and burned, sees RAVEN and their
          eyes lock in friendship as RAVEN escapes into SATANIST
          FAN's car. RAVEN happily gives HONEY the extended index
          and little finger satanic sign and then turns it into a
          thumbs-up gesture of the future.

          HONEY blows RAVEN a kiss and then looks back at the
          CROWD in confusion and begins her long mad walk to
          paddy-wagon through FANS, ENEMIES, MOVIE AGENTS,
          LAWYERS, NEWS TEAMS, and dumbfounded LAW ENFORCEMENT
          OFFICERS who all want something from HONEY. As the
          soundtrack swells triumphantly over the din of jeers,
          applause, career advice, legal strategies and requests
          for autographs and interviews, HONEY begins to smile in
          full movie star insanity and waves and blows kisses to
          the CROWD as if she just won the Oscar.

TITLES OVER YELLOW BACKGROUND.
We PULL BACK to reveal we're looking at THE SUN. In the
distance lie the gorgeous San Gabriel Mountains and the
Downtown Los Angeles skyline.
In ONE LONG TRACKING SHOT, we CRANE PAST some trees to reveal
the vast expansive homes scattered in the hills of Brentwood.
HOMEOWNERS walk dogs, a PAPERBOY chucks papers fr9m a
gleaming mountain bike... It's early in the morning, and the
landscapers haven't come with their leaf blowers yet.
CONTINUE BOOMING DOWN to road level to face    the resplendent
Martin residence. We STEADICAM down the fr    ont walk, able to
admire the manicured hedges and the black E   scalade in the
driveway, to the front door decorated with    a whimsical
placard that reads, "The Martins" -- and we    pass THROUGH THE
KEYHOLE into the foyer.

INT. JESSICA'S HOUSE - MORNING
We TRACK through the living room, passing framed photos of an
athletic eleven year old boy, and we hear a WOMAN'S VOICE as
she comes down the stairs with a GOLDEN RETRIEVER at her
side.

                     WOMAN
               (into phone)
          Yes Donna, I'm out the door.
We TRACK over the Woman's shoulder and follow her into the
kitchen, unable to see her face.

                     WOMAN (CONT'D)
          Just inform Kayleigh that
          anesthesia is on the way to prep
          the epidural and I'll be there as
          soon as I can.
Still looking over her shoulder, we watch her absently
straighten a PHOTOGRAPH of her son on the fridge as she
talks.

                    WOMAN (CONT'D)
          And promise her she's about to have
          a woooonnderful labor.
As the woman pours herself a fresh cup of coffee, her
HOUSEKEEPER enters the kitchen with a full laundry basket.
They give each other a silent wave.

                    WOMAN (CONT'D)
          Right, I'll see you in twenty.
She hangs up her cordless and takes a breath as we COME
AROUND to finally REVEAL JESSICA MARTIN; slightly weary, but
ready for the day ahead.

                     JESSICA
          Buenas dias, Rosario.



                      ROSARIO
           Good morning Miss Jessica.
Jessica sees her answering machine blinking, hits PLAY.
In the background, a cheerful Rosario enters frame and heads
for the back door carrying the basket of laundry.

                 MALE VOICE
           (on machine)
           Honey? Honey, wake up.   Pick up the-
And as she brings the coffee cup to her lips--
SLAMM!! The door EXPLODES open and a squad of FIVE GUNMEN
storm in, wearing SKI-MASKS. Everything is a whirlwind of
quick cuts, noise and confusion.
Jessica's DOG starts to lunge at the men and -- thup! -- is
stilled by a silenced pistol before its second bark.
Rosario runs for the ALARM SYSTEM --

                     LEAD GUNMAN
          Get away from there! Don't touch
          that -- !!
-- but as she reaches out for the PANIC BUTTON -- BLAM!!     He
blows her away, too. The Gunman curses, then turns on
Jessica.

                 LEAD GUNMAN (CONT'D)
          (dire)
          Where is he?
Jessica cringes.

                     JESSICA
          Where is who?

                     LEAD GUNMAN
          Wrong answer.
The bastard hauls back and -- WHAM I -- punches her in the
face, knocking Jessica cold.
Then he turns to his men.

                     LEAD GUNMAN (CONT'D)
          Search the house.
And as the answering machine fills the silence:

                CRAIG VO
          (on machine)
          -I'll call back later.
The LEAD GUNMAN spins around, and we PUSH INTO the blackness
of his masked face.

                                            MATCH CUT TO:



EXT. KIDNAPPERS' SAFEHOUSE - DAY
The BLACKNESS of a BLACK VAN and ESCALADE passing below us.
We quickly CRANE DOWN to see the vehicles traveling through:
An IRON GATE at the edge of an aband9ned property. They
bounce down a long lonely driveway lined with barren trees--
ANGLE ON: THE KIDNAPPERS' VAN as it arrives at its
destination; an isolated HOUSE in the Hills. The grass is
dead. The trees are dead. It's the kind of place you could
scream for a week and no one would hear a thing.
As the van stops--

                                     WE PUSH INTO ITS DOORS:

INT. DARKENED ATTIC - KIDNAPPERS' SAFEHOUSE
A door CRASHES open. Light slices through the dark revealing
the dusty, skeletal interior. Jessica is hurled into the
room and falls to the floor. With bound hands, she
frantically pulls her blindfold off to see--

THE LEAD SKI-MASKED KIDNAPPER
Standing in front of her.    Sturdier than the rest.   Solid.
Imposing.

                     JESSICA
          Wh... what do you want?
Unsettlingly, the Kidnapper says nothing, staring at her.
Jessica tries to remain calm under his angry gaze...
Then suddenly, the Kidnapper turns and exits the room.
Jessica breathes a sigh of relief...but it catches in her
throat as he returns ten seconds later -- with a BASEBALL BAT.
Grim as death, he stalks toward her --

                       JESSICA (CONT'D)
          No, wait..
And reaching.her, he hauls back and SWINGS --

                     JESSICA (CONT'D)

          NO!   PLEASE--//
SMASH! The bat connects with a wooden beam an inch above
Jessica's head, OBLITERATING the ROTARY DIAL TELEPHONE that
hung there.
As phone guts shower down on her, the Lead Kidnapper turns
and stomps away, slamming the attic door shut and locking
Jessica in the darkness.
Only now that they're gone does Jessica allow her fear to
show through. Trembling, tears running down her face,
Jessica finally breaks down, pleading to the empty attic--



                       JESSICA (CONT'D)
            Wha... what the hell is happening?!
The attic's suffocating silence is the only answer she gets.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

THE OCEAN
Skimming along the water.
And we TILT UP to reveal the majestic beaches of Southern
California, and at the center of it all, the SANTA MONICA

PIER.

EXT. SANTA MONICA PIER - MORNING - ESTABLISHING
It would be a typical day, except for that some PEOPLE are
preparing for a "HEAL THE BAY" rally at the end of the pier.
VENDORS set up, preparing for the daily grind ahead.
BIKERS gather around a bad-ass HELLCAT G2 CONFEDERATE
MOTORCYCLE and admire its cutting-edge design.
HOT CHICKS in bikinis try on sunglasses at a stand.
FISHERMEN crack beers while awaiting the next bite.

INT. SANTA MONICA PIER - ARCADE - MORNING

ANGLE ON - ARCADE GAME SCREEN.
The screen displays a car-race arcade game. A computer
generated hot-rod passes other racers at breakneck speed.
Playing the sit-down game, DAYTONA USA, is:
RYAN ACKERMAN, early twenties, looks like he grew up on the
beach without so much as a pot to piss in. His lethal
reflexes and bold recklessness, however, have made him a Jedi
Master of the game.
Ryan's score approaches the HIGH SCORE at the top of the
screen.

                       RYAN
            You recording this?

                       CHAD (OS)
            Yeah, sure...
CHAD, his best bud, aims a BLUE TOOTH VIDEOSTREAMING
CELLPHONE at some CUTE GIRLS instead. We can see their faces
on the tiny SCREEN of the cellphone.
Ryan's car gets caught behind a blue speedster, then passes
on the shoulder.



                       RYAN
            Move, bitch.
He gets an EXTENDED PLAY and the screen flashes "NEW RECORD."
Nearby, a KID watching the game nods.

                        KID
            Nice.
The HIGH SCORE starts rising to match Ryan's score.

                        RYAN
            Get that?
Ryan turns around to see Chad has shoved the cellphone down
the front of his tattered shorts. And he's freeballing it.

                       CHAD
            Check it; Attack of the Bubblegum
            Monster in Hi-Def videostream-

                      RYAN
            C'mon Chad, I gotta put my mouth on
            that.
Holding a cup of soda between his teeth, Chad pulls the
cellphone out of his pants and hits "SEND".

                        CHAD
                 (through cup-holding
                  teeth)
            Sweet. It's going to my email
            right now.
S9me soda inadvertently SPILLS onto the cellphone and Chad
wipes it dry on his pants.

                       RYAN
            Watch it dude, I gotta return that
            thing in seven days.

                       CHAD
            They aren't giving you shit yet?

                       RYAN
            Nah, whenever I return it, I just
            list off why the phone sucks and
            they give me a new model. Figure
            by the tenth time I'll have to go
            somewhere else.
Ryan's car finally CRASHES in a wall of flames.       Game Over.

                                            CUT TO:

THE OCEAN
As seen looking over the rail of the pier.      The tide is in,
but it's still a forty foot drop.


RYAN stares over the railing like a death row inmate
contemplating his last meal.

                      CHAD
           Go already. No one's looking.
His left hand holds his WALLET.

                 CHAD (CONT'D)
           (re: wallet)
           Need me to hold that?
Ryan sticks it in the pocket of his surfer shorts -- he zips
a zipper, tucks a Velcro flap. Pats his pocket proudly.

                     RYAN
          Waterproof.
But as soon as Ryan covertly CLIMBS ONTO THE RAIL, his left
leg starts trembling like crazy.

                     RYAN (CONT'D)
          This is stupid. I could get
          killed. Pick another dare.
Chad lowers the phone, irritated.

                     CHAD
          My ass. Not after you made me
          march in the Gay Pride Parade
          wearing a thong.

                     RYAN
          Screw it then. In one... Two...
          Two and a half--

                     CHAD
          Whole numbers only, Rabbitfoot.
Ryan stares at the waves crashing below. His leg starts
snaking like crazy... And he chickens out, hopping back to
the deck.

                    CHAD (CONT'D)
          Just so you know, I'm emailing this
          to every chick you ever met.
But suddenly Ryan's oblivious to the dare.   His eyes are
glued to something else--

                CHAD (CONT'D)
          (speaking like HAL 900)
          Transmitting pussy file now.
CHLOE, early 20s, a head turner, confident, funny; she can
pull you in like a tractor beam. She and some CUTE FRIENDS
carry heavy cardboard boxes toward a table set up for the
"Heal The Bay" rally.
Ryan walks over like he owns the place.



                      RYAN
           Got any more? I'm here to help.

                      CHLOE
           Thanks, but no, we got 'em all.

                      RYAN
           What's in 'em?
Chloe opens the box.    Hands him a "Heal The Bay" pamphlet.

                      RYAN (CONT'D)
           Cool, you're handing these out
           during the concert?

                     CHLOE
          Yeah, wanna help?
Ryan tries to ignore his thundering heart.

                       RYAN
          Hell yeah.     I'm all about "Heal the
          Bay. "
His eyes ricochet off the pamphlet in his hand.

                     RYAN (CONT'D)
          Me an Chad do the monthly cleanup
          thing, of course...
An awesome wing-man, Chad appears over Chloe's shoulder,
pretending to read a pamphlet, but really holding it up so
Ryan can see it. Piece of cake, now.

                     RYAN (CONT'D)
          We've collected water samples with
          the Stream Team, raised money on
          the Promenade... I'm surprised I
          haven't seen you.
He offers his hand.

                       RYAN (CONT'D)
          Ryan.
She takes it.

                       CHLOE
          Chloe.
The handshake lingers a second longer than necessary, and
they both smile at each other. Chad splits.

                     CHLOE (CONT'D)
          I can't tell if you're full of it.
Ryan stops posturing, gets real.

                     RYAN
          You ever go up to Santa Barbara?
          My dad used to take me there all



                      RYAN (CONT'D)
           the time. Their pier is amazing,
           clear water, huge crabs everywhere,
           oysters right there on the rocks,
           starfish... Hard to believe it's
           the same ocean sometimes.
He's managed to win her back.

                     CHLOE
           Maybe you and I can take a break
           later when Pat Benatar goes on.

                      RYAN
           Sounds like a plan.
There's a moment...     Then --

                     CHLOE
          Oh no -- I forgot. I still have to
          pick up a box of T-shirts at the
          Kinkos on Venice.

                     RYAN
           I'll do it for you... if you want.

                    CHLOE
          Seriously, you would?

                       RYAN
          Sure.     How much is the bill?

                       CHLOE
          Nothing.    It's been paid up front.

                    RYAN
          Do you promise not to go anywhere?

                       CHLOE
          Done.
Ryan makes a graceful exit.       Turns back.

                     RYAN
          Okay, I won't be long.

                CHLOE
          (laughing)
          Bye.
Ryan grabs Chad, and as they walk out of earshot:

                    RYAN
          Dude, does Santa Barbara have a
          harbor or a pier?

                                                CUT TO:

EXT. VENICE - DAY
A short time later, Ryan cruises through a Venice
neighborhood.


Ryan drives an early 70's Ford Bronco; clothes are strewn
across the backseat, and a box of "Heal the Bay" T-SHIRTS now
sits on the shotgun seat.
Ryan reaches into the glove box and pulls out a toothbrush.
He sips warm soda from a bottle and begins brushing.
Checking himself out in the mirror, he sniffs his pits, whoa,
and grabs the cellphone.

                      RYAN
                (into phone)
           Dex, wassup? You won't believe the
           hotties I just met at the pier.
           Smoking. You wanna meet them?
           Yeah? Well don't get too excited
           'cause I need my money.
Ryan stops at a red light.

                      RYAN (CONT'D)
           Bullshit, you're not going
           anywhere,
                (quickly adding)
           I'm pulling up right now.
Some AMBULANCES SPEED BY, SIRENS BLARING.   It's deafening.
Ryan lays on the horn.   When the light changes, Ryan peels
away angrily.

                    RYAN (CONT'D)
              (covering his ear)
          What? Yeah, you better be. And I
          need your shower, I'm talkin' code
          red stankage-
The CELLPHONE begins to CRACKLE with STATIC just as Ryan
drives under an OVERPASS.
Suddenly --
The car ahead of him STOPS in the middle of the street. Ryan
notices too late and has to jam on the brakes. The car
skids, he SCREAMS... and comes to a stop an inch before
hitting the other car's bumper.
He lifts the phone receiver to his ear but the call is WASHED

WITH STATIC.

                RYAN (CONT'D)
          (into phone)
          Dex? You still there...?
And as has happened to all of us, he loses the call.

                    RYAN (CONT'D)
          Damn.

EXT. HIGHWAY OVERPASS - MOMENTS LATER                           10
As traffic resumes and Ryan clears the overpass--


ID                                                                   iu





     SFX:   THE CELLPHONE RINGS.
     Ryan picks up the phone.

                           RYAN
                Sorry, got cut off.      Hey -- what's
                my Caller ID say?
     But there's no voice on the other end, only shuffling sounds.

                             RYAN (CONT'D)
                Yo Dex...?

                                                   MATCH CUT TO:

11   INT. KIDNAPPERS' ATTIC                                          11

     ECU - A TANGLE OF PHONE WIRES
12   Their insulation picked off and spliced together. PAN ALONG 12
     the attic floor, past the rubble of the shattered phone,
     foll9wing the crudely repaired wires to JESSICA'S HANDS,
     tapping the dialer wires together. She's trying so hard to
     simulate a NUMERIC PULSE that she almost doesn't hear:

                             RYAN (VO)
                Hello...?
     Jessica's hands go suddenly still, then -- WHOOM! -- her head
     slams down INTO FRAME on top of the crushed earpiece, a
     desperate hope filling her eyes.

                                                   CUT BACK TO:

13   INT. FORD BRONCO - CONTINUOUS                                   13
     With still no answer, Ryan pulls the phone from his ear --

                             RYAN
                Whatever.    Signing off-
     -- and is just about to hit END CALL when he hears a tiny
     female voice on the other end.

                            JESSICA (VO)
                Wait!    Don't hang up!
     Ryan puts the phone back to his ear.

                             RYAN
                Hello?

                           JESSICA (VO)
                There's not much time! I need you
                to go to the police. My name is
                Jessica Martin; I've been kidnapped!

                           RYAN
                     (not buying)
                Oh really? Kidnapped, huh?


13                                                                          j.j





                             JESSICA (VO)
                  Please. I know what you're
                  thinking, but it's real! I'm in an
                  attic somewhere. I think they're
                  going to kill me! You need to-

                             RYAN
                  Awfully polite kidnappers to give
                  you a phone...
     Jessica's voice TREMBLES uncontrollably.        Desperate, fearful
     and frustrated.

                              JESSICA (VO)
                  No!   You don't understand!
     Suddenly, the cellphone BLIPS twice in Ryan's ear.          He pulls
     it away and looks at its faceplate.

14   INSERT SHOT - THE CELLPHONE                                            14

                             RYAN
                  If you were really in trouble, you
                  would've called the cops, not me.
                  Now I've got a real call on the
                  other line--

     A WIDER SHOT so we see Jessica's bound hands. Her bruised
     face. Whispering frantically into the DEMOLISHED TELEPHONE
     she's JERI-RIGGING back together as she talks.

                             JESSICA (VO)
                  Goddamn it, listen to me! The
                  phone I'm on...it's shattered!
                  There's no dialer! I've been
                  clicking wires together for hours
                  trying to get someone, anyone, and

                  anyone else.

     SFX: Ryan's call waiting BLIPS again.        He considers
     everything Jessica has said, then:

                            RYAN
                  Hmm. Sucks to be you. Try crank
                  yanking someone else. Late.

     A TELEMARKETER checks Ryan's name on a list, then glances at
     the script.

                            TELEMARKETER
                 Hello, Mr. Ackerman. My name is
                 Mark and I'd like to discuss with
                 you the benefits of Mastercharge
                 Credit Union's-

                           RYAN (VO)
                 Awesome, I can totally use a credit
                 card. Tell me more.

                               TELEMARKETER
                 Absolutely.     We've lowered our APR-

                           RYAN
                 -Shucks, now's really not a good
                 time, but why don't I get your
                 number and get back to you later.

                            TELEMARKETER
                 Sure, it's 818...

                           RYAN
                 That's the office number?

                              TELEMARKETER
                 Yes.

                            RYAN
                 Why don't you give me your number
                 instead. That way I can call you
                 when you're having dinner with your
                 family.
     A beat.

                            TELEMARKETER
                 Sorry to have bothered you.
     Click!    The Telemarketer hangs up.

                            RYAN
                 Damn skippy.
     And that's when he notices the message flashing on the
     phone's faceplate: CALL ON HOLD. Ryan clicks the FLASH
     button to pick it up...and Jessica is still there.



INTERCUT CALL - RYAN IN CAR/JESSICA IN ATTIC                    19

                      JESSICA (VO)
           --an you hear me?!

                     RYAN
           You still there? You're getting
           kinda creepy, lady. See ya.

                       JESSICA
          No!    Don't! They're going to kill
          me!    They're going to kill me!!
A silent beat.   A calculated look in her eyes...
RYAN pulls the phone from his ear and is about to hang
up...when he hears the one sound that stops all men cold.
On the other end, Jessica begins to CRY.

                    RYAN
          Oh, it's like that, huh?     Nice with
          the fake tears, lady...

                      JESSICA
          Please...   I just need help.
But Ryan won't be manipulated.

                    RYAN
          You need acting lessons. Now go take
          your meds and bug someone else.

                    JESSICA
          These men!!!--
Jessica stops herself short, quieting the rising hysteria in
her voice before it gives her away. She glances anxiously at
the attic door, then continues, more in control.

                     JESSICA (CONT'D)
          These men killed my housekeeper.
          My dog. You have to help me.
Ryan bristles at being saddled with anything, much less this.

                    RYAN
          No, actually( I don't. Not with a
          hot chick waiting for me at the
          pier.

                      JESSICA
          Please...you're my only hope.
               (beat)
          What's your name?
That catches Ryan off-guard.   He stalls, not wanting to make
this personal.

                     RYAN
          Why, you writing a book--?


19                                                                  x?





                           JESSICA
                --Please, just tell me your name!
     Ryan glances around the street, his eyes falling on a stone
     fountain outside a French Restaurant.

                           RYAN
                Uh...Johnny. Johnny Fountain.

                           JESSICA
                Johnny... What if it was your
                mother who was calling for help?
                How would you feel?

                           RYAN
                Well, I'd be damn impressed,
                considering she's dead.

                           JESSICA
                Goddamn it, how difficult is it to
                hand this phone off to the police?!
                I'll pay you!

                           RYAN
               How much?

                          JESSICA
               Five thousand dollars.

                          RYAN
               Sure you will. I'm hanging up now.

                          JESSICA
               No, wait! WAIT!! Even if there's
               a eighty percent chance I'm lying,
               you nave a one in five chance to
               make five grand f9r a lousy twenty
               minutes of your life.
                    (panics as Ryan is silent)
               Haven't you ever bet on a horse or
               bought a Lottery ticket? I'm
               talking one-in-five odds, twenty
               minutes.
     Ryan slaps the radio off.

                          RYAN
               What do you want me to do?

                                                CUT TO:

20   INT. 15TH PRECINCT - STATION DESK - DAY                        20

     SOMEONE'S POV.
     In EXTREME SLOW-MOTION, chaos unfolds around us like a
     nightmare --
     OFFICERS manhandle a drunk toward the back, a HOOKER screams
     at us with unholy rage, in the far corner, a JUNKIE spits on



20                                                                     ^


     an OFFICER'S FACE and there's a lethal race for disinfectant
     through invisible soup.
     Sounds are distant, eerily muffled.      A HIGH-PITCHED WHINE
     lets us know we're in hell.
     CLOSE UP:    BOB MOONEY'S EYES.    Concerned, but not panicked.
     MOONEY'S POV. Still surreal, SLOW-MOTION, as an Officer with
     a CREWCUT responds by spinning the Junkie's face into a wall,
     legal but hard.
     SFX:   A HEARTBEAT.    OURS.    FAST... And possibly IRREGULAR?
     CLOSE UP - SLOW MOTION - The RIGHT THUMB presses into the

     LEFT WRIST.
     MOONEY'S EYES.      Watching.   Counting... Suddenly --
     WHAM!! Back to reality when a YOUNG GANGBANGER is slammed
     into the station desk by a ROOKIE.

                            ROOKIE OFFICER
                 Problem, Mooney. If I put this one
                 in with the others, there's gonna
                 be a bloodbath.

                            GANGBANGER
                 Put me in there! I'll waste all
                 them pussies!
     REVEAL SERGEANT BOB MOONEY -- a tough, fifty-something beat
     cop who's fighting growing old every step of the way. He
     rolls his eyes at the situation and takes a bite of PIZZA.

                            MOONEY
                 Come on Powell, put the Sharks with
                 the Sharks, the Jets with the Jets
                 and make room.
     Rookie Powell suppresses his irritation and roughly yanks the
     Gangbanger back over to the holding cells.
     Mooney puts down the pizza, no appetite, and stares at the
     news story playing on the TV mounted in the corner.

21   ON THE TELEVISION                                                 21
     a NEWS REPORTER is in the middle of a segment. Over him,
     FOOTAGE rolls of six guilty-looking cops testifying in court;
     being led away in handcuffs.

                            NEWS REPORTER
                 ...was somber when the indictments
                 came down this afternoon in the
                 23rd Precinct corruption scandal.
                 Though the names of six police
                 officers were read aloud, the
                 District Attorney stated that this
                 was merely the "tip of the iceberg"
                 and that unfortunately many other
                 arrests are likely to be coming as
                 the investigations proceed.



'2    BACK TO POLICE STATION                                      22
     As DETECTIVE JACK TOMLIN passes Mooney, he nods toward the TV.

                           DETECTIVE TOMLIN
                Sucks for the fellas at the Two-
                Three right now, huh?

                          MOONEY
                Dirty pricks deserve what they get.
                Public hates us enough without this
                shit.

                      DETECTIVE TOMLIN
                (leaving)
                There's good men over there.
     A FEMALE OFFICER passes Mooney and reaches for his box of
     pizza.

                          FEMALE OFFICER
               Mooney? What are you doing?      You can't
               be eating this crap.
     Mooney plants his own firm grip on the box.

                         MOONEY
               Keep walking, Shelly.   Nothing to
               see here.
     A friendly tug of war.

                          FEMALE OFFICER
               You sure you wanna do that?     What
               would your wife say?
     That's it. Mooney snatches his lunch back and turns to
     lecture this little girl.

                          MOONEY
               She'd say nothing, 'cause she's not
               gonna know about it! Christ, Shel,
               my old man had eleven heart
               attacks. Eleven! I have one
               little infarction and you guys
               start treating me like an invalid!
               I'm a grown man! Leave me alone,
               will you?!

                          FEMALE OFFICER
                    (abashed)
               I was merely referring to your
               cottage-cheese ass.
     Mooney sighs and lifts his pizza to his mouth when --
     WHAMM! The station doors burst open and two dozen GANG
     MEMBERS are bum-rushed into the room by a squad of COPS in
     riot gear. The screaming is deafening.



                                                               17.

                           MOONEY
                I hate this place.

                                               CUT TO:

23   EXT. 15TH PRECINCT - CONTINUOUS                                 23
     The Ford Bronco roars up; snags the handicapped spot. Ryan
     hops out and limps theatrically the first few steps until
     he's far enough away from the car to start running.

                          RYAN
                    (into phone)
               I'm here.

24   INT. 15TH PRECINCT - CONTINUOUS                                 24
     Cops try to wrangle the dozens of shouting GANG MEMBERS who
     cram the Station Desk, waiting to be booked.
     Ryan takes a deep breath and shoves his way through the
     mayhem to the extremely shorthanded Station Desk where:

     MOONEY
     is busy doing ten things at once. Signing release papers.
     Booking a DRUNK whose wife-beater Tee is drenched in blood,
     Etc.

                         RYAN
               Excuse me, officer --
     But Mooney ignores him in favor of the three cops that
     suddenly need arrest sheets signed.

                         RYAN (CONT'D)
               Hey, I've got an emergency here --
     Just then, CREWCUT OFFICER shoulders his way through with a
     cuffed CRACKHEAD TRANNIE in tow. The Trannie's wrists ache.

                          CRACKHEAD TRANNIE
               Loosen these, man, please?! Jus'
               gimme a chance--

                         CREWCUT OFFICER
               Hey, Moon! Where do you want me to

     Crewcut nods and moves off towards the bathroom.

                    (shoving forward)
               Come on, man! I've got some lady
               on the phone here who says she's
               been kidnapped!

     Ryan holds up the phone.         Mooney looks around.

                           MOONEY
                Nice try, kid, but I got no time
                for pranks.

                           RYAN
                Seriously, a lady was murdered!

                          MOONEY
                Which is it, a kidnapping or a
                murder?

                           RYAN
                Take the phone and find out moron!
     A COP snickers somewhere.

     Jessica holds her breath. She stares apprehensively at the
     attic door, praying for Mooney to just take the damn phone.

                             JESSICA
               Please. . .

     Ryan looks sincere.     Mooney deliberates, then sighs.

                           MOONEY
               Okay.   Give it here.
     Ryan thrusts the phone at him, happy to get rid of it.

                          JESSICA (VO)
                    (barely audible whisper)
               Oh thank God! You've got to help
               me. My name's Jessica Martin and
               I've been kidnapped. This morning
               five men broke into my home in
               Brentwood and kidnapped--
     Mooney strains to hear.     His eyes go wide and he quickly jots
     notes on a pad.
     Mooney's eyes shift as three TWEAKERS, wide eyed and sweating
     profusely, are led inside by their ARRESTING OFFICERS.

                             MOONEY
               Ah shit.
     Mooney holds out the phone.

                          MOONEY (CONT'D)
               Hurry kid, take this upstairs to
               Robbery/Homicide and ask for
               Detective Tomlin.



                                                              19.

     Ryan reluctantly takes the phone back as more people converge
     on the Station Desk.

     Jessica hears the phone being shuffled around.

                             RYAN (VO)
                Where?

28   BACK TO POLICE STATION                                          28
     Mooney, recognizing an emergency when he hears one, ignores
     the incoming CROWD him long enough to assist Ryan.

                          MOONEY
               Up the stairs, Tomlin!
     Ryan turns away, and as he returns the cellphone to his ear,
     he's startled to hear--

                     JESSICA (VO)
               (terrified)
               Oh my God...

     Jessica hears:

     SFX: FOOTSTEPS.     RIGHT OUTSIDE HER DOOR.

                          RYAN (VO)
               Lady, what's going on?!
     Jessica drops the phone. Has just enough time to shove it
     behind her before -- SLAM! -- the attic door swings open and
     two of the masked kidnappers stride in. When they reach her,
     they stand silently, trying to unnerve her.

                         LEAD KIDNAPPER
               Where's your husband?

                            JESSICA
               What?     I don't-
     The masked leader SLAPS HER SHARPLY across the face! Jessica
     wants to collapse to the ground, but remains sitting TO KEEP
     THE PHONE HIDDEN behind her.
     The Leader bends down and yells right in her face.



                                                                     20.

                 At work!     Why, what do you want--?
      SLAP!!!   This one's even nastier than the first.

                              LEAD KIDNAPPER

                 NEGATIVE!    WHERE WOULD HE RUN?!

      Phone to his ear. Wide-eyed. Hearing it all.         For the first
      time, starting to believe Jessica's story.

                              RYAN
                 Oh shit...
      Panicking, Ryan turns and walks, then jogs, then all-out runs
      for the station stairwell.

      The Lead Kidnapper stands ominously over the trembling
      Jessica -- Oh God! Does he see the phone cord?

                           JESSICA
                 Please, he should be at work!
                 That's all I know.
      The Leader nods, then turns away. Jessica exhales with
      relief that he didn't spot the phone. But her victory is
      short-lived as:

                              LEAD KIDNAPPER
                You have a little boy, right? Ricky?

      Jessica gasps like a sledgehammer just hit her in the chest.

                NO! NO--.'.' STAY AWAY FROM MY SON!

      locks. Jessica scrambles back to the phone.

                My son --
     Suddenly, as Ryan reaches the first landing -- STATIC starts
     breaking up the call.

                     JESSICA (CONT'D)
               (worried)
               Oh my God! What's happening?!

                         RYAN
               It's just static. I'm running
               upstairs to the detectives. Hold
               on, I might lose you for a sec--

                          JESSICA (VO)
                    (realizing)
               No, don't! Stop. You can't lose
               me--

                          RYAN
                    (still running)
               Wait, we're almost there.

                         JESSICA
                   (panics, losing her cool)
               Stop! Johnny, goddamn it, stop!

               STOP! IF YOU LOSE ME, I'M DEAD!!
     Hearing her fearful tone, Ryan stops reluctantly.

                         RYAN
               Well, what the hell am I supposed
               to do?!
     Ryan looks at himself, standing on the stairs like an idiot.

                           RYAN (CONT'D)
               Jesus!   I'm almost there!
     Ryan checks the SIGNAL STRENGTH INDICATOR on the phone.
     There's only one bar left. Defiantly, Ryan takes a step
     UP...and the bar DISAPPEARS. He quickly hops BACK DOWN.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)
               Crap!
                    (shouts up stairs)

               HELLO? DETECTIVE TOMLIN! WILL

               SOMEONE GET TOMLIN FOR ME, PLEASE?!
     There's no response.   Ryan can't believe this.

                         RYAN (CONT'D)
               You're shitting me.

     Jessica calms herself, resolving to save her child's life.

                          JESSICA
                Johnny, listen to me. My son's
                school lets out at 1:45.

                Good, then if I get a cop--
     Ryan exits the stairwell to find Mooney -- but Mooney's not
     there anymore! There's some NEW GUY -- and he's SWAMPED!

                         JESSICA
                No. There's not enough time. You
                have to pick him up before they--

                          RYAN
               Pick him up? Hell no, lady!     I
               ain't goin' nowhere else--
     Ryan tries to get the NEW GUY's attention, in a dream.

                          JESSICA
               Please please stop standing there!
               He 's just a little boy!

                          JESSICA
               Go!
     Ryan grunts in frustration.

     Forties, salt and pepper hair.    He looks to his crew:

     They're all trim. Athletic. In good shape. They're
     UNMASKED, watching the TV with interest. The news on the
     corruption scandal.
     Greer snaps the TV off.     Checks his watch and nods grimly.

                          GREEK
               Go get the kid.
     Instantly, a hulk of a man (DEASON) and an arrogant, red-

     sitting there, unnoticed by the men -- and on its face, the

     PUSH IN on the flashing orange light that threatens to give

     Ryan takes a hard right, tires squealing.    Pushing it against
     his better judgment.

     Ryan slaloms around other cars like a racecar driver.

                          RYAN
                So your husband's like, uber-rich?

                I make more money than he does.

                           RYAN
                Could they've mistaken you for

                No! I don't know.    None of this
                makes any sense.
     Jessica starts losing it completely, upsetting Ryan so much
     that he takes the next corner too fast and -- SKKRRASH! --

     Ryan cringes with every muscle!
     And the mirror ricochets off the ground -- and smashes
     through the windshield of a recently waxed Acura Legend!

                     RYAN (CONT'D)
               (smirking)
               ...Ain't that a bitch.
     As the heavily-muscled workers start running to beat the shit
     out of him, Ryan floors the gas, sending a shower of wet
     asphalt all over the cursing workers as he peels away,
     CRASHING through a FINAL BARRIER.
     More cautiously, Ryan rounds the next corner and --

                         RYAN (CONT'D)
               There's the school.
     Ryan's right.   Just ahead, we see:

38   EXT. THE WYMAN SCHOOL - DAY                                        38


        private prep school for boys. Ryan pull: A private prep
       it. Walks quickly toward the building.    school for
                                                 boys. Ryan
     pulls over and hops
     out,





                                                                  25.

38                                                                      38





                           RYAN
                Okay, I'm here.

                           JESSICA (VO)
                How much time do we have?
     Ryan checks his watch.     It reads:   "1:40 PM".   He enters.

                          RYAN
               Five minutes. What's your kid's name?

                            JESSICA (VO)
               Ricky.

                          RYAN
               Ricky what?

                            JESSICA
               Martin.

                          RYAN
               Ricky Martin? You named your kid
               Ricky Martin?! Why didn't you
               tattoo "kick me" on his ass while
               you were at it?

                         JESSICA
               He was named before the singer ever-

                            RYAN
               Forget it.     What does he look like?

                          JESSICA (VO)
               He's eight years old. Blonde hair.
               Green eyes. Small for his age.
               He's wearing a light blue shirt and
               dark blue pants--

                         RYAN
               They're all wearing blue shirts and
               pants!
     Ryan turns down a hallway and we see that he's right.      It's
     filled with IDENTICALLY-UNIFORMED LITTLE BOYS.
     As a TIMID BLONDE BOY passes in front of him, Ryan grabs him
     and wheels him around.

                         RYAN (CONT'D)
               Ricky Martin?
     The Boy's eyes get huge.     He tries to pull away.

                          TIMID BOY
               Don't touch me!

                          RYAN
               No, kid, it's okay!    I didn't mean
               to--



                                                                26.

38                                                                    38





                            TIMID BOY
                Help!   Don't touch me!   Don't touch!!
     Ryan quickly moves on... aware that other ADULTS are now
     beginning to take notice of him.

                          RYAN (INTO PHONE)
                Does he have anything else? A
                jacket? A backpack? What's his
                lunch box look like?

                           JESSICA (VO)
                I don't remember.

                           RYAN
                You don't remember your own kid's
                lunch box?!

                          JESSICA
               I don't pack it! Rosario, our
               housekeeper does! Sometimes Craig,
               but...
     Jessica begins to sob, which causes Ryan to panic further.

                          RYAN
               Ricky Martin, where are you!?
     None of the Stepford kids respond.

                     JESSICA (VO)
               (through tears)
               I wish I could give you more.
     Now Ryan's running.    He yells into a BATHROOM.

                         RYAN
               Ricky Martin?

                         MALE VOICE (OS)
               Can I help you, sir?
     Ryan turns to see a MUSCULAR GYM TEACHER looming there.
     Clearly, the guy thinks Ryan's peeping into the boys' room.

                          RYAN
               I'm looking for a little blond boy--
                    (off his shocked look)
               --No, no! Not like that!

                          GYM TEACHER
               Sir, come with me, please!
     Ryan isn't going anywhere. And that's when the BELL RINGS.
     Like a nightmare, HUNDREDS OF UNIFORMED LITTLE BOYS come
     racing out of their classes.

                            RYAN
               Oh shit...



                                                                27.

38                                                                    38


     As the boys stampede by, Ryan yanks the WHISTLE from around
     the Gym Teacher's thick neck and starts blowing it like
     crazy.

                           GYM TEACHER

               HEY--11

                           RYAN

               RICKY MARTIN! DOES ANYONE KNOW
               WHERE RICKY MARTIN IS?1 I can't
               believe I'm yelling this at an all-
               boys school.
     All hell is breaking loose. The kids ignore him. The huge
     Gym Teacher races after him. Jessica yells in his ear.

                          JESSICA (VO)
               Was that the bell? Was that the
               bell?!

                            RYAN
               Yes.    RICKY! RICKY MARTIN!!
     Ryan wades through the sea of uniforms.

                         JESSICA (VO)
               He'11 go to the parents' pick-up
               spot. Oh God, they're going to get
               him!

"\
     Ryan turns around and starts bulling through.    The Gym
     Teacher violently grabs his arm and yanks--

                          GYM TEACHER
               Where do you think you're going?
     --causing the phone to fly out of Ryan's hand and --crack!--
     hit the pavement.

                           RYAN
               No--!
     Ryan tugs his arm free and races to the phone.   The LCD
     display GLASS is cracked into a SPIDERWEB.

                     RYAN (CONT'D)
               (desperate into phone)
               Jessica? You still there?!

                           JESSICA (VO)
               Yes?
     Relieved, Ryan turns and races for the front of the school.

                          RYAN
               No one's gonna get your kid!    He's
               not slow, is he?

                           JESSICA (VO)
               What--?   No!



                                                                28.

38                                                                    38





                          RYAN
               Then he won't go anywhere with
               strangers.

                          JESSICA (VO)
               Unless they have our Escalade. Ricky'11
               think it's Rosario and hop right in!
     She's got a point. Ryan picks up the pace and arrives at the
     pick-up spot. Scans the lot.

                         RYAN
               What color?

                          JESSICA
               Black!

                     RYAN
               (looks)
               Of course it is.
     PAN AROUND to see what Ryan sees -- three black Cadillac
     Escalades.

                         RYAN (CONT'D)
               There's three of them.    What's your
               plate?

                          JESSICA (VO)
               4..7..wait, no...3 -- Oh my God, I
               don't remember!

                         RYAN
               Like you don't remember the lunch
               box? Or anything else about your
               kid--
                    (stops, realizing)
               Oh, man. This is a prank, isn't
               it?

                         JESSICA (VO)
               No!

                         RYAN
               Bullshit! Oh, you're good lady.
               Your friends too. Getting me to
               scream out 'Ricky Martin' at a boys
               school. Damn, you really nailed
               me.

                         JESSICA (VO)
               No--


               This is great, the police think I'm
               a whack job. The school thinks I'm
               some kind of perv child molester.
               I'll probably get the Herpes from
               the gym teacher's whistle --



                                                              29.

38                                                                   38





                            JESSICA (VO)
                No, Johnny, you have to listen to
                me-- /.'
     But Ryan's had enough.     He turns to leave --

                          RYAN
               I'm done being your entertainment for
               the day. I'm going back to the pier
               while I still have a chance --
     -- and passes right by a blonde-haired, green-eyed, EIGHT-
     YEAR-OLD BOY carrying a Lord of the Rings lunchbox. Ryan
     hesitates and is about to stop the kid...but then decides
     "screw it", and keeps on hoofing.
     Ryan rounds a corner to leave -- and is confronted by the Gym
     Teacher and a RENT-A-COP SECURITY GUARD.

                          GYM TEACHER
               Here he is! He's the one that's
               been stalking the students.

                            RYAN
               Stalking?!     No, I can explain--
     The Rent-a-Cop mumbles into his walkie.

                          RENT-A-COP #1
               Okay, we got him. We're at the
               front of the school.
                    (then, to Ryan)
               Sir, come with us.

                         RYAN
                   (as they grab him)
               Hey, HEY RENT-A-DUDE--!!    Hang on a
               sec! This is a huuuge
               misunderstanding--
     A little RENT-A-COP CAR (think geeky, wanna-be cop car) pulls
     up in the driveway below. The Security Guard starts forcibly
     leading Ryan toward it, but as he gets close--

                          JESSICA (VO)
                    (interrupting)
               Lord of the Rings! I forgot his
               father bought him a Lord of the
               Rings lunchbox last week!
     Ryan's heart stops in his chest. He turns to see the Boy
     with the Lord or the Rings lunchbox racing down the school
     steps and up to one of the waiting Escalades.

                         RYAN
                   (struggling)

               RICKY MARTIN!!
     The Boy opens the car door...but turns as he hears his name
     called. For the briefest moment, Ricky and Ryan lock eyes--





                                                        [CONTINUED)



                                                                    30.

    38                                                                    38


         --and that's when a HAND reaches out, snags his backpack and
         YANKS Ricky into the dark of the car! Instantly, the door
         slams shut and the Escalade begins to take off.
         WHIP PAN to Ryan's shocked reaction. He's the only one who's
         seen it. He tries to struggle free of the Guard.

                                 RYAN (CONT'D)
                    Oh shit!    You just see that?!
         Losing control of Ryan, the Rent-a-Cop calls to his partner
         in the car.

                               RENT-A-COP #1
                    Roy, some help over here!
         Below, the Escalade is leaving the driveway.

                              RYAN
                        (struggling harder)
                   Goddamn it, that little kid was
                   just kidnapped!! Do something!!

                                RENT-A-COP #1
                   Roy--! !
         The second Rent-a-Cop, hops out of his car and runs over, but
         as he gets near -- Ryan breaks free!

^

                                RENT-A-COPS

                   HEY--! !
         They chase after him, but Ryan hops over the hood of the
         idling RENT-A-COP CAR and throws himself into its driver's
         seat.
         Rent-a-Cop #1 reaches through the open window and grabs
         Ryan's collar -- and is dragged twenty feet as Ryan throws
         the little car in gear and burns away.

39       INT. RENT-A-COP CAR - RACING DOWN A RESIDENTIAL STREET           39
         Trying to catch the Escalade, a quarter-mile ahead. Ryan
         feels completely conspicuous in the security car as he
         slaloms through the streets of East Hollywood.

                              JESSICA (VO)
                   What's happening, Ryan?!

                              RYAN
                   Don't worry, I can fix this.

                                JESSICA (VO)
                   Oh my God.
         There are three cars between Ryan and the Escalade.

                             RYAN
                   It's okay, I can see them ahead.



                                                                    31.

                             JESSICA (VO)
                  Don't lose them! If you follow them
                  back here, you can tell the police
                  where they're holding us!

                  Okay.

     The mountainous Deason drives as Ellis sits shotgun. In the
     back sits Jessica's son, RICKY; who eyes the two men
     suspiciously. CCR plays on the RADIO.
      Ellis, turns down the radio.       Faking sincerity, he turns to
      face Ricky.

                             ELLIS
                       (gesturing to the radio)
                  Do you want me to change the
                  station to something else?
     Ricky refuses to answer.        Ellis turns around, his fake smile
     quickly vanishing.

                              ELLIS (CONT'D)
                  Yeah.   I like Creedence too.
     He's about to turn the radio volume up when --

                             RICKY
                  Where's Rosario?

                             ELLIS
                  I told you, kid, she had a doctor's
                  appointment, so your mother asked
                  us to pick you up. Don't worry,
                  you'll see your mommy in a few
                  minutes.
     Ricky nods... but we can tell by the look on his face that
     he's not buying their story one bit.

     Cautiously, so as not to give himself away, Ryan PASSES one
     commuter car. Then the next. Narrowing the gap between the
     rent-a-cop car and the Escalade to one last auto.
     It takes Ryan literally standing on the gas pedal to get up
     enough speed to get around the final car. Now the Escalade
     is dead ahead. Ryan begins gently closing the distance
     between them, and is just starting to relax, when--

     A CITY BUS
     merges into traffic from a Bus Stop right ahead of him!



                                                                  32.

                              RYAN

                 SHIT!
       Ryan SLAMS on his breaks and is forced to crawl along at a
 ainful 25 m.p.h.. Worse, he has his view of the Escalade
glocked by the bus' titanic silver ass.

                              JESSICA (VO)
                Johnny!

                             RYAN
                Damn!     There's this stupid bus--
      Ryan jags left and right, catching glimpses around the bus of
      the Escalade still ahead.

                      RYAN (CONT'D)
                (taps his horn)
                Come on!
      But the bus doesn't pull over. Ryan tries flashing the
      security car's CLEAR BUBBLE LIGHTS on the roof, but who the
      hell would pull over for that? The bus sure doesn't.

                             RYAN (CONT'D)
                Jesus.'

                           JESSICA (VO)
                Can't you go around it?
      There's an ungodly amount of opposing traffic--
      But suddenly there's    a break in the  flow! Seizing the
      moment, Ryan SLAM-SH   IFTS the rent-a -cop car's uni-cylinder
      engine into gear and    starts to tear  around the bus -- but has
      to SWERVE BACK as a    SPEEDING TRASH  TRUCK rounds a bend and
      almost creams him!

                           RYAN
                Goddamn it!

                             JESSICA (VO)
                What?!    Did you lose him? !

                           RYAN
                No, I just almost got killed, is
                all.

                           JESSICA
                Oh thank God!

                           RYAN
                Thank God?
                     (irritated)
                That's nice.
     Just then, the bus signals that it's pulling over.

                           RYAN (CONT'D)
                Hey, here we go!



                                                                 33.

     As the bus pulls aside, Ryan floors the wanna-be cop car
     around it...but directly in front of him is a HOMELESS MAN,
     dressed like a sheik, dragging his caravan of TWO COVERED

     SHOPPING CARTS.

                             RYAN (CONT'D)

                SON- OF- A-- II
     Ryan SLAMS on    the brakes, SWERVES HARD to avoid a collision --
     and loses cont   rol of the car! The rent-a-cop car goes POWER
     SLIDING across    oncoming traffic, HORNS BLARING AT HIM and
     heads straight    for a the FLOOR TO CEILING WINDOW of a CAR

     DEALERSHIP.

42   INT. CAR DEALERSHIP                                               42
     SMASH!!! The car goes through the window and RACES down the
     center aisle. CAR SALESMEN and PATRONS are forced to dive
     out of the way as the rent-a-cop car MOWS DOWN DISPLAYS and
     everything else in its path.

                                                 CUT TO:

     Jessica's son, RICKY, who eyes the two men suspiciously.
     CREEDENCE CLEARWATER REVIVAL plays on the RADIO.

                          ELLIS
                    (to Deason)
               Anyone following us?
     Deason checks:

     THE REARVIEW MIRROR
     We see the bus about five car lengths behind, but the rent-a-
     cop car is nowhere to be seen.
     Deason flashes an evil grin.

                            DEASON
               Nan.

     The rent-a-cop car exits the dealership, SMASHING through
     another GLASS WINDOW!
     Ryan quickly regains control of the car and steers it back on
     the street. Only to find that the Escalade has disappeared!

                          JESSICA (VO)
               What's happening?! Are you okay?!

                No, No!    just give me a second--
     As Jessica goes off, Ryan tosses the phone down and focuses
     on finding the Escalade. He floors the rent-a-cop car, engine
     CLATTERING, to the intersection.
     Ryan franticly searches in every direction, but the Escalade
     is nowhere to be seen. He floors it.

                            RYAN (CONT'D)
                Jesus!    Where the hell did they go?
     Dreading talking to Jessica, Ryan slowly picks up the
     receiver.

                         RYAN (CONT'D)
               Jessica, I--

                          JESSICA (VO)
               You let them get away.
     Ryan wants to snap at her, but guilt crushes it right out of
     him. He knows she's right.

     Mooney changes out of his blues, his ears glued to THREE COPS
     in the corner, boasting about an arrest.

                         COP ONE
               -- so of course everyone's playing
               dumb to what kind of drugs he's on.
     The cops start to snicker; they've all heard that one before.

                          COP ONE (CONT'D)
               So I start searching the place.
               I'm about to open a closet door
               when a kid with a Mac 10 jumps out
               of the bathroom. He shoots.
               Misses me and hits one of the
               E.M.T's. Fires again, but the gun
               jams and BAM! Blows half his face
               off. Had enough black tar heroin
               in the closet to resurface the 405.
     Mooney tries to join in on the conversation.

                         MOONEY
               It must've been around '84, when...
     The Cops turn around, while grabbing their stuff.

     Mooney waves them on, but looks disappointed for not being
     able to join in.

               I'll bet in your day you had some
               stories.
     Mooney whips his head around to see DETECTIVE JACK TOMLIN.

                          MOONEY
               Hey Tomlin.

                         DETECTIVE TOMLIN
               Taking off?

                           MOONEY
                    (hardly thrilled)
               My anniversary. You know, duty
               calls; pricey dinner and then some
               crap-ass play.
                    (beat)
               Hey, I sent some college kid down
               to see you this morning. Had some
               rap about a kidnapping --

                         DETECTIVE TOMLIN
               I haven't seen anyone, but I'll ask
               around. Kidnapping, huh?

                          MOONEY
               I thought it was a prank at first,
               but the kid was so worked up--

                          DETECTIVE TOMLIN
               Well, don't you get worked up.
                    (slaps Mooney's chest)
               If the kid comes back, page me, and
               I'll be sure to see him.

                          MOONEY
                    (swallowing his pride)
               Yeah. Okay, Jack. Thanks.

                              RYAN
                 What now?
     Ryan pulls the phone away from his ear and checks it out.

     INSERT SHOT - CELLPHONE FACE PLATE
     The BATTERY INDICATOR is flashing:         LOW BATT.   LOW BATT.

     SFX:   BEEP-BEEP!    The battery indicator has lost another bar.
     Ryan fumbles around in the armrest. Finds nothing. Opens
     the glovebox and -- a snub-nosed .38 SPECIAL tumbles out.

                Well what the hell do you expect me
                to do?!
     Just then, Ryan rounds a corner -- and sees traffic GRIDLOCKED
     to a halt ahead. He tries to maneuver around it, but is
     almost immediately boxed in.

     The phone starts a STEADY BEEPING now, dying imminent. And
     traffic isn't going anywhere. Ryan looks around desperately.
     Nothing. No emergency lane. No shoulder. Just a long drop
     down a HILL to a strip mall below--
     STRIP MALL?! Ryan scans it and does a double-take on one of
     the store's signs: "VERIZON WIRELESS".
     Traffic inches forward. Now he sees an OFF-RAMP a quarter-
     mile ahead -- but at this rate, it'll take forever to make it

     HITS THE GAS!   Despite other drivers' protests, the little
     Rent-a-Cop vehicle blasts across the gridlock, TEARS through

     Ryan lets out a frightened yell as he SAILS through the clear

     THUMP! The Rent-a-Cop car touches down on a steep downslope.
     Ryan struggles to control the bucking automobile,
     miraculously avoiding the minefield of ROCKS and TREE STUMPS.
     He needs both hands for the job and holds the phone by its
     antenna in his teeth.
     There's so much noise, the only thing Jessica could possibly
     hear is a CACOPHONY OF NOISE and Ryan HYPERVENTILATING.

     Ryan is bounced around like a corn kernel in a popper until
     the car hits a jutting rock and -- WHOOOOM! -- goes up on two

                                                               38.

     it back down -- SLAMM! -- so hard that the phone goes flying
     across the car!

                             RYAN (CONT'D)
                Shit!
     Ryan scrabbles for the phone -- but gives it up when he
     bounces over a rise and sees A BILLBOARD DEAD AHEAD!

                             RYAN (CONT'D)

                WHOAAAAAA!
     Ryan whips the wheel and navigates the little car between the
     billboard's concrete posts, but -- WHAM! -- obliterates the
     rent-a-cop's BUBBLE LIGHTS on the billboard's lower edge.
     Somehow, Ryan muscles the bucking econocar safely down the
     rest of the hill and into the strip mall parking lot, where
     it SKIDS OUT.

                      RYAN (CONT'D)
                (grabbing phone)
                Jessica?! Can you hear me?!

                             JESSICA (VO)
                I'm here!
     Ryan hops out and races inside--

48   THE VERIZON WIRELESS STORE - CONTINUOUS                         48
     And of course, they're having a sale and the place is packed.
     Every SALESPERSON is beyond busy in the feeding frenzy.

     SFX:   BEEP-BEEP-BEEP!!
     Panicking, Ryan pushes his way to the front of the counter --

                           IRATE CUSTOMERS
                Hey, what do you think you're
                doing? There's a line!
     -- to the OVERLY-PERKY SALESMAN helping someone else.

     The salesman makes a playful paw swipe with his hand.

                           EASILY-EXCITABLE CUSTOMER
                Oh, how fun!

                  will be with you shortly.
       Ryan glances at the dispenser. A BIG YELLOW SMILEY FACE with
       tickets ejected from the mouth. The next ticket it offers is
       "#97"...and the Now-Serving Display on the wall reads "#71".

       SFX:   BEEP-BEEP-BEEP!I
       Just then, a BUSY SALESWOMAN walks by.     Ryan grabs her.

                               RYAN
                  Hey! Hey!      I've got an emergency

                  I've got a life and death call on
                  this phone and my battery's dying!
                  Do you have a charger?

                       (walks away)
                  Take a number and one of the sales

       Ryan breaks out in a cold sweat. Can't catch his breath. As
       a SALESWOMAN rushes by, Ryan reaches for her.

       The room starts spinning around him. It's clear no one's
       going to help him. Like the clap of doom, the NOW-SERVING
       DISPLAY on the wall flips happily to "#72"

       SFX:   BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP!!!


       Frantic, Ryan glances at the phone. And just as the last
       BATTERY BAR on the power indicator FLICKERS and DISAPPEARS --

                  Aw, screw this...

     Mooney exits the mayhem of the s   tation and walks to a SQUAD
     CAR. Gets in. As he pulls his      seatbelt on, something
     CRINKLES in his breast pocket.     He pulls it out -- the SCRAP
     OF PAPER where the scribbled the    words "JESSICA MARTIN" and
     "BRENTWOOD" when Ryan handed him    the phone.
     Mooney crumples the paper and is about to throw it away...but
     stops himself. He stares at the words, then unable to let it
     go, punches keys on the MOBILE DATA TERMINAL. A name and
     address appear on the screen:

     JESSICA KATE MARTIN.   327 ELMWOOD ESTATES, BRENTWOOD.


     Mooney stares at the name. Then, after a moment, he sighs
     and pulls a LA LAKERS cellphone from his coat. Dials.

                         MOONEY
               Hi, honey. Yeah, I'm gonna be a

     begins CHARGING.

               Thank you for doing all this,

     Jessica JUMPS with a start. Tries to push the PHONE GUTS
     behind a beam with her foot as Greer enters -- but fails.
     The receiver sits in front of the beam, EXPOSED!
     Greer crosses the room and sits on a box next to Jessica.    He
     stares at her for long, uncomfortable moments. Then:

                           JESSICA
               N-no...
     Jessica scoots away, trying to draw Greer's eyes in another
     direction from the phone that lies OUT IN THE OPEN.

     Greer winds up and BAM! Hits Jessica in the stomach, knocking
     the wind out of her and causing her to fall to the ground.

               Wait! The bleachers behind left

      Greer stares at Jessica for a long uncomfortable moment,
      searching her soul. She's lying.

     Then he stands, looking away for just a moment -- but long
     enough for Jessica to NUDGE the phone back behind the beam!

     Relieved at hiding the phone, Jessica gets up and moves to
     the attic window -- and GASPS.

55   JESSICA'S POV - THE YARD BELOW                                    55
     Down in the yard below, Jessica's eleven-year-old son Ricky
     stands uncomfortably in the middle of a basketball half-court
     as one of the kidnappers (a severe-looking ex-con named
     HODGES) stands nearby, watching.

     turns and tosses a basketball to Ricky.

                  Shoot hoops.

     Nervously, Ricky begins to bounce the ball.

     Jessica sees her son start shooting the ball -- completely
     oblivious to Hodges, who flicks open his coat, revealing
     SILENCED PISTOL tucked into his waistband.

      the phone behind the beam. It's subtle at first, but grows
      increasingly louder. She closes her eyes, praying Greer
      won't hear it--
      But Greer does hear it. On the verge of leaving the room,
      Greer stops. Cocks an ear. Instantly, Jessica tries to

                An Officer Mooney from your
                division. Know him?
     Now, we start PULLING BACK, revealing the man's features.

                          DEEP MALE VOICE
                Mooney? He's a desk sergeant.      What
                would you want with him?



                                                              51.

                          ATTRACTIVE WOMAN (VO)
               I had to do a B & E and he came
               snooping around the house looking
               for the owner.

                          DEEP MALE VOICE
               And what did you say?

                         ATTRACTIVE WOMAN (VO)
               That I was her, of course.
     Continue PULLING BACK.   We can almost recognize him now...

                         DEEP MALE VOICE
               Did he believe you?

                         ATTRACTIVE   WOMAN   (VO)
               I think so. He said he thought
               someone was pulling a prank on him.

                          DEEP MALE VOICE
               Mooney doing an investigation?
               What's are you really up to?
     The man swivels around in his chair and we see clearly it's--

                          DETECTIVE TOMLIN
               And no bullshit. Right now you're
               entire department's hot, so if I'm
               gonna get in the tub, I've got to
               know how deep it is.

               Jessica, this car has a sewing

SI   INTERCUT PHONE CALL - RYAN IN RENT-A-COP CAR/JESSICA IN ATTICS 1
     Jessica's voice trails off as she catches a glimp se of
     herself in an OLD MIRROR standing in the corner.  Bruised.
     Clothes torn. Staring at her own cracked reflect  ion, she
     breaks down, but silently this time, locked in he r own
     personal hell.
     For Ryan, the silence is deafening. Despite his frantic
     driving, he feels her pain. And hates being unable to help.

                          RYAN
               Jessica... ?
     There's an emotional beat, then--

                          JESSICA
               Do you think God will forgive me?

                          RYAN
               What do you mean--?

                          JESSICA
               For what I've done...   For giving
               up Craig...
     Ryan is moved by the emotion in her voice.

                          RYAN
               Jessica, they have your kid. You
               had no choice.

                          JESSICA
               I don't know. I don't know...

                         RYAN
               1 know. I heard what they were
               doing to you over there. You held
               out for as long as you could.

                          JESSICA
                    (grim beat)
               My son and I are going to die here,
               Ryan. They already have us. But
               maybe I could've saved Craig...
     The truth of this has a profound effect on Ryan. And just
     when Jessica is about to lose herself to despair --
     Ryan finds a resolve within himself even he didn't know he
     had.

                          RYAN
               Jessica, listen to me. I promise
               you, I'm not going to let that
               happen. I could care less about
               your money. I'm risking my life
               cause I know I'm gonna get you and
               your family out of this. You hear
               what I'm sayin'?

     There is a moment between them, two people connecting on a
     human level...
     But the moment is suddenly cut short as a STATICKY VOICE
     start bleeding into their phone call -- some BRITISH ASSHOLE
     having his own phone call.

                           BRITISH ASSHOLE (VO)
                -- Yeah, the show just bought me a
                Cadillac XLR convertible. No, you
                can't ride in it. Not until you do
                something with that road kill you
                call hair. And what's with your

                     (interrupting)
                Jessica? Are you still there?

                             BRITISH ASSHOLE (VO)
                Hey, hey?!    This is a private call!
     Jessica's voice starts fading as the CROSSTALK gets worse.

                     JESSICA (VO)
               (washed in static)
               I'm..ere, but y...reaking up!

               --That's not my problem, lady.
     Lady?! Suddenly, STATIC starts drowning out Ryan's side of
     the call.

                          RYAN
                    (yelling over the static)
               Jessica, don't hang up! You hear
               me?! Whatever happens --

                          BRITISH ASSHOLE (VO)
               Look woman, tell your kidnapping
               story to someone who gives a shit.
     Ryan can't hear Jessica's side of the conversation; only the
     British Asshole's, which comes in loud and clear.

                             RYAN
               Jessica?!     Jessica?!
     As Ryan goes mental, a CAR PASSES HIM on the opp9site side of
     the road -- a new Cadillac XLR convertible! Inside is an
     appropriately asshole-ish looking guy. He could only be the
     British Asshole.

                 Gotcha.
     Ryan pulls a HARROWING 180 DEGREE TURN, barely missing an
     oncoming car by inches.
     He RACES up to the Cadillac, which has a VANITY PLATE that
     reads, "IDOL MKR." Ryan looks through the window at --

     The driver, who in a typical LA celebrity sighting, turns out
     to be none other than SIMON COWELL, host of American Idol.
     Simon continues his spittle-spraying rant -- at no one.      It
     appears he's using the car's SPEAKERPHONE.

                that invented it you stupid COW!
     Ryan sees Simon Cowell MOUTH THE WORDS "STUPID COW" in synch
     with the conversation. BINGO!
     Ryan floors the Rent-a-cop car ahead of the Cadillac and
     PULLS A 90 DEGREE turn at an intersection; cutting Cowell
     off!
     SCREEEECH! Cowell, trying to avoid a collision, SLAMS on the
     brakes, causing the Cadillac to SKID twenty feet.
     Ryan jumps out of the rent-a-cop car he's left in the middle
     or the intersection and runs over to the Cadillac, banging on
     the window with the .38 Special.
     Cowell practically jumps out of his skin at the sight of the
     gun and the kid with the crazy look in his eyes.

                           SIMON COWELL (CONT'D)

     EXPLODES into tiny pieces of junk as the semi PLOUGHS THROUGH
     IT! Flaming debris rains down around Ryan, and he covers his
     mouth, unable to believe his shitty luck.

                           RYAN
                Ain't that a bitch!
     Ryan turns back to Simon Cowell.

                Out of the car! Now!
     Cowell all but dives out.

               Where's your phone?!

                           SIMON COWELL
                It's on speaker!
     Ryan turns to the car.    Calls out.

               Jessica?

                            JESSICA (VO)
               Ryan?!    I'm here!
     Her voice says she can't believe her ears.
     Relieved, Ryan jumps in the Cadillac XLR and tosses his phone
     on the passenger seat, next to a LAPTOP computer. Guns the
     engine and STOMPS the gas.
     As he passes the ruins of his rent-a-cop car, he slows just
     enough to open the Cadillac's door and snatch up his bag of
     Verizon goodies laying on the pavement -- then peels away.
     Practically frothing at the mouth, Simon Cowell chases after
     on foot, cursing as his beautiful new Cadillac disappears in
     the distance --

                           SIMON COWELL

         SCREEEECH! Ryan steps on the brakes, seeing something ahead.
         WHIP PAN AROUND to see what Ryan's staring at. Just ahead,
         JESSICA'S ESCALADE is pulling up to the curb.

         Ryan pulls along side the red curb and watches as four tough-
         looking men exit the vehicle. We recognize them as Greer,
         Deason, Ellis and Hodges.

         Ryan searches the car and finds the HANDSET in the armrest.
         As he grabs it and races after Greer into the airport, a
         Traffic Cop comes up to the car.

                              TRAFFIC COP

         Greer and his men stride through the airport like sharks
         honing in on bleeding prey.
         Soon, the Kidnappers break up into two groups: Greer and

     Greer, who waits in the LINE OF PASSENGERS waiting to pass
     through airport's METAL DETECTORS. This is Ryan's chance.
     He cuts through the line.

                         RYAN
               Oops. Excuse me. Pardon me. My
               grandmother needs her walker...
     Soon, he makes his way to the front, right behind Greer and
     BUMPS into him. As he does, NOTICE --
     ECU of Ryan slyly slipping the rent-a-cop's tiny .38 Special
     into Greer's heavy motorcycle jacket.
     Greer turns, glaring -- But no one's there.
     Greer looks around, and there's a heart-stopping moment that
     we're afraid he's going to notice Ryan, who now stands
     innocently the next line over--
     --but Greer's eyes pass right over him as he scans the crowd.
     Ryan breathes a sigh of relief as Greer finally turns away to
     walk through the metal detector and...

               Excuse me, sir. Would you mind
               emptying your pockets over here?
     Confused, Greer does. He lays his wallet on the table, then
     his keys... Then looks baffled as he pulls out -- the GUN 1

                   (reaching for something)
               Wait, this is a mistake--

                             TENSE GUARD

               HANDS/     HANDS!!
     As one, the entire security force POUNCES on Greer and Ellis,
     TACKLING them to the ground and IMMOBILIZING their limbs.



                                                                58.

     And while that chaos is going on, Ryan slowly backs through
     to the metal detector...and starts running for Left Field.

                                                MATCH CUT TO:

90   INT. LAX AIRPORT - METAL DETECTORS - CONTINUOUS                  90
     GREER AND ELLIS are crushed under the dogpile of security.
     Behind them, a door slams open and a formation of NATIONAL
     GUARDSMEN race on-scene, showing just how seriously security
     is taken in the wake of Sept. 11th.

                                                CUT TO:

     Ryan jogs down the concourse when--

                          PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM
               Attention travelers. Due to a
               security problem, all persons are
               required to clear the terminal and
               return immediately to the security
               checkpoint at the entrance to
               Concourse B...
     At once, everyone begins filing out of the terminal. Ryan
     looks like a salmon swimming upstream, the only figure moving
     against the tide of people rushing to get out.

                          JESSICA (VO)
               "Left Field" is in Terminal C.

                         RYAN
               Listen to me! They're clearing the
               terminal. Before your husband passes
               me, what does he look like?

                         JESSICA (VO)
               He's thirty-eight. Six feet.     Trim
               build. Thinning hair...

                    (scanning the passengers)
               That's not enough! What's he
               wearing?

                          JESSICA (VO)
               I don't know! We have completely

               -- A suit... He wears glasses,
               thick rims, like Buddy Holly or--
     Bingo! The Buddy Holly glasses is what did it. Ryan sees a
     man in the distance hurrying in his direction -- CRAIG.

                            RYAN
               Found him!



                                                                      59.

        And just as Ryan bee-lines it towards Craig--

                  VOICE (OS)
        Excuse me, sir--
        Ryan turns and finds a NATIONAL GUARDSMAN right behind him.

                              NATIONAL GUARDSMAN
                   You can't be here now. You have to
                   leave the area.

                               RYAN
                  But --

                               NATIONAL GUARDSMAN
                  Now, sir.
        And as Ryan is marched away he sees--

        Knees in their necks.    Hands covering their faces.

         A YOUNG GUARDSMAN does -- and in a big reveal, we see that he
         WITHDRAWS A BADGE. A Los Angeles policeman's badge...
       Ryan's jaw drops.      He can't believe it -- they're cops?!

                             YOUNG GUARDSMAN
                  Hey, this one's on the job.

                            RYAN

                  Run it.
                  (the Guardsman runs off;
                  turns back to Greer)
                  Is that your gun?

     Just then, the Young Guardsman returns.

                          YOUNG GUARDSMAN
                He's clean. Badge matches his I.D.

                Unhook 'em. Stand down security.

     Ryan looks relieved when the airport's alarms SHUT OFF._ The
     P.A. system cheerily thanks everyone for their cooperation
     and, all around, security gates begin to rise.

                          RYAN
                    (noticing; to Guard)
               Hey, can I go now? Can I go?!
     The Guard nods, and Ryan takes off like a shot, racing back
     towards the bar.
     Ryan spots Craig Martin outside the Left Field sports bar.
     Ryan grabs him by the elbow and starts hustling him through
     the concourse.

                         CRAIG
               Hey, what the hell?!    Get your

               Shut up and keep walking. If they
               see us they'll kill us both.

                          CRAIG
               What--?

                          RYAN
               Your wife sent me.

                          CRAIG
               She did?   But how--?

                          RYAN
               Would you hurry your ass?! You
               need to hide. They're here, and
               they're looking for you. They
               already have your family.
     Craig looks at him, growing terrified.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)
               In here!

     Ryan pulls Craig into the MENS RESTROOM.

     An awkward, emotional pause falls between them.

                          RYAN
               Forget about the cash. Just get you
               and y9ur son home safely and we'll

     RYAN hands the cellphone over to Craig.

               Okay.
     Ryan walks out the restroom door as Craig puts the phone to

     In utter disbelief, Ryan turns back toward the gate -- and
     sees Greer, Ellis, Hodges and Deason, cornering another MAN.
     Tall. Lean. Thinning hair.

                 Craig?
      Craig stops dead, hearing the voice. Scans the cobweb-filled
      room, seeing nothing -- then from the depths of the shadows,
      Jessica materializes looking haunted and lifeless as a ghost.

                               CRAIG
                Jessica?
      Jessica races for the safety of Craig's arms, but just as
      she's about to be embraced, Greer steps forward and YANKS
      Jessica back by her hair. She squeals in pain.

                              CRAIG (CONT'D)

                HEY --/ /
      Craig moves to object, but -- OOF! -- Deason sends him
      gasping to the floor with a sledgehammer fist to the gut.

                           JESSICA
                No, don't hurt him!
      Jessica struggles and, with an annoyed shove, Greer sends her
      spilling into Craig. She hugs tightly against him.
      When Craig gets his wind back, he comes to his knees and
      manages to croak out--

                              CRAIG
                Ricky...?
      Jessica nods gravely. He's here, too. Craig looks at his
      wife's face, bruised and hurt, and tears rise in his eyes.

                Oh, God, Jess... What have they
                done to you?

                they've made a mistake--
      But something in his eyes disagrees.

      Greer traces the barrel of the gun down Jessica's cheek.
      Craig looks utterly helpless.

      Craig squeezes the good years of their marriage into a
      strong, loving embrace. Jessica hugs him closer. Leans into
      his ear to seemingly whisper her love in return -- but what
      she actually whispers takes Craig by surprise.

      MESSENGER bullshitting with a HOT DOG VENDOR. Ryan stops and
      stares at the PACKAGE POUCH on the seat and a flashy red BIKE
      HELMET hanging on the handlebars.
      The helmet is futuristic, like something The Flash might
      wear. Ryan eyes the Messenger, grabs the bike, hops on and
      peddles for dear life toward Craig's building with the
      Messenger hot on his heels.

      Marilyn smiles, realizing he's really talking to himself.
      Mooney hangs up, thoughts racing. He reaches behind him, and
      without looking he grabs his wallet and keys.
      He then walks over to Marilyn and kisses the top of her head.

                                                   CUT TO:

115   INT. FEGAN SECURITIES, INC. - THIRD FLOOR - DAY                115
      Dripping with sweat, Ryan shambles out of the stairwell, the
      bike helmet now strapped to his head and the pouch over his
      shoulder -- just as the ELEVATOR ARRIVES behind him!
      As Greer, Hodges and Craig get out, Ryan turns and searches
      for the mailroom that's supposed to be here! Where the hell
      is-- Ah I He finds it and hustles into --

116   INT. MAILROOM - CONTINUOUS                                     116
      A wide COUNTER separates Ryan and a few BUSINESS MEN and
      WOMEN from the MAIL CLERKS that busily work the other side.
      Ryan leans against the wall, pretending to be an ordinary
      bike messenger waiting for a package as Craig and the dirty
      cops enter, brushing right past him.
      Craig scans the faces of the other patrons as they enter,
      desperately trying to figure out who is his secret ally. He
      ignores Ryan completely, whose face is mostly hidden by the
      tinted plastic VISOR attached to the helmet.
      Craig notices an AGING SECURITY GUARD stationed in the area,
      but knows better than to make any waves.

                      MAILROOM SUPERVISOR
                (recognizing Craig)
                Anything I can help you with Mr.
                Martin?

                           CRAIG
                Hey, Benny. This might sound
                ridiculous, but I dropped a DVD
                mailer into the chute this morning
                and I forgot to put down an
                address.

                           MAILROOM SUPERVISOR
                Happens all the time. Let me see
                what's back there. Gimme a sec'.
      The Supervisor disappears into the back room.
      Greer and Hodges take a seat only a few feet away from Ryan.
      The moment is uncomfortable...and gets infinitely worse as--



                                                               73.

116                                                                  116



                          MAIL CLERK ,
                Excuse me, sir? Sir? Sir?
      Ryan turns, realizing with horror that another MAIL CLERK is
      speaking to him.

                           RYAN
                Me?

                          MAIL CLERK
                You waiting for a package?
      Now everyone's looking at Ryan.     Including Greer.

                           RYAN
                     (facing away)
                Sure, uh... I'm supposed to pick
                something up for Mr. Fountain over
                at the Bonaventure.

                           MAIL CLERK
                From what department?

                           RYAN
                I'm not sure... They said it was a
                contract, though, I know that, so
                what would that be, Legal?

                          MAIL CLERK
                What's the tracking number?

                           RYAN
                     (patting himself down)
                Uh... Right. Tracking number.
      It's looking grim.   Thankfully, the Supervisor reappears.

                           MAILROOM SUPERVISOR
                Mr. Martin? I found a number of
                things that could be what you're
                looking for. Mind coming back to
                take a look?
      Hodges shoots Craig a look, "go".

                           CRAIG
                Sure.
      The Supervisor leads Hodges and Craig away to the back room.
      Unfortunately, Greer stays behind.

                           RYAN
                     (patting himself)
                I might... Maybe it's on the
                clipboard on my bike?
      Ryan watches Greer out of the corner of his eye as Hodges and
      Craig disappear inside the vault.



                                                                 74.

116                                                                    116





                           RYAN (CONT'D)
                 I, uh, may need to call somebody.

                                                  CUT TO:

117   INT. MAILROOM - BACK ROOM                                        117
      There's an entire shelf that serves as a dead letter office.
      One plastic bin is filled with reusable interoffice
      envelopes, another bin is overflowing with small mailers,
      computer disks, unlabeled video tapes, Etc...

                           MAILROOM SUPERVISOR
                Help yourself.
      HODGES cautiously watches Craig shuffle through the mailers,
      opening two or three before finding -- he turns one upside
      down -- and a DVD case slides out!
      A quick glance at the label, "ADT Digital Surveillance'.
      5/19/05 06:00 - 07:00" confirms it's the disc.

                           CRAIG
                This is it.
      Hodges seems uncomfortable with the Supervisor hovering over
      his shoulder.

                            HODGES
                Let's go.

                                                  BACK TO:

118   INT. MAILROOM - CONTINUOUS                                       118
      Ryan now sits by the window, cellphone pressed to his ear.
      Feigning frustration.

                          RYAN
                You believe this? Everyone's got
                their head up their ass over there.
      The Mail Clerk ignores him almost as much as Greer wants to.
      Greer opens his cellphone to make a call, but when the signal
      is no good, he wanders outside the mailroom toward the window
      at the end of the hall.

                          MAIL CLERK
                    (impatiently)
                Sir? You think you could just go
                outside and get your clipboard?
      Just then, Hodges and Craig come marching out of the vault.

                            MAIL CLERK (CONT'D)
                Sir?
      Ryan glances at Greer, momentarily distracted on the phone.
      At Hodges, almost out of the bank. As he and Craig near the
      door --



                                                                  75.

118                                                                     118




      A moment where Craig finally locks eyes with Ryan -- and
      suddenly realizes: This is the guy!
      It's now or never.   Ryan has to do something.

                           MAIL CLERK (CONT'D)
                 Sir!?

                            RYAN
                      (to Clerk)
                 Screw the package.
      Ryan stands and, unable to find anything better, snatches a
      metal HAND TRUCK sitting by the door, and as Hodges walks by--

                           MAIL CLERK

                 WHAT ARE YOU DOING--?!
      -- swings it full-force into Hodges' face -- WHAMM!!   Hodges
      drops like a slaughterhouse cow.
      Instantly, employees hit the ground; scream; run for their
      lives. Craig dives for the DVD case. The Security Guard has
      come to life; drawing down on them.

                           SECURITY GUARD

                FREEZE!
      Craig does.   But Ryan grabs him and moves, racing out of the
      bank.

                           RYAN

                COME ON, LET'S GO!

119   INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE MAILROOM - CONTINUOUS                      119
      At the end of the hall, GREER sees Craig and Ryan running out
      of the mailroom. Drops his phone, draws his gun --

                           SECURITY GUARD (OS)

                FREEZE!!
      -- just as the Guard comes running out. His gun was fixed on
      Ryan, but now that he sees Greer with a piece, he trains his
      gun on him instead.

                          SECURITY GUARD (CONT'D)

                DROP YOUR WEAPON!
      Ryan and Craig are struck in the middle of the crossfire.

                           GREER
                     (flashing his badge)

                L.A.P.D.! I'M A COP!

                           SECURITY GUARD

                DROP IT NOW!!
      The instant Ryan and Craig try to escape into a nearby
      stairwell -- Greer turns his gun on the SECURITY GUARD --

      BANG! BANG!



                                                                     76.

119                                                                        119


      -The Security Guard drops and Greer aims his weapon at Craig
      again!
      BANG! -- Greer fires.
      Craig, SHOT IN THE BACK, slams against Ryan with the impact.
      They fall half-in/half-out of the stairwell. Craig weakly
      shoves the DVD into Ryan's hands.

                             CRAIG
                 ..run...
      But Ryan is overwhelmed.       His legs feel like a thousand
      pounds of jelly.

                           CRAIG (CONT'D)
                 ..ruuuUUUUNNNNNN!!
      As Craig slumps to the ground, Ryan stares in shock -- but
      when Greer starts sending a hail of bullets toward them, he
      DIVES into:

120   INT. STAIRWELL - DAY                                                 120
      He starts flying down the stairs...but when he sees four
      BUILDING SECURITY GUARDS racing up from below--

                             RYAN
                Damn!
      --he turns around and starts RUNNING UP instead.

121   INT. MAILROOM - DAY                                                  121
      Hodges gets to his feet. Stumbles out, holding his gushing,
      broken nose. Yells at Greer, who's racing into the stairwell.

                             HODGES
                The kid!!

                             GREER
                No shit.

122   INT. STAIRWELL - DAY                                                 122
      With the Guards and Greer only a floor behind, Ryan thinks
      fast and CHUCKS HIS BIKE HELMET down the corridor, ELBOWS the
      In-Case-Of-Emergency Glass, setting off the FIRE ALARM -- and
      starts running UP.
      Seconds later, when they reach that level, one of the Guards
      sees Ryan's helmet and the broken glass leading away.

                             GUARD
                     (racing down the hall)
                This way!
      The other Guards follow...but Greer isn't convinced.       On a
      hunch, he turns and continues running UP also.
      Peeking over the edge from the floor above--



                                                                  77 .

122                                                                      122



      RYAN
      Sees Greer and Hodges coming.     Big-ass guns out and ready.
      Shit.'
      THE ALARM BELLS SCREAM.     PEOPLE start filling the stairwell
      on every floor.
      Forcing his body to its very limits, Ryan bolts up the stairs
      until he sees the ROOF EXIT on the next floor up. He shoves
      open the nearest door and continues running up to the roof.
      He slips out and silently closes the door behind him just as--

123   INT. STAIRWELL - DAY                                               123
      GREER and HODGES reach the floor beneath. See the door
      swinging shut -- but neither fall for the bait. They runs up
      toward the-

124   EXT. ROOF - DAY                                                    124
      Ryan's eyes SCAN the rooftop. Construction is in progress up
      here; tarpapering. Huge ROLLS OF TARPAPER lie about,
      PALATTES holding supplies covered with TARPS, an industrial

      AIR CONDITIONER...
      Ryan quickly shoves a 2"x4" under the doorknob to jam it.
      Heart pounding, he races to the building's edge and looks
      down. Nothing but a straight drop 60 feet down.
      Footsteps are approaching! POUNDING on the door! Ryan darts
      behind a tarp-covered mass of supplies just as --

125   EXT. ROOF - DAY                                                    125
      GREER shakes the 2"x4" loose.     He and Hodges explode out onto
      the roof, looking for Ryan.
      Greer encircles the huge air-conditioner while Hodges hunts
      behind a large SATELLITE DISH. No Ryan.

                           GREER
                     (to Hodges)
                Here.
      Cop-instincts crackling, Greer stands on one side of the tarp-
      covered stockpile and waits for Hodges to secure the other.
      This is it; they signal go at each other and spring around --
      But Ryan's nowhere to be found!

                             GREER (CONT'D)
                Dammit!
      No, wait! Greer turns and sees a LARGE ALUMINUM CHUTE that
      leads from the roof and elbows down toward a DUMPSTER on
      ground level.



                                                                      78.

125                                                                         125




      Greer peers down the chute for long seconds...but nothing can
      be seen from this angle. It all falls to blackness.

      THE ALARM STOPS.
      Greer cocks his head in the sudden eerie silence. The only
      sounds are INCOHERENT SCREAMS coming from the stairwell. He
      eyes where the chute empties into the dumpster, thinks...

      REVEAL --

126   INT. METAL CHUTE - CONTINUOUS                                         126
      RYAN, wedging himself against the sides of the chute, tries
      to be as still as possible. Every slight movement makes the

      ALUMINUM BUCKLE AND GROAN.
      From his shirt pocket, Jessica's tiny desperate voice pleads.

                             JESSICA (VO)
                  Ryan... ? Ryan, please answer me I
      But Ryan just sits there.    Afraid to move.     Terrified to
      discuss Craig.

127   EXT. ROOF - CONTINUOUS                                                127
      Greer picks up a large roll of tarpaper and starts lugging it
      toward the open mouth of the chute...

.28   INT. METAL CHUTE - CONTINUOUS                                         128
      Ryan holds his breath.    Trembling.   His leg threatening to
      rabbit-foot again.
      Straining to hear Greer, it's impossible not to hear:

                             JESSICA
                  You have to talk to me! Ryan,
                  please you have to talk to me--.'
      The sweat from his hands causes the tiniest SLIP -- and as he
      catches himself, there is a soft metallic BOOOONG from the
      stressed metal.
      Unable to ignore her pleas any longer, Ryan carefully pulls
      the cellphone from his pocket and presses it to his ear.
      Desperate to console her, Ryan --
      BANG!! The TARPAPER ROLL flies down the chute. Ryan looks
      up to see it angrily launching itself right at him!
      He has to let go of the walls to avoid being hit.      He presses
      himself to one side but --
      WHAM!! The bloodthirsty roll bashes his wrist -- and he DROPS

      SIMON COWELL'S CELLPHONE!



                                                                       79.

128                                                                          128




      Ryan reaches out, but the phone goes sliding down the chute!

                                                     CUT TO:

129   INT. ATTIC                                                             129
      Jessica hears a loud SCRAAAAPE, CRASH and a wash of STATIC.

                               JESSICA
                   Ryan?!    OH MY GOD, RYAN?!   RYAN--?!

130   INT. KIDNAPPERS' SAFEHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME                   130
      The hulking Deason hears Jessica's PANICKED VOICE and stands
      with a start. As he moves toward the attic, he notices a
      small RED LIGHT FLASHING behind the bar. As he passes, he
      checks it out and--

                              DEASON

                   WHAT THE--?!
      WHIP PAN DOWN to what Deason sees: The red light is on one
      of the house phones. The LINE-IN-USE INDICATOR.
      And it's lit.
      Shaking like a bear pissing pineapples, Deason rages away
      toward the attic...

      Jessica is curling herself into a tiny sobbing ball on the
      floor when -- WHAMM! -- the attic door crashes open. Jessica
      jumps. Deason looms there. Sees the phone.

                              DEASON

                   YOU STUPID BITCH!
      Jessica hurls the phone receiver away.

                             DEASON (CONT'D)

                   WHO HAVE YOU TOLD?! WHO HAVE YOU

                   TOLD?!

                              JESSICA

                   NO, DON 'T H URT M E--
      Deason roars up and grabs Jessica's neck with one hand.
      HURLS her across the attic and into the OLD MIRROR,
      shattering it in a million pieces around her.
      Desperate for anything, Jessica PALMS a TINY SHARD as she
      struggles to her feet. A two-inch chip.

                             DEASON

                   YOU AND YOUR KID ARE DEAD!
      She lowers her arm, defeated, out of breath...        You win.



                                                                         80.

                                    JESSICA
                        Don't hurt me, and I'll do
                        anything... Anything.. .
             There is a promise in what Jessica offers that Deason
             responds to. His fist FLASHES toward her throat, making her
             flinch. But rather than hitting her, he wraps his meaty
             fingers around her throat, almost daring her to stop him.
             Jessica trembles, but that is all, and just as Deason begins
             to enjoy his work, Jessica JABS at his face, but he predicted
             as much and easily moves to deflect it -- SNICKK! -- she
             flicks her wrist up and SLICES the underside of his upper
             arm.
             Deason flinches a little bit, like a bee sting, then laughs
             as he notices the tiny SHARD in her hand--

                              DEASON
                        (sarcastic)
                        Oooh.
             --but that's when he HEARS it. A DRIPPING SOUND. Deason
             looks down at his arm and is confused to see his entire shirt
             sleeve SOAKED IN BLOOD. It literally pours from his arm onto
             the floor like a river.
             Deason drains white; dizzy.      He looks at Jessica, confused.

                                   JESSICA
                        Brachial artery. Pumps up to 30
                        liters of blood per minute...and
                        there's only five liters in the
                        human body.
             Three seconds later, Deason crumbles...and Jessica leaves the
             attic.

             RYAN'S still trapped. Sounds of approaching SIRENS in the
             distance. Ryan listens for Greer; is he still there?
             BANG!!   BANG!!   Two more heavy TARPAPER ROLLS come right at
             him!
             The first one he gets lucky with, but the second NAILS HIM
             before bouncing furiously away and Ryan loses his grip
             completely and slides out of control.

 133         EXT. ROOF - DAY                                                   133
             GREER watches amazed when Ryan actually tumbles out of the
             ass-end of the metal chute into the dumpster. He drops the
             next roll of tarpaper ready to go and reaches for his gun --

-434    EXT. INSIDE DJUMPSTER - CONTINUOUS                               134
       RYAN is in serious pain.    He frantically fishes through the
       refuse to find:

       SIMON COWELL'S CELLPHONE
       Or rather, what's left of it:      A million shattered pieces
       scattered everywhere.
       Ryan sifts through the plastic debris as if he had secretly
       hoped he could still use it. Yeah, right... He's barely able
       to sit up when --

       BLAM!! BLAM!! BLAM!!
       He ducks back down as bullets ricochet off the steel
       dumpster.
       As SIRENS get louder, closer, Ryan's got to make his move --
       he jumps out of the dumpster, landing on his ass on the
       opposite side of Greer.

       BLAMM-BLAMM-BLAMM!!


       Bullets ricochet off the steel dumpster and Ryan summons his
       courage -- and takes off limping!

135    EXT. ROOF - CONTINUOUS                                            135
       BLAMM-BLAMM-BLAMM!! Greer's pistol is ill equipped for long-
       range shooting. The kid's too far away by now. He grabs his
       walkie --

                            GREER
                      (into walkie)
                 The kid's outside, headed toward
                 the front of the building--

                            HODGES
                 -Gotta go, boss. The Guard's dead.
       Hodges waits by the rooftop door, looking concerned
       as COPS spill out around him onto the roof.



                            COPS
                 Who the hell's shooting up here?
       Greer points to Ryan bolting around the corner.

                           GREER
                 Sonofabitch shot the poor bastard
                 right in front of us!

       Jessica races across the dead brown lawn toward the guest
       house/prison that holds her son. Getting her first good look



                                                                  82.

      at the secluded premises she's on confirms that screaming
      would do no good. She's on her own.
      When she reaches the guest house, she's shocked to find a
      HUGE LOCK on the front door. Frantic, she makes her way
      around the structure to a BIG BAY WINDOW. Though it's
      protected by SECURITY BARS, she can see Ricky through the
      glass.
      Jessica pounds on the glass, and Ricky turns.    When her son
      sees her, he races to the bars.

                              RICKY
                   Mom!

                               JESSICA
                   Baby!   Are you okay?!

                              RICKY
                   I can't get out!
      Jessica looks around for something to bend the bars with.
      There's nothing.

137   EXT. THE MARTIN HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON                            137
      A gold FORD TAURUS pulls up in front. The driver door opens
      and Mooney gets out. Walks to the front door and KNOCKS.
      But this time, there's no answer.
      Mooney rings the bell. Still nothing. Suspicious, he checks
      around the side...and sees the back door SWAYING in the wind.

138   INT. MARTIN HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY                                 138


      Mooney's cop senses scream as he walks inside. A POLICE
      SCANNER chatters in the background. The place is a shambles.
      Someone's been looking for something. He then sees-
      BLOOD STREAKS the floor. It leads from over by the telephone
      to underneath the pantry door.

                             MOONEY
                       (calling into house)
                   Hello? L.A.P.D. Anybody home?
      No answer.    Drawing his gun, Mooney stalks carefully into--

139   INT. MARTIN HOUSE - THE ENTRYWAY - DAY                            139


      A SMALL STAIRCASE leads up to the second floor. As Mooney
      starts up the steps, BOOM UP to the top to REVEAL:

      THE IMPOSTER JESSICA MARTIN (BAYBACK)
      Hiding in ambush at the top of the stairs, gun in hand. She
      listens to Mooney's footsteps and when she thinks he's neared
      the top -- she springs out, blasting away down the staircase!
      But Mooney's not there.



                                                                  83.

                            MOONEY
                 Drop your gun, now.   I got you.
      Now we see him. Still down in the entryway, behind some
      cover, gun aimed and steady.

                            MOONEY (CONT'D)
                 I said drop it.'
      Bayback relaxes -- then WHIRLS around, disappearing down the
      hall! Mooney curses and quietly jogs up the stairs,
      following her into--

140   INT. SHADOWY CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS                                140
      A narrow hallway with multiple OPEN DOORWAYS on each side.
      The Imposter Jessica could be hiding in any one of them...
      Taking care not to give himself away, Mooney inches down the
      hallway. And just when he's thinking that he may have
      successfully created an element of surprise for himself--
      SFX: SQUEEEEAK -- the floorboards of the old house groan
      softly -- GIVING HIS POSITION AWAY!
      Instantly Bayback swings out from a doorway right next to
      Mooney, taps her gun to his chest pulls the tang--
      But Mooney DIVES OUT OF THE WAY! BLAMM-BLAMM-BLAMM!!   Two
      miss, but the third shot NAILS HIS SHOULDER!
      OOF! Mooney lands hard. Blood spreading out under his white
      dress shirt. He cocks his head... listening for the sound of-
      BAYBACK EJECTS A MAGAZINE and is about to reload--
      Mooney JUMPS UP, RETURNS FIRE -- slamming Bayback against the
      wall with two .38 caliber slugs. She collapses to the floor.

                            MOONEY
                Damn it!   DAMN IT!!
      Angry, the adrenaline drowning out the pain, Mooney turns to
      the kidnapper laying in the hall, bleeding out. Kicks her
      gun away and kneels.
      But for the first time, Bayback isn't tough.   Just scared.

                          BAYBACK
                ..a-ambulance...

                          MOONEY
                Tell me where Jessica Martin is or
                you bleed to death right here.

                          BAYBACK
                ..p-please..call.. I.. I'm a--
      Fuck this, Mooney kicks her ribs.



                                                                   84.

                            MOONEY

                  WHERE IS SHE?!
       Bayback struggles for air, reaching for him--

                            BAYBACK
                  ...I'm a cop...
       Bayback squeezes her eyes shut against a wave of pain -- and
       DIES. Mooney stares at her. What did she say? Starts
       patting her down.
       And that's when he finds her BADGE.     L.A.P.D.   23rd Precinct.
       She is a cop.

                              MOONEY
                 Oh shit...
       Mooney grits his teeth against a fresh wave of pain and picks
       up the phone, dials 911.

       Ryan wanders the streets. Checks his wallet -- a measly four

       TOW TRUCK speeds by -- An old Hyundai mounts it like a hippo!
       A lightbulb clicks on for Ryan.

       Jessica SMASHES A REAR WINDOW with a long thick branch and
       uses it to try to pry the bars apart. The limited leverage

       Jessica leans her head around the back corner of the

143    EXT. KIDNAPPERS' SAFEHOUSE / INT. ESCALADE                     143
       Pulls into the driveway.
        Greer and his team are going over surveillance photos taken
        from the cameras at the Fegan Securities Building. The
  hotos are useless, though, as Ryan's face is obscured by his
E helmet and visor.

                 These are the best pictures you
                 could get of him?!

                 He was wearing a visor.
       Greer glares at him -- no shit -- and throws the pictures .

                 Useless!
       The car parks and Greer storms out, followed by Ellis and
       Hodges. They head for the house, and the moment they enter --
       Jessica reappears. But now she's STARING at something.
       The Escalade.

                      (to son; through window)
                 Baby, listen to me. I want you to
                 get away from this window. I want
                 you to go to the other side of the
                 room as far away from the door as
                 you can --

                 No, don't leave me!     Don't leave

       The terror in his voice breaks Jessica's heart.

                 I'm only gonna be gone a second,
                 and then we're gonna go home, but
                 you have to do this first. It's
                 gonna be loud, but don't be scared,
                 okay? Now go find somewhere safe

      PARAMEDICS apply a bandage to Mooney's shoulder.      Mooney's
      pretty shaken up.

                           PARAMEDIC #1
                You're lucky. Shot went clean
                through. A few inches either
                way...
      Mooney watches other PARAMEDICS carry sheet-covered corpses
      into awaiting ambulances. Flashbulbs POP from inside.
      A sedan pulls up and Mooney's relieved to see Tomlin get out.

                           DETECTIVE TOMLIN
                What the hell, Moon? It's all over
                the radio.

                           MOONEY
                Jack, she didn't identify herself.

                          DETECTIVE TOMLIN
                What are you saying?

                           MOONEY
                I shot a cop!
                     (lowering his voice)
                Dana Bayback. From the 23rd.     She
                was one of the kidnappers.
      Tomlin looks stunned by the revelation.

                           DETECTIVE TOMLIN
                Let me call the tw9~three. See
                what the hell's going on.
      Tomlin pulls out a cellphone.

                          MOONEY
                I hate to think more cops are
                involved, but--

                           DETECTIVE TOMLIN
                Did she say anything about the
                Martin woman?

                          MOONEY
                ...Never got the chance.

145   EXT. POLICE. IMPOUND YARD - LATE AFTERNOON - ESTABLISHING         145
      A GONZOLEZ TOW TRUCK drives up (like the one we saw at the
      airport), and stops temporarily beside:
      Simon Cowell, from the CADILLAC XLR incident, who stands at
      the window, screaming at the JADED CASHIER.
      His car idles just on the other side of an IMPOSING FENCE.

                               SIMON COWELL
                    Just give me my goddamned car!

                               JADED CASHIER
                    Don't take that tone of voice with
                    me, sir. I've already told you, we
                    do not release vehicles until all
                    impound fees are paid.
      In the E.G., NOTICE Ryan skulking closer, behind the GONZALEZ

      AUTO TOW TRUCK.

                          SIMON COWELL
                But I didn't cause it to get
                impounded! Can't you understand
                that?! It was stolen from me!

                           JADED CASHIER
                Sir, do you want the car back or
                not?
      Noticing Cowell standing at the window, Ryan presses further
      into the shadows, not wanting to be noticed.

                              SIMON COWELL
                Yes!     But I'm not paying for it!
      The Cashier signals a GRUNGY YARD WORKER on the other side of
      the fence.

                           JADED CASHIER
                Nevermind, Howie. Take 'er back.
      Howie nods, and just as he's about to drive the Cadillac back
      into the yard --

                           SIMON COWELL
                Wait, wait! All right you bloody
                fascist, I'll pay. But if there's
                even the slightest scratch on it...
      Howie smiles, thought so, gets out and splits. As Cowell
      angrily starts making out a check, the Cashier flicks the
      switch to open the gate, and as it opens--
      Ryan slips in. He sneaks behind the wheel of the idling
      Cadillac. And the moment Cowell hands over his check --
      VRRRROOOM!!    Ryan burns rubber out of there.



                                                                  88.

                            SIMON COWELL (CONT'D)
                 Hey, that's my car!
       Cowell chases it -- and watches in horror as Ryan takes a
       speed bump too fast and TEARS THE REAR BUMPER OFF THE

       CADILLAC XLR CONVERTIBLE IN AN EXPLOSION OF SPARKS!

                            SIMON COWELL (CONT'D)
                 NOooooooo...!!

146   EXT. SURFACE STREETS - LATE AFTERNOON                             146
      As he zooms away, Ryan searches the passenger seat with his
      free hand. He hunts through the car and finds -- HIS BLUE

      TOOTH VIDEO CELL PHONE!

                              RYAN
                 Thank you!
      As he flips it open, his eyes spot THE LAPTOP on the floor of
      the passenger seat.
Ryan thinks, pulls out his SECURITY DVD and pops it in.
At first, the SCREEN is a mere wash of digital gobbledygook--
And as Ryan grunts with frustration --
--a Hi-Res QUICKTIME MOVIE suddenly fills the screen:

47    ANGLE ON LAPTOP MONITOR - FOUR WAY SPLIT SCREEN                   147
      The Fagen Securities Building parking lot. A police pursuit
      in progress. Three Police Cars skillfully box in a BMW with
      TWO HISPANIC YOUTHS, forcing it to come to a dead stop.
      GREER and HODGES explode from their cars, guns drawn.
      BAYBACK and ELLIS come from the back. DEASON appears, and he
      and HODGES yank the teens out of the car, who struggle
      frantically to avoid vicious baton blows. When one decks
      Hodges and tries to run, ELLIS SHOOTS HIM in the back!

      WE QUICKLY PAN TO ANOTHER ANGLE:
      Inside the building, CRAIG gets up from his chair, hurries
      into-

      WE PAN DOWN TO ANOTHER ANGLE
      As Craig enters frame inside the Security Office.   And
      watches live-

      ANOTHER ANGLE:
      GREER wastes no time in SHOOTING the second man execution
      style!



                                                                   89.





-148    IN THE CADILLAC XLR CONVERTIBLE                                  148
       RYAN watches in horror. He PULLS OVER, too riveted to drive
       and watch simultaneously. Finally understanding the
       magnitude of this disc.

149    ANOTHER ANGLE:                                                    149
       And as BAYBACK drags a DEAD HISPANIC YOUTH out of the frame,
       legs disappear off-screen in short bursts.

       PAN DIAGONALLY TO ANOTHER ANGLE:
       And more terrifying, GREER stops picking up shell casings,
       turning his head ominously toward the CAMERA! Noticing us!
       Greer motions to several others; DEASON and BAYBACK, who rush
       OUT OF FRAME toward the front entrance.
       ANGLE ONE: At the SIDE DOOR, ELLIS and HODGES start kicking
       in the door with full force.
       ANGLE TWO: GREER, outside, unholstering his GUN at the

       DELIVERY ENTRANCE.

      As Greer reaches the first landing, the HOUSE PHONE starts
      RINGING. Ignoring it, Greer continues on and is about to turn
      the corner to the attic when --

                Boss, you better take this.
      Greer stops, a footstep away from seeing the open attic door.
      From the bottom of the steps, Hodges tosses him a CORDLESS
      PHONE. Greer puts it to his ear.

                            GREER
                 Early twenties? Stumbled out of

                 Tomlin. Take care of him.      No
                 witnesses.
       That's more than Tomlin bargained for.

                            TOMLIN
                 Are you sure that's necessary, sir?

                 there's nothing I can do to save

                 Sure. That's what I thought.        I'll
                 tell him.

        Greer sees Hodges gaping up the stairwell. Following his

        Further in, he can make out Deason's bloody body and the
        rigged-together phone...
        In fact, the only thing Greer doesn't see is Jessica.

                                                                   93.

-^               -..           JESSICA
                  Ricky!    Come on!
       -- but he's frozen in fear at all the noise and dust.    He
       shakes his head. No.

                             JESSICA (CONT'D)
                  Baby, please! It's okay now.
                  We're gonna go home!
                       (glances back nervously)
                  Ricky, please!
       Somehow, the kid digs deep and finds the courage to run to
       the Escalade, where his mother scoops him up into the cab
       just as--
       The kitchen door bursts open and Greer's team spills out into
       the yard. They spot her instantly.

                            ELLIS
                  Get out of the car!    Get out of the
                  goddamned car!!
       As they rush at her--

163    EXT. KIDNAPPERS' SAFEHOUSE/INT. ESCALADE - CONTINUOUS             163
       Jessica throws the big car in reverse and tries to back out --
       but the Escalade's stuck! Caught by the debris, the wheels
       just spin.

                              JESSICA
                 Come on!    COME ON!!
       Jessica rocks the car forward, and back. Forward, and back.
       And just as it finally comes loose -- KRRRAAASHHH!!
       The window next to Jessica's head EXPLODES in a shower of
       tempered glass, shocking us. Two arms snake in and wrap
       around Jessica's neck. Greer.
       But Jessica STOMPS ON THE GAS, hoping the big car will pull
       her free.
       It doesn't. As the Escalade surges away across the lawn,
       Greer's vice-like grip holds, PULLING JESSICA OUT the broken
       window and -- THUMP! -- to the guest house debris below.
       As Jessica watches in horror:

       THE DRIVERLESS ESCALADE
       Careens down the driveway and crashes into a pillar.    Hodges
       races over and yanks Ricky out.

       GREER
       Balls his fist in Jessica's hair and yanks her around hard.

                            GREER

                 WHO DID YOU TELL?!

                 LYING BITCH! ! WHO WAS THAT KID IN

      Jessica screams as he yanks her to her knees.

                             RICKY
                 Stop it!   Don't hurt her!!
      Seething mad, Greer rips his gun from its holster and is
      literally about to blow Jessica's brains out when--

      SFX:   THE CORDLESS PHONE IN GREER'S POCKET STARTS RINGING!
      The entire world stops. There's an awkward moment: Jessica
      cowering, Greer recovering, the phone just ringing and
      ringing... The telephone is the only sound in the world,
      getting louder and louder with each ring until--
      Greer answers it.

                            GREER
                 Bad timing, Tomlin.
      But it isn't Tomlin on the phone this time.       It's--

                shit, pal, it doesn't work that
                way.

                Go cut the kid's throat.
      Though Ryan's eyes widen in panic, his voice remains cool.

                             RYAN
                Fine.     Your loss.   Nice talking to
                you.
      And Ryan hangs up. He waits nervously, sweating, staring at
      the phone for the longest seconds of his life--

                              RYAN (CONT'D)
                Ring.     C'mon, damn it, ring!   RING!
      Then it does. Ryan waits a couple rings, slowing his
      speeding heart, then nonchalantly picks up.

                          GREER
                So, how do you want to do this?

                          RYAN
                Put on a big ass Ronald McDonald smile,
                apologize to the kid and the woman and
                bring 'em to the Santa Monica pier.

                              GREER (VO)
                No.     Somewhere quieter.

                Fine.    But you come alone.

                             RYAN
                Done.

                           GREER (VO)
                How will I recognize you?

                           RYAN

                What's your cell number?

                We caught a break with the kid. He's

                Everyone's on a cellphone! I've
                got like fifty possible targets

      Ellis' cross hairs flit from one person on a cell, to
      another, to another...

      TOMLIN AND MOONEY move along the crowd, scanning the sea of
      spectators for Ryan. Mooney moves more slowly behind Tomlin,
      skin looking pale, sheened in sweat and laboring for breath
      as they hike up the bridge.



                                                                        100.

                     something.

                               RYAN (VO)
                     No. Put them on the Ferris wheel.
                     I want to see them safe first.

                                GREER
                     That wasn't part of the deal.

          The top of the bluffs, overlooking the pier below.       Among the
          crowd, some SKATE RATS scare the ELDERLY.

                                  RYAN (VO)

                    I swore I wouldn't do that.

                               RYAN
                    Like you swore to protect and
                    serve?
          The reference brings Greer up short.       There's a moment, then:

                               GREER
                    You know a lot...

                              RYAN
                    And I'll forget a lot, too. But
                    not until they're both out of
                    danger.
          Now PAN AROUND TO REVEAL Ryan among the crowd, wearing a
          SURFING WINDBREAKER; HOODED with WATERPROOF POCKETS -- but
          where's his cellphone?
          Moving closer, we see Ryan's wearing the EARBUD MIKE from the
          Verizon store. With the earbud concealed under the loose
          hood, Ryan looks like anyone else just watching the show.

                               RYAN (CONT'D)
                    Your choice, man. The Martins or
                    the DVD. Either way, I'm not

                Not bad. Most people never get
                past two.
      Greer flinches as his own taunts are used against him.

                     (to Ellis)
                Keep an eye on them. As soon as we

                Oooh, I think I just pissed myself.
      Ryan looks optimistic when Hodges gets out and opens the back
      door. And just as he's on the brink of success--

                              FEMALE VOICE (OS)

                HEY--!

        A woman's HAND grabs the hood of Ryan's windbreaker and rips
        it away from his face. Wheels him around. It's:

                  There you are! Where the hell were

                  on the Prominade yourself--?
        But Ryan's got no time for this.

                  I've been..looking for..you, kid--
       But Ryan struggles, thinking Mooney is with the bad guys.
       Mooney grabs him as he tries to make a break for it.

      RYAN struggles with Mooney. The crowd completely ignores
      them in favor of the raucous concert.
      In the heat of battle, Ryan's cellphone clatters by Chloe' s
      feet.

      Trying to break Mooney's stronghold, Ryan SHOVES him
      backwards, SLAMMING his injured shoulder into the PIER

      RAILING.
      Mooney SCREAMS out in pain and grabs his shoulder, releasing--
      Ryan, who BREAKS AWAY and turns to see Mooney COLLAPSE to the
      ground, holding his blood-soaked shoulder. Ryan looks over
      to Chloe, whose face is a combination of shock and confusion.

                           CHLOE
                Oh my God--

                Someone call 911!
      A CROWD starts to gather when --
      Ryan feels the barrel of a gun nudging his back.     Tomlin's
      gun.

                           TOMLIN
                It's over kid.
      Fuck! Ryan's got no choice but to slowly walk toward the end
      of the pier.
      MOONEY - From his prone position, he catches a glimpse of
      Tomlin backing Ryan quietly into the crowd. Not trying to
      help. Not calling for an ambulance. In that instant, Mooney
      knows he's been betrayed. Tomlin's in on this.



                                                                 104.

                   you'd better have that goddamned
                   disc. Where is it?
      Just then, Greer appears through the crowd ahead of him.
      Like a nightmare, he closes in.
      Ryan slowly slips his phone into a waterproof pocket in his
      windbreaker and zips it up.

                   Aw shit...
      Ryan's world is spinning -- the NOISE, the CROWDS, the

      TENSION...
      He KICKS BACK hard into Tomlin's SHIN. It is enough for
      Tomlin to release his grip and Ryan bolts.
      Tomlin recovers and raises his GUN to get a bead on Ryan, but
      it causes the crowd around him to PANIC.

      Ryan navigates through the fleeing crowd and turns to see
      Greer and Tomlin quickly gaining ground.
      He has to make a choice, either go over the railing, or deal
      with Greer and Tomlin. Ryan decides on the ocean. He runs
      to a MAN FISHING WITH HIS SON and uses their ice chest as a
      step. Just as he JUMPS THE RAIL -- Tomlin gets off a SHOT!
      SLIIIIIICEE!!! The bullet tears through Ryan's shoulder as
      he spins headlong into the Pacific!
      TOMLIN AND GREER run to the railing and see Ryan HIT the

      Ryan is struggling. Bleeding. Sinking. Dying. His lungs
      convulse, trying to breathe, burning like a thousand red-hot
      needles are pushing their way through his chest.
      The WAVES POUND against the thick pylons below the pier. Just
      as Ryan comes up for air he's SLAMMED into a wooden pylon!
      Ryan fights for his life as the surge churns him underwater,
      BASHING him repeatedly against the pillars. It's not pretty.

       He unzips the waterproof pocket of his shorts, pulling out

       He looks for anything that'll save him, but finds only

                             MOONEY
                  Just keep that ambulance close by.
      And as he stumbles off--

194   INT. THE DORY ENTRANCE - NIGHT                                     194
      TOMLIN - By the time his eyes adjust to the dark, Ryan is
      nowhere to be seen. TARPS undulate over jumbles of boxes and
      equipment everywhere -- a hundred places to hide.
      Alone, Tomlin stalks among the equipment.     Gun out.   Hunting
      Ryan like a snake on the scent or prey.

                            TOMLIN
                 You're wounded kid, just give me
                 what I came for, and I'll let you
                 all go.
      Police sirens in the distance grow louder.
      Tomlin's offer goes unanswered.    That's when he notices the
      BLOOD on the ground. Tomlin smiles, following Ryan's trail
      to a PILE OF BLOOD-SMEARED TARPS -- where the trail ends!
      It's obvious Ryan used these to staunch his wound. Shit!
      He's gonna have to search this whole place--
      Then, suddenly, Tomlin gets an idea. He pulls out his phone,
      making sure it's concealed from view, and writes a TEXT
      MESSAGE to--
x95   EXT. SANTA MONICA PIER - NIGHT                                     195
      Greer pulls out his ringing cell phone. On the text screen
      it says, "CALL HIM". Greer flashes an wicked grin, and dials
      the last number on his call log.

                                                  CUT TO:

      Tomlin's ready to pounce.
      SFX:   Nearby, Ryan's cellphone starts to RING, betraying him!
      Instantly, Tomlin hones in on the noise -- coming from under
      a bulky tarp along the far wall -- and EMPTIES HIS GUN at it!
      The tarp shreds. Nothing could survive the assault.
      Tomlin walks calmly across the room to stand before the tarp.

                            TOMLIN
                 Shoulda stayed at home this
                 morning, kid.
      And just then, Tomlin throws off the shredded tarp exposing--
      Ryan's cellphone.   And nothing else.



                                                              107 .

                Funny. I was about to say the same
                to you.

                             TOMLIN
                What the--
      And in the instant Tomlin realizes he's been tricked, he
      turns and--

      WHAM!


      RYAN HITS TOMLIN in the face with a 2x4, SMASHING his TEETH
      and sending him backwards. Before Tomlin has time to
      rec9ver, Ryan swings again. CRACK! -- And his KNEE CAP is
      obliterated. Ryan, looking like a psychotic Babe Ruth, gives
      Tomlin two more vicious WHACKS before grabbing his cellphone
      and high-tailing it out of there.

                    hold his location. Hodges, parking

         Just as Hodges reaches for the door handle -- Jessica wraps
         her cuffs around his throat, throws her legs against the back
         of his seat and pulls like her life depended on it.
         Hodges chokes, flails, digs, and claws at the cuffs, but his
         fingertips are no match for Jessica's muscular legs.

      gun shot. He turns around only to find --
      A PISTOL pointed right at his face -- Greer's pistol.
      He PUSHES Ryan behind a SUV so as not to be seen by the cops.

                No more bullshit!     Just give me the

      Ryan slowly unzips his front jacket pocket and removes the

      DVD.
      Greer snatches it and SMASHES it to pieces. Fragments fall
      through the cracks in the pier, to the ocean below.
      Ryan, pale as ghost, knows he's seconds from meeting his
      maker.

      And just as he's about to pull the trigger --
      BLAM!! Jessica fires a WARNING SHOT. Greer( startled, spins
      around to see Jessica pointing Hodges' gun in his face.

                           JESSICA
                Tell me why I shouldn't kill you.
      For the first time, Greer actually looks frightened.
      Recognizing the homicidal look in her eyes, he SPUTTERS, but
      nothing comes out.
      Ryan, weak and pale with blood loss, looks up at his guardian
      angel.

              Jessica slowly lowers the gun and looks into Ryan's face.

              Ryan flips open his phone and on the SCREEN plays the
              SECURITY FOOTAGE of the murder in the parking lot. We see
              that Ryan must've copied the DVD with his videophone.
